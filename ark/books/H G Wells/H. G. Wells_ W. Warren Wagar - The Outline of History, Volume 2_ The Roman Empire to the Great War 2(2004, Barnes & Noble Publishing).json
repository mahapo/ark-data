Wells’ absorbing memoirs, Experiment in Autobiography (1934), herelated in some detail how he came to write The Outline of History. “My idea wasat first,” he wrote, “an outline of history beginning with an account of theRoman and Chinese empires at the Christian era, and coming up to contemporaryconditions.” Established historians would collaborate in writing this chronicleof the last nineteen centuries, under Wells’ supervision.He soon gave up on the “established historians” and wrote the whole bookhimself, albeit with plentiful advice and commentary from professionalcolleagues. He also abandoned his plan to begin with the advent of Christianity.As readers of the first volume of The Outline of History know, he chose insteadto launch his narrative with the creation of the solar system. In more than twodozen chapters he told us of everything from the emergence of life on earth tothe history of Rome.But Wells did not abandon his plan to come up “to contemporary conditions.” Inthe second volume of The Outline of History, he carried the story down to what,in 1920, was the latest news: the “Great War” of 1914-1918 and the creation ofthe League of Nations. He also took the opportunity to peer into the future.Anyone familiar with what passed for world history in 1920 cannot help but beimpressed by the scope of Wells’ account in this second volume. The first fourchapters traced the rise of Christianity and Islam, with an intervening chapteron the tangled history of Asia, both western and eastern, from just before theChristian era to AD 650. Although Wells personally adhered to no religion, hetreated the founders of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism with respect, showinghow their teachings harmonized in many ways with one another, and even—in hisjudgment—with the spiritual and ethical implications of modern science. He alsoanticipated the finding of more recent world historians, such as Andre GunderFrank, that China was the world’s richest and most advanced nation from theseventh century AD to at least the seventeenth. Chapter IV, after reviewing thehistory of early medieval Europe, charted the collision between Islam andChristianity during the Crusades.The most remarkable portion of this second volume of The Outline of History isthe way it surveys life in Asia and Europe between the thirteenth and sixteenthcenturies. To most of Wells’ Western readers, this was simply the era of thelater “Middle Ages” and the “Renaissance” and ”Reformation.” All eyes focused onthe metamorphosis of Western Europe from feudalism to powerful monarchies andthe first blushes of a distinctively “modern” sensibility.But Wells began his exploration of this era with another theme altogether: theemergence of the Mongols as the world’s greatest power in the thirteenthcentury, their conquests throughout Eurasia, and the exploits of theirself-styled descendants, such as Timurlane and Baber, the founder of the MughalEmpire in northern India. He also took appropriate note of the rise of theOttoman Turks as the preeminent power in the Middle East, North Africa, and theBalkans, capped by their seizure of Constantinople in 1453. Just by puttingthese vast events in the so-called medieval era first, ahead of his report ofdevelopments in Western Europe, Wells made a salient point. Western Europe didnot yet occupy center stage in global history. The chief movers and shakers ofthe world during all this time were, as often before, the teeming tribes andnations of Asia, many of them Muslim.In his next chapter, however, Wells caught up with the European story, sketchingthe “renascence of Western civilization” largely as a history of ideas, and inparticular the progress of free inquiry and speculative thought from thethirteenth century to the sixteenth. Predictably, his heroes were men such asJohn Wycliffe, John Ball, and John Huss ( Jan Hus), priestly rebels against theestablished order, although he was more guarded about Martin Luther and hadnothing to say about John Calvin. He also devoted admiring pen-portraits to theearliest pioneers of modern science, from Roger Bacon to Galileo. Among thephilosophers of the later Middle Ages, his idol was William of Occam, one of theoriginators of “nominalism,” the doctrine that objects are unique and that thecategories or “essences” into which we group them for our own convenience do nothave any independent existence. By 1920 Wells had come to regard himself as anominalist, like many other thinkers drawn to the methods and world-view ofmodern science.But one section of this chapter stands out as an illustration of the limits ofeven Wells’ imagination and reach, in good part because of the times in which helived. If he surmounted these limits when dealing with the civilizations ofAsia, he failed to do so when he looked westward to the so-called New World. Thetitle of the section in question, “America Comes into History” (ch. VI, § 8),suggests that the great Amerindian civilizations of the pre-Columbian WesternHemisphere did not become “historical” until Europeans discovered—andravaged—them. Wells’ narrative did include a few sentences on the origins of theAztec and Incan empires before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors, butnearly the whole section focused on the conquest itself and its immediateaftermath. By the same token, there is no account of the major civilizations andcultures of sub-Saharan Africa before the seventeenth century, although in thisinstance Wells may more readily be excused. Much less was known about them byWestern scholars at the time he conducted his research.Then come five closely related chapters, originally linked under the omnibustitle “The Age of the Great Powers,” which treated, in succession, the historyof Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries down to about 1775, therevolutions in North America and France that followed, the life and times ofNapoleon (perhaps Wells’ favorite villain), the nineteenth century chiefly inEurope, and World War I. Brief sections on the history of Japan, the Europeanrape of Africa, the reawakening of China (which he expected would soon rivalEurope and the U.S.), and the British Empire gave readers glimpses of lifebeyond Europe’s shores, but they were glimpses only. The Americas barely enteredthe picture at all.The real point of these five chapters was that Europe’s division into apatchwork quilt of armed and aggressive national states in early modern timesled ultimately to what Wells called the “international catastrophe of 1914,” acatastrophe so horrific that it brought closure to the “Great Power period” inworld history altogether. The decision to write The Outline of History in thefirst place had been a direct response on Wells’ part to World War I, then knownas the “Great War.” He had attributed its millions of corpses and shatteredlandscapes to the teaching of history as national epic, as the record of this orthat country’s rise to glory and power, without regard for other nations ortheir own grievances and aspirations. Human beings needed to be reeducated, toview the history of all humankind as a single adventure. “History,” he wrote inan eloquent article published in the spring of 1919, “is one.” Accordingly, inWells’ eyes, it was essential to assign full responsibility for the Great War tothe ill-taught leaders of the vainly strutting Great Powers of Europe, toBritain, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Russia, which had been jostlingfor supremacy for centuries and had now brought well-earned ruin on themselves.The extensive chapter on the Great War ends with a bracing bitter account of theattempts of the peacemakers at Versailles in 1919 to create a new world order.Wells had been a leading figure in the movement in Great Britain to promote theidea of a postwar league of nations, a league with real authority to reduce oreliminate armaments altogether and to keep the peace of the world. As he saw it,the statesmen at Versailles had instead imposed a punitive peace on the defeatednations. They had fashioned the League of Nations, but it was a league only ofdiplomats appointed by their respective governments, with few powers and littleauthority. Wells expressed his disdain and disappointment in some of his mostcaustic prose and continued to ridicule the League of Nations for the rest ofhis life.Nevertheless, he did not abandon hope. He brought his Outline to a strikingclose with Chapter XII, “The Next Stage of History,” taking advantage of hisconsiderable prowess and reputation as a prophet of things to come, firstdemonstrated in 1902 in a book entitled Anticipations. The future is accordedonly one chapter, and it is quite compact, but it sums up all the thought thatWells could bring to bear on the deeper meaning of world history.Wells argued that through the interplay of communities of obedience (the greatsettled civilizations) and communities of will (the nomadic cultures), humanityhad progressed through the ages. In its advance, the size of its states hadsteadily enlarged, although still not widely enough. Ideas of freedom anddemocracy had also emerged and had been realized, at least in part, in variousparts of the world. Knowledge and skill had vastly expanded.Today, Wells insisted, technological wonders had transformed a planet of manyseparate, relatively isolated societies into a planet where the only sanelyconceivable state was a world state, empowered by all its peoples to keep thepeace and serve the needs of everyone. He offered his vision of what a trueworld state, a federation of all nations, could achieve. Still lacking was aneducated public prepared to demand and support such a state, but this problem,too, could be solved, with enough will and determination. In the most oftenquoted passage from all of Wells’ many books, he wrote: “Human history becomesmore and more a race between education and catastrophe.” He placed his wager oneducation.Had the world heeded Wells’ counsel in the postwar era, most of the horrors ofthe rest of the twentieth century might have been avoided. We might haveinherited a sane, responsible world order in the twenty-first century. We shallnever know for sure, but the wisdom and foresight that Wells displayed at theend of The Outline of History are cause for much soul-searching as wecontemplate what actually ensued on this earth after its first publication.In the years that followed, The Outline of History sold millions of copies inmany languages. Religious conservatives, such as Archbishop Richard Downey andHilaire Belloc, railed against it in polemical tracts. Florence Deeks, aCanadian woman, went to court to accuse Wells of plagiarizing a manuscript ofher own, as if world history could be copyrighted. No credible evidence ofplagiarism has ever surfaced, and no one has demonstrated that Wells even sawher manuscript. She lost her suits, both in Canada and Britain.But on the whole, the Outline was warmly received. It inspired others to bringout similar, although never comparable, volumes. Its freshly written sequel, AShort History of the World (1922), was adopted as a textbook in progressiveEnglish secondary schools. Many professional historians, especially in theUnited States, caroled its praises, although some sprang to the attack.No matter. As the celebrated Cornell historian Carl Becker commented, TheOutline of History was “a notable effort to enlist the experience of mankind inthe service of its destiny.” Another great historian, the late A. J. P. Taylorof Oxford University, confessed that he may have learned more from the Outline,which he encountered as a youth, than from any other book he ever read.Nowadays, the professional study and writing and teaching of world history havebecome perhaps the most venturesome and exciting enterprises of scholars in thediscipline. How much of this we owe to Wells is a matter of conjecture, but hesurely belongs somewhere in the chain of causation.What remains most true of Wells’ The Outline of History is its sheerreadability. Wells was among the finest prose writers of his generation, with anuncanny sense of how to seize the attention of the average educated man orwoman. Swift but colorful biographical sketches, candid personal asides, vividnarration, memorable figures of speech, and frequent pauses to show the largerimportance of the subjects at hand sustain our interest through its many pages.At the same time, Wells did not treat his readers with condescension. Nor did heevade controversy by suppressing it, as the many initialed footnotes fromdissenting consultants included in early editions bear witness. But above all,he knew how to tell a story and give it human significance. W.

We have already told the main facts about the origin of the Jewish nationand tradition, about the Diaspora, about the fundamentally scattered nature ofJewry even from the beginning, and the gradual development of the idea of onejust God ruling the earth and bound by a special promise to preserve and bringto honour the Jewish people. The Jewish idea was and is a curious combination oftheological breadth and an intense racial patriotism. The Jews looked for aspecial saviour, a Messiah, who was to redeem mankind by the agreeable processof restoring the fabulous glories of David and Solomon, and bringing the wholeworld at last under the benevolent but firm Jewish heel. As the political powerof the Semitic peoples declined, as Carthage followed Tyre into the darkness andSpain became a Roman province, this dream grew and spread. There can be littledoubt that the scattered Phœnicians in Spain and Africa and throughout theMediterranean, speaking as they did a language closely akin to Hebrew and beingdeprived of their authentic political rights, became proselytes to Judaism. Forphases of vigorous proselytism alternated with phases of exclusive jealousy inJewish history. On one occasion the Idumeans, being conquered, were all forciblymade Jews.1 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1] There were Arabtribes who were Jews in the time of Muhammad, and a Turkish people who weremainly Jews in South Russia in the ninth century. Judaism is indeed thereconstructed political ideal of many shattered peoples—mainly Semitic. It is tothe Phœnician contingent and to Aramean accessions in Babylon that the financialand commercial tradition of the Jews is to be ascribed. But as a result of thesecoalescences and assimilations, almost everywhere in the towns throughout theRoman Empire, and far beyond it in the east, Jewish communities traded andflourished, and were kept in touch through the Bible, and through a religiousand educational organization. The main part of Jewry never was in Judea and hadnever come out of Judea.Manifestly this intercommunicating series of Judaized communities had very greatfinancial and political facilities. They could assemble resources, they couldstir up, they could allay. They were neither so abundant nor so civilized as thestill more widely diffused Greeks, but they had a tradition of greatersolidarity. Greek was hostile to Greek; Jew stood by Jew. Wherever a Jew went,he found men of like mind and like tradition with himself. He could get shelter,food, loans, and legal help. And by reason of this solidarity rulers hadeverywhere to take account of this people as a help, as a source of loans, or asa source of trouble. So it is that the Jews have persisted as a people whileHellenism has become a universal light for mankind.We cannot tell here in any detail the history of that smaller part of Jewry thatlived in Judea. These Jews had returned to their old position of danger; againthey were seeking peace in, so to speak, the middle of a highway. In the oldtime they had been between Syria and Assyria to the north and Egypt to thesouth; now they had the Seleucids to the north and the Ptolemys to the south,and when the Seleucids went, then down came the Roman power upon them. Theindependence of Judea was always a qualified and precarious thing. The readermust go to the Antiquities and the Wars of the Jews of Flavius Josephus, acopious, tedious, and maddeningly patriotic writer, to learn of the successionof their rulers, of their high-priest monarchs, and of the Maccabæans, theHerods and the like. These rulers were for the most part of the ordinary easterntype, cunning, treacherous, and blood-stained. Thrice Jerusalem was taken andtwice the temple was destroyed. It was the support of the far more powerfulDiaspora that prevented the little country from being wiped out altogether,until 70 A.D., when Titus, the adopted son and successor of the EmperorVespasian, after a siege that ranks in bitterness and horror with that of Tyreand Carthage, took Jerusalem and destroyed city and temple altogether. He didthis in an attempt to destroy Jewry, but indeed he made Jewry stronger bydestroying its one sensitive and vulnerable point.003 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_003_r1.gif]Throughout a history of five centuries of war and civil commotion between thereturn from captivity and the destruction of Jerusalem, certain constantfeatures of the Jew persisted. He remained obstinately monotheistic; he wouldhave none other gods but the one true God. In Rome, as in Jerusalem, he stoodout manfully against the worship of any god-Cæsar. And to the best of hisability he held to his covenants with his God. No graven images could enterJerusalem; even the Roman standards with their eagles had to stay outside.Two divergent lines of thought are traceable in Jewish affairs during these fivehundred years. On the right, so to speak, are the high and narrow Jews, thePharisees, very orthodox, very punctilious upon even the minutest details of thelaw, intensely patriotic and exclusive. Jerusalem on one occasion fell to theSeleucid monarch Antiochus IV because the Jews would not defend it on theSabbath day, when it is forbidden to work; and it was because the Jews made noeffort to destroy his siege train on the Sabbath that Pompey the Great was ableto take Jerusalem. But against these narrow Jews were pitted the broad Jews, theJews of the left, who were Hellenizers, among whom are to be ranked theSadducees, who did not believe in immortality. These latter Jews, the broadJews, were all more or less disposed to mingle with and assimilate themselves tothe Greeks and Hellenized peoples about them. They were ready to acceptproselytes, and so to share God and his promise with all mankind. But what theygained in generosity they lost in rectitude. They were the worldlings of Judea.We have already noted how the Hellenized Jews of Egypt lost their Hebrew, andhad to have their Bible translated into Greek.In the reign of Tiberius Cæsar a great teacher arose out of Judea who was toliberate the intense realization of the righteousness and unchallengeableoneness of God, and of man’s moral obligation to God, which was the strength oforthodox Judaism, from that greedy and exclusive narrowness with which it was soextraordinarily intermingled in the Jewish mind. This was Jesus of Nazareth, theseed rather than the founder of Christianity.§ 2The audience to which this book will first be presented will be largely anaudience of Christians, with perhaps a sprinkling of Jewish readers, and theformer at least will regard Jesus of Nazareth as being much more than a humanteacher, and his appearance in the world not as a natural event in history, butas something of a supernatural sort interrupting and changing that steadydevelopment of life towards a common consciousness and a common will, which wehave hitherto been tracing in this book. But these persuasions, dominant as theyare in Europe and America, are nevertheless not the persuasions of all men or ofthe great majority of mankind, and we are writing this outline of the story oflife with as complete an avoidance of controversial matter as may be. We aretrying to write as if this book was to be read as much by Hindus or Moslems orBuddhists as by Americans and Western Europeans. We shall therefore hold closelyto the apparent facts, and avoid, without any disputation or denial, thetheological interpretations that have been imposed upon them. We shall tell whatmen have believed about Jesus of Nazareth, but him we shall treat as being whathe appeared to be, a man, just as a painter must needs paint him as a man. Thedocuments that testify to his acts and teachings we shall treat as ordinaryhuman documents. If the light of divinity shine through our recital, we willneither help nor hinder it. This is what we have already done in the case ofBuddha, and what we shall do later with Muhammad. About Jesus we have to writenot theology but history, and our concern is not with the spiritual andtheological significance of his life, but with its effects upon the politicaland everyday life of men.Almost our only sources of information about the personality of Jesus arederived from the four gospels, all of which were certainly in existence a fewdecades after his death, and from allusions to his life in the letters(epistles) of the early Christian propagandists. The first three gospels, thegospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, many suppose to be derived from some earlierdocuments; the gospel of St. John has more idiosyncrasy and is coloured bytheology of a strongly Hellenic type. Critics are disposed to regard the gospelof St. Mark as being the most trustworthy account of the personality and actualwords of Jesus. But all four agree in giving us a picture of a very definitepersonality; they carry the same conviction of reality that the early accountsof Buddha do. In spite of miraculous and incredible additions, one is obliged tosay, “Here was a man. This part of the tale could not have been invented.”But just as the personality of Gautama Buddha has been distorted and obscured bythe stiff squatting figure, the gilded idol of later Buddhism, so one feels thatthe lean and strenuous personality of Jesus is much wronged by the unreality andconventionality that a mistaken reverence has imposed upon his figure in modernChristian art. Jesus was a penniless teacher, who wandered about the dustysun-bit country of Judea, living upon casual gifts of food; yet he is alwaysrepresented clean, combed, and sleek, in spotless raiment, erect, and withsomething motionless about him as though he was gliding through the air. Thisalone has made him unreal and incredible to many people who cannot distinguishthe core of the story from the ornamental and unwise additions of theunintelligently devout.And it may be that the early parts of the gospels are accretions of the samenature. The miraculous circumstances of the birth of Jesus, the great star thatbrought wise men from the east to worship at his manger cradle, the massacre ofthe male infant children in the region of Bethlehem by Herod as a consequence ofthese portents, and the flight into Egypt, are all supposed to be suchaccretionary matter by many authorities. At the best they are events unnecessaryto the teaching, and they rob it of much of the strength and power it possesseswhen we strip it of such accompaniment. So, too, do the discrepant genealogiesgiven by Matthew and Luke, in which there is an endeavour to trace the directdescent of Joseph, his father, from King David, as though it was any honour toJesus or to anyone to have such a man as an ancestor. The insertion of thesegenealogies is the more peculiar and unreasonable, because, according to thelegend, Jesus was not the son of Joseph at all, but miraculously conceived.We are left, if we do strip this record of these difficult accessories, with thefigure of a being, very human, very earnest and passionate, capable of swiftanger, and teaching a new and simple and profound doctrine—namely, the universalloving Fatherhood of God and the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven. He was clearlya person—to use a common phrase—of intense personal magnetism. He attractedfollowers and filled them with love and courage. Weak and ailing people wereheartened and healed by his presence. Yet he was probably of a delicatephysique, because of the swiftness with which he died under the pains ofcrucifixion. There is a tradition that he fainted when, according to the custom,he was made to bear his cross to the place of execution. When he first appearedas a teacher he was a man of about thirty. He went about the country for threeyears spreading his doctrine, and then he came to Jerusalem and was accused oftrying to set up a strange kingdom in Judea; he was tried upon this charge, andcrucified together with two thieves. Long before these two were dead, hissufferings were over.Now it is a matter of fact that in the gospels all that body of theologicalassertion which constitutes Christianity finds little support. There is, as thereader may see for himself, no clear and emphatic assertion in these books ofthe doctrines which Christian teachers of all denominations find generallynecessary to salvation. Except for one or two passages in St. John’s Gospel itis difficult to get any words actually ascribed to Jesus in which he claimed tobe the Jewish Messiah (rendered in Greek by “the Christ”) and still moredifficult is it to find any claim to be a part of the godhead, or any passage inwhich he explained the doctrine of the Atonement or urged any sacrifices orsacraments (that is to say, priestly offices) upon his followers. We shall seepresently how later on all Christendom was torn by disputes about the Trinity.There is no evidence that the apostles of Jesus ever heard of the Trinity—at anyrate from him. The observance of the Jewish Sabbath, again, transferred to theMithraic Sun-day, is an important feature of many Christian cults; but Jesusdeliberately broke the Sabbath, and said that it was made for man and not manfor the Sabbath. Nor did he say a word about the worship of his mother Mary, inthe guise of Isis, the Queen of Heaven. All that is most characteristicallyChristian in worship and usage, he ignored. Sceptical writers have had thetemerity to deny that Jesus can be called a Christian at all. For light uponthese extraordinary gaps in his teaching, each reader must go to his ownreligious guides. Here we are bound to mention these gaps on account of thedifficulties and controversies that arose out of them, and we are equally boundnot to enlarge upon them.As remarkable is the enormous prominence given by Jesus to the teaching of whathe called the Kingdom of Heaven, and its comparative insignificance in theprocedure and teaching of most of the Christian churches.This doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, which was the main teaching of Jesus,and which plays so small a part in the Christian creeds, is certainly one of themost revolutionary doctrines that ever stirred and changed human thought. It issmall wonder if the world of that time failed to grasp its full significance,and recoiled in dismay from even a half apprehension of its tremendouschallenges to the established habits and institutions of mankind. It is smallwonder if the hesitating convert and disciple presently went back to the oldfamiliar ideas of temple and altar, of fierce deity and propitiatory observance,of consecrated priest and magic blessing, and—these things being attendedto—reverted then to the dear old habitual life of hates and profits andcompetition and pride. For the doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, as Jesus seemsto have preached it, was no less than a bold and uncompromising demand for acomplete change and cleansing of the life of our struggling race, an uttercleansing, without and within. To the gospels the reader must go for all that ispreserved of this tremendous teaching; here we are only concerned with the jarof its impact upon established ideas.The Jews were persuaded that God, the one God of the whole world, was arighteous god, but they also thought of him as a trading god who had made abargain with their Father Abraham about them, a very good bargain indeed forthem, to bring them at last to predominance in the earth. With dismay and angerthey heard Jesus sweeping away their dear securities. God, he taught, was nobargainer; there were no chosen people and no favourites in the Kingdom ofHeaven. God was the loving father of all life, as incapable of showing favour asthe universal sun. And all men were brothers—sinners alike and beloved sonsalike—of this divine father. In the parable of the Good Samaritan Jesus castscorn upon that natural tendency we all obey, to glorify our own people and tominimize the righteousness of other creeds and other races. In the parable ofthe labourers he thrust aside the obstinate claim of the Jews to have a sort offirst mortgage upon God. All whom God takes into the kingdom, he taught, Godserves alike; there is no distinction in his treatment, because there is nomeasure to his bounty. From all, moreover, as the parable of the buried talentwitnesses, and as the incident of the widow’s mite enforces, he demands theutmost. There are no privileges, no rebates, and no excuses in the Kingdom ofHeaven.But it was not only the intense tribal patriotism of the Jews that Jesusoutraged. They were a people of intense family loyalty, and he would have sweptaway all the narrow and restrictive family affections in the great flood of thelove of God. The whole Kingdom of Heaven was to be the family of his followers.We are told that, “While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and hisbrethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. Then one said unto him,Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who aremy brethren? And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said,Behold my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of my Fatherwhich is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.”2[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en2]And not only did Jesus strike at patriotism and the bonds of family loyalty inthe name of God’s universal fatherhood and the brotherhood of all mankind, butit is clear that his teaching condemned all the gradations of the economicsystem, all private wealth, and personal advantages. All men belonged to thekingdom; all their possessions belonged to the kingdom; the righteous life forall men, the only righteous life, was the service of God’s will with all that wehad, with all that we were. Again and again he denounced private riches and thereservation of any private life.“And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled tohim, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternallife? And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good butone, that is, God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do notkill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy fatherand mother. And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these things have Iobserved from my youth. Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him,One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to thepoor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, andfollow me. And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he hadgreat possessions.“And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shallthey that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! And the disciples wereastonished at his words. But Jesus answered again, and saith unto them,Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdomof God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for arich man to enter into the kingdom of God.”3[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en3]Moreover, in his tremendous prophecy of this kingdom which was to make all menone together in God, Jesus had small patience for the bargaining righteousnessof formal religion. Another large part of his recorded utterances is aimedagainst the meticulous observance of the rules of the pious career. “Then cametogether unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came fromJerusalem. And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, thatis to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. For the Pharisees, and allthe Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition ofthe elders. And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not.And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washingof cups, and pots, brazen vessels, and of tables. Then the Pharisees and scribesasked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders,but eat bread with unwashen hands? He answered and said unto them, Well hathIsaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written,“This people honoureth me with their lips,“But their heart is far from me.“Howbeit in vain do they worship me,“Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.“For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as thewashing of pots and cups: and many other such things ye do. And he said untothem, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your owntradition.”4 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en4]So, too, we may note a score of places in which he flouted that darling virtueof the formalist, the observance of the Sabbath.It was not merely a moral and a social revolution that Jesus proclaimed; it isclear from a score of indications that his teaching had a political bent of theplainest sort. It is true that he said his kingdom was not of this world, thatit was in the hearts of men and not upon a throne; but it is equally clear thatwherever and in what measure his kingdom was set up in the hearts of men, theouter world would be in that measure revolutionized and made new.Whatever else the deafness and blindness of his hearers may have missed in hisutterances, it is plain that they did not miss his resolve to revolutionize theworld. Some of the questions that were brought to Jesus and the answers he gaveenable us to guess at the drift of much of his unrecorded teaching. Thedirectness of his political attack is manifest by such an incident as that ofthe coin—“And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catchhim in his words. And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we knowthat thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person ofmen, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute toCæsar, or not? Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing theirhypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image andsuperscription? And they said unto him, Cæsar’s. And Jesus answering said untothem, Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things thatare God’s”5 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en5]—which in view ofall else that he had taught, left very little of a man or his possessions forCæsar.The whole tenor of the opposition to him and the circumstances of his trial andexecution show clearly that to his contemporaries he seemed to propose plainlyand did propose plainly to change and fuse and enlarge all human life. But evenhis disciples did not grasp the profound and comprehensive significance of thatproposal. They were ridden by the old Jewish dream of a king, a Messiah tooverthrow the Hellenized Herods and the Roman overlord, and restore the fabledglories of David. They disregarded the substance of his teaching, plain anddirect though it was; evidently they thought it was merely his mysterious andsingular way of setting about the adventure that would at last put him on thethrone of Jerusalem. They thought he was just another king among the endlesssuccession of kings, but of a quasi-magic kind, and making quasi-magicprofession of an impossible virtue.“And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying Master, we wouldthat thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire. And he said unto them,What would ye that I should do for you? They said unto him, Grant unto us thatwe may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup thatI drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? And theysaid unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of thecup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye bebaptized: but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give;but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared. And when the ten heardit, they began to be much displeased with James and John. But Jesus called themto him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule overthe Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exerciseauthority upon them. But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will begreat among you, shall be your minister: and whosoever of you will be thechiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the Son of Man came not to beministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.”6[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en6]This was cold comfort for those who looked for a due reward for their servicesand hardships in his train. They could not believe this hard doctrine of akingdom of service which was its own exceeding great reward. Even after hisdeath upon the cross, they could still, after their first dismay, revert to thebelief that he was nevertheless in the vein of the ancient world of pomps andprivileges, that presently by some amazing miracle he would become undead againand return, and set up his throne with much splendour and graciousness inJerusalem. They thought his life was a stratagem and his death a trick.He was too great for his disciples. And in view of what he plainly said, is itany wonder that all who were rich and prosperous felt a horror of strangethings, a swimming of their world at his teaching? Perhaps the priests and therulers and the rich men understood him better than his followers. He wasdragging out all the little private reservations they had made from socialservice into the light of a universal religious life.He was like some terrible moral huntsman digging mankind out of the snug burrowsin which they had lived hitherto. In the white blaze of this kingdom of histhere was to be no property, no privilege, no pride and precedence; no motiveindeed and no reward but love. Is it any wonder that men were dazzled andblinded and cried out against him? Even his disciples cried out when he wouldnot spare them the light. Is it any wonder that the priests realized thatbetween this man and themselves there was no choice but that he or priestcraftshould perish? Is it any wonder that the Roman soldiers, confronted and amazedby something soaring over their comprehension and threatening all theirdisciplines, should take refuge in wild laughter, and crown him with thorns androbe him in purple and make a mock Cæsar of him? For to take him seriously wasto enter upon a strange and alarming life, to abandon habits, to controlinstincts and impulses, to essay an incredible happiness. . . .Is it any wonder that to this day this Galilean is too much for our smallhearts?§ 3Yet be it noted that while there was much in the real teachings of Jesus that arich man or a priest or a trader or an imperial official or any ordinaryrespectable citizen could not accept without the most revolutionary changes inhis way of living, yet there was nothing that a follower of the actual teachingof Gautama Sakya might not receive very readily, nothing to prevent a primitiveBuddhist from being also a Nazarene, and nothing to prevent a personal discipleof Jesus from accepting all the recorded teachings of Buddha.Again consider the tone of this extract from the writings of a Chinaman, Mo Ti,who lived somewhen in the fourth century B.C., when the doctrines of Confuciusand Lao Tse prevailed in China, before the advent of Buddhism to that country,and note how “Nazarene” it is.“The mutual attacks of state on state; the mutual usurpations of family onfamily; the mutual robberies of man on man; the want of kindness on the part ofthe sovereign and of loyalty on the part of the minister; the want of tendernessand filial duty between father and son—these, and such as these, are the thingsinjurious to the empire. All this has arisen from want of mutual love. If butthat one virtue could be made universal, the princes loving one another wouldhave no battle-fields; the chiefs of families would attempt no usurpations; menwould commit no robberies; rulers and ministers would be gracious and loyal;fathers and sons would be kind and filial; brothers would be harmonious andeasily reconciled. Men in general loving one another, the strong would not makeprey of the weak; the many would not plunder the few, the rich would not insultthe poor, the noble would not be insolent to the mean; and the deceitful wouldnot impose upon the simple.”7 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en7]This is extraordinarily like the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth cast intopolitical terms. The thoughts of Mo Ti came close to the Kingdom of Heaven.This essential identity is the most important historical aspect of these greatworld religions. They were in their beginnings quite unlike the priest, altar,and temple cults, those cults for the worship of definite finite gods thatplayed so great and so essential a part in the earlier stages of man’sdevelopment between 15,000 B.C. and 600 B.C. These new world religions, from 600B.C. onward, were essentially religions of the heart and of the universal sky.They swept away all those various and limited gods that had served the turn ofhuman needs since the first communities were welded together by fear and hope.And presently when we come to Islam we shall find that for a third time the samefundamental new doctrine of the need of a universal devotion of all men to oneWill reappears. Warned by the experiences of Christianity, Muhammad was veryemphatic in insisting that he himself was merely a man and so saved his teachingfrom much corruption and misrepresentation.We speak of these great religions of mankind which arose between the Persianconquest of Babylon and the break-up of the Roman empire as rivals; but it istheir defects, their accumulations and excrescences, their differences oflanguage and phrase, that cause the rivalry; and it is not to one overcoming theother or to any new variant replacing them that we must look, but to the whitetruth in each being burnt free from its dross, and becoming manifestly the sametruth—namely, that the hearts of men, and therewith all the lives andinstitutions of men, must be subdued to one common Will, ruling them all.8[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en8]And though much has been written foolishly about the antagonism of science andreligion, there is indeed no such antagonism. What all these world religionsdeclare by inspiration and insight, history as it grows clearer and science asits range extends display, as a reasonable and demonstrable fact, that men formone universal brotherhood, that they spring from one common origin, that theirindividual lives, their nations and races, interbreed and blend and go on tomerge again at last in one common human destiny upon this little planet amidstthe stars. And the psychologist can now stand beside the preacher and assure usthat there is no reasoned peace of heart, no balance and no safety in the soul,until a man in losing his life has found it, and has schooled and disciplinedhis interests and will beyond greeds, rivalries, fears, instincts, and narrowaffections. The history of our race and personal religious experience run soclosely parallel as to seem to a modern observer almost the same thing; bothtell of a being at first scattered and blind and utterly confused, feeling itsway slowly to the serenity and salvation of an ordered and coherent purpose.That, in the simplest, is the outline of history; whether one have a religiouspurpose or disavow a religious purpose altogether, the lines of the outlineremain the same.§ 4In the year 30 A.D., while Tiberius, the second emperor, was Emperor of Rome andPontius Pilate was procurator of Judea, a little while before the Feast of thePassover, Jesus of Nazareth came into Jerusalem. Probably he came then for thefirst time. Hitherto he had been preaching chiefly in Galilee, and for the mostpart round and about the town of Capernaum. In Capernaum he had preached in thesynagogue.His entry into Jerusalem was a pacific triumph. He had gathered a greatfollowing in Galilee—he had sometimes to preach from a boat upon the Lake ofGalilee, because of the pressure of the crowd upon the shore—and his fame hadspread before him to the capital. Great crowds came out to greet him. It isclear they did not understand the drift of his teaching, and that they sharedthe general persuasion that by some magic of righteousness he was going tooverthrow the established order. He rode into the city upon the foal of an assthat had been borrowed by his disciples. The crowd accompanied him with cries oftriumph and shouts of “Hosanna,” a word of rejoicing.He went to the temple. Its outer courts were cumbered with the tables ofmoney-changers and with the stalls of those who sold doves to be liberated bypious visitors to the temple. These traders upon religion he and his followerscast out, overturning the tables. It was almost his only act of positive rule.Then for a week he taught in Jerusalem, surrounded by a crowd of followers whomade his arrest by the authorities difficult. Then officialdom gathered itselftogether against this astonishing intruder. One of his disciples, Judas,dismayed and disappointed at the apparent ineffectiveness of this capture ofJerusalem, went to the Jewish priests to give them his advice and help in thearrest of Jesus. For this service he was rewarded with thirty pieces of silver.The high priest and the Jews generally had many reasons for dismay at thisgentle insurrection that was filling the streets with excited crowds; forexample, the Romans might misunderstand it or use it as an occasion to do somemischief to the whole Jewish people. Accordingly the high priest Caiaphas, inhis anxiety to show his loyalty to the Roman overlord, was the leader in theproceedings against this unarmed Messiah, and the priests and the orthodox mobof Jerusalem the chief accusers of Jesus.How he was arrested in the garden of Gethsemane, how he was tried and sentencedby Pontius Pilate, the Roman procurator, how he was scourged and mocked by theRoman soldiers and crucified upon the hill called Golgotha, is told withunsurpassable simplicity and dignity in the gospels.The revolution collapsed utterly. The disciples of Jesus with one accorddeserted him, and Peter, being taxed as one of them, said, “I know not the man.”This was not the end they had anticipated in their great coming to Jerusalem.His last hours of aching pain and thirst upon the cross were watched only by afew women and near friends. Towards the end of the long day of suffering thisabandoned leader roused himself to one supreme effort, cried out with a loudvoice, “My God! my God! why has thou forsaken me?” and, leaving these words toecho down the ages, a perpetual riddle to the faithful, died.It was inevitable that simple believers should have tried to enhance the starkterrors of this tragedy by foolish stories of physical disturbances similar tothose which had been invented to emphasize the conversion of Gautama. We aretold that a great darkness fell upon the earth, and that the veil of the templewas rent in twain; but if indeed these things occurred, they produced not theslightest effect upon the minds of people in Jerusalem at that time. It isdifficult to believe nowadays that the order of nature indulged in any suchmeaningless comments. Far more tremendous is it to suppose a world apparentlyindifferent to those three crosses in the red evening twilight, and to thelittle group of perplexed and desolated watchers. The darkness closed upon thehill; the distant city set about its preparations for the Passover; scarcelyanyone but that knot of mourners on the way to their homes troubled whetherJesus of Nazareth was still dying or already dead. . . .The souls of the disciples were plunged for a time into utter darkness. Thenpresently came a whisper among them and stories, rather discrepant stories, thatthe body of Jesus was not in the tomb in which it had been placed, and thatfirst one and then another had seen him alive. Soon they were consolingthemselves with the conviction that he had risen from the dead, that he hadshown himself to many, and had ascended visibly into heaven. Witnesses werefound to declare that they had positively seen him go up, visibly in his body.He had gone through the blue—to God. Soon they had convinced themselves that hewould presently come again, in power and glory, to judge all mankind. In alittle while, they said, he would come back to them; and in these brightrevivals of their old-time dream of an assertive and temporal splendour theyforgot the greater measure, the giant measure, he had given them of the Kingdomof God.§ 5The story of the early beginnings of Christianity is the story of the strugglebetween the real teachings and spirit of Jesus of Nazareth and the limitations,amplifications, and misunderstandings of the very inferior men who had loved andfollowed him from Galilee, and who were now the bearers and custodians of hismessage of mankind. The gospels and the Acts of the Apostles present a patchedand uneven record, but there can be little question that on the whole it is aquite honest record of those early days.The early Nazarenes, as the followers of Jesus were called, present from thefirst a spectacle of a great confusion between these two strands, his teachingon the one hand, and the glosses and interpretations of the disciples on theother. They continued for a time his disciplines of the complete subjugation ofself; they had their goods in common, they had no bond but love. Nevertheless,they built their faith upon the stories that were told of his resurrection andmagical ascension, and the promised return. Few of them understood that therenunciation of self is its own reward, that it is itself the Kingdom of Heaven;they regarded it as a sacrifice that entitled them to the compensation of powerand dominion when presently the second coming occurred. They had now allidentified Jesus with the promised Christ, the Messiah so long expected by theJewish people. They found out prophecies of the crucifixion in the prophets—theGospel of Matthew is particularly insistent upon these prophecies. Revived bythese hopes, enforced by the sweet and pure lives of many of the believers, theNazarene doctrine began to spread very rapidly in Judea and Syria.And presently there arose a second great teacher, whom many modern authoritiesregard as the real founder of Christianity, Saul of Tarsus, or Paul. Saulapparently was his Jewish and Paul his Roman name; he was a Roman citizen, and aman of much wider education and a much narrower intellectuality than Jesus seemsto have been. By birth he was probably a Jew, though some Jewish writers denythis; he had certainly studied under Jewish teachers. But he was well versed inthe Hellenic theologies of Alexandria, and his language was Greek. Someclassical scholars profess to find his Greek unsatisfactory; he did not use theGreek of Athens, but the Greek of Alexandria; but he used it with power andfreedom.9 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en9] He was a religioustheorist and teacher long before he heard of Jesus of Nazareth, and he appearsin the New Testament narrative at first as the bitter critic and antagonist ofthe Nazarenes.The present writer has been unable to find any discussion of the religious ideasof Paul before he became a follower of Jesus. They must have been a basis, ifonly a basis of departure, for his new views, and their phraseology certainlysupplied the colour of his new doctrines. We are almost equally in the dark asto the teachings of Gamaliel, who is named as the Jewish teacher at whose feethe sat. Nor do we know what Gentile teachings had reached him. It is highlyprobable that he had been influenced by Mithraism. He uses phrases curiouslylike Mithraistic phrases. What will be clear to anyone who reads his variousEpistles, side by side with the Gospels, is that his mind was saturated by anidea which does not appear at all prominently in the reported sayings andteachings of Jesus, the idea of a sacrificial person, who is offered up to Godas an atonement for sin. What Jesus preached was a new birth of the human soul;what Paul preached was the ancient religion of priest and altar and propitiatorybloodshed. Jesus was to him the Easter lamb, that traditional human victimwithout spot or blemish who haunts all the religions of the dark white peoples.Paul came to the Nazarenes with overwhelming force because he came to them withthis completely satisfactory explanation of the disaster of the crucifixion. Itwas a brilliant elucidation of what had been utterly perplexing.Paul had never seen Jesus. His knowledge of Jesus and his teaching must havebeen derived from the hearsay of the original disciples. It is clear that heapprehended much of the spirit of Jesus and his doctrine of a new birth, but hebuilt this into a theological system, a very subtle and ingenious system, whoseappeal to this day is chiefly intellectual. And it is clear that the faith ofthe Nazarenes, which he found as a doctrine of motive and a way of living, hemade into a doctrine of belief. He found the Nazarenes with a spirit and hope,and he left them Christians with the beginning of a creed.But we must refer the reader to the Acts of the Apostles and the PaulineEpistles for an account of Paul’s mission and teaching. He was a man of enormousenergy, and he taught at Jerusalem, Antioch, Athens, Corinth, Ephesus, and Rome.Possibly he went into Spain. The manner of his death is not certainly known, butit is said that he was killed in Rome during the reign of Nero. A great fire hadburnt a large part of Rome, and the new sect was accused of causing this. Therapid spread of Christian teaching certainly owes more to Paul than to any othersingle man. Within two decades of the crucifixion this new religion was alreadyattracting the attention of the Roman rulers in several provinces. If it hadacquired a theology in the hands of St. Paul, it still retained much of therevolutionary and elementary quality of the teachings of Jesus. It had becomesomewhat more tolerant of private property; it would accept wealthy adherentswithout insisting upon the communization of their riches, and St. Paul hascondoned the institution of slavery (“Slaves, be obedient to your masters”), butit still set its face like flint against certain fundamental institutions of theRoman world. It would not tolerate the godhead of Cæsar; not even by a mutegesture at the altar would the Christians consent to worship the Emperor, thoughtheir lives were at stake in the matter. It denounced the gladiatorial shows.Unarmed, but possessing enormous powers of passive resistance, Christianity thusappeared at the outset plainly as rebellion, striking at the political if not atthe economic essentials of the imperial system. The first evidences ofChristianity in non-Christian literature we find when perplexed Roman officialsbegan to write to one another and exchange views upon the strange problempresented by this infectious rebellion of otherwise harmless people.Much of the history of the Christians in the first two centuries of theChristian era is very obscure. They spread far and wide throughout the world,but we know very little of their ideas or their ceremonies and methods duringthat time. As yet they had no settled creeds, and there can be little doubt thatthere were wide local variations in their beliefs and disciplines during thisformless period. But whatever their local differences, everywhere they seem tohave carried much of the spirit of Jesus; and though everywhere they arousedbitter enmity and active counter-propaganda, the very charges made against themwitness to the general goodness of their lives.During this indefinite time a considerable amount of a sort of theocrasia seemsto have gone on between the Christian cult and the almost equally popular andwidely diffused Mithraic cult, and the cult of Serapis-Isis-Horus. From theformer it would seem the Christians adopted Sun-day as their chief day ofworship instead of the Jewish Sabbath, the abundant use of candles in religiousceremonies, the legend of the adoration by the shepherds, and probably alsothose ideas and phrases, so distinctive of certain sects to this day, aboutbeing “washed in the blood” of Christ, and of Christ being a blood sacrifice.For we have to remember that a death by crucifixion is hardly a more bloodydeath than hanging; to speak of Jesus shedding his blood for mankind is really amost inaccurate expression. Even when we remember that he was scourged, that hewore a crown of thorns, and that his side was pierced by a spear, we are stillfar from a “fountain filled with blood.” But Mithraism centred upon some nowforgotten mysteries about Mithras sacrificing a sacred and benevolent bull; allthe Mithraic shrines seem to have contained a figure of Mithras killing thisbull, which bleeds copiously from a wound in its side, and from this blood a newlife sprang. The Mithraist votary actually bathed in the blood of thesacrificial bull, and was “born again” thereby. At his initiation he wentbeneath a scaffolding on which the bull was killed, and the blood ran down onhim.The contributions of the Alexandrine cult to Christian thought and practiceswere even more considerable. In the personality of Horus, who was at once theson of Serapis and identical with Serapis, it was natural for the Christians tofind an illuminating analogue in their struggles with the Pauline mysteries.From that to the identification of Mary with Isis, and her elevation to a rankquasi-divine—in spite of the saying of Jesus about his mother and his brothersthat we have already quoted—was also a very natural step. Natural, too, was itfor Christianity to adopt, almost insensibly, the practical methods of thepopular religions of the time. Its priests took on the head-shaving and thecharacteristic garments of the Egyptian priests, because that sort of thingseemed to be the right way of distinguishing a priest. One accretion followedanother. Almost insensibly the originally revolutionary teaching was buriedunder these customary acquisitions. We have already tried to imagine GautamaBuddha returning to Tibet, and his amazement at the worship of his own image inLhassa. We will but suggest the parallel amazement of some earnest Nazarene whohad known and followed his dusty and travel-worn Master through the dry sunlightof Galilee, restored suddenly to this world and visiting, let us say, a mass inSt. Peter’s at Rome, at learning that the consecrated wafer upon the altar wasnone other than his crucified teacher.Religion in a world community is not many things but one thing, and it wasinevitable that all the living religious faiths in the world at the time, andall the philosophy and religious thought that came into contact withChristianity, should come to an account with Christianity and exchange phrasesand ideas. The hopes of the early Nazarenes had identified Jesus with theChrist; the brilliant mind of Paul had surrounded his career with mysticalsignificance. Jesus had called men and women to a giant undertaking, to therenunciation of self, to the new birth into the kingdom of love. The line ofleast resistance for the flagging convert was to intellectualize himself awayfrom this plain doctrine, this stark proposition, into complicated theories andceremonies—that would leave his essential self alone. How much easier is it tosprinkle oneself with blood than to purge oneself from malice and competition;to eat bread and drink wine and pretend one had absorbed divinity, to givecandles rather than the heart, to shave the head and retain the scheming privacyof the brain inside it! The world was full of such evasive philosophy andtheological stuff in the opening centuries of the Christian era. It is not forus here to enlarge upon the distinctive features of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism,Philonism, and the like teachings which abounded in the Alexandrian world. Butit was all one world with that in which the early Christians were living. Thewritings of such men as Origen, Plotinus, and Augustine witness to theinevitable give and take of the time.Jesus called himself the Son of God and also the Son of Man; but he laid littlestress on who he was or what he was, and much upon the teachings of the Kingdom.In declaring that he was more than a man and divine, Paul and his otherfollowers, whether they were right or wrong, opened up a vast field of argument.Was Jesus God? Or had God created him? Was he identical with God or separatefrom God? It is not the function of the historian to answer such questions, buthe is bound to note them, and to note how unavoidable they were, because of theimmense influence they have had upon the whole subsequent life of westernmankind. By the fourth century of the Christian Era we find all the Christiancommunities so agitated and exasperated by tortuous and elusive arguments aboutthe nature of God as to be largely negligent of the simpler teachings ofcharity, service, and brotherhood that Jesus had inculcated.The chief views that the historian notices are those of the Arians, theSabellians, and the Trinitarians. The Arians followed Arius, who taught thatChrist was less than God; the Sabellians taught that he was a mode or aspect ofGod; God was Creator, Saviour, and Comforter just as one man may be father,trustee, and guest; the Trinitarians, of whom Athanasius was the great leader,taught that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost were three distinct Persons,but one God. The reader is referred to the Athanasian Creed10[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en10] for the exact expression ofthe latter mystery, and for the alarming consequences to him of any failure tograsp and believe it. To Gibbon he must go for a derisive statement of thesecontroversies. The present writer can deal with them neither with awe norderision; they seem to him, he must confess, a disastrous ebullition of thehuman mind entirely inconsistent with the plain account of Jesus preserved forus in the gospels. Orthodoxy became a test not only for Christian office, butfor Christian trade and help. A small point of doctrine might mean affluence orbeggary to a man. It is difficult to read the surviving literature of the timewithout a strong sense of the dogmatism, the spites, rivalries, and pedantriesof the men who tore Christianity to pieces for the sake of these theologicalrefinements. Most of the Trinitarian disputants—for it is chiefly Trinitariandocuments that survive —accuse their antagonists, probably with truth, of meanand secondary motives, but they do so in a manner that betrays their own basespirit very clearly. Arius, for example, is accused of adopting hereticalopinions because he was not appointed Bishop of Alexandria. Riots andexcommunications and banishments punctuated these controversies, and finallycame official persecutions. These fine differences about the constitution of theDeity interwove with politics and international disputes. Men who quarrelledover business affairs, wives who wished to annoy their husbands, developedantagonistic views upon this exalted theme. Most of the barbarian invaders ofthe empire were Arians; probably because their simple minds found theTrinitarian position incomprehensible.It is easy for the sceptic to mock at these disputes. But even if we think thatthese attempts to say exactly how God was related to himself were presumptuousand intellectually monstrous, nevertheless we are bound to recognize thatbeneath these preposterous refinements of impossible dogmas there lay often areal passion for truth—even if it was truth ill conceived. Both sides producedgenuine martyrs. And the zeal of these controversies, though it is a base andoften malicious zeal, did at any rate make the Christian sects veryenergetically propagandist and educational. Moreover, because the history of theChristian body in the fourth and fifth centuries is largely a record of theseunhappy disputes, that must not blind us to the fact that the spirit of Jesusdid live and ennoble many lives among the Christians. The test of the gospels,though it was probably tampered with during this period, was not destroyed, andJesus of Nazareth, in his own manifest inimitable greatness, still taughtthrough that text. Nor did these unhappy quarrels prevent Christianity frommaintaining a united front against gladiatorial shows and against the degradingworship of idols and of the god-Cæsar.§ 6So far as it challenged the divinity of Cæsar and the characteristicinstitutions of the empire, Christianity is to be regarded as a rebellious anddisintegrating movement, and so it was regarded by most of the emperors beforeConstantine the Great. It encountered considerable hostility, and at lastsystematic attempts to suppress it. Decius was the first emperor to organize anofficial persecution, and the great era of the martyrs was in the time ofDiocletian (303 and following years). The persecution of Diocletian was indeedthe crowning struggle of the old idea of the god-emperor against the alreadygreat and powerful organization that denied his divinity. Diocletian hadreorganized the monarchy upon lines of extreme absolutism; he had abolished thelast vestiges of republican institutions; he was the first emperor to surroundhimself completely with the awe-inspiring etiquette of an eastern monarch. Hewas forced by the logic of his assumptions to attempt the complete eradicationof a system that flatly denied them. The test in the persecution was that theChristian was required to offer sacrifice to the emperor.“Though Diocletian, still averse to the effusion of blood, had moderated thefury of Galerius, who proposed that everyone refusing to offer sacrifice shouldimmediately be burnt alive, the penalties inflicted on the obstinacy of theChristians might be deemed sufficiently rigorous and effectual. It was enactedthat their churches, in all the provinces of the empire, should be demolished totheir foundations; and the punishment of death was denounced against all whoshould presume to hold any secret assemblies for the purpose of religiousworship. The philosophers, who now assumed the unworthy office of directing theblind zeal of persecution, had diligently studied the nature and genius of theChristian religion; and as they were not ignorant that the speculative doctrinesof the faith were supposed to be contained in the writings of the prophets, ofthe evangelists, and of the apostles, they most probably suggested the orderthat the bishops and presbyters should deliver all their sacred books into thehands of the magistrates, who were commanded, under the severest penalties, toburn them in a public and solemn manner. By the same edict, the property of thechurch was at once confiscated; and the several parts of which it might consistwere either sold to the highest bidder, united to the imperial domain, bestowedon the cities or corporations, or granted to the solicitations of rapaciouscourtiers. After taking such effectual measures to abolish the worship, and todissolve the government of the Christians, it was thought necessary to subjectto the most intolerable hardships the condition of those perverse individualswho should still reject the religion of nature, of Rome, and of their ancestors.Persons of a liberal birth were declared incapable of holding any honours oremployments; slaves were for ever deprived of the hopes of freedom; and thewhole body of the Christians were put out of the protection of the law. Thejudges were authorized to hear and to determine every action that was broughtagainst a Christian; but the Christians were not permitted to complain of anyinjury which they themselves had suffered; and those unfortunate sectaries wereexposed to the severity, while they were excluded from the benefits, of publicjustice. . . . This edict was scarcely exhibited to the public view, in the mostconspicuous place in Nicomedia, before it was torn down by the hands of aChristian, who expressed at the same time, by the bitterest of invectives, hiscontempt as well as abhorrence for such impious and tyrannical governors. Hisoffence, according to the mildest laws, amounted to treason, and deserved death,and if it be true that he was a person of rank and education, thosecircumstances could serve only to aggravate his guilt. He was burnt, or ratherroasted, by a slow fire; and his executioners, zealous to revenge the personalinsult which had been offered to the emperors, exhausted every refinement ofcruelty without being able to subdue his patience, or to alter the steady andinsulting smile which in his dying agonies he still preserved in hiscountenance.”11 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en11]So with the death of this unnamed martyr the great persecution opened. But, asGibbon points out, our information as to its severity is of very doubtful value.He estimates the total of victims as about two thousand, and contrasts this withthe known multitudes of Christians martyred by their fellow-Christians duringthe period of the Reformation. Gibbon was strongly prejudiced againstChristianity, and here he seems disposed to minimize the fortitude andsufferings of the Christians. In many provinces, no doubt, there must have beena great reluctance to enforce the edict. But there was a hunt for the copies ofHoly Writ, and in many places a systematic destruction of Christian churches.There were tortures and executions, as well as a great crowding of the gaolswith Christian presbyters and bishops. We have to remember that the Christiancommunity was now a very considerable element of the population, and that aninfluential proportion of the officials charged with the execution of the edictwere themselves of the proscribed faith. Gelerius, who was in control of theeastern provinces, was among the most vigorous of the persecutors, but in theend, on his death bed (371), he realized the futility of his attacks upon thishuge community, and granted toleration in an edict, the gist of which Gibbontranslates as follows:—“Among the important cares which have occupied our mind for the utility andpreservation of the empire, it was our intention to correct and re-establish allthings according to the ancient laws and public discipline of the Romans. Wewere particularly desirous of reclaiming into the way of reason and nature thedeluded Christians who had renounced the religion and ceremonies instituted bytheir fathers; and presumptuously despising the practice of antiquity, hadinvented extravagant laws and opinions according to the dictates of their fancy,and had collected a various society from the different provinces of our empire.The edicts which we have published to enforce the worship of the gods havingexposed many of the Christians to danger and distress, many having suffereddeath, and many more who still persist in their impious folly, being leftdestitute of any public exercise of religion, we are disposed to extend to thoseunhappy men the effects of our wonted clemency. We permit them, therefore,freely to profess their private opinions and to assemble in their conventicleswithout fear or molestation, provided always that they preserve a due respect tothe established laws and government. By another rescript we shall signify ourintentions to the judges and magistrates; and we hope that our indulgence willengage the Christians to offer up their prayers to the deity whom they adore,for our safety and prosperity, for their own, and for that of the republic.”In a few years Constantine the Great was reigning, first as associated emperor(312) and then as the sole ruler (324), and the severer trials of Christianitywere over. If Christianity was a rebellious and destructive force towards apagan Rome, it was a unifying and organizing force within its own communion.This fact the genius of Constantine grasped. The spirit of Jesus, for all thedoctrinal dissensions that prevailed, made a great freemasonry throughout andeven beyond the limits of the empire. The faith was spreading among thebarbarians beyond the border; it had extended into Persia and Central Asia. Itprovided the only hope of moral solidarity he could discern in the great welterof narrow views and self-seeking over which he had to rule. It, and it alone,had the facilities for organizing will, for the need of which the empire wasfalling to pieces like a piece of rotten cloth. In 312 Constantine had to fightfor Rome and his position against Maxentius. He put the Christian monogram uponthe shields and banners of his troops and claimed that the God of the Christianshad fought for him in his complete victory at the battle of the Milvian Bridgejust outside Rome. By this act he renounced all those pretensions to divinitythat the vanity of Alexander the Great had first brought into the western world,and with the applause and enthusiastic support of the Christians he establishedhimself as a monarch more absolute even than Diocletian.In a few years’ time Christianity had become the official religion of theempire, and in A.D. 337 Constantine upon his death-bed was baptized as aChristian.§ 7The figure of Constantine the Great is at least as cardinal in history as thatof Alexander the Great or Augustus Cæsar. We know very little of his personalityor of his private life; no Plutarch, no Suetonius, has preserved any intimateand living details about him. Abuse we have of him from his enemies, and muchobviously fulsome panegyric to set against it; but none of these writers give usa living character of him; he is a party symbol for them, a partisan flag. It isstated by the hostile Zosimus that, like Sargon I, he was of illegitimate birth;his father was a distinguished general and his mother, Helena, an inkeeper’sdaughter of Nish in Serbia. Gibbon, however, is of opinion that there was avalid marriage. In any case it was a lowly marriage, and the personal genius ofConstantine prevailed against serious disadvantages. He was comparativelyilliterate, he knew little or no Greek. It appears to be true that he banishedhis eldest son Crispus, and caused him to be executed at the instigation of theyoung man’s stepmother, Fausta; and it is also recorded that he was afterwardsconvinced of the innocence of Crispus, and caused Fausta to beexecuted—according to one account by being boiled to death in her bath, andaccording to another by being exposed naked to wild beasts on a desolatemountain—while there is also very satisfactory documentary evidence that shesurvived him. If she was executed, the fact remains that her three sons,together with two nephews, became the appointed heirs of Constantine. Clearlythere is nothing solid to be got from this libellous tangle, and such soufflé asis possible with these scanty materials is to be found admirably done by Gibbon(chap. xviii.). Gibbon, because of his anti-Christian animus, is hostile toConstantine; but he admits that he was temperate and chaste. He accuses him ofprodigality because of his great public buildings, and of being vain anddissolute (!) because in his old age he wore a wig—Gibbon wore his own hair tiedwith a becoming black bow —and a diadem and magnificent robes. But all the lateremperors after Diocletian wore diadems and magnificent robes.Yet if the personality of Constantine the Great remains phantom-like, if theparticulars of his domestic life reveal nothing but a vague tragedy, we canstill guess at much that was in his mind. It must, in the closing years of hislife, have been a very lonely mind. He was more of an autocrat than any previousemperor had been—that is to say, he had less counsel and help. No class ofpublic-spirited and trustworthy men remained; no senate nor council shared anddeveloped his schemes. How much he apprehended the geographical weakness of theempire, how far he saw the complete disaster that was now so near, we can onlyguess. He made his real capital at Nicomedia in Bithynia; Constantinople acrossthe Bosphorus was still being built when he died. Like Diocletian, he seems tohave realized the broken-backed outline of his dominions, and to haveconcentrated his attention on foreign affairs and more particularly on theaffairs of Hungary, South Russia, and the Black Sea. He reorganized all theofficial machinery of the empire; he gave it a new constitution and sought toestablish a dynasty. He was a restless remaker of things; the social confusionhe tried to fix by assisting in the development of a caste system. This wasfollowing up the work of his great predecessor, Diocletian. He tried to make acaste of the peasants and small cultivators, and to restrict them from movingfrom their holdings. In fact he sought to make them serfs. The supply of slavelabour had fallen off because the empire was no longer an invading but aninvaded power; he turned to serfdom as the remedy. His creative effortsnecessitated unprecedentedly heavy taxation. All these things point to a lonelyand forcible mind. It is in his manifest understanding of the need of someunifying moral force if the empire was to hold together that his claim tooriginality lies.It was only after he had turned to Christianity that he seems to have realizedthe fierce dissensions of the theologians. He made a great effort to reconcilethese differences in order to have one uniform and harmonious teaching in thecommunity, and at his initiative a general council of the Church was held atNicæa, a town near Nicomedia and over against Constantinople, in 325. Eusebiusgives a curious account of this strange gathering, over which the Emperor,although he was not yet a baptized Christian, presided. It was not his firstcouncil of the Church, for he had already (in 313) presided over a council atArles. He sat in the midst of the council of Nicæa upon a golden throne, and ashe had little Greek, we must suppose he was reduced to watching the countenancesand gestures of the debaters, and listening to their intonations. The councilwas a stormy one. When old Arius rose to speak, one Nicholas of Myra struck himin the face, and afterwards many ran out, thrusting their fingers into theirears in affected horror at the old man’s heresies. One is tempted to imagine thegreat Emperor, deeply anxious for the soul of his empire, firmly resolved to endthese divisions, bending towards his interpreters to ask them the meaning of theuproar.The views that prevailed at Nicæa are embodied in the Nicene Creed, a strictlyTrinitarian statement, and the Emperor sustained the Trinitarian position. Butafterwards, when Athanasius bore too hardly upon the Arians, he had him banishedfrom Alexandria; and when the church at Alexandria would have excommunicatedArius, he obliged it to readmit him to communion.§ 8This date 325 A.D. is a very convenient date in our history. It is the date ofthe first complete general (“œcumenical”) council of the entire Christian world.(That at Arles we have mentioned had been a gathering of only the western half.)It marks the definite entry upon the stage of human affairs of the Christianchurch and of Christianity as it is generally understood in the world today. Itmarks the exact definition of Christian teaching by the Nicene Creed.It is necessary that we should recall the reader’s attention to the profounddifferences between this fully developed Christianity of Nicæa and the teachingof Jesus of Nazareth. All Christians hold that the latter is completelycontained in the former, but that is a question outside our province. What isclearly apparent is that the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth was a propheticteaching of the new type that began with the Hebrew prophets. It was notpriestly, it had no consecrated temple and no altar. It had no rites andceremonies. Its sacrifice was “a broken and a contrite heart.” Its onlyorganization was an organization of preachers, and its chief function was thesermon. But the fully fledged Christianity of the fourth century, though itpreserved as its nucleus the teachings of Jesus in the gospels, was mainly apriestly religion of a type already familiar to the world for thousand of years.The centre of its elaborate ritual was an altar, and the essential act ofworship the sacrifice, by a consecrated priest, of the mass. And it had arapidly developing organization of deacons, priests, and bishops.But if Christianity had taken on an extraordinary outward resemblance to thecults of Serapis, Ammon, or Bel-Marduk, we must remember that even itspriestcraft had certain novel features. Nowhere did it possess any quasi-divineimage of God. There was no head temple containing the god, because God waseverywhere. There was no holy of holies. Its widespread altars were alladdressed to the unseen universal Trinity. Even in its most archaic aspectsthere was in Christianity something new.A very important thing for us to note is the rôle played by the Emperor in thefixation of Christianity. Not only was the council of Nicæa assembled byConstantine the Great, but all the great councils, the two at Constantinople(381 and 553), Ephesus (431), and Chalcedon (451), were called together by theimperial power. And it is very manifest that in much of the history ofChristianity at this time the spirit of Constantine the Great is as evident as,or more evident, than the spirit of Jesus. He was, we have said, a pureautocrat. The last vestiges of Roman republicanism had vanished in the days ofAurelian and Diocletian. To the best of his lights he was trying to remake thecrazy empire while there was yet time, and he worked without any councillors,any public opinion, or any sense of the need of such aids and checks. The ideaof stamping out all controversy and division, stamping out all thought, byimposing one dogmatic creed upon all believers, is an altogether autocraticidea, it is the idea of the single-handed man who feels that to work at all hemust be free from opposition and criticism. The history of the Church under hisinfluence becomes now therefore a history of the violent struggles that werebound to follow upon his sudden and rough summons to unanimity. From him theChurch acquired the disposition to be authoritative and unquestioned, to developa centralized organization and run parallel to the empire.A second great autocrat who presently contributed to the stamping upon CatholicChristianity of a distinctly authoritative character was Theodosius I,Theodosius the Great (379-395). He forbade the unorthodox to hold meetings,handed over all churches to the Trinitarians, and overthrew the heathen temples,throughout the empire, and in 390 he caused the great statue of Serapis atAlexandria to be destroyed. There was to be no rivalry, no qualification to therigid unity of the Church.Here we cannot tell of the vast internal troubles of the Church, itsindigestions of heresy; of Arians and Paulicians, of Gnostics and Manicheans.Had it been less authoritative and more tolerant of intellectual variety, itmight perhaps have been a still more powerful body than it became. But, in spiteof all these disorders, it did for some time maintain a conception of humanunity more intimate and far wider than was ever achieved before. By the fifthcentury Christendom was already becoming greater, sturdier, and more enduringthan any empire had ever been, because it was something not merely imposed uponmen, but interwoven with the texture of their minds. It reached out far beyondthe utmost limits of the empire, into Armenia, Persia, Abyssinia, Ireland,Germany, India, and Turkestan. “Though made up of widely scatteredcongregations, it was thought of as one body of Christ, one people of God. Thisideal unity found expression in many ways. Intercommunication between thevarious Christian communities was very active. Christians upon a journey werealways sure of a warm welcome and hospitable entertainment from theirfellow-disciples. Messengers and letters were sent freely from one church toanother. Missionaries and evangelists went continually from place to place.Documents of various kinds, including gospels and apostolic epistles, circulatedwidely. Thus in various ways the feeling of unity found expression, and thedevelopment of widely separated parts of Christendom conformed more or lessclosely to a common type.”12 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en12]Christendom retained at least the formal tradition of this general unity ofspirit until 1054, when the Latin-speaking Western church and the main andoriginal Greek-speaking church, the “Orthodox” church, severed themselves fromone another, ostensibly upon the question of adding two words to the creed. Theolder creed had declared that the “Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father.” TheLatins wanted to add, and did add “Filioque” (== and from the son), and placedthe Greeks out of their communion because they would not follow this lead. Butalready as early as the fifth century the Christians in Eastern Syria, Persia,Central Asia—there were churches at Merv, Herat, and Samarkand—and India haddetached themselves on a similar score. These extremely interesting AsiaticChristians are known in history as the Nestorian Church, and their influenceextended into China. The Egyptian and Abyssinian churches also detachedthemselves very early upon similarly inexplicable points. Long before thisformal separation of the Latin and Greek-speaking halves of the main church,however, there was a practical separation following upon the breaking up of theempire. Their conditions diverged from the first. While the Greek-speakingEastern Empire held together and the emperor at Constantinople remained dominantin the Church, the Latin half of the empire, as we have already told, collapsed,and left the Church free of any such imperial control. Moreover, whileecclesiastical authority in the empire of Constantinople was divided between thehigh-bishops, or patriarchs, of Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, andJerusalem, authority in the West was concentrated in the Patriarch, or Pope, ofRome. The Bishop of Rome had always been recognized as first among thepatriarchs, and all these things conspired to justify exceptional pretensionsupon his part to a quasi-imperial authority. With the final fall of the WesternEmpire, he took over the ancient title of pontifex maximus which the emperorshad held, and so became the supreme sacrificial priest of the Roman tradition.Over the Christians of the West his supremacy was fully recognized, but from thebeginning it had to be urged with discretion within the dominions of the Easternemperor and the jurisdictions of the other four patriarchs.Ideas of worldly rule by the Church were already prevalent in the fourthcentury. St. Augustine, a citizen of Hippo in North Africa, who wrote between354 and 430, gave expression to the developing political ideas of the Church inhis book The City of God. The City of God leads the mind very directly towardsthe possibility of making the world into a theological and organized Kingdom ofHeaven. The city, as Augustine puts it, is “a spiritual society of thepredestined faithful,” but the step from that to a political application was nota very wide one. The Church was to be the ruler of the world over all nations,the divinely led ruling power over a great league of terrestrial states. Inlater years these ideas developed into a definite political theory and policy.As the barbarian races settled and became Christian, the Pope began to claim anoverlordship of their kings. In a few centuries the Pope had become in theory,and to a certain extent in practice, the high priest, censor, judge, and divinemonarch of Christendom; his influence extended in the west far beyond the utmostrange of the old empire, to Ireland, Norway and Sweden, and over all Germany.For more than a thousand years this idea of the unity of Christendom, ofChristendom as a sort of vast Amphictyony, whose members even in war time wererestrained from many extremities by the idea of a common brotherhood and acommon loyalty to the Church, dominated Europe. The history of Europe from thefifth century onward to the fifteenth is very largely the history of the failureof this great idea of a divine world government to realize itself in practice.§ 9We have already given an account in the previous chapter of the chief irruptionsof the barbarian races. We may now, with the help of a map, make a brief reviewof the political divisions of Europe at the close of the fifth century. Novestige of the Western Empire, the original Roman Empire, remained as a distinctand separate political division. Politically it was completely broken up. Overmany parts of Europe a sort of legendary overlordship of the Hellenic EasternEmpire as the Empire held its place in men’s minds. The emperor atConstantinople was, in theory at least, still emperor. In Britain, the quitebarbaric Teutonic Angles, Saxons and Jutes had conquered the eastern half ofEngland; in the west of the island the Britons still held out, but weregradually being forced back into Wales and Cornwall. The Anglo-Saxons seem tohave been among the most ruthless and effective of barbarian conquerors, for,wherever they prevailed, their language completely replaced the Keltic or Latinspeech—it is not certain which—used by the British. These Anglo-Saxons were asyet not Christianized. Most of Gaul, Holland, and the Rhineland was under thefairly vigorous, Christianized, and much more civilized kingdom of the Franks.But the Rhone valley was under the separate kingdom of the Burgundians. Spainand some of the south of France were under the rule of the Visigoths, but theSuevi were in possession of the north-west corner of the peninsula. Of theVandal kingdom in Africa we have already written; and Italy, still in itspopulation and habits Roman, came under the rule of the Ostrogoths. There was noemperor left in Rome; Theodoric I ruled there as the first of a line of Gothickings, and his rule extended across the Alps into Pannonia and down the Adriaticto Dalmatia and Serbia. To the east of the Gothic kingdom the emperors ofConstantinople ruled definitely. The Bulgars were still at this time a Mongoliantribe of horse-riding nomads in the region of the Volga; the Aryan Serbs hadrecently come southward to the shores of the Black Sea into the original home ofthe Visigoths; the Turko-Finnish Magyars were not yet in Europe. The Lombardswere as yet north of the Danube.The sixth century was marked by a phase of vigour on the part of the EasternEmpire under the Emperor Justinian (527-565). The Vandal kingdom was recoveredin 534; the Goths were expelled from Italy in 553. So soon as Justinian was dead(565), the Lombards descended into Italy and settled in Lombardy, but they leftRavenna, Rome, Southern Italy, and North Africa under the rule of the EasternEmpire.Such was the political condition of the world in which the idea of Christendomdeveloped. The daily life of that time was going on at a very low level indeedphysically, intellectually, and morally. It is frequently said that Europe inthe sixth and seventh centuries relapsed into barbarism, but that does notexpress the reality of the case. It is far more correct to say that thecivilization of the Roman empire had passed into a phase of extremedemoralization. Barbarism is a social order of an elementary type, orderlywithin its limits; but the state of Europe beneath its political fragmentationwas a social disorder. Its morale was not that of a kraal, but that of a slum.In a savage kraal a savage knows that he belongs to a community, and lives andacts accordingly; in a slum, the individual neither knows of nor acts inrelation to any greater being.Only very slowly and weakly did Christianity restore that lost sense ofcommunity and teach men to rally about the idea of Christendom. The social andeconomic structure of the Roman Empire was in ruins. That civilization had beena civilization of wealth and political power sustained by the limitation andslavery of the great mass of mankind. It had presented a spectacle of outwardsplendour and luxurious refinement, but beneath that brave outward show werecruelty, stupidity, and stagnation. It had to break down, it had to be removedbefore anything better could replace it.We have already called attention to its intellectual deadness. For threecenturies it had produced neither science nor literature of any importance. Itis only where men are to be found neither too rich and powerful to be temptedinto extravagant indulgences nor too poor and limited to care for anythingbeyond the daily need that those disinterested curiosities and serene impulsescan have play that give sane philosophy and science and great art to the world,and the plutocracy of Rome had made such a class impossible. When men and womenare unlimited and unrestrained, the evidence of history shows clearly that theyare all liable to become monsters of self-indulgence; when, on the other hand,they are driven and unhappy, then their impulse is towards immoderate tragicalresorts, towards wild revolts or towards the austerities and intensities ofreligion.It is not perhaps true to say that the world became miserable in these “darkages” to which we have now come; much nearer the truth is it to say that theviolent and vulgar fraud of Roman imperialism, that world of politicians,adventurers, landowners and financiers, collapsed into a sea of misery that wasalready there. Our histories of these times are very imperfect: there were fewplaces where men could write, and little encouragement to write at all; no onewas sure even of the safety of his manuscript or the possibility of its beingread. But we know enough to tell that this age was an age not merely of war androbbery, but of famine and pestilence. No effective sanitary organization hadyet come into the world, and the migrations of the time must have destroyedwhatever hygenic balance had been established. Attila’s ravages in North Italywere checked by an outbreak of fever in 452. There was a great epidemic ofbubonic plague towards the end of the reign of Justinian (565) which did much toweaken the defence of Italy against the Lombards. In 543 ten thousand people haddied in one day in Constantinople. (Gibbon says “each day.”) Plague was ragingin Rome in 590. The seventh century was also a plague-stricken century. TheEnglishman Bede, one of the few writers of the time, records pestilences inEngland in 664, 672, 678, and 683, no fewer than four in twenty years! Gibboncouples the Justinian epidemic with the great comet of 531, and with the veryfrequent and serious earthquakes of that reign. “Many cities of the east wereleft vacant, and in several districts of Italy the harvest and the vintagewithered on the ground.” He alleges “a visible decrease of the human specieswhich has never been made good in some of the fairest countries of the globe.”To many in those dark days it seemed that all learning and all that made lifeseemly and desirable was perishing.004 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_004_r1.gif]How far the common lot was unhappier under these conditions of squalor andinsecurity than it had been under the grinding order of the imperial system itis impossible to say. There was possibly much local variation, the rule ofviolent bullies here and a good-tempered freedom there, famine this year andplenty the next. If robbers abounded, tax-gatherers and creditors haddisappeared. Such kings as those of the Frankish and Gothic kingdoms were reallyphantom rulers to most of their so-called subjects; the life of each districtwent on at a low level, with little trade or travel. Greater or lesser areas ofcountryside would be dominated by some able person, claiming with more or lessjustice the title of lord or count or duke from the tradition of the laterempire or from the king. Such local nobles would assemble bands of retainers andbuild themselves strongholds. Often they adapted pre-existing buildings. TheColosseum at Rome, for example, the arena of many great gladiatorial shows, wasconverted into a fortress, and so was the amphitheatre at Arles. So also was thegreat tomb of Hadrian at Rome. In the decaying and now insanitary towns andcities shrunken bodies of artisans would hold together and serve the needs ofthe cultivating villages about them by their industry, placing themselves underthe protection of some adjacent noble.§ 10A very important share in the social recrystallization that went on in the sixthand seventh centuries after the breakdown and fusion of the fourth and fifth wastaken by the Christian monastic orders that were now arising in the Westernworld.Monasteries had existed in the world before Christianity. During the period ofsocial unhappiness among the Jews before the time of Jesus of Nazareth, therewas a sect of Essenes who lived apart in communities vowed to austere lives ofsolitude, purity, and self-denial. Buddhism, too, had developed its communitiesof men who withdrew from the general effort and commerce of the world to leadlives of austerity and contemplation. Indeed, the story of Buddha as we havetold it, shows that such ideas must have prevailed in India long before histime, and that at last he repudiated them. Quite early in the history ofChristianity there arose a similar movement away from the competition and heatand stress of the daily life of men. In Egypt, particularly, great numbers ofmen and women went out into the desert and there lived solitary lives of prayerand contemplation, living in absolute poverty in caves or under rocks, andsubsisting on the chance alms of those whom their holiness impressed. Such liveswould signify little to the historian, they are indeed of their very naturelives withdrawn from history, were it not for the turn this monastic tendencypresently took among the more energetic and practical Europeans.One of the central figures in the story of the development of monasticism inEurope is St. Benedict, who lived between 480 and 544. He was born at Spoleto inItaly, and he was a young man of good family and ability. The shadow of thetimes fell upon him, and, like Buddha, he took to the religious life and atfirst set no limit to his austerities. Fifty miles from Rome is Subiaco, andthere at the end of a gorge of the Anio, beneath a jungle growth of weeds andbushes, rose a deserted palace built by the Emperor Nero, overlooking anartificial lake that had been made in those days of departed prosperity bydamming back the waters of the river. Here, with a hair shirt as his chiefpossession, Benedict took up his quarters in a cave in the highsouthward-looking cliff that overhangs the stream, in so inaccessible a positionthat his food had to be lowered to him on a cord by a faithful admirer. Threeyears he lived here, and his fame spread as Buddha’s did nearly a thousand yearsbefore under similar circumstances.As in the case of Buddha, the story of Benedict has been overlaid by foolish andcredulous disciples with a mass of silly stories of miracles and manifestations.But presently we find him, no longer engaged in self-torment, but controlling agroup of twelve monasteries, and the resort of a great number of people. Youthsare brought to him to be educated, and the whole character of his life haschanged.From Subiaco he moved further southward to Monte Cassino, half-way between Romeand Naples, a lonely and beautiful mountain, in the midst of a great circle ofmajestice heights. Here, it is interesting to note that in the sixth centuryA.D. he found a temple of Apollo and a sacred grove and the countryside stillworshipping at this shrine. His first labours had to be missionary labours, andit was with difficulty that he persuaded the simple pagans to demolish theirtemple and cut down their grove. The establishment upon Monte Cassino became afamous and powerful centre within the lifetime of its founder. Mixed up with theimbecile inventions of marvel-loving monks about demons exorcised, discipleswalking on the water, and dead children restored to life, we can still detectsomething of the real spirit of Benedict. Particularly significant are thestories that represent him as discouraging extreme mortification. He sent adamping message to a solitary who had invented a new degree in saintliness bychaining himself to a rock in a narrow cave. “Break thy chain,” said Benedict,“for the true servant of God is chained not to rocks by iron, but torighteousness by Christ.”And next to the discouragement of solitary self-torture it is Benedict’sdistinction that he insisted upon hard work. Through the legends shines theclear indication of the trouble made by his patrician students and disciples whofound themselves obliged to toil instead of leading lives of leisurely austerityunder the ministrations of the lower class brethren. A third remarkable thingabout Benedict was his political influence. He set himself to reconcile Gothsand Italians, and it is clear that Totila, his Gothic king, came to him forcounsel and was greatly influenced by him. When Totila retook Naples from theGreeks, the Goths protected the women from insult and treated even the capturedsoldiers with humanity. When Belisarius, Justinian’s general, had taken the sameplace ten years previously, he had celebrated his triumph by a general massacre.Now the monastic organization of Benedict was a very great beginning in thewestern world. One of his prominent followers was Pope Gregory the Great(540-604), the first monk to become pope (590); he was one of the most capableand energetic of the popes, sending successful missions to the unconverted, andparticularly to the Anglo-Saxons. He ruled in Rome like an independent king,organizing armies, making treaties. To his influence is due the imposition ofthe Benedictine rule upon nearly the whole of Latin monasticism.Closely associated with these two names in the development of a civilizingmonasticism out of the merely egotistic mortifications of the early recluses isthat of Cassiodorus (490-585). He was evidently much senior to Pope Gregory, andyounger by ten years than Benedict, and, like these two, he belonged to apatrician family, a Syrian family settled in Italy. He had a considerableofficial career under the Gothic kings; and when, between 545 and 553, theoverthrow of those kings and the great pestilence paved the way for the newbarbaric rule of the Lombards, he took refuge in a monastic career. He founded amonastery upon his private estates, and set the monks he gathered to work inquite the Benedictine fashion, though whether his monks actually followed theBenedictine rule that was being formulated about the same time from MonteCassino we do not know. But there can be no question of his influence upon thedevelopment of this great working, teaching, and studying order. It is evidentthat he was profoundly impressed by the universal decay of education and thepossible loss of all learning and of the ancient literature by the world; andfrom the first he directed his brethren to the task of preserving and restoringthese things. He collected ancient MSS. and caused them to be copied. He madesundials, water clocks, and similar apparatus, a little last gleam ofexperimental science in the gathering darkness. He wrote a history of the Gothickings, and, what is more significant of his sense of the needs of the time, heproduced a series of school books on the liberal arts and a grammar. Probablyhis influence was even greater than that of St. Benedict in making monasticisminto a powerful instrument for the restoration of social order in the Westernworld.The spread of monasteries of the Benedictine order or type in the seventh andeighth centuries was very considerable. Everywhere we find them as centres oflight, restoring, maintaining, and raising the standard of cultivation,preserving some sort of elementary education, spreading useful arts, multiplyingand storing books, and keeping before the eyes of the world the spectacle andexample of a social backbone. For eight centuries thenceforth the Europeanmonastic system remained a system of patches and fibres of enlightenment in whatmight otherwise have been a wholly chaotic world. Closely associated with theBenedictine monasteries were the schools that grew presently into the mediævaluniversities. The schools of the Roman world had been altogether swept away inthe general social breakdown. There was a time when very few priests in Britainor Gaul could read the gospel or their service books. Only gradually wasteaching restored to the world. But when it was restored, it came back not asthe duty work of a learned slave, but as the religious service of a specialclass of devoted men.In the east also there was a breach of educational continuity, but there thecause was not so much social disorder as religious intolerance, and the breakwas by no means so complete. Justinian closed and dispersed the schools ofAthens (529), but he did this very largely in order to destroy a rival to thenew school he was setting up in Constantinople, which was more directly underimperial control. Since the new Latin learning of the developing westernuniversities had no text-books and literature of its own, it had, in spite ofits strong theological bias to the contrary, to depend very largely upon theLatin classics and the Latin translations of the Greek literature. It wasobliged to preserve far more of that splendid literature than it had a mind todo."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IISEVEN CENTURIES IN ASIA (CIRCA 50 B.C. TO A.D. 650)§ 1. Justinian the Great. § 2.

The Travels of Yuan Chwang.§ 1IN the preceding two chapters we have concentrated our attention chiefly on thecollapse in the comparatively short space of four centuries of the political andsocial order of the western part of the great Roman Empire of Cæsar and Trajan.We have dwelt upon the completeness of that collapse. To any intelligent andpublic-spirited mind living in the time and under the circumstances of St.Benedict or Cassiodorus, it must have seemed, indeed, as if the light ofcivilization was waning and near extinction. But with the longer views a studyof universal history gives us, we can view those centuries of shadow as a phase,and probably a necessary phase, in the onward march of social and politicalideas and understandings. And if, during that time, a dark sense of calamityrested upon Western Europe, we must remember that over large portions of theworld there was no retrogression.With their Western prepossessions European writers are much too prone tounderrate the tenacity of the Eastern empire that centred upon Constantinople.This empire embodied a tradition much more ancient than that of Rome. If thereader will look at the map we have given of its extent in the sixth century,and if he will reflect that its official language had then become Greek, he willrealize that what we are dealing with here is only nominally a branch of theRoman Empire; it is really the Hellenic Empire of which Herodotus dreamt andwhich Alexander the Great founded. True it called itself Roman and its people“Romans,” and to this day modern Greek is called “Romaic.” True also thatConstantine the Great knew no Greek and that Justinian’s accent was bad. Thesesuperficialities of name and form cannot alter the fact that the empire was inreality Hellenic, with a past of six centuries at the time of Constantine theGreat, and that while the real Roman Empire crumpled up completely in fourcenturies, this Hellenic “Roman Empire” held out for more than eleven—from 312,the beginning of the reign of Constantine the Great, to 1453, whenConstantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks.And while we have had to tell of something like a complete social collapse inthe west, there were no such equivalent breakdowns in the east. Towns and citiesflourished, the countryside was well cultivated, trade went on. For manycenturies Constantinople was the greatest and richest city in the world. We willnot trouble ourselves here with the names and follies, the crimes and intrigues,of its tale of emperors. As with most monarchs of great states, they did notguide their empire; they were carried by it. We have already dealt at somelength with Constantine the Great (312-337), we have mentioned Theodosius theGreat (379-395), who for a little while reunited the empire, and Justinian I(527-565). Presently we shall tell something of Heraclius (610-641). Justinian,like Constantine, may have had Slav blood in his veins. He was a man of greatambition and great organizing power, and he had the good fortune to be marriedto a woman of equal or greater ability, the Empress Theodora, who had in heryouth been an actress of doubtful reputation. But his ambitious attempts torestore the ancient greatness of the empire probably overtaxed its resources. Aswe have told, he reconquered the African province from the Vandals and most ofItaly from the Goths. He also recovered the South of Spain. He built the greatand beautiful church of Sancta Sophia in Constantinople, founded a university,and codified the law.1 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en13] Butagainst this we must set his closing of the schools of Athens. Meanwhile a greatplague swept the world, and at his death this renewed and expanded empire of hiscollapsed like a pricked bladder. The greater part of his Italian conquests waslost to the Lombards. Italy was indeed at that time almost a desert; the Lombardhistorians assert they came into an empty country. The Avars and Slavs struckdown from the Danube country towards the Adriatic, Slav populations establishingthemselves in what is now Serbia, Croatia, and Dalmatia, to become theYugo-Slavs of today. Moreover, a great and exhausting struggle began with theSassanid Empire in Persia.But before we say anything of this struggle, in which the Persians thrice camenear to taking Constantinople, and which was decided by a great Persian defeatat Nineveh (627), it is necessary to sketch very briefly the history of Persiafrom the Parthian days.§ 2We have already drawn a comparison between the brief four centuries of Romanimperialism and the obstinate vitality of the imperialism of theEuphrates-Tigris country. We have glanced very transitorily at the HellenizedBactrian and Seleucid monarchies that flourished in the eastern half ofAlexander’s area of conquest for three centuries, and told how the Parthianscame down into Mesopotamia in the last century B.C. We have described the battleof Carrhæ and the end of Crassus. Thereafter for two centuries and a half theParthian dynasty of the Arsacids ruled in the east and the Roman in the west,with Armenia and Syria between them, and the boundaries shifted east and west aseither side grew stronger. We have marked the utmost eastward extension of theRoman Empire under Trajan (see map to Vol. 1, Chap. XXVIII, § 3), and we havenoted that about the same time the Indo-Scythians (Vol. 1, Chap. XXVIII, § 4)poured down into India.In 227 occurred a revolution, and the Arsacid dynasty gave way to a morevigorous line, the Sassanid, a national Persian line under Ardashir I. In onerespect the empire of Ardashir I presented a curious parallelism with that ofConstantine the Great a hundred years later. Ardashir attempted to consolidateit by insisting upon religious unity, and adopted as the state religion the oldPersian faith of Zoroaster, of which we shall have more to say later.This new Sassanid Empire immediately became aggressive, and under Sapor I, theson and successor of Ardashir, took Antioch. We have already noted how theEmperor Valerian was defeated (260) and taken prisoner. But as Sapor wasretiring from a victorious march into Asia Minor, he was fallen upon anddefeated by Odenathus, the Arab king of a great desert-trading centre, Palmyra.For a brief time under Odenathus, and then under his widow Zenobia, Palmyra wasa considerable state, wedged between the two empires. Then it fell to theEmperor Aurelian, who carried off Zenobia in chains to grace his triumph at Rome(272).We will not attempt to trace the fluctuating fortunes of the Sassanids duringthe next three centuries. Throughout that time war between Persia and the empireof Constantinople wasted Asia Minor like a fever. Christianity spread widely andwas persecuted, for after the Christianization of Rome the Persian monarchremained the only god-monarch on earth, and he saw in Christianity merely thepropaganda of his Byzantine rival. Constantinople became the protector of theChristians and Persia of the Zoroastrians; in a treaty of 422, the one empireagreed to tolerate Zoroastrianism and the other Christianity. In 483, theChristians of the east split off from the Orthodox church and became theNestorian church; which, as we have already noted, spread its missionaries farand wide throughout Central and Eastern Asia. This separation from Europe, sinceit freed the Christian bishops of the east from the rule of the Byzantinepatriarchs, and so lifted from the Nestorian church the suspicion of politicaldisloyalty, led to a complete toleration of Christianity in Persia. WithChosroes I (531-579) came a last period of Sassanid vigour. He was thecontemporary and parallel of Justinian. He reformed taxation, restored theorthodox Zoroastrianism, extended his power into Southern Arabia (Yemen), whichhe rescued from the rule of Abyssinian Christians, pushed his northern frontierinto Western Turkestan, and carried on a series of wars with Justinian. Hisreputation as an enlightened ruler stood so high, that when Justinian closed theschools of Athens, the last Greek philosophers betook themselves to his court.They sought in him the philosopher king—that mirage which, as we have noted,Confucius and Plato had sought in their day. The philosophers found theatmosphere of orthodox Zoroastrianism even less to their taste than orthodoxChristianity, and in 549 Chosroes had the kindness to insert a clause in anarmistice with Justinian, permitting their return to Greece, and ensuring thatthey should not be molested for their pagan philosophy or their transitorypro-Persian behaviour.It is in connection with Chosroes that we hear now of a new Hunnish people inCentral Asia, the Turks, who are, we learn, first in alliance with him and thenwith Constantinople.Chosroes II (590-628), the grandson of Chosroes I, experienced extraordinaryfluctuations of fortune. At the outset of his career he achieved astonishingsuccesses against the empire of Constantinople. Three times (in 608, 615, and627) his armies reached Chalcedon, which is over against Constantinople; he tookAntioch, Damascus, and Jerusalem (614), and from Jerusalem he carried off across, said to be the true cross on which Jesus was crucified, to his capitalCtesiphon. (But some of this or some other true cross had already got to Rome.It had been brought from Jerusalem, it was said, by the “Empress Helena,” theidealized and canonized mother of Constantine, a story for which Gibbondisplayed small respect.2 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en14]) In619, Chosroes II conquered that facile country, Egypt. This career of conquestwas at last arrested by the Emperor Heraclius (610), who set about restoring theruined military power of Constantinople. For some time Heraclius avoided a greatbattle while he gathered his forces. He took the field in good earnest in 623.The Persians experienced a series of defeats culminating in the battle ofNineveh (627); but neither side had the strength for the complete defeat of theother. At the end of the struggle there was still an undefeated Persian armyupon the Bosphorus, although there were victorious Byzantine forces inMesopotamia. In 628 Chosroes II was deposed and murdered by his son. Anindecisive peace was concluded between the two exhausted empires a year or solater, restoring their old boundaries; and the true cross was sent back toHeraclius, who replaced it in Jerusalem with much pomp and ceremony.§ 3So we give briefly the leading events in the history of the Persian as of theByzantine Empire. What is more interesting for us and less easy to give are thechanges that went on in the lives of the general population of those greatempires during that time. The present writer can find little of a definitecharacter about the great pestilences that we know swept the world in the secondand sixth centuries of this era. Certainly they depleted population, andprobably they disorganized social order in these regions just as much as we knowthey did in the Roman and Chinese empires.The late Sir Mark Sykes, whose untimely death in Paris during the influenzaepidemic of 1919 was an irreparable loss to Great Britain, wrote in The Caliph’sLast Heritage a vivid review of the general life of Nearer Asia during theperiod we are considering. In the opening centuries of the present era, he says:“The direction of military administration and imperial finance became entirelydivorced in men’s minds from practical government; and notwithstanding thevilest tyranny of sots, drunkards, tyrants, lunatics, savages, and abandonedwomen, who from time to time held the reins of government, Mesopotamia,Babylonia, and Syria contained enormous populations, huge canals and dykes werekept in repair, and commerce and architecture flourished, in spite of aperpetual procession of hostile armies and a continual changing of thenationality of the governor. Each peasant’s interest was centred in his rulingtown; each citizen’s interest was in the progress and prosperity of his city;and the advent of an enemy’s army may have sometimes been looked on even withsatisfaction, if his victory was assured and the payment of his contracts amatter of certainty.005 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_005_r1.gif]“A raid from the north,3 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en15] onthe other hand, must have been a matter for dread. Then the villagers had needto take refuge behind the walls of the cities, from whence they could descry thesmoke which told of the wreck and damage caused by the nomads. So long, however,as the canals were not destroyed (and, indeed, they were built with suchsolidity and caution that their safety was assured), no irreparable damage couldbe effected. . . .“In Armenia and Pontus the condition of life was quite otherwise. These weremountain districts, containing fierce tribes headed by powerful native nobilityunder recognized ruling kings, while in the valleys and plains the peacefulcultivator provided the necessary economic resources. . . . Cilicia andCappadocia were now thoroughly subject to Greek influence, and containednumerous wealthy and highly civilized towns, besides possessing a considerablemerchant marine. Passing from Cilicia to the Hellespont, the whole Mediterraneancoast was crowded with wealthy cities and Greek colonies, entirely cosmopolitanin thought and speech, with those municipal and local ambitions which seemnatural to the Grecian character. The Grecian Zone extended from Caria to theBosphorus, and followed the coast as far as Sinope on the Black Sea, where itgradually faded away.“Syria was broken up into a curious quilt-like pattern of principalities andmunicipal kingdoms; beginning with the almost barbarous states of Commagene andEdessa (Urfa) in the north. South of these stood Bambyce, with its huge templesand priestly governors. Towards the coast a dense population in villages andtowns clustered around the independent cities of Antioch, Apamea, and Emesa(Homs); while out in the wilderness the great Semitic merchant city of Palmyrawas gaining wealth and greatness as the neutral trading-ground between Parthiaand Rome. Between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon we find, at the height of itsglory, Heliopolis (Baalbek), the battered fragments of which even now commandour admiration. . . . Bending in towards Galilee we find the wondrous cities ofGerasa and Philadelphia (Amman) connected by solid roads of masonry andfurnished with gigantic aqueducts. . . . Syria is still so rich in ruins andremains of the period that it is not difficult to picture to oneself the natureof its civilization. The arts of Greece, imported long before, had beendeveloped into magnificence that bordered on vulgarity. The richness ofornamentation, the lavish expense, the flaunting wealth, all tell that thetastes of the voluptuous and artistic Semites were then as now. I have stood inthe colonnades of Palmyra and I have dined in the Hotel Cecil, and, save thatthe latter is built of iron, daubed with sham wood, sham stucco, sham gold, shamvelvet, and sham stone, the effect is identical. In Syria there were slaves insufficient quantity to make real buildings, but the artistic spirit is asdebased as anything made by machinery. Over against the cities the village folkmust have dwelt pretty much as they do now, in houses of mud and dry stone wall;while out in the distant pastures the Bedouin tended their flocks in freedomunder the rule of the Nabatean kings of their own race, or performed the officeof guardians and agents of the great trading caravans.006 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_006_r1.gif]“Beyond the herdsmen lay the parching deserts, which acted as the impenetrablebarrier and defence of the Parthian Empire behind the Euphrates, where stood thegreat cities of Ctesiphon, Seleucia, Hatra, Nisibin, Harran, and hundreds morewhose very names are forgotten. These great townships subsisted on the enormouscereal wealth of Mesopotamia, watered as it then was by canals, whose makers’names were even then already lost in the mists of antiquity. Babylon and Ninevehhad passed away; the successors of Persia and Macedon had given place toParthia; but the people and the cultivation were the same as when Cyrus theConqueror had first subdued the land. The language of many of the towns wasGreek, and the cultured citizens of Seleucia might criticize the philosophiesand tragedies of Athens; but the millions of the agricultural population knewpossibly no more of these things than does many an Essex peasant of today knowof what passes in the metropolis.”Compare with this the state of affairs at the end of the seventh century.“Syria was now an impoverished and stricken land, and her great cities, thoughstill populated, must have been encumbered with ruins which the public fundswere not sufficient to remove. Damascus and Jerusalem themselves had notrecovered from the effects of long and terrible sieges; Amman and Gerash haddeclined into wretched villages under the sway and lordship of the Bedouin. TheHauran, perhaps, still showed signs of the prosperity for which it had beennoted in the days of Trajan; but the wretched buildings and rude inscriptions ofthis date all point to a sad and depressing decline. Out in the desert, Palmyrastood empty and desolate save for a garrison in the castle. On the coasts and inthe Lebanon a shadow of the former business and wealth was still to be seen; butin the north, ruin, desolation, and abandonment must have been the common stateof the country, which had been raided with unfailing regularity for one hundredyears and had been held by an enemy for fifteen. Agriculture must have declined,and the population notably decreased through the plagues and distresses fromwhich it had suffered.“Cappadocia had insensibly sunk into barbarism; and the great basilicas andcities, which the rude countrymen could neither repair nor restore, had beenleveled with the ground. The Anatolian peninsula had been ploughed and harrowedby the Persian armies; the great cities had been plundered and sacked.”§ 4It was while Heraclius was engaged in restoring order in this already desolatedSyria after the death of Chosroes II and before the final peace with Persia,that a strange message was brought to him. The bearer had ridden over to theimperial outpost at Bostra in the wilderness south of Damascus. The letter wasin Arabic, the obscure Semitic language of the nomadic peoples of the southerndesert; and probably only an interpretation reached him—presumably withdeprecatory notes by the interpreter.It was an odd, florid challenge from someone who called himself “Muhammad, theProphet of God.” This Muhammad, it appeared, called upon Heraclius toacknowledge the one true God and to serve him. Nothing else was definite in thedocument.There is no record of the reception of this missive, and presumably it wentunanswered. The emperor probably shrugged his shoulders, and was faintly amusedat the incident.But at Ctesiphon they knew more about this Muhammad. He was said to be atiresome false prophet, who had incited Yemen, the rich province of SouthernArabia, to rebel against the King of Kings. Kavadh was much occupied withaffairs. He had deposed and murdered his father Chosroes II, and he wasattempting to reorganize the Persian military forces. To him also came a messageidentical with that sent to Heraclius. The thing angered them. He tore up theletter, flung the fragments at the envoy, and bade him begone.When this was told to the sender far away in the squalid little town of Medina,he was very angry. “Even so, O Lord!” he cried; “rend Thou his kingdom fromhim.” (A.D. 628.)§ 5But before we go on to tell of the rise of Islam in the world, it will be wellto complete our survey of the condition of Asia in the dawn of the seventhcentury. And a word or so is due to religious developments in the Persiancommunity during the Sassanid period.From the days of Cyrus onward Zoroastrianism had prevailed over the ancient godsof Nineveh and Babylon. Zoroaster (the Greek spelling of the Iranian“Zarathustra”), like Buddha, was an Aryan. We know nothing of the age in whichhe lived; some authorities make him as early as 1000 B.C., others make himcontemporary with Buddha or Confucius; and as little do we know of his place ofbirth or his exact nationality. His teachings are preserved to us in the ZendAvesta, but here, since they no longer play any great part in the world’saffairs, we cannot deal with them in any detail. The opposition of a good god,Ormuzd, the god of light, truth, frankness, and the sun, and a bad god, Ahriman,god of secrecy, cunning, diplomacy, darkness, and night, formed a very centralpart of his religion. As we find it in history, it is already surrounded by aceremonial and sacerdotal system; it has no images, but it has priests, temples,and altars, on which burn a sacred fire and at which sacrificial ceremonies areperformed. Among other distinctive features is its prohibition of either theburning or the burial of the dead. The Parsees of India, the last survivingZoroastrians, still lay their dead out within certain open towers, the Towers ofSilence, to which the vultures come.Under the Sassanid kings from Ardashir onward (227), this religion was theofficial religion; its head was the second person in the state next to the king,and the king in quite the ancient fashion was supposed to be divine orsemi-divine and upon terms of peculiar intimacy with Ormuzd.But the religious fermentation of the world did not leave the supremacy ofZoroastrianism undisputed in the Persian Empire. Not only was there a greateastward diffusion of Christianity, to which we have already given notice, butnew sects arose in Persia, incorporating the novel ideas of the time. One earlyvariant or branch of Zoroastrianism, Mithraism, we have already named. It hadspread into Europe by the first century B.C., after the eastern campaigns ofPompey the Great. It became enormously popular with the soldiers and commonpeople, and, until the time of Constantine the Great, continued to be a seriousrival to Christianity. Indeed, one of his successors, the Emperor Julian (361-363), known in Christian history as “Julian the Apostate,” made a belatedattempt to substitute it for the accepted faith. Mithras was a god of light,“proceeding” from Ormuzd and miraculously born, in much the same way that thethird person in the Christian Trinity proceeds from the first. Of this branch ofthe Zoroastrian stem we need say no more. In the third century A.D., however,another religion, Manichæism, arose, which deserves some notice now.Mani, the founder of Manichæism, was born the son of a good family of Ecbatana,the old Median capital (A.D. 216). He was educated at Ctesiphon. His father wassome sort of religious sectary, and he was brought up in an atmosphere ofreligious discussion. There came to him that persuasion that he at last had thecomplete light, which is the moving power of all religious initiators. He wasimpelled to proclaim his doctrine. In A.D. 242, at the accession of Sapor I, thesecond Sassanid monarch, he began his teaching.It is characteristic of the way in which men’s minds were moving in those daysthat his teaching included a sort of theocrasia. He was not, he declared,proclaiming anything new. The great religious founders before him had all beenright: Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus Christ—all had been true prophets, but tohim it was appointed to clarify and crown their imperfect and confused teaching.This he did in Zoroastrian language. He explains the perplexities andcontradictions of life as a conflict of light and darkness, Ormuzd was God andAhriman Satan. But how man was created, how he fell from light into darkness,how he is being disentangled and redeemed from the darkness, and of the partplayed by Jesus in this strange mixture of religions we cannot explain here evenif we would. Our interest with the system is historical and not theological.But of the utmost historical interest is the fact that Mani not only went aboutIran preaching these new and to him these finally satisfying ideas of his, butinto Turkestan, into India, and over the passes into China. This freedom oftravel is to be noted. It is interesting also because it brings before us thefact that Turkestan was no longer a country of dangerous nomads, but a countryin which cities were flourishing and men had the education and leisure fortheological argument. The ideas of Mani spread eastward and westward with greatrapidity, and they were a most fruitful rootstock of heresies throughout theentire Christian world for nearly a thousand years.Somewhen about A.D. 270 Mani came back to Ctesiphon and made many converts. Thisbrought him into conflict with the official religion and the priesthood. In 277the reigning monarch had him crucified and his body, for some unknown reason,flayed, and there began a fierce persecution of his adherents. Nevertheless,Manichæism held its own in Persia with Nestorian Christianity and orthodoxZoroastrianism (Mazdaism) for some centuries.§ 6It becomes fairly evident that in the fifth and sixth centuries A.D. not merelyPersia, but the regions that are now Turkestan and Afghanistan were far moreadvanced in civilization than were the French and English of that time. Theobscurity of the history of these regions has been lifted in the last twodecades, and a very considerable literature written in languages of the Turkishgroup has been discovered. These extant manuscripts date from the seventhcentury onward. The alphabet is an adaptation of the Syrian, introduced byManichæan missionaries, and many of the MSS. discovered—parchments have beenfound in windows in the place of glass—are as beautifully written as anyBenedictine production. Mixed up with a very extensive Manichæan literature aretranslations of the Christian scriptures and Buddhistic writings. Much of thisearly Turkish material still awaits examination.Everything points to the conclusion that those centuries, which were centuriesof disaster and retrogression in Europe, were comparatively an age of progressin Middle Asia eastward into China.A steady westward drift to the north of the Caspian of Hunnish peoples, who werenow called Tartars and Turks, was still going on in the sixth century, but itmust be thought of as an overflow rather than as a migration of whole peoples.The world from the Danube to the Chinese frontiers was still largely a nomadicworld, with towns and cities growing up upon the chief trade routes. We need nottell in any detail here of the constant clash of the Turkish peoples of WesternTurkestan with the Persians to the south of them, the agelong bickering ofTuranian and Iranian. We hear nothing of any great northward marches of thePersians, but there were great and memorable raids to the south both by theTuranians to the east and the Alans to the west of the Caspian before the bigseries of movements of the third and fourth century westward that carried theAlans and Huns into the heart of Europe. There was a nomadic drift to the eastof Persia and southward through Afghanistan towards India, as well as this driftto the north-west. These streams of nomads flowed by Persia on either side. Wehave already mentioned the Yue-Chi (Chap. xxviii, § 4), who finally descendedinto India as the Indo-Scythians in the second century. A backward, stillnomadic section of these Yue-Chi remained in Central Asia, and became numerousupon the steppes of Turkestan, as the Ephthalites or White Huns. After being anuisance and a danger to the Persians for three centuries, they finally beganraiding into India in the footsteps of their kinsmen about the year 470, about aquarter of a century after the death of Attila. They did not migrate into India;they went to and fro, looting in India and returning with their loot to theirown country, just as later the Huns established themselves in the great plain ofthe Danube and raided all Europe.The history of India during these seven centuries we are now reviewing ispunctuated by these two invasions of the Yue-Chi, the Indo-Scythians who, as wehave said, wiped out the last traces of Hellenic rule, and the Ephthalites.Before the former of these, the Indo-Scythians, a wave of uprooted populations,the Sakas, had been pushed; so that altogether India experienced three waves ofbarbaric invasion, about A.D. 100, about A.D. 120, and about A.D. 470. But onlythe second of these invasions was a permanent conquest and settlement. TheIndo-Scythians made their headquarters on the North-west Frontier and set up adynasty, the Kushan dynasty, which ruled most of North India as far east asBenares.007 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_007_r1.gif]The chief among these Kushan monarchs was Kanishka (date unknown), who added toNorth India Kashgar, Yarkand, and Khotan. Like Asoka, he was a great andvigorous promoter of Buddhism, and these conquests, this great empire of theNorth-west Frontier, must have brought India into close and frequent relationswith China and Tibet.We will not trouble to record here the divisions and coalescences of power inIndia, nor the dynasties that followed the Kushans, because these things signifyvery little to us from our present point of view. Sometimes all India was apatchwork quilt of states; sometimes such empires as that of the Guptasprevailed over great areas. These things made little difference in the ideas,the religion, and the ordinary way of life of the Indian peoples. Brahminismheld its own against Buddhism, and the two religions prospered side by side. Themass of the population was living then very much as it lives today; dressing,cultivating, and building its houses in much the same fashion.The irruption of the Ephthalites is memorable not so much because of itspermanent effects as because of the atrocities perpetrated by the invaders.These Ephthalites very closely resembled the Huns of Attila in their barbarism;they merely raided, they produced no such dynasty as the Kushan monarchy; andtheir chiefs retained their headquarters in Western Turkestan. Mihiragula, theirmost capable leader, has been called the Attila of India. One of his favouriteamusements, we are told, was the expensive one of rolling elephants downprecipitous places in order to watch their sufferings. His abominations rousedhis Indian tributary princes to revolt, and he was overthrown (528). But thefinal ending of the Ephthalite raids into India was effected not by Indians, butby the destruction of their central establishment of the Ephthalites on the Oxus(565) by the growing power of the Turks, working in alliance with the Persians.After this break-up, the Ephthalites dissolved very rapidly and completely intothe surrounding populations, much as the European Huns did after the death ofAttila a hundred years earlier. Nomads without central grazing lands mustdisperse; nothing else is possible. Some of the chief Rajput clans of today inRajputana in North India are descended, it is said, from these White Huns.§ 7These seven centuries which saw the beginning and the end of the emperors inRome and the complete breakdown and recasting of the social, economic,political, and religious life of Western Europe, saw also very profound changesin the Chinese world. It is too commonly assumed by both Chinese, Japanese, andEuropean historians, that the Han dynasty, under which we find China at thebeginning of this period, and the Tang dynasty, with which it closed, wereanalogous ascendancies controlling a practically similar empire, and that thefour centuries of division that elapsed between the end of the Han dynasty (220)and the beginning of the Tang period (619) were centuries of disturbance ratherthan essential change. The divisions of China are supposed to be merelypolitical and territorial; and, deceived by the fact that at the close as at thecommencement of these four centuries, China occupied much the same wide extentof Asia, and was still recognizably China, still with a common culture, a commonscript, and a common body of ideas, they ignore the very fundamental breakingdown and reconstruction that went on, and the many parallelisms to the Europeanexperience that China displayed.It is true that the social collapse was never so complete in the Chinese as inthe European world. There remained throughout the whole period considerableareas in which the elaboration of the arts of life could go on. There was nosuch complete deterioration in cleanliness, decoration, artistic and literaryproduction as we have to record in the West, and no such abandonment of anysearch for grace and pleasure. We note, for instance, that “tea” appeared in theworld, and its use spread throughout China. China began to drink tea in thesixth century A.D. And there were Chinese poets to write delightfully about theeffects of the first cup and the second cup and the third cup, and so on. Chinacontinued to produce beautiful paintings long after the fall of the Han rule. Inthe second, third, and fourth centuries some of the most lovely landscapes werepainted that have ever been done by men. A considerable production of beautifulvases and carvings also continued. Fine building and decoration went on.Printing from wood blocks began about the same time as tea-drinking, and withthe seventh century came a remarkable revival of poetry.Certain differences between the great empires of the East and West were all infavour of the stability of the former. China had no general coinage. The cashand credit system of the Western world, at once efficient and dangerous, had notstrained her economic life. Not that the monetary idea was unknown. For smalltransactions the various provinces were using perforated zinc and brass “cash,”but for larger there was nothing but stamped ingots of silver. This great empirewas still carrying on most of its business on a basis of barter like that whichprevailed in Babylon in the days of the Aramean merchants. And so it continuedto do to the dawn of the twentieth century.We have seen how under the Roman republic economic and social order wasdestroyed by the too great fluidity of property that money brought about. Moneybecame abstract, and lost touch with the real values it was supposed torepresent. Individuals and communities got preposterously into debt, and theworld was saddled by a class of rich men who were creditors, men who did nothandle and administer any real wealth, but who had the power to call up money.No such development of “finance” occurred in China. Wealth in China remainedreal and visible. And China had no need for any Licinian law, nor for a TiberiusGracchus. The idea of property in China did not extend far beyond tangiblethings. There was no “labour” slavery, no gang servitude.4[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en16] The occupier and user of theland was in most instances practically the owner of it, subject to a land tax.There was a certain amount of small scale landlordism, but no great estates.Landless men worked for wages paid mostly in kind—as they were in ancientBabylon.008 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_008_r1.gif]These things made for stability and the geographical form of China for unity;nevertheless, the vigour of the Han dynasty declined, and when at last at theclose of the second century A.D. the world catastrophe of the great pestilencestruck the system, the same pestilence that inaugurated a century of confusionin the Roman empire, the dynasty fell like a rotten tree before a gale. And thesame tendency to break up into a number of warring states, and the same eruptionof barbaric rulers, was displayed in East and West alike. In China, as in theWestern empire, faith had decayed. Mr. Fu ascribes much of the politicalnervelessness of China in this period to Epicureanism, arising, he thinks, outof the sceptical individualism of Lao Tse. This phase of division is known asthe “Three Kingdom Period.” The fourth century saw a dynasty of more or lesscivilized Huns established as rulers in the province of Shen-si. This Hunnishkingdom included not merely the north of China, but great areas of Siberia; itsdynasty absorbed the Chinese civilization, and its influence carried Chinesetrade and knowledge to the Arctic circle. Mr. Fu compares this Siberian monarchyto the empire of Charlemagne in Europe; it was the barbarian becoming “Chinized”as Charlemagne was a barbarian becoming Romanized. Out of a fusion of theseSiberian with native north Chinese elements arose the Suy dynasty, whichconquered the south. This Suy dynasty marks the beginning of a renascence ofChina. Under a Suy monarch the Lu-chu isles were annexed to China, and there wasa phase of great literary activity. The number of volumes at this time in theimperial library was increased, we are told, to 54,000. The dawn of the seventhcentury saw the beginning of the great Tang dynasty, which was to endure forthree centuries.The renascence of China that began with Suy and culminated in Tang was, Mr. Fuinsists, a real new birth. “The spirit,” he writes, “was a new one; it markedthe Tang civilization with entirely distinctive features. Four main factors hadbeen brought together and fused: (1) Chinese liberal culture; (2) Chineseclassicism; (3) Indian Buddhism; and (4) Northern bravery. A new China had comeinto being. The provincial system, the central administration, and the militaryorganization of the Tang dynasty were quite different from those of theirpredecessors. The arts had been much influenced and revivified by Indian andCentral Asiatic influences. The literature was no mere continuation of the old;it was a new production. The religious and philosophical schools of Buddhismwere fresh features. It was a period of substantial change.“It may be interesting to compare this making of China with the fate of theRoman Empire in her later days. As the Roman world was divided into the easternand western halves, so was the Chinese world into the southern and the northern.The barbarians in the case of Rome and in the case of China made similarinvasions. They established dominions of a similar sort. Charlemagne’s empirecorresponded to that of the Siberian dynasty (Later Wei), the temporary recoveryof the Western empire by Justinian corresponded to the temporary recovery of thenorth by Liu Yu. The Byzantine line corresponded to the southern dynasties. Butfrom this point the two worlds diverged. China recovered her unity; Europe hasstill to do so.”The dominions of the emperor, Tai-tsung (627), the second Tang monarch, extendedsouthward into Annam and westward to the Caspian sea. His southern frontier inthat direction marched with that of Persia. His northern ran along the Altaifrom the Kirghis steppe, north of the desert of Gobi. But it did not includeCorea, which was conquered and made tributary by his son. This Tang dynastycivilized and incorporated into the Chinese race the whole of the southwardpopulation, and just as the Chinese of the north call themselves the “men ofHan,” so the Chinese of the south call themselves the “men of Tang.” The law wascodified, the literary examination system was revised, and a complete andaccurate edition of all the Chinese classics was produced. To the court ofTai-tsung came an embassy from Byzantium, and, what is more significant, fromPersia came a company of Nestorian missionaries (635). These latter Tai-tsungreceived with great respect; he heard them state the chief articles of theircreed, and ordered the Christian scriptures to be translated into Chinese forhis further examination. In 638 he announced that he found the new religionentirely satisfactory, and that it might be preached within the empire. He alsoallowed the building of a church and the foundation of a monastery.A still more remarkable embassy also came to the court of Tai-tsung in the year628, five years earlier than the Nestorians. This was a party of Arabs, who cameby sea to Canton in a trading vessel from Yanbu, the port of Medina in Arabia.(Incidentally it is interesting to know that there were such vessels engaged inan east and west trade at this time.) These Arabs had been sent by that Muhammadwe have already mentioned, who styled himself “The Prophet of God,” and themessage they brought to Tai-tsung was probably identical with the summons whichwas sent in the same year to the Byzantine emperor Heraclius and to Kavadh inCtesiphon. But the Chinese monarch neither neglected the message as Heracliusdid, nor insulted the envoys after the fashion of the parricide Kavadh. Hereceived them well, expressed great interest in their theological views, andassisted them, it is said, to build a mosque for the Arab traders in Canton—amosque which survives to this day. It is one of the oldest mosques in the world.§ 8The urbanity, the culture, and the power of China under the early Tang rulersare in so vivid a contrast with the decay, disorder, and divisions of theWestern world, as at once to raise some of the most interesting questions in thehistory of civilization. Why did not China keep this great lead she had won byher rapid return to unity and order? Why does she not to this day dominate theworld culturally and politically?For a long time she certainly did keep ahead. It is only a thousand years later,in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the discovery of America, thespread of printed books and education in the West, and the dawn of modernscientific discovery, that we can say with confidence that the Western worldbegan to pull ahead of China. Under the Tang rule, her greatest period, and thenagain under the artistic but rather decadent Sung dynasty (960-1279), and againduring the period of the cultured Mings (1358-1644), China presented a spectacleof prosperity, happiness, and artistic activity far in front of any contemporarystate. And seeing that she achieved so much, why did she not achieve more?Chinese shipping was upon the seas, and there was a considerable overseas tradeduring that time.5 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en17] Why did theChinese never discover America or Australia? There was much isolatedobservation, ingenuity, and invention. The Chinese knew of gunpowder in thesixth century, they used coal and gas heating centuries before these things wereused in Europe; their bridge-building, their hydraulic engineering wasadmirable; the knowledge of materials shown in their enamel and lacquer ware isvery great. Why did they never organize the system of record and cooperation ininquiry that has given the world modern science? And why, in spite of theirgeneral training in good manners and self-restraint, did intellectual educationnever soak down into the general mass of the population? Why are the masses ofChina today, and why have they always been, in spite of an exceptionally highlevel of natural intelligence, illiterate?It is customary to meet such questions with rather platitudinous answers. We aretold that the Chinaman is the most conservative of human beings, that, incontrast with the European races, his mind is twisted round towards the past,that he is the willing slave of etiquette and precedent to a degreeinconceivable to Western minds. He is represented as having a mentality sodistinct that one might almost expect to find a difference in brain structure toexplain it. The appeals of Confucius to the wisdom of the ancients are alwaysquoted to clinch this suggestion.If, however, we examine this generalization more closely, it dissolves into thinair. The superior intellectual initiative, the liberal enterprise, theexperimental disposition that is supposed to characterize the Western mind, ismanifest in the history of that mind only during certain phases and underexceptional circumstances. For the rest, the Western world displays itself astraditional and conservative as China. And, on the other hand, the Chinese mindhas, under conditions of stimulus, shown itself quite as inventive and versatileas the European, and the very kindred Japanese mind even more so. For, take thecase of the Greeks, the whole swing of their mental vigour falls into the periodbetween the sixth century B.C. and the decay of the Alexandrian Museum under thelater Ptolemies in the second century B.C. There were Greeks before that timeand Greeks since, but a history of a thousand years of the Byzantine Empireshowed the Hellenic world at least as intellectually stagnant as China. Then wehave already drawn attention to the comparative sterility of the Italian mindduring the Roman period and its abundant fertility since the Renaissance oflearning. The English mind again had a phase of brightness in the seventh andeighth centuries, and it did not shine again until the fifteenth. Again, themind of the Arabs, as we shall presently tell, blazed out like a star for half adozen generations after the appearance of Islam, having never achieved anythingof importance before or since. On the other hand, there was always a great dealof scattered inventiveness in China, and the progress of Chinese art witnessesto new movements and vigorous innovations. We exaggerate the reverence of theChinese for their fathers; parricide was a far commoner crime among the Chineseemperors than it was even among the rulers of Persia. Moreover, there have beenseveral liberalizing movements in China, several recorded struggles against the“ancient ways.”It has already been suggested that phases of real intellectual progress in anycommunity seem to be connected with the existence of a detached class of men,sufficiently free not to be obliged to toil or worry exhaustively about mundaneneeds, and not rich and powerful enough to be tempted into extravagances oflust, display, or cruelty. They must have a sense of security, but not a conceitof superiority. This class, we have further insinuated, must be able to talkfreely and communicate easily. It must not be watched for heresy or persecutedfor any ideas it may express. Such a happy state of affairs certainly prevailedin Greece during its best days. A class of intelligent, free gentlefolk isindeed evident in history whenever there is a record of bold philosophy oreffective scientific advances.In the days of T’ang and Sung and Ming there must have been an abundance ofpleasantly circumstanced people in China of just the class that supplied most ofthe young men of the Academy at Athens, or the bright intelligences ofRenaissance Italy, or the members of the London Royal Society, that mothersociety of modern science; and yet China did not produce in these periods ofopportunity any such large beginnings of recorded and analyzed fact.If we reject the idea that there is some profound racial difference betweenChina and the West which makes the Chinese by nature conservative and the Westby nature progressive, then we are forced to look for the operating cause ofthis difference in progressiveness in some other direction. Many people aredisposed to find that operating cause which has, in spite of her originaladvantages, retarded China so greatly during the last four or five centuries, inthe imprisonment of the Chinese mind in a script and in an idiom of thought soelaborate and so difficult that the mental energy of the country has beenlargely consumed in acquiring it. This view deserves examination.We have already given an account in Chap. xvi of the peculiarities of Chinesewriting and of the Chinese language. The Japanese writing is derived from theChinese, and consists of a more rapidly written system of forms. A great numberof these forms are ideograms taken over from the Chinese and used exactly as theChinese ideograms are used, but also a number of signs are used to expresssyllables; there is a Japanese syllabary after the fashion of the Sumeriansyllabary we have described in Chap. xvi. The Japanese writing remains a clumsysystem, as clumsy as cuneiform, though not so clumsy as Chinese; and there hasbeen a movement in Japan to adopt a Western alphabet. Korea long ago went a stepfarther and developed a true alphabet from the same Chinese origins. With theseexceptions all the great writing systems now in use in the world are based onthe Mediterranean alphabets, and are beyond comparison more easily learnt andmastered than the Chinese. This means that while other peoples learn merely acomparatively simple and straightforward method of setting down the languagewith which they are familiar, the Chinaman has to master a great multitude ofcomplex word signs and word groups. He must not simply learn the signs, but theestablished grouping of those signs to represent various meanings. He mustfamiliarize himself, therefore, with a number of exemplary classical works.Consequently in China, while you will find great numbers of people who know thesignificance of certain frequent and familiar characters, you discover only afew whose knowledge is sufficiently extensive to grasp the meaning of anewspaper paragraph, and still fewer who can read any subtlety of intention orfine shades of meaning. In a lesser degree this is true also of Japan. No doubtEuropean readers, especially of such word-rich languages as English or Russian,vary greatly among themselves in regard to the extent of books they canunderstand and how far they understand them; their power varies according totheir vocabularies; but the corresponding levels of understanding among theChinese represent a far greater expenditure of time and labour upon theirattainment. A mandarin’s education in China is, mainly, learning to read.And it may be that the consequent preoccupation of the educated class during itsmost susceptible years upon the Chinese classics gave it a bias in favour ofthis traditional learning upon which it had spent so much time and energy. Fewmen who have toiled to build up any system of knowledge in their minds willwillingly scrap it in favour of something strange and new; this disposition isas characteristic of the West as of the East; it is shown as markedly by thescholars of the British and American universities as by any Chinese mandarins,and the British at the present time, in spite of the great and manifestadvantages in popular education and national propaganda the change would givethem, refuse to make any move from their present barbaric orthography towards aphonetic alphabet and spelling. The peculiarities of the Chinese script, and theeducational system arising out of that script, must have acted age after age asan invincible filter that favoured the plastic and scholarly mind as against therestive and orginating type, and kept the latter out of positions of influenceand authority. There is much that is plausible in this explanation.There have been several attempts to simplify the Chinese writing and to adopt analphabetical system. In the early days of Buddhism in China, when there was aconsiderable amount of translation from Sanscrit, Indian influences came near toachieving this end; two Chinese alphabets were indeed invented, and each hadsome little use. But what hindered the general adoption of these, and whatstands in the way of any phonetic system of Chinese writing today, is this, thatwhile the literary script and phraseology is the same from one end of China tothe other, the spoken language of the common people, both in pronunciation andin its familiar idioms, varies so widely that men from one province may beincomprehensible to men from another. There is, however, a “standard Chinese,” arather bookish spoken idiom, which is generally understood by educated people;and it is upon the possibility of applying an alphabetical system of writing tothis standard Chinese that the hopes of modern educational reformers in Chinaare based at the present time. For fresh attempts are now being made to releasethe Chinese mind from this ancient entanglement.A Chinese alphabet has been formed; it is taught in the common schools, andnewspapers and pamphlets are issued in it. And the rigid examination system thatkilled all intellectual initiatives has been destroyed. There has also been aconsiderable simplification in the direction of introducing spoken idioms intowritten Chinese. This makes for ease and lucidity; even in the old characterssuch Chinese is more easily read and written, and it is far better adapted thanclassical Chinese to the needs of modern literary expression.The very success and early prosperity and general contentment of China in thepast must have worked to justify in that land all the natural self-complacencyand conservatism of mankind. No animal will change when its conditions are “goodenough” for present survival. And in this matter man is still an animal. Untilthe nineteenth century, for more than two thousand years, there was little inthe history of China that could cause any serious doubts in the mind of aChinaman of the general superiority of his own civilization to that of the restof the world, and there was no reason apparent therefore for any alteration.China produced a profusion of beautiful art, some delightful poetry, astonishingcookery, and thousands of millions of glowingly pleasant lives generation aftergeneration. Her ships followed her marvellous inland waterways, and put to seabut rarely, and then only to India or Borneo as their utmost adventure.6[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en18] (Until the sixteenth centurywe must remember European seamen never sailed out into the Atlantic Ocean. TheNorse discovery of America, the Phœnician circumnavigation of Africa, wereexceptional feats.) And these things were attained without any such generalboredom, servitude, indignity, and misery as underlay the rule of the rich inthe Roman Empire. There was much poverty, much discontent, but it was not massedpoverty, it was not a necessary popular discontent. For a thousand years theChinese system, though it creaked and swayed at times, seemed proof againstdecay. Dynastic changes there were, rebellions, phases of disorder, famines,pestilences; two great invasions that set foreign dynasties upon the throne ofthe Son of Heaven, but no such shock as to revolutionize the order of the dailyround. The emperors and dynasties might come and go; the mandarins, theexaminations, the classics, and the traditions and habitual life remained.China’s civilization had already reached its culmination in the seventh centuryA.D., its crowning period was the Tang period; and though it continued to spreadslowly and steadily into Annam, into Cambodia, into Siam, into Tibet, intoNepal, Korea, Mongolia, and Manchuria, there is henceforth little more than suchgeographical progress to record of it in this history for a thousand years.§ 9In the year 629, the year after the arrival of Muhammad’s envoys at Canton andthirty odd years after the landing of Pope Gregory’s missionaries in England, acertain learned and devout Buddhist named Yuan Chwang started out from Sian-fu,Tai-tsung’s capital, upon a great journey to India. He was away sixteen years,he returned in 645, and he wrote an account of his travels which is treasured asa Chinese classic. One or two points about his experiences are to be noted herebecause they contribute to our general review of the state of the world in theseventh century A.D.Yuan Chwang was as eager for marvels and as credulous as Herodotus, and withoutthe latter writer’s fine sense of history; he could never pass a monument orruin without learning some fabulous story about it; Chinese ideas of the dignityof literature perhaps prevented him from telling us much detail of how hetravelled, who were his attendants, how he was lodged, or what he ate and how hepaid his expenses—details precious to the historian; nevertheless, he gives us aseries of illuminating flashes upon China, Central Asia, and India in the periodnow under consideration.009 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_009_r1.gif]His journey was an enormous one. He went and came back by way of the Pamirs. Hewent by the northern route, crossing the desert of Gobi, passing along thesouthern slopes of the Thien Shan, skirting the great deep blue lake of IssikKul, and so to Tashkend and Samarkand, and then more or less in the footsteps ofAlexander the Great southward to the Khyber Pass and Peshawar. He returned bythe southern route, crossing the Pamirs from Afghanistan to Kashgar, and soalong the line of retreat the Yue-Chi had followed in the reverse directionseven centuries before, and by Yarkand, along the slopes of the Kuen Lun torejoin his former route near the desert end of the Great Wall. Each routeinvolved some hard mountaineering. His journeyings in India are untraceable; hewas there fourteen years, and he went all over the peninsula from Nepal toCeylon.At that time there was an imperial edict forbidding foreign travel, so that YuanChwang started from Sian-fu like an escaping criminal. There was a pursuit toprevent him carrying out his project. How he bought a lean red-coloured horsethat knew the desert paths from a strange grey-beard, how he dodged a frontierguard-house with the help of a “foreign person” who made him a bridge ofbrushwood lower down the river, how he crossed the desert guided by the bones ofmen and cattle, how he saw a mirage, and how twice he narrowly escaped beingshot by arrows when he was getting water near the watch-towers on the deserttrack, the reader will find in the Life. He lost his way in the desert of Gobi,and for four nights and five days he had no water; when he was in the mountainsamong the glaciers, twelve of his party were frozen to death. All this is in theLife; he tells little of it in his own account of his travels.He shows us the Turks, this new development of the Hun tradition, in possessionnot only of what is now Turkestan, but all along the northern route. He mentionsmany cities and considerable cultivation. He is entertained by various rulers,allies of or more or less nominally tributaries to China, and among others bythe Khan of the Turks, a magnificent person in green satin, with his long hairtied with silk.“The gold embroidery of this grand tent shone with a dazzling splendour; theministers of the presence in attendance sat on mats in long rows on either sideall dressed in magnificent brocade robes, while the rest of the retinue on dutystood behind. You saw that although it was a case of a frontier ruler, yet therewas an air of distinction and elegance. The Khan came out from his tent aboutthirty paces to meet Yuan Chwang, who, after a courteous greeting, entered thetent. . . . After a short interval envoys from China and Kao-chang were admittedand presented their despatches and credentials, which the Khan perused. He wasmuch elated, and caused the envoys to be seated; then he ordered wine and musicfor himself and them and grape-syrup for the pilgrim. Hereupon all pledged eachother, and the filling and draining of the winecups made a din and bustle, whilethe mingled music of various instruments rose loud: although the airs were thepopular strains of foreigners, yet they pleased the senses and exhilarated themental faculties. After a little, piles of roasted beef and mutton were servedfor the others, and lawful food, such as cakes, milk, candy, honey, and grapes,for the pilgrim. After the entertainment, grape-syrup was again served and theKhan invited Yuan Chwang to improve the occasion, whereupon the pilgrimexpounded the doctrines of the ‘ten virtues,’ compassion for animal life, andthe paramitas and emancipation. The Khan, raising his hands, bowed, and gladlybelieved and accepted the teaching.”Yuan Chwang’s account of Samarkand is of a large and prosperous city, “a greatcommercial entrepôt, the country about it very fertile, abounding in trees andflowers and yielding many fine horses. Its inhabitants were skilful craftsmen,smart and energetic.” At that time we must remember there was hardly such athing as a town in Anglo-Saxon England.As his narrative approached his experiences in India, however, the pious andlearned pilgrim in Yuan Chwang got the better of the traveller, and the bookbecomes congested with monstrous stories of incredible miracles. Nevertheless,we get an impression of houses, clothing, and the like, closely resembling thoseof the India of today. Then, as now, the kaleidoscopic variety of an Indiancrowd contrasted with the blue uniformity of the multitude in China. In the timeof Buddha it is doubtful if there were reading and writing in India; now readingand writing were quite common accomplishments. Yuan Chwang gives an interestingaccount of a great Buddhist university at Nalanda, where ruins have quiterecently been discovered and excavated. Nalanda and Taxilla seem to have beenconsiderable educational centres as early as the opening of the schools ofAthens. The caste system Yuan Chwang found fully established in spite of Buddha,and the Brahmins were now altogether in the ascendant. He names the four maincastes we have mentioned in Chap. xviii., § 4 (q.v.), but his account of theirfunctions is rather different. The Sudras, he says, were the tillers of thesoil. Indian writers say that their function was to wait upon the three “twiceborn” castes above them.But, as we have already intimated, Yuan Chwang’s account of Indian realities isswamped by his accumulation of legends and pious inventions. For these he hadcome, and in these he rejoiced. The rest, as we shall see, was a task that hadbeen set him. The faith of Buddha which in the days of Asoka, and even so lateas Kaniska, was still pure enough to be a noble inspiration, we now discoverabsolutely lost in a wilderness of preposterous rubbish, a philosophy of endlessBuddhas, tales of manifestations and marvels like a Christmas pantomime,immaculate conceptions by six-tusked elephants, charitable princes givingthemselves up to be eaten by starving tigresses, temples built over a sacrednail-paring, and the like. We cannot give such stories here; if the reader likesthat sort of thing, he must go to the publications of the Royal Asiatic Societyor the India Society, where he will find a delirium of such imaginations. And incompetition with this Buddhism, intellectually undermined as it now was andsmothered in gilded decoration, Brahminism was everywhere gaining ground again,as Yuan Chwang notes with regret.Side by side with these evidences of a vast intellectual decay in India we maynote the repeated appearance in Yuan Chwang’s narrative of ruined and desertedcities. Much of the country was still suffering from the ravages of theEphthalites and the consequent disorders. Again and again we find such passagesas this: “He went north-east through a great forest, the road being a narrow,dangerous path, with wild buffalo and wild elephants, and robbers and huntersalways in wait to kill travellers, and emerging from the forest he reached thecountry of Kou-shih- na-ka-lo (Kúsinagara). The city walls were in ruins, andthe towns and villages were deserted. The brick foundations of the ‘old city’(that is, the city which had been the capital) were above ten li in circuit;there were very few inhabitants, the interior of the city being a wild waste.”This ruin was, however, by no means universal; there is at least as much mentionof crowded cities and villages and busy cultivations.The Life tells of many hardships upon the return journey: he fell among robbers;the great elephant that was carrying the bulk of his possessions was drowned; hehad much difficulty in getting fresh transport. Here we cannot deal with theseadventures.The return of Yuan Chwang to Sian-fu, the Chinese capital, was, we gather, atriumph. Advance couriers must have told of his coming. There was a publicholiday; the streets were decorated by gay banners and made glad with music. Hewas escorted into the city with great pomp and ceremony. Twenty horses wereneeded to carry the spoils of his travels; he had brought with him hundreds ofBuddhist books written in Sanscrit, and made of trimmed leaves of palm and birchbark strung together in layers; he had many images great and small of Buddha, ingold, silver, crystal, and sandal-wood; he had holy pictures, and no fewer thanone hundred and fifty well authenticated true relics of Buddha. Yuan Chwang waspresented to the emperor, who treated him as a personal friend, took him intothe palace, and questioned him day by day about the wonders of these strangelands in which he had stayed so long. But while the emperor asked about India,the pilgrim was disposed only to talk about Buddhism.The subsequent history of Yuan Chwang contains two incidents that throw lightupon the mental workings of this great monarch, Tai-tsung, who was probablyquite as much a Moslem as he was a Christian or a Buddhist. The trouble aboutall religious specialists is that they know too much about their own religionand how it differs from others; the advantage, or disadvantage, of such creativestatesmen as Tai-tsung and Constantine the Great is that they know comparativelylittle of such matters. Evidently the fundamental good of all these religionsseemed to Tai-tsung to be much the same fundamental good. So it was natural tohim to propose that Yuan Chwang should now give up the religious life and comeinto his foreign office, a proposal that Yuan Chwang would not entertain for amoment. The emperor then insisted at least upon a written account of thetravels, and so got this classic we treasure. And finally Tai-tsung proposed tothis highly saturated Buddhist that he should now use his knowledge of Sanscritin translating the works of the great Chinese teacher, Lao Tse, so as to makethem available for Indian readers. It seemed, no doubt, to the emperor a fairreturn and a useful service to the fundamental good that lies beneath allreligions. On the whole, he thought Lao Tse might very well rank with or even alittle above Buddha, and therefore that if his work was put before the Brahmins,they would receive it gladly. In much the same spirit Constantine the Great haddone his utmost to make Arius and Athanasius settle down amicably together. Butnaturally enough this suggestion was repulsed by Yuan Chwang. He retired to amonastery and spent the rest of his years translating as much as he could of theBuddhist literature he had brought with him into elegant Chinese writing."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIIMUHAMMAD AND ISLAM§ 1. Arabia Before Muhammad. § 2. Life of Muhammad to the Hegira. § 3. MuhammadBecomes a Fighting Prophet. § 4. The Teachings of Islam. § 5. The Caliphs AbuBekr and Omar. § 6. The Great Days of the Omayyads. § 7. The Decay of IslamUnder the Abbasids. § 8. The Intellectual Life of Arab Islam.§ 1WE have already described how in A.D. 628 the courts of Heraclius, of Kavadh,and of Tai-tsung were visited by Arab envoys sent from a certain Muhammad, “TheProphet of God,” at the small trading town of Medina in Arabia. We must tell nowwho this prophet was who had arisen among the nomads and traders of the Arabiandesert.From time immemorial Arabia, except for the fertile strip of the Yemen to thesouth, had been a land of nomads, the headquarters and land of origin of theSemitic peoples. From Arabia at various times waves of these nomads had driftednorth, east, and west into the early civilizations of Egypt, the Mediterraneancoast, and Mesopotamia. We have noted in this history how the Sumerians wereswamped and overcome by such Semitic waves, how the Semitic Phœnicians andCanaanites established themselves along the eastern shores of the Mediterranean,how the Babylonians and Assyrians were settled Semitic peoples, how the Hyksosconquered Egypt, how the Arameans established themselves in Syria with Damascusas their capital, and how the Hebrews partially conquered their “Promised Land.”At some unknown date the Chaldeans drifted in from Eastern Arabia and settled inthe old southern Sumerian lands. With each invasion first this and then thatsection of the Semitic peoples comes into history. But each of such swarmingsstill leaves a tribal nucleus behind to supply fresh invasions in the future.The history of the more highly organized empires of the horse and iron period,the empires of roads and writing, shows Arabia thrust like a wedge betweenEgypt, Palestine, and the Euphrates-Tigris country, and still a reservoir ofnomadic tribes who raid and trade and exact tribute for the immunity andprotection of caravans. There are temporary and flimsy subjugations. Egypt,Persia, Macedonia, Rome, Syria, Constantinople, and again Persia claim someunreal suzerainty in turn over Arabia, profess some unsubstantial protection.Under Trajan there was a Roman province of “Arabia,” which included the thenfertile region of the Hauran and extended as far as Petra. Now and then someArab chief and his trading city rises to temporary splendour. Such was thatOdenathus of Palmyra, whose brief career we have noted and another suchtransitory desert city whose ruins still astonish the traveller was Baalbek.After the destruction of Palmyra, the desert Arabs began to be spoken of in theRoman and Persian records as Saracens.In the time of Chosroes II, Persia claimed a certain ascendancy over Arabia, andmaintained officials and tax collectors in the Yemen. Before that time the Yemenhad been under the rule of the Abyssinian Christians for some years, and beforethat for seven centuries it had had native princes professing, be it noted, theJewish faith.Until the opening of the seventh century A.D. there were no signs of anyunwonted or dangerous energy in the Arabian deserts. The life of the country wasgoing on as it had gone on for long generations. Wherever there were fertilepatches, wherever, that is, there was a spring or a well, a scanty agriculturalpopulation subsisted, living in walled towns because of the Bedouin who wanderedwith their sheep, cattle, and horses over the desert. Upon the main caravanroutes the chief towns rose to a certain second-rate prosperity, and foremostamong them were Medina and Mecca. In the beginning of the seventh century Medinawas a town of about 15,000 inhabitants all told; Mecca may have had twenty ortwenty five thousand. Medina was a comparatively well-watered town, andpossessed abundant date groves; its inhabitants were Yemenites, from the fertileland to the south. Mecca was a town of a different character, built about aspring of water with a bitter taste, and inhabited by recently settled Bedouin.010 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_010_r1.gif]Mecca was not merely nor primarily a trading centre; it was a place ofpilgrimage. Among the Arab tribes there had long existed a sort of Amphictyonycentering upon Mecca and certain other sanctuaries; there were months of truceto war and blood feuds, and customs of protection and hospitality for thepilgrim. In addition there had grown up an Olympic element in these gatherings;the Arabs were discovering possibilities of beauty in their language, and therewere recitations of war poetry and love songs. The sheiks of the tribes, under a“king of the poets,” sat in judgment and awarded prizes; the prize songs weresung through all Arabia.The Kaaba, the sanctuary at Mecca, was of very ancient date. It was a smallsquare temple of black stones, which had for its corner-stone a meteorite. Thismeteorite was regarded as a god, and all the little tribal gods of Arabia wereunder his protection. The permanent inhabitants of Mecca were a tribe of Bedouinwho had seized this temple and constituted themselves its guardians. To themthere came in the months of truce a great incourse of people, who marched aboutthe Kaaba ceremonially, bowed themselves, and kissed the stone, and also engagedin trade and poetical recitations. The Meccans profited much from thesevisitors.All of this is very reminiscent of the religious and political state of affairsin Greece fourteen centuries earlier. But the paganism of these more primitiveArabs was already being assailed from several directions. There had been a greatproselytizing of Arabs during the period of the Maccabæans and Herods in Judea;and, as we have already noted, the Yemen had been in succession under the ruleof Jews (Arab proselytes to Judaism, i.e.), Christians, and Zoroastrians. It isevident that there must have been plenty of religious discussion during thepilgrimage fairs at Mecca and the like centres. Naturally enough Mecca was astronghold of the old pagan cult which gave it its importance and prosperity;Medina, on the other hand, had Jewish proclivities, and there were Jewishsettlements near by. It was inevitable that Mecca and Medina should be in astate of rivalry and bickering feud.§ 2It was in Mecca about the year A.D. 570 that Muhammad, the founder of Islam, wasborn. He was born in considerable poverty, and even by the standards of thedesert he was uneducated; it is doubtful if he ever learnt to write. He was forsome years a shepherd’s boy; then he became the servant of a certain Kadija, thewidow of a rich merchant. Probably he had to look after her camels or help inher trading operations; and he is said to have travelled with caravans to theYemen and to Syria. He does not seem to have been a very useful trader, but hehad the good fortune to find favour in the lady’s eyes, and she married him, tothe great annoyance of her family. He was then only twenty-five years old. It isuncertain if his wife was much older, though tradition declares she was forty.After the marriage he probably made no more long journeys. There were severalchildren, one of whom was named Abd Manif—that is to say, the servant of theMeccan god Manif, which demonstrates that at that time Muhammad had made noreligious discoveries.Until he was forty he did indeed live a particularly undistinguished life inMecca, as the husband of a prosperous wife. There may be some ground for thesupposition that he became partner in a business in agricultural produce. Toanyone visiting Mecca about A.D. 600 he would probably have seemed something ofa loafer, a rather shy, good-looking individual, sitting about and listening totalk, a poor poet, and an altogether second-rate man.About his internal life we can only speculate. Imaginative writers have supposedthat he had great spiritual struggles, that he went out into the desert inagonies of doubt and divine desire. “In the silence of the desert night, in thebright heat of noontide desert day, he, as do all men, had known and felthimself alone yet not in solitude, for the desert is of God, and in the desertno man may deny Him.”1 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en19] Maybethat was so, but there is no evidence of any such desert trips. Yet he wascertainly thinking deeply of the things about him. Possibly he had seenChristian churches in Syria; almost certainly he knew much of the Jews and theirreligion, and he heard their scorn for this black stone of the Kaaba that ruledover the three hundred odd tribal gods of Arabia. He saw the pilgrimage crowds,and noted the threads of insincerity and superstition in the paganism of thetown. It oppressed his mind. The Jews had perhaps converted him to a belief inthe One True God, without his knowing what had happened to him.At last he could keep these feelings to himself no longer. When he was forty hebegan to talk about the reality of God, at first apparently only to his wife anda few intimates. He produced certain verses, which he declared had been revealedto him by an angel. They involved an assertion of the unity of God and someacceptable generalizations about righteousness. He also insisted upon a futurelife, the fear of hell for the negligent and evil, and the reservation ofparadise for the believer in the One God. Except for his claim to be a newprophet, there does not seem to have been anything very new about thesedoctrines at the time, but this was seditious teaching for Mecca, which partlysubsisted upon its polytheistic cult, and which was therefore holding on toidols when all the rest of the world was giving them up. Like Mani, Muhammadclaimed that the prophets before him, and especially Jesus and Abraham, had beendivine teachers, but that he crowned and completed their teaching. Buddhism,however, he did not name, probably because he had never heard of Buddha. DesertArabia was in a theological backwater.For some years the new religion was the secret of a small group of simplepeople, Kadija, the Prophet’s wife, Ali, an adopted son, Zeid, a slave, and AbuBekr, a friend and admirer. For some years it was an obscure sect in a fewhouseholds of Mecca, a mere scowl and muttering at idolatry, so obscure andunimportant that the leading men of the town did not trouble about it in theleast. Then it gathered strength. Muhammad began to preach more openly, to teachthe doctrine of a future life, and to threaten idolaters and unbelievers withhell fire. He seems to have preached with considerable effect. It appeared tomany that he was aiming at a sort of dictatorship in Mecca, and drawing manysusceptible and discontented people to his side; and an attempt was made todiscourage and suppress the new movement.Mecca was a place of pilgrimage and a sanctuary; no blood could be shed withinits walls; nevertheless, things were made extremely disagreeable for thefollowers of the new teacher. Boycott and confiscation were used against them.Some were driven to take refuge in Christian Abyssinia. But the Prophet himselfwent unscathed because he was well connected, and his opponents did not want tobegin a blood feud. We cannot follow the fluctuations of the struggle here, butit is necessary to note one perplexing incident in the new Prophet’s career,which, says Sir Mark Sykes, “proves him to have been an Arab of the Arabs.”After all his insistence upon the oneness of God, he wavered. He came into thecourtyard of the Kaaba, and declared that the gods and goddesses of Mecca might,after all, be real, might be a species of saints with a power of intercession.His recantation was received with enthusiasm, but he had no sooner made it thanhe repented, and his repentance shows that he had indeed the fear of God in him.His lapse from honesty proves him honest. He did all he could to repair the evilhe had done. He said that the devil had possessed his tongue, and denouncedidolatry again with renewed vigour. The struggle against the antiquated deities,after a brief interval of peace, was renewed again more grimly, and with nofurther hope of reconciliation.For a time the old interests had the upper hand. At the end of ten years ofprophesying, Muhammad found himself a man of fifty, and altogether unsuccessfulin Mecca. Kadija, his first wife, was dead, and several of his chief supportershad also recently died. He sought a refuge at the neighbouring town of Tayf, butTayf drove him out with stones and abuse. Then, when the world looked darkest tohim, opportunity opened before him. He found he had been weighed and approved inan unexpected quarter. The city of Medina was much torn by internal dissension,and many of its people, during the time of pilgrimage to Mecca, had beenattracted by Muhammad’s teaching. Probably the numerous Jews in Medina hadshaken the ancient idolatry of the people. An invitation was sent to him to comeand rule in the name of his God in Medina.He did not go at once. He parleyed for two years, sending a disciple to preachin Medina and destroy the idols there. Then he began sending such followers ashe had in Mecca to Medina to await his coming there; he did not want to trusthimself to unknown adherents in a strange city. This exodus of the faithfulcontinued, until at last only he and Abu Bekr remained.In spite of the character of Mecca as a sanctuary, he was very nearly murderedthere. The elders of the town evidently knew of what was going on in Medina, andthey realized the danger to them if this seditious prophet presently foundhimself master of a town on their main caravan route to Syria. Custom must bowto imperative necessity, they thought; and they decided that, blood feud or noblood feud, Muhammad must die. They arranged that he should be murdered in hisbed; and in order to share the guilt of this breach of sanctuary they appointeda committee to do this, representing every family in the city except Muhammad’sown. But Muhammad had already prepared his flight; and when in the night theyrushed into his room, they found Ali, his adopted son, sleeping, or feigningsleep, on his bed.The flight (the Hegira) was an adventurous one, the pursuit being pressed hard.Expert desert trackers sought for the spoor to the north of the town, butMuhammad and Abu Bekr had gone south to certain caves where camels andprovisions were hidden, and thence he made a great detour to Medina. There heand his faithful companion arrived, and were received with great enthusiasm onSeptember 20, 622. It was the end of his probation and the beginning of hispower.§ 3Until the Hegira, until he was fifty-one, the character of the founder of Islamis a matter of speculation and dispute. Thereafter he is in the light. Wediscover a man of great imaginative power but tortuous in the Arab fashion, andwith most of the virtues and defects of the Bedouin.The opening of his reign was “very Bedouin.” The rule of the One God of all theearth, as it was interpreted by Muhammad, began with a series of raids—which formore than a year were invariably unsuccessful—upon the caravans of Mecca. Thencame a grave scandal, the breaking of the ancient customary truce of the ArabAmphictyony in the sacred month of Rahab. A party of Moslems, in this season ofprofound peace, treacherously attacked a small caravan and killed a man. It wastheir only success, and they did it by the order of the Prophet.Presently came a battle. A force of seven hundred men had come out from Mecca toconvoy home another caravan, and they encountered a large raiding party of threehundred. There was a fight, the battle of Badr, and the Meccans got the worst ofit. They lost about fifty or sixty killed and as many wounded. Muhammad returnedin triumph to Medina, and was inspired by Allah and this success to order theassassination of a number of his opponents among the Jews in the town who hadtreated his prophetic claims with a disagreeable levity.But Mecca resolved to avenge Badr, and at the battle of Uhud, near Medina,inflicted an indecisive defeat upon the Prophet’s followers. Muhammad wasknocked down and nearly killed, and there was much running away among hisfollowers. The Meccans, however, did not push their advantage and enter Medina.For some time all the energies of the Prophet were concentrated upon rallyinghis followers, who were evidently much dispirited. The Koran records thechastened feelings of those days. “The suras of the Koran,” says Sir Mark Sykes,“which are attributed to this period, excel nearly all the others in theirmajesty and sublime confidence.” Here, for the judgment of the reader, is anexample of these majestic utterances, from the recent orthodox translation bythe Maulvi Muhammad Ali.2 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en20] “Oh,you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back uponyour heels, so you will turn back losers.“Nay! Allah is your Patron, and He is the best of the helpers.“We will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they setup with Allah that for which He has sent down no authority, and their abode isthe fire; and evil is the abode of the unjust.“And certainly Allah made good to you his promise, when you slew them by Hispermission, until when you became weak-hearted and disputed about the affair anddisobeyed after He had shown you that which you loved; of you were some whodesired this world, and of you were some who desired the hereafter; then Heturned you away from them that He might try you; and He has certainly pardonedyou, and Allah is Gracious to the believers.“When you ran off precipitately, and did not wait for anyone, and the Apostlewas calling you from your rear, so He gave you another sorrow instead of yoursorrow, so that you might not grieve at what had escaped you, nor at what befellyou; and Allah is aware of what you do.“Then after sorrow he sent down security upon you, a calm coming upon a party ofyou, and there was another party whom their own souls had rendered anxious; theyentertained about Allah thoughts of ignorance quite unjustly, saying: We have nohand in this affair. Say, surely the affair is wholly in the hands of Allah.They conceal within their souls what they would not reveal to you. They say: Hadwe any hand in the affair, we would not have been slain here. Say: had youremained in your houses, those for whom slaughter was ordained would certainlyhave gone forth to the places where they would be slain, and that Allah mighttest what was in your breasts and that He might purge what was in your hearts;and Allah knows what is in the breasts.“As for those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies met, onlythe devil sought to cause them to make a slip on account of some deeds they haddone, and certainly Allah has pardoned them; surely Allah is Forgiving,Forbearing.” Inconclusive hostilities continued for some years, and at last Mecca made acrowning effort to stamp out for good and all the growing power of Medina. Amixed force of no fewer than 10,000 men was scraped together, an enormous forcefor the time and country. It was, of course, an entirely undisciplined force offootmen, horsemen, and camel riders, and it was prepared for nothing but theusual desert scrimmage. Bows, spears, and swords were its only weapons. When atlast it arrived amid a vast cloud of dust in sight of the hovels and houses ofMedina, instead of a smaller force of the same kind drawn up for battle, as ithad expected, it found a new and entirely disconcerting phenomenon, a trench anda wall. Assisted by a Persian convert, Muhammad had entrenched himself inMedina!This trench struck the Bedouin miscellany as one of the most unsportsmanlikethings that had ever been known in the history of the world. They rode about theplace. They shouted their opinion of the whole business to the besieged. Theydischarged a few arrows, and at last encamped to argue about this amazingoutrage. They could arrive at no decision. Muhammad would not come out; therains began to fall, the tents of the allies got wet and the cooking difficult,views became divergent and tempers gave way, and at last this great hostdwindled again into its constituent parts without ever having given battle(627). The bands dispersed north, east, and south, became clouds of dust, andceased to matter. Near Medina was a castle of Jews, against whom Muhammad wasalready incensed because of their disrespect for his theology. They had shown adisposition to side with the probable victor in this last struggle, and Muhammadnow fell upon them, slew all the men, nine hundred of them, and enslaved thewomen and children. Possibly many of their late allies were among the biddersfor these slaves. Never again after this quaint failure did Mecca make aneffective rally against Muhammad, and one by one its leading men came over tohis side.We need not follow the windings of the truce and the treaty that finallyextended the rule of the Prophet to Mecca. The gist of the agreement was thatthe faithful should turn towards Mecca when they prayed instead of turningtowards Jerusalem, as they had hitherto done, and that Mecca should be thepilgrimage centre of the new faith. So long as the pilgrimage continued, the menof Mecca, it would seem, did not care very much whether the crowd assembled inthe name of one god or many. Muhammad was getting more and more hopeless of anyextensive conversion of the Jews and Christians, and he was ceasing to press hisidea that all these faiths really worshipped the same One God. Allah wasbecoming more and more his own special God, tethered now by this treaty to themeteoric stone of the Kaaba, and less and less the father of all mankind.Already the Prophet had betrayed a disposition to make a deal with Mecca, and atlast it was effected. The lordship of Mecca was well worth the concession. Ofcomings and goings and a final conflict we need not tell. In 629 Muhammad cameto the town as its master. The image of Manif, the god after whom he had oncenamed his son, was smashed under his feet as he entered the Kaaba.Thereafter his power extended, there were battles, treacheries, massacres; buton the whole he prevailed, until he was master of all Arabia; and when he wasmaster of all Arabia in 632, at the age of sixty-two, he died.Throughout the concluding eleven years of his life after the Hegira, there islittle to distinguish the general conduct of Muhammad from that of any otherwelder of peoples into a monarchy. The chief difference is his use of a religionof his own creation as his cement. He was diplomatic, treacherous, ruthless, orcompromising as the occasion required and as any other Arab king might have beenin his place; and there was singularly little spirituality in his kingship. Norwas his domestic life during his time of power and freedom one of exceptionaledification. Until the death of Kadija, when he was fifty, he seems to have beenthe honest husband of one wife; but then, as many men do in their decliningyears, he developed a disagreeably strong interest in women.He married two wives after the death of Kadija, one being the young Ayesha, whobecame and remained his favourite and most influential partner; and subsequentlya number of other women, wives and concubines, were added to his establishment.This led to much trouble and confusion, and in spite of many special and veryhelpful revelations on the part of Allah, these complications still require muchexplanation and argument from the faithful. There was, for example, a scandalabout Ayesha; she was left behind on one occasion when the howdah and the camelwent on, while she was looking for her necklace among the bushes; and so Allahhad to intervene with some heat and denounce her slanderers. Allah also had tospeak very plainly about the general craving among this household of women for“this world’s life and its ornature” and for “finery.” Then there was muchdiscussion because the Prophet first married his young cousin Zainib to hisadopted son Zaid, and afterwards, “when Zaid had accomplished his want of her,”the Prophet took her and married her—but, as the inspired book makes clear, onlyin order to show the difference between an adopted and a real son. “We gave herto you as a wife, so that there should be no difficulty for the believers inrespect of the wives of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished theirwant of them, and Allah’s command shall be performed.” Yet surely a simplestatement in the Koran should have sufficed without this excessively practicaldemonstration. There was, moreover, a mutiny in the harem on account of theundue favours shown by the Prophet to an Egyptian concubine who had borne him aboy, a boy for whom he had a great affection, since none of Kadija’s sons hadsurvived. These domestic troubles mingle inextricably with our impression of theProphet’s personality. One of his wives was a Jewess, Safiyya, whom he hadmarried on the evening of the battle in which her husband had been captured andexecuted. He viewed the captured women at the end of the day, and she foundfavour in his eyes and was taken to his tent.These are salient facts in these last eleven years of Muhammad’s career. Becausehe, too, founded a great religion, there are those who write of this evidentlylustful and rather shifty leader as though he were a man to put beside Jesus ofNazareth or Gautama or Mani. But it is surely manifest that he was a being of acommoner clay; he was vain, egotistical, tyrannous, and a self-deceiver; and itwould throw all our history out of proportion if, out of an insincere deferenceto the possible Moslem reader, we were to present him in any other light.Yet, unless we balance it, this insistence upon his vanity, egotism,self-deception, and hot desire does not complete the justice of the case. Wemust not swing across from the repudiation of the extravagant pretensions of thefaithful to an equally extravagant condemnation. Can a man who has no goodqualities hold a friend? Because those who knew Muhammad best believed in himmost. Kadija for all her days believed in him—but she may have been a fondwoman. Abu Bekr is a better witness, and he never wavered in his devotion. AbuBekr believed in the Prophet, and it is very hard for anyone who reads thehistory of these times not to believe in Abu Bekr. Ali again risked his life forthe Prophet in his darkest days. Muhammad was no impostor, at any rate, thoughat times his vanity made him behave as though Allah was at his beck and call,and as if his thoughts were necessarily God’s thoughts. And if his bloodstainedpassion with Safiyya amazes and disgusts our modern minds, his love for littleIbrahim, the son of Mary the Egyptian, and his passionate grief when the childdied, reinstate him in the fellowship of all those who have known love and loss.He smoothed the earth over the little grave with his own hands. “This eases theafflicted heart,” he said. “Though it neither profits nor injures the dead, yetit is a comfort to the living.”§ 4But the personal quality of Muhammad is one thing and the quality of Islam, thereligion he founded, is quite another. Muhammad was not pitted against Jesus orMani, and his relative stature is only a very secondary question for us; it isIslam which was pitted against the corrupted Christianity of the seventh centuryand against the decaying tradition of the Zoroastrian Magi with which thehistorian has the greater concern. And whether it was through its Prophet orwhether it was in spite of its Prophet, and through certain accidents in itsorigin and certain qualities of the desert from which it sprang, there can be nodenying that Islam possesses many fine and noble attributes. It is not alwaysthrough sublime persons that great things come into human life. It is the follyof the simple disciple which demands miraculous frippery on the majesty of truthand immaculate conceptions for righteousness.A year before his death, at the end of the tenth year of the Hegira, Muhammadmade his last pilgrimage from Medina to Mecca. He made then a great sermon tohis people of which the tradition is as follows. There are, of course, disputesas to the authenticity of the words, but there can be no dispute that the worldof Islam, a world still of three hundred million people, receives them to thisday as its rule of life, and to a great extent observes it. The reader will notethat the first paragraph sweeps away all plunder and blood feuds among thefollowers of Islam. The last makes the believing Negro the equal of the Caliph.They may not be sublime words, as certain utterances of Jesus of Nazareth aresublime; but they established in the world a great tradition of dignified fairdealing, they breathe a spirit of generosity, and they are human and workable.They created a society more free from widespread cruelty and social oppressionthan any society had ever been in the world before.“Ye people: Hearken to my words; for I know not whether, after this year, Ishall ever be amongst you here again. Your lives and property are sacred andinviolable amongst one another until the end of time.“The Lord hath ordained to every man the share of his inheritance; a testamentis not lawful to the prejudice of heirs.“The child belongeth to the parent; and the violator of wedlock shall be stoned.“Whoever claimeth falsely another for his father, or another for his master, thecurse of God and the angels and of all mankind shall rest upon him.“Ye people! Ye have rights demandable of your wives, and they have rightsdemandable of you. Upon them it is incumbent not to violate their conjugal faithnor commit any act of open impropriety; which things if they do, ye haveauthority to shut them up in separate apartments and to beat them with stripes,yet not severely. But if they refrain therefrom, clothe them and feed themsuitably. And treat your women well, for they are with you as captives andprisoners; they have not power over anything as regards themselves. And ye haveverily taken them on the security of God, and have made their persons lawfulunto you by the words of God.“And your slaves, see that ye feed them with such food as ye eat yourselves, andclothe them with the stuff ye wear. And if they commit a fault which ye are notinclined to forgive, then sell them, for they are the servants of the Lord, andare not to be tormented.“Ye people! hearken to my speech and comprehend the same. Know that every Moslemis the brother of every other Moslem. All of you are on the same equality.”This insistence upon kindliness and consideration in the daily life is one ofthe main virtues of Islam, but it is not the only one. Equally important is theuncompromising monotheism, void of any Jewish exclusiveness, which is sustainedby the Koran. Islam from the outset was fairly proof against the theologicalelaborations that have perplexed and divided Christianity and smothered thespirit of Jesus. And its third source of strength has been in the meticulousprescription of methods of prayer and worship, and its clear statement of thelimited and conventional significance of the importance ascribed to Mecca. Allsacrifice was barred to the faithful; no loophole was left for the sacrificialpriest of the old dispensation to come back into the new faith. It was notsimply a new faith, a purely prophetic religion, as the religion of Jesus was inthe time of Jesus, or the religion of Gautama in the lifetime of Gautama, but itwas so stated as to remain so. Islam to this day has learned doctors, teachers,and preachers; but it has no priests.It was full of the spirit of kindliness, generosity, and brotherhood; it was asimple and understandable religion; it was instinct with the chivalroussentiment of the desert; and it made its appeal straight to the commonestinstincts in the composition of ordinary men. Against it were pitted Judaism,which had made a racial hoard of God; Christianity talking and preachingendlessly now of trinities, doctrines, and heresies no ordinary man could makehead or tail of; and Mazdaism, the cult of the Zoroastrian Magi, who hadinspired the crucifixion of Mani. The bulk of the people to whom the challengeof Islam came did not trouble very much whether Muhammad was lustful or not, orwhether he had done some shifty and questionable things; what appealed to themwas that this God, Allah, he preached, was by the test of the conscience intheir hearts a God of righteousness, and that the honest acceptance of hisdoctrine and method opened the door wide in a world of uncertainty, treachery,and intolerable divisions to a great and increasing brotherhood of trustworthymen on earth, and to a paradise not of perpetual exercises in praise andworship, in which saints, priests, and anointed kings were still to have theupper places, but of equal fellowship and simple and understandable delightssuch as their souls craved for. Without any ambiguous symbolism, without anydarkening of altars or chanting of priests, Muhammad had brought home thoseattractive doctrines to the hearts of mankind.§ 5The true embodiment of the spirit of Islam was not Muhammad, but his closefriend and supporter, Abu Bekr. There can be little doubt that if Muhammad wasthe mind and imagination of primitive Islam, Abu Bekr was its conscience and itswill. Throughout their life together it was Muhammad who said the thing, but itwas Abu Bekr who believed the thing. When Muhammad wavered, Abu Bekr sustainedhim. Abu Bekr was a man without doubts, his beliefs cut down to acts cleanly asa sharp knife cuts. We may feel sure that Abu Bekr would never have temporizedabout the minor gods of Mecca, or needed inspirations from Allah to explain hisprivate life. When in the eleventh year of the Hegira (632) the Prophet sickenedof a fever and died, it was Abu Bekr who succeeded him as Caliph and leader ofthe people (Kalifa = Successor), and it was the unflinching confidence of AbuBekr in the righteousness of Allah which prevented a split between Medina andMecca, which stamped down a widespread insurrection of the Bedouin againsttaxation for the common cause, and carried out a great plundering raid intoSyria that the dead Prophet had projected. And then Abu Bekr, with that faithwhich moves mountains, set himself simply and sanely to organize the subjugationof the whole world to Allah —with little armies of 3,000 or 4,000Arabs—according to those letters the Prophet had written from Medina in 628 toall the monarchs of the world.And the attempt came near to succeeding. Had there been in Islam a score of men,younger men to carry on his work, of Abu Bekr’s quality, it would certainly havesucceeded. It came near to succeeding because Arabia was now a centre of faithand will, and because nowhere else in the world until China was reached, unlessit was upon the steppes of Russia or Turkestan, was there another community offree-spirited men with any power of belief in their rulers and leaders. The headof the Byzantine Empire, Heraclius, the conqueror of Chosroes II, was past hisprime and suffering from dropsy, and his empire was exhausted by the longPersian war. Nor had he at any time displayed such exceptional ability as thenew occasion demanded. The motley of people under his rule knew little of himand cared less. Persia was at the lowest depths of monarchist degradation, theparricide Kavadh II had died after a reign of a few months, and a series ofdynastic intrigues and romantic murders enlivened the palace but weakened thecountry. The war between Persia and the Byzantine Empire was only formallyconcluded about the time of the beginning of Abu Bekr’s rule. Both sides hadmade great use of Arab auxiliaries; over Syria a number of towns and settlementsof Christianized Arabs were scattered who professed a baseless loyalty toConstantinople; the Persian marches between Mesopotamia and the desert wereunder the control of an Arab tributary prince, whose capital was at Hira. Arabinfluence was strong in such cities as Damascus, where Christian Arab gentlemenwould read and recite the latest poetry from the desert competitors. There wasthus a great amount of easily assimilable material ready at hand for Islam.011 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_011_r1.gif]And the military campaigns that now began were among the most brilliant in theworld’s history. Arabia had suddenly become a garden of fine men. The name ofKhalid stands out as the brightest star in a constellation of able and devotedMoslem generals. Whenever he commanded he was victorious, and when the jealousyof the second Caliph, Omar, degraded him unjustly and inexcusably,3[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en21] he made no ado, but servedAllah cheerfully and well as a subordinate to those over whom he had ruled. Wecannot trace the story of this warfare here; the Arab armies strucksimultaneously at Byzantine Syria and the Persian frontier city of Hira, andeverywhere they offered a choice of three alternatives: either pay tribute, orconfess the true God and join us, or die. They encountered armies, large anddisciplined but spiritless armies, and defeated them. And nowhere was there sucha thing as a popular resistance. The people of the populous irrigation lands ofMesopotamia cared not a jot whether they paid taxes to Byzantium or Persepolisor to Medina; and of the two, Arabs or Persian court, the Arabs, the Arabs ofthe great years, were manifestly the cleaner people, more just and moremerciful. The Christian Arabs joined the invaders very readily and so did manyJews. Just as in the west, so now in the east, an invasion became a socialrevolution. But here it was also a religious revolution with a new anddistinctive mental vitality.It was Khalid who fought the decisive battle (634) with the army of Heracliusupon the banks of the Yarmuk, a tributary of the Jordan. The legions, as ever,were without proper cavalry; for seven centuries the ghost of old Crassus hadhaunted the east in vain; the imperial armies relied upon Christian Arabauxiliaries, and these deserted to the Moslems as the armies joined issue. Agreat parade of priests, sacred banners, pictures, and holy relics was made bythe Byzantine host, and it was further sustained by the chanting of monks. Butthere was no magic in the relics and little conviction about the chanting. Onthe Arab side of the emirs and sheiks harangued the troops, and after theancient Arab fashion the shrill voices of women in the rear encouraged theirmen. The Moslem ranks were full of believers before whom shone victory orparadise. The battle was never in doubt after the defection of the irregularcavalry. An attempt to retreat dissolved into a rout and became a massacre. TheByzantine army had fought with its back to the river, which was presently chokedwith its dead.Thereafter Heraclius slowly relinquished all Syria, which he had so lately wonback from the Persians, to his new antagonists. Damascus soon fell, and a yearlater the Moslems entered Antioch. For a time they had to abandon it again to alast effort from Constantinople, but they re-entered it for good under Khalid.Meanwhile on the eastern front, after a swift initial success which gave themHira, the Persian resistance stiffened. The dynastic struggle had ended at lastin the coming of a king of kings, and a general of ability had been found inRustam. He gave battle at Kadessia (637). His army was just such anothercomposite host as Darius had led into Thrace or Alexander defeated at Issus; itwas a medley of levies. He had thirty-three war elephants, and he sat on agolden throne upon a raised platform behind the Persian ranks, surveying thebattle, which throne will remind the reader of Herodotus, the Hellespont, andSalamis more than a thousand years before. The battle lasted three days; eachday the Arabs attacked and the Persian host held its ground until nightfallcalled a truce. On the third day the Arabs received reinforcements, and towardsthe evening the Persians attempted to bring the struggle to an end by a chargeof elephants. At first the huge beasts carried all before them; then one waswounded painfully and became uncontrollable, rushing up and down between thearmies. Its panic affected the others, and for a time both armies remaineddumbfounded in the red light of sunset, watching the frantic efforts of thesegrey, squealing monsters to escape from the tormenting masses of armed men thathemmed them in. It was by the merest chance that at last they broke through thePersian and not through the Arab array, and that it was the Arabs who were ableto charge home upon the resulting confusion. The twilight darkened to night, butthis time the armies did not separate. All through the night the Arabs smote inthe name of Allah, and pressed upon the shattered and retreating Persians. Dawnbroke upon the vestiges of Rustam’s army in flight far beyond the litter of thebattlefield. Its path was marked by scattered weapons and war material,abandoned transport, and the dead and dying. The platform and the golden thronewere broken down, and Rustam lay dead among a heap of dead men. . . .Already in 634 Abu Bekr had died and given place to Omar, the Prophet’sbrother-in-law, as Caliph; and it was under Omar (634-643) that the mainconquests of the Moslems occurred. The Byzantine Empire was pushed out of Syriaaltogether. But at the Taurus Mountains the Moslem thrust was held. Armenia wasoverrun, all Mesopotamia was conquered and Persia beyond the rivers. Egyptpassed almost passively from Greek to Arab; in a few years the Semitic race, inthe name of God and His Prophet, had recovered nearly all the dominions it hadlost to the Aryan Persians a thousand years before. Jerusalem fell early, makinga treaty without standing siege, and so the True Cross which had been carriedoff by the Persians a dozen years before, and elaborately restored by Heraclius,passed once more out of the rule of Christians. But it was still in Christianhands; the Christians were to be tolerated, paying only a poll tax; and all thechurches and all the relics were left in their possession.Jerusalem made a peculiar condition for its surrender. The city would giveitself only to the Caliph Omar in person. Hitherto he had been in Medinaorganizing armies and controlling the general campaign. He came to Jerusalem(638), and the manner of his coming shows how swiftly the vigour and simplicityof the first Moslem onset was being sapped by success. He came thesix-hundred-mile journey with only one attendant; he was mounted on a camel, anda bag of barley, another of dates, a water-skin, and a wooden platter were hisprovision for the journey. He was met outside the city by his chief captains,robed splendidly in silks and with richly caparisoned horses. At this amazingsight the old man was overcome with rage. He slipped down from his saddle,scrabbled up dirt and stones with his hands, and pelted these fine gentlemen,shouting abuse. What was this insult? What did this finery mean? Where were hiswarriors? Where were the desert men? He would not let these popinjays escorthim. He went on with his attendant, and the smart Emirs rode afar off—well outof range of his stones. He met the Patriarch of Jerusalem, who had apparentlytaken over the city from its Byzantine rulers, alone. With the Patriarch he goton very well. They went round the Holy Places together, and Omar, now a littleappeased, made sly jokes at the expense of his too magnificent followers.Equally indicative of the tendencies of the time is Omar’s letter ordering oneof his governors who had built himself a palace at Kufa, to demolish it again.012 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_012_r1.gif]“They tell me,” he wrote, “you would imitate the palace of Chosroes,4[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en22] and that you would even usethe gates that once were his. Will you also have guards and porters at thosegates, as Chosroes had? Will you keep the faithful afar off and deny audience tothe poor? Would you depart from the custom of our Prophet, and be as magnificentas those Persian emperors, and descend to hell even as they have done?”5[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en23]§ 6Abu Bekr and Omar I are the two master figures in the history of Islam. It isnot within our scope here to describe the wars by which in a hundred andtwenty-five years Islam spread itself from the Indus to the Atlantic and Spain,and from Kashgar on the borders of China to Upper Egypt. Two maps must sufficeto show the limits to which the vigorous impulse of the new faith carried theArab idea and the Arabic scriptures, before worldliness, the old trading andplundering spirit, and the glamour of the silk robe had completely recoveredtheir paralyzing sway over the Arab intelligence and will. The reader will notehow the great tide swept over the footsteps of Yuan Chwang, and how easily inAfrica the easy conquests of the Vandals were repeated in the reverse direction.And if the reader entertains any delusions about a fine civilization, eitherPersian, Roman, Hellenic, or Egyptian, being submerged by this flood, the soonerhe dismisses such ideas the better. Islam prevailed because it was the bestsocial and political order the times could offer. It prevailed becauseeverywhere it found politically apathetic peoples, robbed, oppressed, bullied,uneducated, and unorganized, and it found selfish and unsound governments out oftouch with any people at all. It was the broadest, freshest, and cleanestpolitical idea that had yet come into actual activity in the world, and itoffered better terms than any other to the mass of mankind. The capitalistic andslave-holding system of the Roman Empire and the literature and culture andsocial tradition of Europe had altogether decayed and broken down before Islamarose; it was only when mankind lost faith in the sincerity of itsrepresentatives that Islam, too, began to decay.013 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_013_r1.gif]The larger part of its energy spent itself in conquering and assimilating Persiaand Turkestan; its most vigorous thrusts were northwardly from Persia andwestwardly through Egypt. Had it concentrated its first vigour upon theByzantine Empire, there can be little doubt that by the eighth century it wouldhave taken Constantinople and come through into Europe as easily as it reachedthe Pamirs. The Caliph Muawiya, it is true, besieged the capital for seven years(672 to 678), and Suleiman in 717 and 718; but the pressure was not sustained,and for three or four centuries longer the Byzantine Empire remained the crazybulwark of Europe. In the newly Christianized or still pagan Avars, Bulgars,Serbs, Slavs, and Saxons, Islam would certainly have found as ready converts asit did in the Turks of Central Asia. And though, instead of insisting uponConstantinople, it first came round into Europe by the circuitous route ofAfrica and Spain, it was only in France, at the end of a vast line ofcommunications from Arabia, that it encountered a power sufficiently vigorous toarrest its advance.From the outset the Bedouin aristocrats of Mecca dominated the new empire. AbuBekr, the first Caliph, was in an informal shouting way elected at Medina, andso were Omar I and Othman, the third Caliph, but all three were Meccans of goodfamily. They were not men of Medina. And though Abu Bekr and Omar were men ofstark simplicity and righteousness Othman was of a baser quality, a man quite inthe vein of those silk robes, to whom conquest was not conquest for Allah butfor Arabia, and especially for Mecca in Arabia, and more particularly forhimself and for the Meccans and for his family, the Omayyads. He was a worthyman, who stood out for his country and his town and his “people.” He was noearly convert as his two predecessors had been; he had joined the Prophet forreasons of policy in fair give and take. With his accession the Caliph ceases tobe a strange man of fire and wonder, and becomes an Oriental monarch like manyOriental monarchs before and since, a fairly good monarch by Eastern standardsas yet, but nothing more.The rule and death of Othman brought out the consequences of Muhammad’sweaknesses as clearly as the lives of Abu Bekr and Omar had witnessed to thedivine fire in his teaching. Muhammad had been politic at times when Abu Bekrwould have been firm, and the new element of aristocratic greediness that camein with Othman was one fruit of those politic moments. And the legacy of thatcarelessly compiled harem of the Prophet, the family complications andjealousies which had lurked in the background of Moslem affairs during the ruleof the first two Caliphs, was now coming out into the light of day. Ali, who wasthe nephew, the adopted son, and the son-in-law of the Prophet —he was thehusband of the Prophet’s daughter Fatima—he had considered himself the rightfulCaliph. His claims formed an undertow to the resentment of Medina and of therival families of Mecca against the advancement of the Omayyads. But Ayesha, thefavourite wife of the Prophet, had always been jealous of Fatima and hostile toAli. She supported Othman. . . . The splendid opening of the story of Islamcollapses suddenly into this squalid dispute and bickering of heirs and widows.In 656 Othman, an old man of eighty, was stoned in the streets of Medina by amob, chased to his house, and murdered; and Ali became at last Caliph, only tobe murdered in his turn (661). In one of the battles in this civil war, Ayesha,now a gallant, mischievous old lady, distinguished herself by leading a charge,mounted on a camel. She was taken prisoner and treated well.While the armies of Islam were advancing triumphantly to the conquest of theworld, this sickness of civil war smote at its head. What was the rule of Allahin the world to Ayesha when she could score off the detested Fatima, and whatheed were the Omayyads and the partisans of Ali likely to take of the unity ofmankind when they had a good hot feud of this sort to entertain them, with thecaliphate as a prize? The world of Islam was rent in twain by the spites,greeds, and partisan silliness of a handful of men and women in Medina. Thatquarrel still lives. To this day one main division of the Moslems, the Shiites,maintain the hereditary right of Ali to be Caliph as an article of faith! Theyprevail in Persia and India. But an equally important section, the Sunnites,with whom it is difficult for a disinterested observer not to agree, deny thispeculiar addendum to Muhammad’s simple creed. So far as we can gather at thislength of time, Ali was an entirely commonplace individual.To watch this schism creeping across the brave beginnings of Islam is likewatching a case of softening of the brain. To the copious literature of thesubject we must refer the reader who wishes to learn how Hasan, the son of Ali,was poisoned by his wife, and how Husein, his brother, was killed. We do butname them here because they still afford a large section of mankind scope forsentimental partisanship and mutual annoyance. They are the two chief Shiitemartyrs. Amidst the coming and going of their conflicts the old Kaaba at Meccawas burnt down, and naturally there began endless disputation whether it shouldbe rebuilt in exactly its ancient form or on a much larger scale.In this and the preceding sections we have seen once more the inevitablestruggle of this newest and latest unifying impulse in the world’s affairsagainst the everyday worldliness of mankind, and we have seen also how from thefirst the complicated household of Muhammad was like an evil legacy to the newfaith. But as this history now degenerates into the normal crimes and intriguesof an Oriental dynasty, the student of history will realize a third fundamentalweakness in the world reforms of Muhammad. He was an illiterate Arab, ignorantof history, totally ignorant of all the political experiences of Rome andGreece, and almost as ignorant of the real history of Judea; and he left hisfollowers with no scheme for a stable government embodying and concentrating thegeneral will of the faithful, and no effective form to express the very realspirit of democracy (using the world in its modern sense) that pervades theessential teaching of Islam. His own rule was unlimited autocracy, andautocratic Islam has remained. Politically Islam was not an advance, but aretrogression from the traditional freedoms and customary laws of the desert.The breach of the pilgrims’ truce that led to the battle of Badr is the blackestmark against early Islam. Nominally Allah is its chief ruler—but practically itsmaster has always been whatever man was vigorous and unscrupulous enough tosnatch and hold the Caliphate—and, subject to revolts and assassinations, itsfinal law has been that man’s will.For a time, after the death of Ali, the Omayyad family was in the ascendant, andfor nearly a century they gave rulers to Islam.The Arab historians are so occupied with the dynastic squabbles and crimes ofthe time, that it is difficult to trace the external history of the period. Wefind Moslem shipping upon the seas defeating the Byzantine fleet in a great seafight off the coast of Lycia (A.D. 655), but how the Moslems acquired thisvictorious fleet thus early we do not clearly know. It was probably chieflyEgyptian. For some years Islam certainly controlled the eastern Mediterranean,and in 662 and again in 672, during the reign of Muawiya (662-680), the firstgreat Omayyad Caliph, made two sea attacks upon Constantinople. They had to besea attacks because Islam, so long as it was under Arab rule, never surmountedthe barrier of the Taurus Mountains. During the same period the Moslems werealso pressing their conquests further and further into Central Asia. While Islamwas already decaying at its centre, it was yet making great hosts of newadherents and awakening a new spirit among the hitherto divided and aimlessTurkish peoples. Medina was no longer a possible centre for its vast enterprisesin Asia, Africa, and the Mediterranean, and so Damascus became the usual capitalof the Omayyad Caliphs.Chief among these, as for a time the clouds of dynastic intrigue clear, areAbdal Malik (685-705) and Walid I (705-715), under whom the Omayyad line rose tothe climax of its successes. The western boundary was carried to the Pyrenees,while to the east the domains of the Caliph marched with China. The son ofWalid, Suleiman (715), carried out a second series of Moslem attacks uponConstantinople which his father had planned and proposed. As with the CaliphMuawiya half a century before, the approach was by sea—for Asia Minor, as wehave just noted, was still unconquered—and the shipping was drawn chiefly fromEgypt. The emperor, a usurper, Leo the Isaurian, displayed extraordinary skilland obstinacy in the defence; he burnt most of the Moslem shipping in abrilliant sortie, cut up the troops they had landed upon the Asiatic side of theBosphorus, and after a campaign in Europe of two years (717- 718), a winter ofunexampled severity completed their defeat.From this point onward the glory of the Omayyad line decays. The firsttremendous impulse of Islam was now spent. There was no further expansion and amanifest decline in religious zeal. Islam had made millions of converts, and haddigested those millions very imperfectly. Cities, nations, whole sects andraces, Arab pagans, Jews, Christians, Manichæans, Zoroastrians, Turanian paganshad been swallowed up into this new vast empire of Muhammad’s successors. It hashitherto been the common characteristic of all the great unifying religiousinitiators of the world, the common oversight, that they have accepted the moraland theological ideals to which the first appeal was made, as though they wereuniversal ideals. Muhammad’s appeal, for example, was to the traditionalchivalry and underlying monotheistic feelings of the intelligent Arabs of histime. These things were latent in the mind and conscience of Mecca and Medina;he did but call them forth. Then, as the new teaching spread and stereotypeditself, it had to work on a continually more uncongenial basis, it had to growin soil that distorted and perverted it. Its sole text-book was the Koran. Tominds untuned to the melodies of Arabic, this book seemed to be, as it seems tomany European minds today, a mixture of fine-spirited rhetoric with—to put itplainly—formless and unintelligent gabble. Countless converts missed the realthing in it altogether. To that we must ascribe the readiness of the Persian andIndian sections of the faith to join the Shiite schism upon a quarrel that theycould at least understand and feel. And to the same attempt to square the newstuff with old prepossessions was due such extravagant theology as presentlydisputed whether the Koran was and always had been co-existent with God.6[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en24] We should be stupefied by thepreposterousness of this idea if we did not recognize in it at once thewell-meaning attempt of some learned Christian convert to Islamize his beliefthat “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word wasGod.”7 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en25]None of the great unifying religious initiators of the world hitherto seems tohave been accompanied by any understanding of the vast educational task, thevast work of lucid and varied exposition and intellectual organization involvedin its propositions. They all present the same history of a rapid spreading,like a little water poured over a great area, and then of a superficiality andcorruption.In a little while we hear stories of an Omayyad Caliph, Walid II (743-744), whomocked at the Koran, ate pork, drank wine, and did not pray. Those stories mayhave been true or they may have been circulated for political reasons. Therebegan a puritan reaction in Mecca and Medina against the levity and luxury ofDamascus. Another great Arab family, the Abbas family, the Abbasids, athoroughly wicked line, had long been scheming for power, and was making capitalout of the general discontent. The feud of the Omayyads and the Abbasids wasolder than Islam; it had been going on before Muhammad was born. These Abbasidstook up the tradition of the Shiite “martyrs,” Ali and his sons Hasan andHusein, and identified themselves with it. The banner of the Omayyads was white;the Abbasid adopted a black banner, black in mourning for Hasan and Husein,black because black is more impressive than any colour; moreover, the Abbasidsdeclared that all the Caliphs after Ali were usurpers. In 749 they accomplisheda carefully prepared revolution, and the last of the Omayyad Caliphs was hunteddown and slain in Egypt. Abul Abbas was the first of the Abbasid Caliphs, and hebegan his reign by collecting into one prison every living male of the Omayyadline upon whom he could lay hands and causing them all to be massacred. Theirbodies, it is said, were heaped together, a leathern carpet was spread overthem, and on this gruesome table Abul Abbas and his councillors feasted.Moreover, the tombs of the Omayyad Caliphs were rifled, and their bones burntand scattered to the four winds of heaven. So the grievances of Ali were avengedat last, and the Omayyad line passed out of history.There was, it is interesting to note, a rising on behalf of the Omayyads inKhorasan which was assisted by the Chinese Emperor.§ 7But the descendants of Ali were not destined to share in this triumph for long.The Abassids were adventurers and rulers of an older school than Islam. Now thatthe tradition of Ali had served its purpose, the next proceeding of the newCaliph was to hunt down and slaughter the surviving members of his family, thedescendants of Ali and Fatima.Clearly the old traditions of Sassanid Persia and of Persia before the Greekswere returning to the world. With the accession of the Abbasids the control ofthe sea departed from the Caliph, and with it went Spain and North Africa, inwhich, under an Omayyad survivor in the former case, independent Moslem statesnow arose. The centre of gravity of Islam shifted across the desert fromDamascus to Mesopotamia. Mansur, the successor of Abul Abbas, built himself anew capital at Bagdad near the ruins of Ctesiphon, the former Sassanid capital.Turks and Persians as well as Arabs became Emirs, and the army was reorganizedupon Sassanid lines. Medina and Mecca were now only of importance as pilgrimagecentres, to which the faithful turned to pray. But because it was a finelanguage, and because it was the language of the Koran, Arabic continued tospread until presently it had replaced Greek and become the language of educatedmen throughout the whole Moslem world.Of the Abbasid monarchs after Abul Abbas we need tell little here. A bickeringwar went on year by year in Asia Minor in which neither Byzantium nor Bagdadmade any permanent gains, though once or twice the Moslems raided as far as theBosphorus. A false prophet Mokanna, who said he was God, had a brief buttroublesome career. There were plots, there were insurrections; they lie flatand colourless now in the histories like dead flowers in an old book. One otherAbbasid Caliph only need be named, and that quite as much for his legendary asfor his real importance, Haroun-al-Raschid (786-809). He was not only the Caliphof an outwardly prosperous empire in the world of reality, but he was also theCaliph of an undying empire in the deathless world of fiction, he was theHaroun-al-Raschid of the Arabian Nights.Sir Mark Sykes8 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en26] gives anaccount of the reality of his empire from which we will quote certain passages.He says: “The Imperial Court was polished, luxurious, and unlimitedly wealthy;the capital, Bagdad, a gigantic mercantile city surrounding a hugeadministrative fortress, wherein every department of state had a properlyregulated and well-ordered public office; where schools and colleges abounded;whither philosophers, students, doctors, poets, and theologians flocked from allparts of the civilized globe. . . . The provincial capitals were embellishedwith vast public buildings, and linked together by an effective and rapidservice of posts and caravans; the frontiers were secure and well garrisoned,the army loyal, efficient, and brave; the governors and ministers honest andforbearing. The empire stretched with equal strength and unimpaired control fromthe Cilician gates to Aden, and from Egypt to Central Asia. Christians, Pagans,Jews, as well as Moslems, were employed in the government service. Usurpers,rebellious generals, and false prophets seemed to have vanished from the Moslemdominions. Traffic and wealth had taken the place of revolution and famine. . .. Pestilence and disease were met by Imperial hospitals and governmentphysicians. . . . In government business the rough-and-ready methods of Arabianadministration had given place to a complicated system of Divans, initiatedpartly from the Roman, but chiefly taken from the Persian system of government.Posts, Finance, Privy Seal, Crown Lands, Justice, and Military affairs were eachadministered by separate bureaux in the hands of ministers and officials; anarmy of clerks, scribes, writers, and accountants swarmed into these offices andgradually swept the whole power of the government into their own hands byseparating the Commander of the Faithful from any direct intercourse with hissubjects. The Imperial Palace and the entourage were equally based on Roman andPersian precedents. Eunuchs, closely veiled ‘harems’ of women, guards, spies,go-betweens, jesters, poets, and dwarfs clustered around the person of theCommander of the Faithful, each, in his degree, endeavouring to gain the royalfavour and indirectly distracting the royal mind from affairs of business andstate. Meanwhile the mercantile trade of the East poured gold into Bagdad, andsupplemented the other enormous stream of money derived from the contributionsof plunder and loot despatched to the capital by the commanders of thevictorious raiding forces which harried Asia Minor, India, and Turkestan. Theseemingly unending supply of Turkish slaves and Byzantine specie added to therichness of the revenues of Irak, and, combined with the vast commercial trafficof which Bagdad was the centre, produced a large and powerful moneyed class,composed of the sons of generals, officials, landed proprietors, royalfavourites, merchants, and the like, who encouraged the arts, literature,philosophy, and poetry as the mood took them, building palaces for themselves,vying with each other in the luxury of their entertainments, suborning poets tosound their praises, dabbling in philosophy, supporting various schools ofthought, endowing charities, and, in fact, behaving as the wealthy have alwaysbehaved in all ages.“I have said that the Abbasid Empire in the days of Haroun-al-Raschid was weakand feeble to a degree, and perhaps the reader will consider this a foolishproposition when he takes into consideration that I have described the Empire asorderly, the administration definite and settled, the army efficient, and wealthabundant. The reason I make the suggestion is that the Abbasid Empire had losttouch with everything original and vital in Islam, and was constructed entirelyby the reunion of the fragments of the empires Islam had destroyed. There wasnothing in the empire which appealed to the higher instincts of the leaders ofthe people; the holy war had degenerated into a systematic acquisition ofplunder. The Caliph had become a luxurious Emperor or King of Kings; theadministration had changed from a patriarchal system to a bureaucracy. Thewealthier classes were rapidly losing all faith in the religion of the state;speculative philosophy and high living were taking the place of Koranicorthodoxy and Arabian simplicity. The solitary bond which could have held theempire together, the sternness and plainness of the Moslem faith, was completelyneglected by both the Caliph and his advisers. . . . Haroun-al-Raschid himselfwas a winebibber, and his palace was decorated with graven images of birds andbeasts and men. . . .“For a moment we stand amazed at the greatness of the Abbasid dominion; thensuddenly we realize that it is but as a fair husk enclosing the dust and ashesof dead civilizations.”Haroun-al-Raschid died in 809. At his death his great empire fell immediatelyinto civil war and confusion, and the next great event of unusual importance inthis region of the world comes two hundred years later when the Turks, under thechiefs of the great family of the Seljuks, poured southward out of Turkestan,and not only conquered the empire of Bagdad, but Asia Minor also. Coming fromthe north-east as they did, they were able to outflank the great barrier of theTaurus Mountains, which had hitherto held back the Moslems. They were still muchthe same people as those of whom Yuan Chwang gave us a glimpse four hundredyears earlier, but now they were Moslems, and Moslems of the primitive type, menwhom Abu Bekr would have welcomed to Islam. They caused a great revival ofvigour in Islam, and they turned the minds of the Moslem world once more in thedirection of a religious war against Christendom. For there had been a sort oftruce between these two great religions after the cessation of the Moslemadvance and the decline of the Omayyads. Such warfare as had gone on betweenChristianity and Islam had been rather border-bickering than sustained war. Itbecame only a bitter fanatical struggle again in the eleventh century.§ 8But before we go on to tell of the Turks and the Crusaders, the great wars thatbegan between Christendom and Islam, and which have left a quite insaneintolerance between these great systems right down to the present time, it isnecessary to give a little more attention to the intellectual life of theArabic-speaking world which was now spreading more and more widely over theregions which Hellenism had once dominated. For some generations beforeMuhammad, the Arab mind had been, as it were, smouldering, it had been producingpoetry and much religious discussion; under the stimulus of the national andracial successes it presently blazed out with a brilliance second only to thatof the Greeks during their best period. From a new angle and with a fresh vigourit took up that systematic development of positive knowledge which the Greekshad begun and relinquished. It revived the human pursuit of science. If theGreek was the father, then the Arab was the foster-father of the scientificmethod of dealing with reality, that is to say, by absolute frankness, theutmost simplicity of statement and explanation, exact record, and exhaustivecriticism. Through the Arabs it was and not by the Latin route that the modernworld received that gift of light and power.Their conquests brought the Arabs into contact with the Greek literarytradition, not at first directly, but through the Syrian translations of theGreek writers. The Nestorian Christians, the Christians to the east oforthodoxy, seem to have been much more intelligent and active-minded than thecourt theologians of Byzantium, and at a much higher level of general educationthan the Latin-speaking Christians of the west. They had been tolerated duringthe latter days of the Sassanids, and they were tolerated by Islam until theascendancy of the Turks in the eleventh century. They had preserved much of theHellenic medical science, and had even added to it. In the Omayyad times most ofthe physicians in the Caliph’s dominions were Nestorians, and no doubt manylearned Nestorians professed Islam without any serious compunction or any greatchange in their work and thoughts. They had preserved much of Aristotle both inGreek and in Syrian translations. They had a considerable mathematicalliterature. Their equipment makes the contemporary resources of St. Benedict orCassiodorus seem very pitiful. To these Nestorian teachers came the fresh Arabmind out of the desert, keen and curious, and learnt much and improved upon itsteaching.But the Nestorians were not the only teachers available for the Arabs.Throughout all the rich cities of the east the kindred Jews were scattered withtheir own distinctive literature and tradition, and the Arab and the Jewish mindreacted upon one another to a common benefit. The Arab was informed and the Jewsharpened to a keener edge. The Jews have never been pedants in the matter oftheir language; we have already noted that a thousand years before Islam theyspoke Greek in Hellenized Alexandria, and now all over this new Moslem worldthey were speaking and writing Arabic. Some of the greatest of Jewish literaturewas written in Arabic, the religious writings of Maimonides, for example.Indeed, it is difficult to say in the case of this Arabic culture where the Jewends and the Arab begins, so important and essential were its Jewish factors.Moreover, there was a third source of inspiration, more particularly inmathematical science, to which at present it is difficult to do justice—India.There can be little doubt that the Arab mind during its best period was ineffective contact with Sanscrit literature and with Indian ideas, and that itderived much from this source.The distinctive activities of the Arab mind were already manifest under theOmayyads, though it was during the Abbasid time that it made its best display.History is the beginning and core of all sound philosophy and all greatliterature, and the first Arab writers of distinction were historians,biographers, and quasi-historical poets. Romantic fiction and the short storyfollowed as a reading public developed, willing to be amused. And as readingceased to be a special accomplishment, and became necessary to every man ofaffairs and to every youth of breeding, came the systematic growth of aneducational system and an educational literature. By the ninth and tenthcenturies there are not only grammars, but great lexicons, and a mass ofphilological learning in Islam.And a century or so in advance of the west, there grew up in the Moslem world ata number of centres, at Basra, at Kufa, at Bagdad and Cairo, and at Cordoba, outof what were at first religious schools dependent upon mosques, a series ofgreat universities. The light of these universities shone far beyond the Moslemworld, and drew students to them from east and west. At Cordoba in particularthere were great numbers of Christian students, and the influence of Arabphilosophy coming by way of Spain upon the universities of Paris, Oxford, andNorth Italy and upon Western European thought generally, was very considerableindeed. The name of Averroes (Ibn-rushd) of Cordoba (1126- 1198) stands out asthat of the culminating influence of Arab philosophy upon European thought. Hedeveloped the teachings of Aristotle upon lines that made a sharp divisionbetween religious and scientific truth, and so prepared the way for theliberation of scientific research from the theological dogmatism that restrainedit both under Christianity and under Islam. Another great name is that ofAvicenna (Ibnsinã), the Prince of Physicians (980-1037), who was born at theother end of the Arabic world at Bokhara, and who travelled in Khorasan. . . .The book-copying industry flourished at Alexandria, Damascus, Cairo, and Bagdad,and about the year 970 there were twenty-seven free schools open in Cordoba forthe education of the poor.“In mathematics,” say Thatcher and Schwill,9[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en27] “the Arabs built on thefoundations of the Greek mathematicians. The origin of the so-called Arabicnumerals is obscure. Under Theodoric the Great, Boethius made use of certainsigns which were in part very like the nine digits which we now use. One of thepupils of Gerbert also used signs which were still more like ours, but the zerowas unknown till the twelfth century, when it was invented by an Arabmathematician named Muhammad-Ibn-Musa, who also was the first to use the decimalnotation, and who gave the digits the value of position. In geometry the Arabsdid not add much to Euclid, but algebra is practically their creation; also theydeveloped spherical trigonometry, inventing the sine, tangent, and cotangent. Inphysics they invented the pendulum, and produced work on optics. They madeprogress in the science of astronomy. They built several observatories, andconstructed many astronomical instruments which are still in use. Theycalculated the angle of the ecliptic and the precession of the equinoxes. Theirknowledge of astronomy was undoubtedly considerable.“In medicine they made great advances over the work of the Greeks. They studiedphysiology and hygiene, and their materia medica was practically the same asours today. Many of their methods of treatment are still in use among us. Theirsurgeons understood the use of anæsthetics, and performed some of the mostdifficult operations known. At the time when in Europe the practice of medicinewas forbidden by the Church, which expected cures to be effected by religiousrites performed by the clergy, the Arabs had a real science of medicine. Inchemistry they made a good beginning. They discovered many new substances, suchas alcohol,10 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en28] potash, nitrateof silver, corrosive sublimate, and nitric and sulphuric acid. . . . Inmanufactures they outdid the world in variety and beauty of design andperfection of workmanship. They worked in all the metals—gold, silver, copper,bronze, iron, and steel. In textile fabrics they have never been surpassed. Theymade glass and pottery of the finest quality. They knew the secrets of dyeing,and they manufactured paper. They had many processes of dressing leather, andtheir work was famous throughout Europe. They made tinctures, essences, andsyrups. They made sugar from the cane, and grew many fine kinds of wine. Theypractised farming in a scientific way, and had good systems of irrigation. Theyknew the value of fertilizers, and adapted their crops to the quality of theground. They excelled in horticulture, knowing how to graft and how to producenew varieties of fruit and flowers. They introduced into the west many trees andplants from the east, and wrote scientific treatises on farming.”One item in this account must be underlined here because of its importance inthe intellectual life of mankind, the manufacture of paper. This the Arabs seemto have learnt from the Chinese by way of Central Asia. The Europeans acquiredit from the Arabs. Until that time books had to be written upon parchment orpapyrus, and after the Arab conquest of Egypt Europe was cut off from thepapyrus supply. Until paper became abundant, the art of printing was of littleuse, and newspapers and popular education by means of books was impossible. Thiswas probably a much more important factor in the relative backwardness of Europeduring the dark ages than historians seem disposed to admit. . . .And all this mental life went on in the Moslem world in spite of a veryconsiderable amount of political disorder. From first to last the Arabs nevergrappled with the problem, the still unsolved problem, of the stable progressivestate; everywhere their form of government was absolutist and subject to theconvulsions, changes, intrigues, and murders that have always characterized theextremer forms of monarchy. But for some centuries, beneath the crimes andrivalries of courts and camps, the spirit of Islam did preserve a certaingeneral decency and restraint in life; the Byzantine Empire was impotent toshatter this civilization, and the Turkish danger in the north-east gatheredstrength only very slowly. Until the Turk fell upon it, the intellectual life ofIslam continued. Perhaps it secretly flattered itself that it would always beable to go on in spite of the thread of violence and unreason in its politicaldirection. Hitherto in all countries that has been the characteristic attitudeof science and literature. The intellectual man has been loth to come to gripswith the forcible man. He has generally been something of a courtier andtime-server. Possibly he has never yet been quite sure of himself. Hitherto menof reason and knowledge have never had the assurance and courage of thereligious fanatic. But there can be little doubt that they have accumulatedsettled convictions and gathered confidence during the last few centuries; theyhave slowly found a means to power through the development of popular educationand popular literature, and today they are far more disposed to say thingsplainly and to claim a dominating voice in the organization of human affairsthan they have ever been before in the world’s history."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IVCHRISTENDOM AND THE CRUSADES§ 1.

A List of Leading Popes.§ 1LET us turn again now from this intellectual renascence in the cradle of theancient civilizations to the affairs of the Western world. We have described thecomplete economic, social, and political break-up of the Roman imperial systemin the west, the confusion and darkness that followed in the sixth and seventhcenturies, and the struggles of such men as Cassiodorus to keep alight the flameof human learning amidst these windy confusions. For a time it would be idle towrite of states and rulers. Smaller or greater adventurers seized a castle or acountryside and ruled an uncertain area. The British Islands, for instance, weresplit up amidst a multitude of rulers; numerous Keltic chiefs in Ireland andScotland and Wales and Cornwall fought and prevailed over and succumbed to eachother; the English invaders were also divided into a number of fluctuating“kingdoms,” Kent, Wessex, Essex, Sussex, Mercia, Northumbria, and East Anglia,which were constantly at war with one another. So it was over most of theWestern world. Here a bishop would be the monarch, as Gregory the Great was inRome; here a town or a group of towns would be under the rule of the duke orprince of this or that. Amidst the vast ruins of the city of Romehalf-independent families of quasi-noble adventurers and their retainersmaintained themselves. The Pope kept a sort of general predominance there, buthe was sometimes more than balanced by a “Duke of Rome.” The great arena of theColosseum had been made into a privately-owned castle, and so, too, had the vastcircular tomb of the Emperor Hadrian; and the adventurers who had possession ofthese strongholds and their partisans waylaid each other and fought and bickeredin the ruinous streets of the once imperial city. The tomb of Hadrian was knownafter the days of Gregory the Great as the Castle of St. Angelo, the Castle ofthe Holy Angel, because when he was crossing the bridge over the Tiber on hisway to St. Peter’s to pray against the great pestilence which was devastatingthe city, he had had a vision of a great angel standing over the dark mass ofthe mausoleum and sheathing a sword, and he had known then that his prayerswould be answered. This Castle of St. Angelo played a very important part inRoman affairs during this age of disorder.Spain was in much the same state of political fragmentation as Italy or Franceor Britain; and in Spain the old feud of Carthaginian and Roman was stillcontinued in the bitter hostility of their descendants and heirs, the Jew andthe Christian. So that when the power of the Caliph had swept along the NorthAfrican coast to the Straits of Gibraltar, it found in the Spanish Jews readyhelpers in its invasion of Europe. A Moslem army of Arabs and of Berbers, thenomadic Hamitic people of the African desert and mountain hinterland who hadbeen converted to Islam, crossed and defeated the West Goths in a great battlein 711. In a few years the whole country was in their possession.In 720 Islam had reached the Pyrenees, and had pushed round their eastern endinto France; and for a time it seemed that the faith was likely to subjugateGaul as easily as it had subjugated the Spanish peninsula. But presently itstruck against something hard, a new kingdom of the Franks, which had beenconsolidating itself for some two centuries in the Rhineland and North France.Of this Frankish kingdom, the precursor of France and Germany, which formed thewestern bulwark of Europe against the faith of Muhammad, as the Byzantine empirebehind the Taurus Mountains formed the eastern, we shall now have much to tell;but first we must give some account of the new system of social groupings out ofwhich it arose.§ 2It is necessary that the reader should have a definite idea of the socialcondition of western Europe in the eighth century. It was not a barbarism.Eastern Europe was still barbaric and savage; things had progressed but littlebeyond the state of affairs described by Gibbon in his account of the mission ofPriscus to Attila (see p. 485). But western Europe was a shattered civilization,without law, without administration, with roads destroyed and educationdisorganized, but still with great numbers of people with civilized ideas andhabits and traditions. It was a time of confusion, of brigandage, of crimesunpunished and universal insecurity. It is very interesting to trace how, out ofthe universal mêlée, the beginnings of a new order appeared. In a modernbreakdown there would probably be the formation of local vigilance societies,which would combine and restore a police administration and a roughly democraticrule. But in the broken-down western empire of the sixth, seventh, and eighthcenturies, men’s ideas turned rather to leaders than to committees, and thecentres about which affairs crystallized were here barbaric chiefs, here avigorous bishop or some surviving claimant to a Roman official position, here along-recognized landowner or man of ancient family, and here again some vigoroususurper of power. No solitary man was safe. So men were forced to linkthemselves with others, preferably people stronger than themselves. The lonelyman chose the most powerful and active person in his district and became hisman. The freeman or the weak lordling of a petty territory linked himself tosome more powerful lord. The protection of that lord (or the danger of hishostility) became more considerable with every such accession. So very rapidlythere went on a process of political crystallization in the confused and lawlesssea into which the Western Empire had liquefied. These natural associations andalliances of protector and subordinates grew very rapidly into a system, thefeudal system, traces of which are still to be found in the social structure ofevery European community west of Russia.This process speedily took on technical forms and laws of its own. In such acountry as Gaul it was already well in progress in the days of insecurity beforethe barbarian tribes broke into the empire as conquerors. The Franks when theycame into Gaul brought with them an institution, which we have already noted inthe case of the Macedonians, and which was probably of very wide distributionamong the Nordic people, the gathering about the chief or war king of a body ofyoung men of good family, the companions or comitatus, his counts or captains.It was natural in the case of invading peoples that the relations of a weak lordto a strong lord should take on the relations of a count to his king, and that aconquering chief should divide seized and confiscated estates among hiscompanions. From the side of the decaying empire there came to feudalism theidea of the grouping for mutual protection of men and estates; from the Teutonicside came the notions of knightly association, devotion, and personal service.The former was the economic side of the institution, the latter the chivalrous.The analogy of the aggregation of feudal groupings with crystallization is avery close one. As the historian watches the whirling and eddying confusion ofthe fourth and fifth centuries in Western Europe, he begins to perceive theappearance of these pyramidal growths of heads and subordinates andsub-subordinates, which jostle against one another, branch, dissolve again, orcoalesce. “We use the term ‘feudal system’ for convenience sake, but with adegree of impropriety if it conveys the meaning ‘systematic.’ Feudalism in itsmost flourishing age was anything but systematic. It was confusion roughlyorganized. Great diversity prevailed everywhere, and we should not be surprisedto find some different fact or custom in every lordship. Anglo-Norman feudalismattained in the eleventh and twelfth centuries a logical completeness and auniformity of practice which, in the feudal age proper, can hardly be foundelsewhere through so large a territory. . . .014 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_014_r1.gif]“The foundation of the feudal relationship proper was the fief, which wasusually land, but might be any desirable thing, as an office, a revenue in moneyor kind, the right to collect a toll, or operate a mill. In return for the fief,the man became the vassal of his lord; he knelt before him, and, with his handsbetween his lord’s hands, promised him fealty and service. . . . The faithfulperformance of all the duties he had assumed in homage constituted the vassal’sright and title to his fief. So long as they were fulfilled, he, and his heirafter him, held the fief as his property, practically and in relation to allunder-tenants as if he were the owner. In the ceremony of homage andinvestiture, which is the creative contract of feudalism, the obligationsassumed by the two parties were, as a rule, not specified in exact terms. Theywere determined by local custom. . . . In many points of detail the vassal’sservices differed widely in different parts of the feudal world. We may say,however, that they fall into two classes, general and specific. The generalincluded all that might come under the idea of loyalty, seeking the lord’sinterests, keeping his secrets, betraying the plans of his enemies, protectinghis family, etc. The specific services are capable of more definite statement,and they usually received exact definition in custom and sometimes in writtendocuments. The most characteristic of these was the military service, whichincluded appearance in the field on summons with a certain force, often armed ina specified way, and remaining a specified length of time. It often includedalso the duty of guarding the lord’s castle, and of holding one’s own castlesubject to the plans of the lord for the defence of his fief. . . .“Theoretically regarded, feudalism covered Europe with a network of these fiefs,rising in graded ranks one above the other from the smallest, the knight’s fee,at the bottom, to the king at the top, who was the supreme landowner, or whoheld the kingdom from God. . . .”1[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en29]But this was the theory that was superimposed upon the established facts. Thereality of feudalism was its voluntary cooperation.“The feudal state was one in which, it has been said, private law had usurpedthe place of public law.” But rather is it truer that public law had failed andvanished and private law had come in to fill the vacuum. Public duty had becomeprivate obligation.§ 3We have already mentioned various kingdoms of the barbarian tribes who set up amore or less flimsy dominion over this or that area amidst the debris of theempire, the kingdoms of the Suevi and West Goths in Spain, the East-Gothickingdom in Italy, and the Italian Lombard kingdom which succeeded the Gothsafter Justinian had expelled the latter and after the great pestilence haddevastated Italy. The Frankish kingdom was another such barbarian power whicharose first in what is now Belgium, and which spread southward to the Loire, butit developed far more strength and solidarity than any of the others. It was thefirst real state to emerge from the universal wreckage. It became at last a wideand vigorous political reality, and from it are derived two great powers ofmodern Europe, France and the German Empire. Its founder was Clovis (481-511)who began as a small king in Belgium and ended with his southern frontiersnearly at the Pyrenees. He divided his kingdom among his four sons, but theFranks retained a tradition of unity in spite of this division, and for a timefraternal wars for a single control united rather than divided them. A moreserious split arose, however, through the Latinization of the Western Franks,who occupied Romanized Gaul and who learnt to speak the corrupt Latin of thesubject population, while the Franks of the Rhineland retained their Low Germanspeech. At a low level of civilization, differences in language cause verypowerful political strains. For a hundred and fifty years the Frankish world wassplit in two, Neustria, the nucleus of France, speaking a Latinish speech, whichbecame at last the French language we know, and Austrasia, the Rhineland, whichremained German.2 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en30]015 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_015_r1.gif]We will not tell here of the decay of the dynasty, the Merovingian dynasty,founded by Clovis; nor how in Austrasia a certain court official, the Mayor ofthe Palace, gradually became the king de facto and used the real king as apuppet. The position of Mayor of the Palace also became hereditary in theseventh century, and in 687 a certain Pepin of Heristhal, the Austrasian Mayorof the Palace, had conquered Neustria and reunited all the Franks. He wasfollowed in 714 by his son, Charles Martel, who also bore no higher title thanMayor of the Palace. (His poor little Merovingian kings do not matter in theslightest degree to us here.) It was this Charles Martel who stopped theMoslems. They had pushed as far as Tours when he met them, and in a great battlebetween that place and Poitiers (732) utterly defeated them and broke theirspirit. Thereafter the Pyrenees remained their utmost boundary; they came nofurther into Western Europe.Charles Martel divided his power between two sons, but one resigned and wentinto a monastery, leaving his brother Pepin sole ruler. This Pepin it was whofinally extinguished the descendants of Clovis. He sent to the Pope to ask whowas the true king of the Franks, the man who held the power or the man who worethe crown; and the Pope, who was in need of a supporter, decided in favour ofthe Mayor of the Palace. So Pepin was chosen king at a gathering of the Frankishnobles in the Merovingian capital Soissons, and anointed and crowned. That wasin 751. The Franco-Germany he united was consolidated by his son Charlemagne. Itheld together until the death of his grandson Louis (840), and then France andGermany broke away again —to the great injury of mankind. It was not adifference of race or temperament, it was a difference of language and traditionthat split these Frankish peoples asunder.That old separation of Neustria and Austrasia still works out in bitterconsequences. In 1916 the ancient conflict of Neustria and Austrasia had brokenout into war once more. In the August of that year the present writer visitedSoissons, and crossed the temporary wooden bridge that had been built by theEnglish after the Battle of the Aisne from the main part of the town to thesuburb of St. Médard. Canvas screens protected passengers upon the bridge fromthe observation of the German sharpshooters who were sniping from their trenchesdown the curve of the river. He went with his guides across a field and along bythe wall of an orchard in which a German shell exploded as he passed. So hereached the battered buildings that stand upon the site of the ancient abbey ofSt. Médard, in which the last Merovingian was deposed and Pepin the Short wascrowned in his stead. Beneath these ancient buildings there were great crypts,very useful as dug-outs—for the German advanced lines were not more than acouple of hundred yards away. The sturdy French soldier lads were cooking andresting in these shelters, and lying down to sleep among the stone coffins thathad held the bones of their Merovingian kings.§ 4The populations over which Charles Martel and King Pepin ruled were at verydifferent levels of civilization in different districts. To the west and souththe bulk of the people consisted of Latinized and Christian Kelts; in thecentral regions these rulers had to deal with such more or less ChristianizedGermans as the Franks and Burgundians and Alemanni; to the north-east were stillpagan Frisians and Saxons; to the east were the Bavarians, recentlyChristianized through the activities of St. Boniface; and to the east of themagain pagan Slavs and Avars. The “Paganism” of the Germans and Slavs was verysimilar to the primitive religion of the Greeks; it was a manly religion inwhich temple, priest, and sacrifices played a small part, and its gods were likemen, a kind of “school prefects” of more powerful beings who interferedimpulsively and irregularly in human affairs. The Germans had a Jupiter in Odin,a Mars in Thor, a Venus in Freya, and so on. Throughout the seventh and eighthcenturies a steady process of conversion to Christianity went on amidst theseGerman and Slavonic tribes.It will be interesting to English-speaking readers to note that the most zealousand successful missionaries among the Saxons and Frisians came from England.Christianity was twice planted in the British Isles. It was already there whileBritain was a part of the Roman Empire; a martyr, St. Alban, gave his name tothe town of St. Albans, and nearly every visitor to Canterbury has also visitedlittle old St. Martin’s church, which was used during the Roman times. FromBritain, as we have already said, Christianity spread beyond the imperialboundaries into Ireland—the chief missionary was St. Patrick—and there was avigorous monastic movement with which are connected the names of St. Columba andthe religious settlements of Iona. Then in the fifth and sixth centuries camethe fierce and pagan English, and they cut off the early Church of Ireland fromthe main body of Christianity. In the seventh century Christian missionarieswere converting the English, both in the north from Ireland and in the southfrom Rome. The Rome mission was sent by Pope Gregory the Great just at the closeof the sixth century. The story goes that he saw English boys for sale in theRoman slave market, though it is a little difficult to understand how they gotthere. They were very fair and good-looking. In answer to his inquiries, he wastold that they were Angles. “Not Angles, but Angels,” said he, “had they but thegospel.”016 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_016_r1.gif]The mission worked through the seventh century. Before that century was over,most of the English were Christians; though Mercia, the central English kingdom,held out stoutly against the priests and for the ancient faith and ways. Andthere was a swift progress in learning upon the part of these new converts. Themonasteries of the kingdom of Northumbria in the north of England became acentre of light and learning. Theodore of Tarsus was one of the earliestarchbishops of Canterbury (669-690). “While Greek was utterly unknown in thewest of Europe, it was mastered by some of the pupils of Theodore. Themonasteries contained many monks who were excellent scholars. Most famous of allwas Bede, known as the Venerable Bede (673-735), a monk of Jarrow (on Tyne). Hehad for his pupils the six hundred monks of that monastery, besides the manystrangers who came to hear him. He gradually mastered all the learning of hisday, and left at his death forty-five volumes of his writings, the mostimportant of which are ‘The Ecclesiastical History of the English’ and histranslation of the Gospel of John into English. His writings were widely knownand used throughout Europe. He reckoned all dates from the birth of Christ, andthrough his works the use of Christian chronology became common in Europe. Owingto the large number of monasteries and monks in Northumbria, that part ofEngland was for a time far in advance of the south in civilization.”3[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en31]In the seventh and eighth centuries we find the English missionaries active uponthe eastern frontiers of the Frankish kingdom. Chief among these was St.Boniface (680-755), who was born at Crediton, in Devonshire, who converted theFrisians, Thuringians, and Hessians, and who was martyred in Holland.Both in England and on the Continent the ascendant rulers seized uponChristianity as a unifying force to cement their conquests. Christianity becamea banner for aggressive chiefs—as it did in Uganda in Africa in the bloody daysbefore that country was annexed to the British Empire. After Pepin, who died in768, came two sons, Charles and another, who divided his kingdom; but thebrother of Charles died in 771, and Charles then became sole king (771-814) ofthe growing realm of the Franks. This Charles is known in history as Charles theGreat, or Charlemagne. As in the case of Alexander the Great and Julius Cæsar,posterity has enormously exaggerated his memory. He made his wars of aggressiondefinitely religious wars. All the world of north-western Europe, which is nowGreat Britain, France, Germany, Denmark, and Norway and Sweden, was in the ninthcentury an arena of bitter conflict between the old faith and the new. Wholenations were converted to Christianity by the sword just as Islam in Arabia,Central Asia, and Africa had converted whole nations a century or so before.With fire and sword Charlemagne preached the Gospel of the Cross to the Saxons,Bohemians, and as far as the Danube into what is now Hungary; he carried thesame teaching down the Adriatic Coast through what is now Dalmatia, and drovethe Moslems back from the Pyrenees as far as Barcelona.Moreover, he it was who sheltered Egbert, an exile from Wessex, in England, andassisted him presently to establish himself as King in Wessex (802). Egbertsubdued the Britons in Cornwall, as Charlemagne conquered the Britons ofBrittany, and, by a series of wars, which he continued after the death of hisFrankish patron, made himself at last the first King of all England (828).But the attacks of Charlemagne upon the last strongholds of paganism provoked avigorous reaction on the part of the unconverted. The Christianized English hadretained very little of the seamanship that had brought them from the mainland,and the Franks had not yet become seamen. As the Christian propaganda ofCharlemagne swept towards the shores of the North and Baltic Seas, the paganswere driven to the sea. They retaliated for the Christian persecutions withplundering raids and expeditions against the northern coasts of France andagainst Christian England. These pagan Saxons and English of the mainland andtheir kindred from Denmark and Norway are the Danes and Northmen of our nationalhistories. They were also called Vikings,4[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en32] which means “inlet-men,”because they came from the deep inlets of the Scandinavian coast. They came inlong black galleys, making little use of sails. Most of our information aboutthese wars and invasions of the Pagan Vikings is derived from Christian sources,and so we have abundant information of the massacres and atrocities of theirraids and very little about the cruelties inflicted upon their pagan brethren,the Saxons, at the hands of Charlemagne, Their animus against the cross andagainst monks and nuns was extreme. They delighted in the burning of monasteriesand nunneries and the slaughter of their inmates.017 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_017_r1.gif]Throughout the period between the fifth and the ninth centuries these Vikings orNorthmen were learning seamanship, becoming bolder, and ranging further. Theybraved the northern seas until the icy shores of Greenland were a familiarhaunt, and by the ninth century they had settlements (of which Europe in generalknew nothing) in America. In the tenth and eleventh centuries many of theirsagas began to be written down in Iceland. They saw the world in terms ofvaliant adventure. They assailed the walrus, the bear, and the whale. In theirimaginations, a great and rich city to the south, a sort of confusion of Romeand Byzantium, loomed large. They called it “Miklagard” (Michael’s court) orMicklegarth. The magnetism of Micklegarth was to draw the descendants of theseNorthmen down into the Mediterranean by two routes, by the west and also acrossRussia from the Baltic, as we shall tell later. By the Russian route went alsothe kindred Swedes.So long as Charlemagne and Egbert lived, the Vikings were no more than raiders;but as the ninth century wore on, these raids developed into organizedinvasions. In several districts of England the hold of Christianity was by nomeans firm as yet. In Mercia in particular the pagan Northmen found sympathy andhelp. By 886 the Danes had conquered a fair part of England, and the Englishking, Alfred the Great, had recognized their rule over their conquests, theDane-law, in the pact he made with Guthrum their leader. A little later, in 912,another expedition under Rolf the Ganger established itself upon the coast ofFrance in the region that was known henceforth as Normandy (= Northman-dy). Butof how there was presently a fresh conquest of England by the Danes, and howfinally the Duke of Normandy became King of England, we cannot tell at anylength. There were very small racial and social differences between Angle,Saxon, Jute, Dane, or Norman; and though these changes loom large in theimaginations of the English, they are seen to be very slight rufflings indeed ofthe stream of history when we measure them by the standards of a greater world.The issue between Christianity and paganism vanished presently from thestruggle. By the Treaty of Wedmore the Danes agreed to be baptized if they wereassured of their conquests; and the descendants of Rolf in Normandy were notmerely Christianized, but they learnt to speak French from the more civilizedpeople about them, forgetting their own Norse tongue. Of much greatersignificance in the history of mankind are the relations of Charlemagne with hisneighbours to the south and east, and to the imperial tradition.018 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_018_r1.gif]§ 5Through Charlemagne the tradition of the Roman Cæsar was revived in Europe. TheRoman Empire was dead and decaying; the Byzantine Empire was far gone indecline; but the education and mentality of Europe had sunken to a level atwhich new creative political ideas were probably impossible. In all Europe theresurvived not a tithe of the speculative vigour that we find in the Athenianliterature of the fifth century B.C. There was no power to postulate a newoccasion or to conceive and organize a novel political method. OfficialChristianity had long overlaid and accustomed itself to ignore those strangeteachings of Jesus of Nazareth from which it had arisen. The Roman Church,clinging tenaciously to its possession of the title of pontifex maximus, hadlong since abandoned its appointed task of achieving the Kingdom of Heaven. Itwas preoccupied with the revival of Roman ascendancy on earth, which itconceived of as its inheritance. It had become a political body, using the faithand needs of simple men to forward its schemes. Europe drifted towards a drearyimitation and revival of the misconceived failures of the past. For elevencenturies from Charlemagne onwards, “Emperors” and “Cæsars” of this line andthat come and go in the history of Europe like fancies in a disordered mind. Weshall have to tell of a great process of mental growth in Europe, of enlargedhorizons and accumulating power, but it was a process that went on independentlyof, and in spite of, the political forms of the time, until at last it shatteredthose forms altogether. Europe during those eleven centuries of the imitationCæsars which began with Charlemagne, and which closed only in the monstrousbloodshed of 1914-1918, has been like a busy factory owned by a somnambulist,who is sometimes quite unimportant and sometimes disastrously in the way. Orrather than a somnambulist, let us say by a corpse that magically simulates akind of life. The Roman Empire staggers, sprawls, is thrust off the stage, andreappears, and—if we may carry the image one step further—it is the Church ofRome which plays the part of the magician and keeps this corpse alive.And throughout the whole period there is always a struggle going on for thecontrol of the corpse between the spiritual and various temporal powers. We havealready noted the spirit of St. Augustine’s City of God. It was a book which weknow Charlemagne read, or had read to him—for his literary accomplishments arerather questionable. He conceived of this Christian Empire as being ruled andmaintained in its orthodoxy by some such great Cæsar as himself. He was to ruleeven the Pope. But at Rome the view taken of the revived empire differed alittle from that. There the view taken was that the Christian Cæsar must beanointed and guided by the Pope—who would even have the power to excommunicateand depose him. Even in the time of Charlemagne this divergence of view wasapparent. In the following centuries it became acute.The idea of the revived Empire dawned only very gradually upon the mind ofCharlemagne. At first he was simply the ruler of his father’s kingdom of theFranks, and his powers were fully occupied in struggles with the Saxons andBavarians, and with the Slavs to the east of them, with the Moslem in Spain, andwith various insurrections in his own dominions. And as the result of a quarrelwith the King of Lombardy, his father-in-law, he conquered Lombardy and NorthItaly. We have noted the establishment of the Lombards in North Italy about 570after the great pestilence, and after the overthrow of the East Gothic kings byJustinian. These Lombards had always been a danger and a fear to the Popes, andthere had been an alliance between Pope and Frankish King against them in thetime of Pepin. Now Charlemagne completely subjugated Lombardy (774), sent hisfather-in-law to a monastery, and carried his conquests beyond the presentnorth-eastern boundaries of Italy into Dalmatia in 776. In 781 he caused one ofhis sons, Pepin, who did not outlive him, to be crowned King of Italy in Rome.There was a new Pope, Leo III, in 795, who seems from the first to have resolvedto make Charlemagne emperor. Hitherto the court at Byzantium had possessed acertain indefinite authority over the Pope. Strong emperors like Justinian hadbullied the Popes and obliged them to come to Constantinople; weak emperors hadannoyed them ineffectively. The idea of a breach, both secular and religious,with Constantinople had long been entertained at the Lateran,5[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en33] and in the Frankish powerthere seemed to be just the support that was necessary if Constantinople was tobe defied. So at his accession Leo III sent the keys of the tomb of St. Peterand a banner to Charlemagne as the symbols of his sovereignty in Rome as King ofItaly. Very soon the Pope had to appeal to the protection he had chosen. He wasunpopular in Rome; he was attacked and ill-treated in the streets during aprocession, and obliged to fly to Germany (799). Eginhard says his eyes weregouged out and his tongue cut off; he seems, however, to have had both eyes andtongue again a year later. Charlemagne brought him back and reinstated him(800).Then occurred a very important scene. On Christmas Day, in the year 800, asCharles was rising from prayer in the Church of St. Peter, the Pope, who hadeverything in readiness, clapped a crown upon his head and hailed him Cæsar andAugustus. There was great popular applause. But Eginhard, the friend andbiographer of Charlemagne, says that the new emperor was by no means pleased bythis coup of Pope Leo’s. If he had known this was to happen, he said, “he wouldnot have entered the church, great festival though it was.” No doubt he had beenthinking and talking of making himself emperor, but he had evidently notintended that the Pope should make him emperor. He had some idea of marrying theEmpress Irene, who at that time reigned in Constantinople, and so becomingmonarch of both Eastern and Western Empires. He was now obliged to accept thetitle in the manner that Leo III had adopted as a gift from the Pope, and in away that estranged Constantinople and secured the separation of Rome from theByzantine Church.At first Byzantium was unwilling to recognize the imperial title of Charlemagne.But in 810 a great disaster fell upon the Byzantine Empire. The paganBulgarians, under their Prince Krum (802-814), defeated and destroyed the armiesof the Emperor Nicephorus, whose skull became a drinking-cup for Krum. Thegreater part of the Balkan peninsula was conquered by these people. (TheBulgarian and the English nations thus became established as political unitiesalmost simultaneously.) After this misfortune Byzantium was in no position todispute this revival of the empire in the West, and in 812 Charlemagne wasformally recognized by Byzantine envoys as Emperor and Augustus.So the Empire of Rome, which had died at the hands of Odoacer in 476, rose againin 800 as the “Holy Roman Empire.” While its physical strength lay north of theAlps, the centre of its idea was Rome. It was therefore from the beginning adivided thing of uncertain power, a claim and an argument rather than anecessary reality. The German sword was always clattering over the Alps intoItaly, and missions and legates toiling over in the reverse direction. But theGermans could never hold Italy permanently, because they could not stand themalaria that the ruined, neglected, undrained country fostered. And in Rome, aswell as in several other of the cities of Italy, there smouldered a more ancienttradition, the tradition of the aristocratic republic, hostile to both Emperorand Pope.§ 6In spite of the fact that we have a life of him written by his contemporary,Eginhard,6 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en34] the character andpersonality of Charlemagne are difficult to visualize. Eginhard lacks vividness;he tells many particulars, but not the particulars that make a man live again inthe record. Charlemagne, he says, was a tall man, with a rather feeble voice;and he had bright eyes and a long nose. “The top of his head was round,”whatever that may mean, and his hair was “white.” He had a thick, rather shortneck, and “his belly too prominent.” He wore a tunic with a silver border, andgartered hose. He had a blue cloak, and was always girt with his sword, hilt andbelt being of gold and silver. He was evidently a man of great activity, oneimagines him moving quickly, and his numerous love affairs did not interfere atall with his incessant military and political labours. He had numerous wives andmistresses. He took much exercise, was fond of pomp and religious ceremonies,and gave generously. He was a man of very miscellaneous activity and greatintellectual enterprise, and with a self-confidence that is rather suggestive ofWilliam II, the ex-German Emperor, the last, perhaps for ever, of this series ofimitation Cæsars in Europe which Charlemagne began.The mental life that Eginhard records of him is interesting, because it not onlygives glimpses of a curious character, but serves as a sample of theintellectuality of the time. He could read probably; at meals he “listened tomusic or reading,” but we are told that he had not acquired the art of writing;“he used to keep his writing-book and tablets under his pillow, that when he hadleisure he might practise his hand in forming letters, but he made littleprogress in an art begun too late in life.” He had, however, a real respect forlearning and a real desire for knowledge, and he did his utmost to attract menof learning to his court. Among others who came was Alcuin, a learnedEnglishman. All those learned men were, of course, clergymen, there being noother learned men, and naturally they gave a strongly clerical tinge to theinformation they imparted to their master. At his court, which was usually atAix-la-Chapelle or Mayence, he maintained in the winter months a curiousinstitution called his “school,” in which he and his erudite associates affectedto lay aside all thoughts of worldly position, assumed names taken from theclassical writers or from Holy Writ, and discoursed upon theology andliterature. Charlemagne himself was “David.” He developed a considerableknowledge of theology, and it is to him that we must ascribe the addition of thewords filio que to the Nicene Creed, an addition that finally split the Latinand Greek churches asunder. But it is more than doubtful if he had any suchseparation in mind. He wanted to add a word or so to the creed, just as theEmperor William II wanted to write operas and paint pictures,7[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en35] and he took up what wasoriginally a Spanish innovation.Of his organization of his empire there is little to be said here. He was fartoo restless and busy to consider the quality of his successor or the conditionof political stability, and the most noteworthy thing in this relationship isthat he particularly schooled his son and successor, Louis the Pious (814-840),to take the crown from the altar and crown himself. But Louis the Pious was toopious to adhere to those instructions when the Pope made an objection.The legislation of Charlemagne was greatly coloured by Bible reading; he knewhis Bible well, as the times went; and it is characteristic of him that after hehad been crowned emperor he required every male subject above the age of twelveto renew his oath of allegiance, and to undertake to be not simply a goodsubject, but a good Christian. To refuse baptism and to retract after baptismwere crimes punishable by death. He did much to encourage architecture, andimported many Italian architects, chiefly from Ravenna, to whom we owe many ofthe pleasant Byzantine buildings that still at Worms and Cologne and elsewheredelight the tourist in the Rhineland. He founded a number of cathedrals andmonastic schools, did much to encourage the study of classical Latin, and was adistinguished amateur of church music. The possibility of his talking Latin andunderstanding Greek is open to discussion; probably he talked French-Latin.Frankish, however, was his habitual tongue. He made a collection of old Germansongs and tales, but these were destroyed by his successor Louis the Pious onaccount of their paganism.He corresponded with Haroun-al-Raschid, the Abbasid Caliph at Bagdad, who wasnot perhaps the less friendly to him on account of his vigorous handling of theOmayyad Arabs in Spain. Gibbon supposes that this “public correspondence wasfounded on vanity,” and that “their remote situation left no room for acompetition of interest.” But with the Byzantine Empire between them in theEast, and the independent caliphate of Spain in the West, and a common danger inthe Turks of the great plains, they had three very excellent reasons forcordiality. Haroun-al-Raschid, says Gibbon, sent Charlemagne by his ambassadorsa splendid tent, a water clock, an elephant, and the keys of the Holy Sepulchre.The last item suggests that Charlemagne was to some extent regarded by theSaracen monarch as the protector of the Christians and Christian properties inhis dominions. Some historians declare explicitly that there was a treaty tothat effect.§ 7The Empire of Charlemagne did not outlive his son and successor, Louis thePious. It fell apart into its main constituents. The Latinized Keltic andFrankish population of Gaul begins now to be recognizable as France, though thisFrance was broken up into a number of dukedoms and principalities, often with nomore than a nominal unity; the German-speaking peoples between the Rhine and theSlavs to the east similarly begin to develop an even more fragmentary intimationof Germany. When at length a real emperor reappears in Western Europe (962), heis not a Frank, but a Saxon; the conquered in Germany have become the masters.It is impossible here to trace the events of the ninth and tenth centuries inany detail, the alliances, the treacheries, the claims and acquisitions.Everywhere there was lawlessness, war, and a struggle for power. In 987 thenominal kingdom of France passed from the hands of the Carlovingians, the lastdescendants of Charlemagne, into the hands of Hugh Capet, who founded a newdynasty. Most of his alleged subordinates were in fact independent, and willingto make war on the king at the slightest provocation. The dominions of the Dukeof Normandy, for example, were more extensive and more powerful than thepatrimony of Hugh Capet. Almost the only unity of this France over which theking exercised a nominal authority lay in the common resolution of its greatprovinces to resist incorporation in any empire dominated either by a Germanruler or by the Pope. Apart from the simple organization dictated by that commonwill, France was a mosaic of practically independent nobles. It was an era ofcastle-building and fortification, and what was called “private war” throughoutall Europe.The state of Rome in the tenth century is almost indescribable. The decay of theEmpire of Charlemagne left the Pope without a protector, threatened by Byzantiumand the Saracens (who had taken Sicily), and face to face with the unruly noblesof Rome. Among the most powerful of these were two women, Theodora and Marozia,mother and daughter8 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en36] who insuccession held the Castle of St. Angelo (§ 1), which Theophylact, the patricianhusband of Theodora, had seized with most of the temporal power of the Pope;these two women were as bold, unscrupulous, and dissolute as any male prince ofthe time could have been, and they are abused by historians as though they wereten times worse. Marozia seized and imprisoned Pope John X (928), who speedilydied under her care. She subsequently made her illegitimate son pope, under thetitle of John XI. After him her grandson, John XII, filled the chair of St.Peter. Gibbon’s account of the manners and morals of John XII takes refuge atlast beneath a veil of Latin footnotes. This Pope, John XII, was finallydegraded by the new German Emperor Otto, who came over the Alps and down intoItaly to be crowned in 962.9 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en37]This new line of Saxon emperors, which thus comes into prominence, sprang from acertain Henry the Fowler, who was elected King of Germany by an assembly ofGerman nobles, princes, and prelates in 919. In 936 he was succeeded as King byhis son, Otto I, surnamed the Great, who was also elected to be his successor atAix-la-Chapelle, and who finally descended upon Rome at the invitation of JohnXII, to be crowned emperor in 962. His subsequent degradation of John was forcedupon him by that pope’s treachery. With his assumption of the imperial dignity,Otto I did not so much overcome Rome as restore the ancient tussle of Pope andEmperor for ascendancy to something like decency and dignity again. Otto I wasfollowed by Otto II (973-983), and he again by a third Otto (983-1002).10[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en38]The struggle between the Emperor and the Pope for ascendancy over the Holy RomanEmpire plays a large part in the history of the early Middle Ages, and we shallhave presently to sketch its chief phases. Though the church never sank quite tothe level of John XII again, nevertheless the story fluctuates through phases ofgreat violence, confusion, and intrigue. Yet the outer history of Christendom isnot the whole history of Christendom. That the Lateran was as cunning, foolish,and criminal as most other contemporary courts has to be recorded; but, if weare to keep due proportions in this history, it must not be unduly emphasized.We must remember that through all those ages, leaving profound consequences, butleaving no conspicuous records upon the historian’s page, countless men andwomen were touched by that Spirit of Jesus which still lived and lives still atthe core of Christianity, that they led lives that were on the whole graciousand helpful, and that they did unselfish and devoted deeds. Through those agessuch lives cleared the air and made a better world possible. Just as in theMoslem world the Spirit of Islam generation by generation produced its crop ofcourage, integrity, and kindliness.§ 8While the Holy Roman Empire and the kingdoms of France and England were thusappearing amidst the extreme political fragmentation of the civilization ofWestern Europe, both that civilization and the Byzantine Empire were beingsubjected to a threefold attack: from the Saracen powers, from the Northmen,and, more slowly developed and most formidable of all, from a new westwardthrust of the Turkish peoples through South Russia, and also by way of Armeniaand the Empire of Bagdad from Central Asia.After the overthrow of the Omayyads by the Abbasid dynasty, the strength of theSaracenic impulse against Europe diminished. Islam was no longer united. Spainwas under a separate Omayyad Caliph, North Africa, though nominally subject tothe Abbasids, was really independent, and presently (969) Egypt became aseparate power with a Shiite Caliph of its own, a pretender claiming descentfrom Ali and Fatima (the Fatimite Caliphate). These Egyptian Fatimites, thegreen flag Moslems, were fanatics in comparison with the Abbasids, and did muchto embitter the genial relations of Islam and Christianity. They took Jerusalem,and interfered with the Christian access to the Holy Sepulchre. On the otherside of the shrunken Abbasid domain there was also a Shiite kingdom in Persia.The chief Saracen conquest in the ninth century was Sicily; but this was notoverrun in the grand old style in a year or so, but subjugated tediously througha long century, and with many set-backs. The Spanish Saracens disputed in Sicilywith the Saracens from Africa. In Spain the Saracens were giving ground before arenascent Christian effort. Nevertheless, the Byzantine Empire and WesternChristendom were still so weak upon the Mediterranean Sea that the Saracenraiders and pirates from North Africa were able to raid almost unchallenged inSouth Italy and the Greek Islands.019 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_019_r1.gif]But now a new force was appearing in the Mediterranean. We have already remarkedthat the Roman Empire never extended itself to the shores of the Baltic Sea, norhad ever the vigour to push itself into Denmark. The Nordic Aryan peoples ofthese neglected regions learnt much from the empire that was unable to subduethem; as we have already noted, they developed the art of shipbuilding andbecame bold seamen; they spread across the North Sea to the west, and across theBaltic and up the Russian rivers into the very heart of what is now Russia. Oneof their earliest settlements in Russia was Novgorod the Great. There is thesame trouble and confusion for the student of history with these northern tribesas there is with the Scythians of classical times, and with the Hunnish Turkishpeoples of Eastern and Central Asia. They appear under a great variety of names,they change and intermingle. In the case of Britain, for example, the Angles,the Saxons, and Jutes conquered most of what is now England in the fifth andsixth centuries; the Danes, a second wave of practically the same people,followed in the eighth and ninth; and in 1016 a Danish King, Canute the Great,reigned in England, and not only over England, but over Denmark and Norway. Hissubjects sailed to Iceland, Greenland, and perhaps to the American continent.For a time, under Canute and his sons, it seemed possible that a greatconfederation of the Northmen might have established itself. Then in 1066 athird wave of the same people flowed over England from the “Norman” state inFrance, where the Northmen had been settled since the days of Rolf the Ganger(912), and where they had learnt to speak French. William, Duke of Normandy,became the William the Conqueror (1066) of English history. Practically, fromthe standpoint of universal history, all these peoples were the same people,waves of one Nordic stock. These waves were not only flowing westward, buteastward. Already we have mentioned a very interesting earlier movement of thesame peoples under the name of Goths from the Baltic to the Black Sea. We havetraced the splitting of these Goths into the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths, andthe adventurous wanderings that ended at last in the Ostrogoth kingdom in Italyand the Visigoth states in Spain. In the ninth century a second movement of theNorthmen across Russia was going on at the same time that their establishmentsin England and their dukedom of Normandy were coming into existence. Thepopulation of South Scotland, England, East Ireland, Flanders, Normandy, and theRussias have more elements in common than we are accustomed to recognize. Allare fundamentally Gothic and Nordic peoples. Even in their weights and measuresthe kinship of Russian and English is to be noted; both have the Norse inch andfoot, and many early Norman churches in England are built on a scale that showsthe use of the sajene (7 ft.) and quarter sajene, a Norse measure still used inRussia. These “Russian” Norsemen travelled in the summer-time, using the riverroutes that abounded in Russia; they carried their ships by portages from thenorthward-running rivers to those flowing southward. They appeared as pirates,raiders, and traders both upon the Caspian and the Black Sea. The Arabicchroniclers note their apparition upon the Caspian, and learnt to call themRussians. They raided Persia, and threatened Constantinople with a great fleetof small craft (in 865, 904, 941, and 1043).11[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en39] One of these Northmen, Rurik(circa 850), established himself as the ruler of Novgorod and his successor, theduke Oleg, took Kief, and laid the foundations of modern Russia. The fightingqualities of the Russian Vikings were speedily appreciated at Constantinople;the Greeks called them Varangians, and an Imperial Varangian bodyguard wasformed. After the conquest of England by the Normans (1066), a number of Danesand English were driven into exile and joined these Russian Varangians,apparently finding few obstacles to intercourse in their speech and habits.Meanwhile the Normans from Normandy were also finding their way into theMediterranean from the West. They came first as mercenaries, and later asindependent invaders; and they came mainly, not, it is to be noted, by sea, butin scattered bands by land. They came through the Rhineland and Italy partly inthe search for warlike employment and loot, partly as pilgrims. For the ninthand tenth centuries saw a great development of pilgrimage. These Normans, asthey grew powerful, discovered themselves such rapacious and vigorous robbersthat they forced the Eastern Emperor and the Pope into a feeble and ineffectivealliance against them (1053). They defeated and captured and were pardoned bythe Pope; they established themselves in Calabria and South Italy, conqueredSicily from the Saracens (1060-1090), and under Robert Guiscard, who had enteredItaly as a pilgrim adventurer and began his career as a brigand in Calabria,threatened the Byzantine Empire itself (1081). His army, which contained acontingent of Sicilian Moslems, crossed from Brindisi to Epirus in the reversedirection to that in which Pyrrhus had crossed to attack the Roman Republic,thirteen centuries before (275 B.C.). He laid siege to the Byzantine strongholdof Durazzo.Robert captured Durazzo (1082), but the pressure of affairs in Italy recalledhim, and ultimately put an end to this first Norman attack upon the Empire ofByzantium, leaving the way open for the rule of a comparatively vigorousComnenian dynasty (1081-1204). In Italy, amidst conflicts too complex for us totell here, it fell to Robert Guiscard to besiege and sack Rome (1084); andGibbon notes with quiet satisfaction the presence of that contingent of SicilianMoslems amongst the looters. There were in the twelfth century three otherNorman attacks upon the Eastern power, one by the son of Robert Guiscard, andthe two others directly from Sicily by sea. . . .020 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_020_r1.gif]But neither the Saracens nor the Normans pounded quite so heavily against theold empire at Byzantium or against the Holy Roman Empire, the vamped-up RomanEmpire of the West, as did the double thrust from the Turanian centres inCentral Asia, of which we must now tell. We have already noted the westwardmovement of the Avars, and the Turkish Magyars who followed in their track. Fromthe days of Pepin I onward, the Frankish power and its successors in Germanywere in conflict with these Eastern raiders along all the Eastern borderlands.Charlemagne held and punished them, and established some sort of overlordship asfar east as the Carpathians; but amidst the enfeeblement that followed hisdeath, these peoples, more or less blended now in the accounts under the name ofHungarians, led by the Magyars, re-established their complete freedom again, andraided yearly, often as far as the Rhine. They destroyed, Gibbon notes, themonastery of St. Gall in Switzerland, and the town of Bremen. Their greatraiding period was between 900 and 950. Their biggest effort, through Germanyright into France, thence over the Alps and home again by North Italy, was in938-9.Thrust southward by these disturbances, and by others to be presently noted, theBulgarians established themselves under Krum, between the Danube andConstantinople. Originally a Turkish people, the Bulgarians, since their firstappearance in the east of Russia, had become by repeated admixture almostentirely Slavonic in race and language. For some time after their establishmentin Bulgaria they remained pagan. Their king, Boris (852-884), entertained Moslemenvoys, and seems to have contemplated an adhesion to Islam, but finally hemarried a Byzantine princess, and handed himself and his people over to theChristian faith.021 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_021_r1.gif]The Hungarians were drubbed into a certain respect for civilization by Henry theFowler, the elected King of Germany, and Otto the First, the first Saxonemperor, in the tenth century. But they did not decide to adopt Christianityuntil about A.D. 1000. Though they were Christianized, they retained their ownTurko-Finnic language (Magyar), and they retain it to this day.Bulgarians and Hungarians do not, however, exhaust the catalogue of the peopleswhose westward movements embodied the Turkish thrust across South Russia. Behindthe Hungarians and Bulgarians thrust the Khazars, a Turkish people, with whomwere mingled a very considerable proportion of Jews who had been expelled fromConstantinople, and who had mixed with them and made many proselytes. To theseJewish Khazars are to be ascribed the great settlements of Jews in Poland andRussia.12 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en40] Behind the Khazarsagain, and overrunning them, were the Petschenegs (or Patzinaks), a savageTurkish people who are first heard of in the ninth century, and who weredestined to dissolve and vanish as the kindred Huns did five centuries before.And while the trend of all these peoples was westward, we have, when we arethinking of the present population of these South Russian regions, to rememberalso the coming and going of the Northmen between the Baltic and the Black Sea,who interwove with the Turkish migrants like warp and woof, and bear in mindalso that there was a considerable Slavonic population, the heirs anddescendants of Scythians, Sarmatians, and the like, already established in theserestless, lawless, but fertile areas. All these races mixed with and reactedupon one another. The universal prevalence of Slavonic languages, except inHungary, shows that the population remained predominantly Slav. And in what isnow Roumania, for all the passage of peoples, and in spite of conquest afterconquest, the tradition and inheritance of the Roman provinces of Dacia andMœsia Inferior still kept a Latin speech and memory alive.But this direct thrust of the Turkish peoples against Christendom to the northof the Black Sea was, in the end, not nearly so important as their indirectthrust south of it through the empire of the Caliph. We cannot deal here withthe tribes and dissensions of the Turkish peoples of Turkestan, nor with theparticular causes that brought to the fore the tribes under the rule of theSeljuk clan. In the eleventh century these Seljuk Turks broke with irresistibleforce not in one army, but in a group of armies, and under two brothers, intothe decaying fragments of the Moslem Empire. For Islam had long ceased to be oneempire. The orthodox Sunnite Abbasid rule had shrunken to what was onceBabylonia; and even in Bagdad the Caliph was the mere creature of his Turkishpalace guards. A sort of mayor of the palace, a Turk, was the real ruler. Eastof the Caliph, in Persia, and west of him in Palestine, Syria, and Egypt, wereShiite heretics. The Seljuk Turks were orthodox Sunnites; they now swept downupon and conquered the Shiite rulers and upstarts, and established themselves asthe protectors of the Bagdad Caliph, taking over the temporal powers of themayor of the palace. Very early they conquered Armenia from the Greeks, andthen, breaking the bounds that had restrained the power of Islam for fourcenturies, they swept on to the conquest of Asia Minor, almost to the gates ofConstantinople. The mountain barrier of Cilicia that had held the Moslem so longhad been turned by the conquest of Armenia from the north-east. Under AlpArslan, who had united all the Seljuk power in his own hands, the Turks utterlysmashed the Byzantine army at the battle of Manzikert, or Melasgird (1071). Theeffect of this battle upon people’s imaginations was very great. Islam, whichhad appeared far gone in decay, which had been divided religiously andpolitically, was suddenly discovered to have risen again, and it was the secureold Byzantine Empire that seemed on the brink of dissolution. The loss of AsiaMinor was very swift. The Seljuks established themselves at Iconium (Konia), inwhat is now Anatolia. In a little while they were in possession of the fortressof Nicæa over against the capital.§ 9We have already told of the attack of the Normans upon the Byzantine Empire fromthe west, and of the battle of Durazzo (1081); and we have noted thatConstantinople had still vivid memories of the Russia sea raids (1043).Bulgaria, it is true, had been tamed, but there was heavy and uncertain warfaregoing on with the Petschenegs. North and west, the emperor’s hands were full.This swift advance of the Turks into country that had been so long securelyByzantine must have seemed like the approach of final disaster. The EasternEmperor, Michael VII, under the pressure of these convergent dangers, took astep that probably seemed both to himself and to Rome of the utmost politicalsignificance. He appealed to the Pope, Gregory VII, for assistance. His appealwas repeated still more urgently by his successor, Alexius Comnenus, to PopeUrban II.To the counsellors of Rome this must have presented itself as a supremeopportunity for the assertion of the headship of the Pope over the entireChristian world.In this history we have traced the growth of this idea of a religious governmentof Christendom—and through Christendom of mankind—and we have shown hownaturally and how necessarily, because of the tradition of world empire, itfound a centre at Rome. The Pope of Rome was the only Western patriarch; he wasthe religious head of a vast region in which the ruling tongue was Latin; theother patriarchs of the Orthodox Church spoke Greek, and so were inaudiblethroughout his domains; and the two words filio que, which had been added to theLatin creed, had split off the Byzantine Christians by one of those impalpableand elusive doctrinal points upon which there is no reconciliation. (The finalrupture was in 1054.) The life of the Lateran changed in its quality with everyoccupant of the chair of St. Peter: sometimes papal Rome was a den of corruptionand uncleanness, as it had been in the days of John XII; sometimes it waspervaded by the influence of widely thinking and nobly thinking men. But behindthe Pope was the assembly of the cardinals, priests, and a great number ofhighly educated officials, who never, even in the darkest and wildest days, lostsight altogether of the very grand idea of a divine world dominion, of a peaceof Christ throughout the earth that St. Augustine had expressed. Through all theMiddle Ages that idea was the guiding influence in Rome. For a time, perhaps,mean minds would prevail there, and in the affairs of the world Rome would playthe part of a greedy, treacherous, and insanely cunning old woman; followed aphase of masculine and quite worldly astuteness perhaps, or a phase ofexaltation. Came an interlude of fanaticism or pedantry, when all the pressurewas upon exact doctrine. Or there was a moral collapse, and the Lateran becamethe throne of some sensuous or æsthetic autocrat, ready to sell every hope orhonour the church could give for money to spend upon pleasure or display. Yet,on the whole, the papal ship kept its course, and came presently into the windagain.In this period to which we have now come, the period of the eleventh century, wediscover a Rome dominated by the personality of an exceptionally greatstatesman, Hildebrand, who occupied various official positions under asuccession of Popes, and finally became Pope himself under the name of GregoryVII (1073-1085). We find that under his influence, vice, sloth, and corruptionhave been swept out of the church, that the method of electing the Popes hasbeen reformed, and that a great struggle has been waged with the Emperor uponthe manifestly vital question of “investitures,” the question whether Pope ortemporal monarch should have the decisive voice in the appointment of thebishops in their domains. Vital that question was not only to the church, but tothe monarchs, for in many countries more than a quarter of the land was clericalproperty. Hitherto the Roman clergy had been able to marry; but now, to detachthem effectually from the world and to make them more completely the instrumentsof the church, celibacy was imposed upon all priests. . . .Gregory VII had been prevented by his struggle over the investitures from anyeffectual answer to the first appeal from Byzantium; but he had left a worthysuccessor in Urban II (1087- 1099); and when the letter of Alexius came to hand,Urban seized at once upon the opportunity it afforded for drawing together allthe thoughts and forces of Western Europe into one passion and purpose. Therebyhe might hope to end the private warfare that prevailed, and find a properoutlet for the immense energy of the Normans. He saw, too, an opportunity ofthrusting the Byzantine power and Church aside, and extending the influence ofthe Latin Church over Syria, Palestine, and Egypt. The envoys of Alexius wereheard at a church council, hastily summoned at Piazenza (= Placentia), and nextyear (1095) at Clermont, Urban held a second great council, in which all theslowly gathered strength of the Church was organized for a universal warpropaganda against the Moslems. Private war, all war among Christians, was tocease until the infidel had been swept back and the site of the Holy Sepulchrewas again in Christian hands.The fervour of the response enables us to understand the great work of creativeorganization that had been done in Western Europe in the previous fivecenturies. In the beginning of the seventh century we saw Western Europe as achaos of social and political fragments, with no common idea nor hope, a systemshattered almost to a dust of self-seeking individuals. Now in the dawn of theeleventh century there is everywhere a common belief, a linking idea, to whichmen may devote themselves, and by which they can cooperate together in auniversal enterprise. We realize that, in spite of much weakness andintellectual and moral unsoundness, to this extent the Christian Church hasworked. We are able to measure the evil phases of tenth-century Rome, thescandals, the filthiness, the murders and violence, at their proper value by thescale of this fact. No doubt also all over Christendom there had been many lazy,evil, and foolish priests; but it is manifest that this task of teaching andcoordination that had been accomplished could have been accomplished onlythrough a great multitude of right-living priests and monks and nuns. A new andgreater amphictyony, the amphictyony of Christendom, had come into the world,and it had been built by thousands of anonymous, faithful lives.And this response to the appeal of Urban the Second was not confined only towhat we should call educated people. It was not simply knights and princes whowere willing to go upon this crusade. Side by side with the figure of Urban wemust put the figure of Peter the Hermit, a type novel to Europe, albeit a littlereminiscent of the Hebrew prophets. This man appeared preaching the crusade tothe common people. He told a story—whether truthful or untruthful hardly mattersin this connection —of his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, of the wanton destruction atthe Holy Sepulchre by the Seljuk Turks, who took it in 1073, and of theexactions, brutalities, and deliberate cruelties practised upon the Christianpilgrims to the Holy Places. Barefooted, clad in a coarse garment, riding on anass, and bearing a huge cross, this man travelled about France and Germany, andeverywhere harangued vast crowds in church or street or market-place.Here for the first time we discover Europe with an idea and a soul! Here is auniversal response of indignation at the story of a remote wrong, a swiftunderstanding of a common cause for rich and poor alike. You cannot imagine thisthing happening in the Empire of Augustus Cæsar, or indeed in any previous statein the world’s history. Something of the kind might perhaps have been possiblein the far smaller world of Hellas, or in Arabia before Islam. But this movementaffected nations, kingdoms, tongues, and peoples. It is clear that we aredealing with something new that has come into the world, a new clear connectionof the common interest with the consciousness of the common man.§ 10From the very first this flaming enthusiasm was mixed with baser elements. Therewas the cold and calculated scheme of the free and ambitious Latin Church tosubdue and replace the emperor-ruled Byzantine Church; there was the freebootinginstinct of the Normans, who were tearing Italy to pieces, which turned readilyenough to a new and richer world of plunder; and there was something in themultitude who now turned their faces east, something deeper than love in thehuman composition, namely, fear-born hate, that the impassioned appeals of thepropagandists and the exaggeration of the horrors and cruelties of the infidelhad fanned into flame. And there was still other forces; the intolerant Seljuksand the intolerant Fatimites lay now an impassable barrier across the eastwardtrade of Genoa and Venice that had hitherto flowed through Bagdad and Aleppo, orthrough Egypt. They must force open these closed channels, unless Constantinopleand the Black Sea route were to monopolize Eastern trade altogether. Moreover,in 1094 and 1095 there had been a pestilence and famine from the Scheldt toBohemia, and there was great social disorganization. “No wonder,” says Mr.Earnest Barker, “that a stream of emigration set towards the East, such as wouldin modern times flow towards a newly discovered goldfield—a stream carrying inits turbid waters much refuse, tramps and bankrupts, camp-followers andhucksters, fugitive monks and escaped villeins, and marked by the same motleygrouping, the same fever of life, the same alternations of affluence andbeggary, which mark the rush for a goldfield today.”But these were secondary contributory causes. The fact of predominant interestto the historian of mankind is this will to crusade suddenly revealed as a newmass possibility in human affairs.022 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_022_r1.gif]The story of the crusades abounds in such romantic and picturesque detail thatthe writer of an Outline of History must ride his pen upon the curb through thisalluring field. The first forces to move eastward were great crowds ofundisciplined people rather than armies, and they sought to make their way bythe valley of the Danube, and thence southward to Constantinople. This was the“people’s crusade.” Never before in the whole history of the world had therebeen such a spectacle as these masses of practically leaderless people moved byan idea. It was a very crude idea. When they got among foreigners, they do notseem to have realized that they were not already among the infidel. Two greatmobs, the advance guard of the expedition, committed such excesses in Hungary,where the language must have been incomprehensible to them, as to provoke theHungarians to destroy them. They were massacred. A third host began with a greatpogrom of the Jews in the Rhineland—for the Christian blood was up—and thismultitude was also dispersed in Hungary. Two other hosts under Peter got throughand reached Constantinople, to the astonishment and dismay of the EmperorAlexius. They looted and committed outrages as they came, and at last he shippedthem across the Bosphorus, to be massacred rather than defeated by the Seljuks(1096).This first unhappy appearance of the “people” as people in modern Europeanhistory was followed in 1097 by the organized forces of the First Crusade. Theycame by diverse routes from France, Normandy, Flanders, England, Southern Italyand Sicily, and the will and power of them were the Normans. They crossed theBosphorus and captured Nicæa, which Alexius snatched away from them before theycould loot it. They then went by much the same route as Alexander the Great,through the Cilician Gates, leaving the Turks in Konia unconquered, past thebattlefield of the Issus, and so to Antioch, which they took after nearly ayear’s siege. Then they defeated a great relieving army from Mosul. A large partof the Crusaders remained in Antioch, a smaller force under Godfrey of Bouillon(in Belgium) went on to Jerusalem. “After a little more than a month’s siege,the city was finally captured (July 15). The slaughter was terrible; the bloodof the conquered ran down the streets, until men splashed in blood as they rode.At nightfall, ‘sobbing for excess of joy,’ the crusaders came to the Sepulchrefrom their treading of the winepress, and put their blood stained hands togetherin prayer. So, on that day of July, the First Crusade came to an end.”13[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en41]The authority of the Patriarch of Jerusalem was at once seized upon by the Latinclergy with the expedition, and the Orthodox Christians found themselves inrather a worse case under Latin rule than under the Turk. There were alreadyLatin principalities established at Antioch and Edessa, and there began astruggle for ascendancy between these various courts and kings, and anunsuccessful attempt to make Jerusalem a property of the Pope. These arecomplications beyond our present scope.Let us quote, however, a characteristic passage from Gibbon:—“In a style less grave than that of history, I should perhaps compare theEmperor Alexius to the jackal, who is said to follow the steps and to devour theleavings of the lion. Whatever had been his fears and toils in the passage ofthe First Crusade, they were amply recompensed by the subsequent benefits whichhe derived from the exploits of the franks. His dexterity and vigilance securedtheir first conquest of Nicæa, and from this threatening station the Turks werecompelled to evacuate the neighbourhood of Constantinople. While the Crusaders,with blind valour, advanced into the midland countries of Asia, the crafty Greekimproved the favourable occasion when the emirs of the sea coast were recalledto the standard of the Sultan. The Turks were driven from the isles of Rhodesand Chios; the cities of Ephesus and Smyrna, of Sardes, Philadelphia, andLaodicea were restored to the empire, which Alexius enlarged from the Hellespontto the banks of the Mæander and the rocky shores of Pamphylia. The churchesresumed their splendour; the towns were rebuilt and fortified; and the desertcountry was peopled with colonies of Christians, who were gently removed fromthe more distant and dangerous frontier. In these paternal cares we may forgiveAlexius, if we forget the deliverance of the holy sepulchre; but, by the Latins,he was stigmatized with the foul reproach of treason and desertion. They hadsworn fidelity and obedience to his throne; but he had promised to assist theirenterprise in person, or at least, with his troops and treasures; his baseretreat dissolved their obligations; and the sword, which had been theinstrument of their victory, was the pledge and title of their justindependence. It does not appear that the emperor attempted to revive hisobsolete claims over the kingdom of Jerusalem, but the borders of Cilicia andSyria were more recent in his possession and more accessible to his arms. Thegreat army of the Crusaders was annihilated or dispersed; the principality ofAntioch was left without a head, by the surprise and captivity of Bohemond; hisransom had oppressed him with a heavy debt; and his Norman followers wereinsufficient to repel the hostilities of the Greeks and Turks. In this distress,Bohemond embraced a magnanimous resolution, of leaving the defence of Antioch tohis kinsman, the faithful Tancred; of arming the West against the ByzantineEmpire, and of executing the design which he inherited from the lessons andexample of his father Guiscard. His embarkation was clandestine; and if we maycredit a tale of the Princess Anna, he passed the hostile sea closely secretedin a coffin. (Anna Comnena adds, that to complete the imitation, he was shut upwith a dead cock; and condescends to wonder how the barbarian could endure theconfinement and putrefaction. This absurd tale is unknown to the Latins.) Buthis reception in France was dignified by the public applause and his marriagewith the king’s daughter; his return was glorious, since the bravest spirits ofthe age enlisted under his veteran command; and he repassed the Adriatic at thehead of five thousand horse and forty thousand foot, assembled from the mostremote climates of Europe. The strength of Durazzo and prudence of Alexius, theprogress of famine and approach of winter, eluded his ambitious hopes; and thevenal confederates were seduced from his standard. A treaty of peace suspendedthe fears of the Greeks.”We have dealt thus lengthily with the First Crusade, because it displayscompletely the quality of all these expeditions. The reality of the strugglebetween the Latin and the Byzantine system became more and more nakedlyapparent. In 1101 came reinforcements, in which the fleet of the mercantilerepublics of Venice and Genoa played a prominent part, and the power of thekingdom of Jerusalem was extended. The year 1147 saw a Second Crusade, in whichboth the Emperor Conrad III and King Louis of France participated. It was a muchmore stately and far less successful and enthusiastic expedition than itspredecessor. It had been provoked by the fall of Edessa to the Moslems in 1144.One large division of Germans, instead of going to the Holy Land, attacked andsubjugated the still pagan Wends east of the Elbe. This, the Pope agreed,counted as crusading, and so did the capture of Lisbon, and the foundation ofthe Christian kingdom of Portugal by the Flemish and English contingents.In 1169 a Kurdish adventurer, named Saladin, became ruler of Egypt, in whichcountry the Shiite heresy had now fallen before a Sunnite revival. This Saladinreunited the efforts of Egypt and Bagdad, and preached a Jehad, a Holy War, acounter-crusade, of all the Moslems against the Christians. This Jehad excitedalmost as much feeling in Islam as the First Crusade had done in Christendom. Itwas now a case of crusader against crusader; and in 1187 Jerusalem was retaken.This provoked the Third Crusade (1189). This also was a grand affair, plannedjointly by the Emperor Frederick I (known better as Frederick Barbarossa), theKing of France, and the King of England (who at that time owned many of thefairest French provinces). The papacy played a secondary part in thisexpedition; it was in one of its phases of enfeeblement; and the crusade was themost courtly, chivalrous, and romantic of all. Religious bitterness wasmitigated by the idea of knightly gallantry, which obsessed both Saladin andRichard I (1189-1199) of England (Cœur-de-Lion), and the lover of romance mayvery well turn to the romances about this period for its flavour. The crusadesaved the principality of Antioch for a time, but failed to retake Jerusalem.The Christians, however, remained in possession of the sea-coast of Palestine.By the time of the Third Crusade, the magic and wonder had gone out of thesemovements altogether. The common people had found them out. Men went, but onlykings and nobles straggled back; and that often only after heavy taxation for aransom. The idea of the crusades was cheapened by their too frequent and trivialuse. Whenever the Pope quarrelled with anyone now, he called for a crusade,until the word ceased to mean anything but an attempt to give flavour to anunpalatable civil war. There was a crusade against the heretics in the south ofFrance, one against John (King of England), one against the Emperor FrederickII. The Popes did not understand the necessity of dignity to the papacy. Theyhad achieved a moral ascendancy in Christendom. Forthwith they began to fritterit away. They not only cheapened the idea of the crusades, but they made theirtremendous power of excommunication, of putting people outside all thesacraments, hopes, and comforts of religion, ridiculous by using it in meredisputes of policy. Frederick II was not only crusaded against, butexcommunicated—without visible injury. He was excommunicated again in 1239, andthis sentence was renewed by Innocent IV in 1245.The bulk of the Fourth Crusade never reached the Holy land at all. It startedfrom Venice (1202), captured Zara, encamped at Constantinople (1203), andfinally, in 1204, stormed the city. It was frankly a combined attack on theByzantine Empire. Venice took much of the coasts and islands of the empire, anda Latin, Baldwin of Flanders, was set up as emperor in Constantinople. The Latinand Greek Churches were declared to be reunited, and Latin emperors ruled asconquerors in Constantinople from 1204 to 1261.In 1212 occurred a dreadful thing, a children’s crusade. An excitement thatcould no longer affect sane adults was spread among the children in the south ofFrance and in the Rhone valley. A crowd of many thousands of French boys marchedto Marseilles; they were then lured on board ship by slave traders, who soldthem into slavery in Egypt. The Rhineland children tramped into Italy, manyperishing by the way, and there dispersed. Pope Innocent III made great capitalout of this strange business. “The very children put us to shame,” he said; andsought to whip up enthusiasm for a Fifth Crusade. This crusade aimed at theconquest of Egypt, because Jerusalem was now held by the Egyptian Sultan; itsremnants returned in 1221, after an inglorious evacuation of its one capture,Damietta, with the Jerusalem vestiges of the True Cross as a sort of consolationconcession on the part of the victor. We have already noted the earlieradventures of this venerable relic before the days of Muhammad when it wascarried off by Chosroes II to Ctesiphon, and recovered by the Emperor Heraclius.Fragments of the True Cross, however, had always been in Rome at the church ofS. Croce-in-Gerusa-lemme, since the days of the Empress Helena (the mother ofConstantine the Great) to whom, says the legend, its hiding-place had beenrevealed in a vision during her pilgrimage to the Holy Land.14[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en42]The Sixth Crusade (1229) was a crusade bordering upon absurdity. The EmperorFrederick II had promised to go upon a crusade, and evaded his vow. He had madea false start and returned. He was probably bored by the mere idea of a crusade.But the vow had been part of the bargain by which he secured the support of PopeInnocent III in his election as emperor. He busied himself in reorganizing thegovernment of his Sicilian kingdom, though he had given the Pope to understandthat he would relinquish those possessions if he became emperor; and the Popewas anxious to stop this process of consolidation by sending him to the HolyLand. The Pope did not want Frederick II, or any German emperor at all in Italy,because he himself wished to rule Italy. As Frederick II remained evasive,Gregory IX excommunicated him, proclaimed a crusade against him, and invaded hisdominions in Italy (1228). Whereupon the Emperor sailed with an army to the HolyLand. There he had a meeting with the Sultan of Egypt (the Emperor spoke sixlanguages freely, including Arabic); and it would seem these two gentlemen, bothof sceptical opinions, exchanged views of a congenial sort, discussed the Popein a worldly spirit, debated the Mongolian rush westward, which threatened themboth alike, and agreed finally to a commercial convention, and the surrender ofa part of the kingdom of Jerusalem to Frederick. This indeed was a new sort ofcrusade, a crusade by private treaty. As this astonishing crusader had beenexcommunicated, he had to indulge in a purely secular coronation in Jerusalem,taking the crown from the altar with his own hand, in a church from which allthe clergy had gone. Probably there was no one to show him the Holy Places;indeed these were presently all put under an interdict by the Patriarch ofJerusalem and locked up; manifestly the affair differed altogether in spiritfrom the red onslaught of the First Crusade. It had not even the kindlysociability of the Caliph Omar’s visit six hundred years before. Frederick IIrode out of Jerusalem almost alone, returned from this unromantic success toItaly, put his affairs there in order very rapidly, chased the papal armies outof his possessions, and obliged the Pope to give him absolution from hisexcommunication (1230). This Sixth Crusade was indeed not only the reductio adabsurdum of crusades, but of papal excommunications. Of this Frederick II weshall tell more in a later section, because he was very typical of certain newforces that were coming into European affairs.The Christians lost Jerusalem again in 1244; it was taken from them very easilyby the Sultan of Egypt when they attempted an intrigue against him. Thisprovoked the Seventh Crusade, the Crusade of St. Louis, King of France (LouisIX), who was taken prisoner in Egypt and ransomed in 1250. Not until 1918, whenit fell to a mixed force of French, British, and Indian troops, did Jerusalemslip once more from the Moslem grasp. . . .One more crusade remains to be noted, an expedition to Tunis by this same LouisIX, who died of fever there.§ 11The essential interest of the crusades for the historian of mankind lies in thewave of emotion, of unifying feeling, that animated the first. Thereafter theseexpeditions became more and more an established process, and less and less vitalevents. The First Crusade was an occurrence like the discovery of America; thelater ones were more and more like a trip across the Atlantic. In the eleventhcentury, the idea of the crusade must have been like a strange and wonderfullight in the sky; in the thirteenth one can imagine honest burghers saying intones of protest, “What! another crusade!” The experience of St. Louis in Egyptis not like a fresh experience for mankind; it is much more like a round of golfover some well-known links, a round that was dogged by misfortune. It is aninsignificant series of events. The interest of life had shifted to otherdirections.The beginning of the crusades displays all Europe saturated by a naïveChristianity, and ready to follow the leading of the Pope trustfully and simply.The scandals of the Lateran during its evil days, with which we are all sofamiliar now, were practically unknown outside Rome. And Gregory VII and UrbanII had redeemed all that. But intellectually and morally their successors at theLateran and the Vatican15 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en43] werenot equal to their opportunities. The strength of the papacy lay in the faithmen had in it, and it used that faith so carelessly as to enfeeble it. Rome hasalways had too much of the shrewdness of the priest and too little of the powerof the prophet. So that while the eleventh century was a century of ignorant andconfiding men, the thirteenth was an age of knowing and disillusioned men. Itwas a far more civilized and profoundly sceptical world.The bishops, priests, and the monastic institutions of Latin Christendom beforethe days of Gregory VII had been perhaps rather loosely linked together and veryvariable in quality; but it is clear that they were, as a rule, intenselyintimate with the people among whom they found themselves, and with much of thespirit of Jesus still alive in them; they were trusted, and they had enormouspower within the conscience of their followers. The church, in comparison withits later state, was more in the hands of local laymen and the local ruler; itlacked its later universality. The energetic bracing up of the churchorganization by Gregory VII, which was designed to increase the central power ofRome, broke many subtle filaments between priest and monastery on the one hand,and the countryside about them on the other. Men of faith and wisdom believe ingrowth and their fellow men; but priests, even such priests as Gregory VII,believe in the false “efficiency” of an imposed discipline. The squabble overinvestitures made every prince in Christendom suspicious of the bishops asagents of a foreign power; this suspicion filtered down to the parishes. Thepolitical enterprises of the papacy necessitated an increasing demand for money.Already in the thirteenth century it was being said everywhere that the priestswere not good men, that they were always hunting for money.In the days of ignorance there had been an extraordinary willingness to believethe Catholic priesthood good and wise. Relatively it was better and wiser inthose days. Great powers beyond her spiritual functions had been entrusted tothe church, and very extraordinary freedoms. Of this confidence the fullestadvantage had been taken. In the Middle Ages the church had become a statewithin the state. It had its own law courts. Cases involving not merely priests,but monks, students, crusaders, widows, orphans, and the helpless, were reservedfor the clerical courts; and whenever the rites or rules of the church wereinvolved, there the church claimed jurisdiction over such matters as wills,marriage, oaths, and of course over heresy, sorcery, and blasphemy. There werenumerous clerical prisons in which offenders might pine all their lives. ThePope was the supreme law-giver of Christendom, and his court at Rome the finaland decisive court of appeal. And the church levied taxes; it had not only vastproperties and a great income from fees, but it imposed a tax of a tenth, thetithe, upon its subjects. It did not call for this as a pious benefaction; itdemanded it as a right. The clergy, on the other hand, were now claimingexemption from lay taxation.This attempt to trade upon their peculiar prestige and evade their share infiscal burdens was certainly one very considerable factor in the growingdissatisfaction with the clergy. Apart from any question of justice, it wasimpolitic. It made taxes seem ten times more burthensome to those who had topay. It made everyone feel the immunities of the church. And a still moreextravagant and unwise claim made by the church was the claim to the power ofdispensation. The Pope might in many instances set aside the laws of the churchin individual cases; he might allow cousins to marry, permit a man to have twowives, or release anyone from a vow. But to do such things is to admit that thelaws affected are not based upon necessity and an inherent righteousness; thatthey are in fact restrictive and vexatious. The law-giver, of all beings, mostowes the law allegiance. He of all men should behave as though the law compelledhim. But it is the universal weakness of mankind that what we are given toadminister we presently imagine we own.§ 12The Emperor Frederick II is a very convenient example of the sort of doubter andrebel the thirteenth century could produce. It may be interesting to tell alittle of this intelligent and cynical man. He was the son of the GermanEmperor, Henry VI, and grandson of Frederick Barbarossa, and his mother was thedaughter of Roger I, the Norman King of Sicily. He inherited this kingdom in1198, when he was four years old; his mother was his guardian for six months,and when she died, Pope Innocent III (1198 to 1216) became regent and guardian.He seems to have had an exceptionally good and remarkably mixed education, andhis accomplishments earned him the flattering title of Stupor mundi, theamazement of the world. The result of getting an Arabic view of Christianity,and a Christian view of Islam, was to make him believe that all religions wereimpostures, a view held perhaps by many a stifled observer in the Age of Faith.But he talked about his views; his blasphemies and heresies are on record.Growing up under the arrogant rule of Innocent III, who never seems to haverealized that his ward had come of age, he developed a slightly humorousevasiveness. It was the papal policy to prevent any fresh coalescence of thepower of Germany and Italy, and it was equally Frederick’s determination to getwhatever he could. When presently opportunity offered him the imperial crown ofGermany, he secured the Pope’s support by agreeing, if he were elected, torelinquish his possessions in Sicily and South Italy, and to put down heresy inGermany. For Innocent III was one of the great persecuting Popes, an able,grasping, and aggressive man. (For a Pope, he was exceptionally young. He becamePope at thirty-seven.) It was Innocent who had preached a cruel crusade againstthe heretics in the south of France, a crusade that presently became a lootingexpedition beyond his control. So soon as Frederick was elected emperor(1211),16 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en44] Innocent pressed forthe performance of the vows and promises he had wrung from his dutiful ward. Theclergy were to be free from lay jurisdiction and from taxation, and exemplarycruelties were to be practised upon the heretics. None of which things Frederickdid. As we have already told, he would not even relinquish Sicily. He likedSicily as a place of residence better than he liked Germany.Innocent III died baffled in 1216, and his successor, Honorius III, effectednothing. Honorius was succeeded by Gregory IX (1227), who evidently came to thepapal throne with a nervous resolution to master this perplexing young man. Heexcommunicated him at once for failing to start upon his crusade, which was nowtwelve years overdue; and he denounced his vices, heresies, and general offencesin a public letter (1227). To this Frederick replied in a far abler documentaddressed to all the princes of Europe, a document of extreme importance inhistory, because it is the first clear statement of the issue between thepretensions of the Pope to be absolute ruler of all Christendom, and the claimsof the secular rulers.17 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en45] Thisconflict had always been smouldering; it had broken out here in one form, andthere in another; but now Frederick put it in clear general terms upon which mencould combine together.Having delivered this blow, he departed upon the pacific crusade of which wehave already told. In 1239, Gregory IX was excommunicating him for a secondtime, and renewing that warfare of public abuse in which the papacy had alreadysuffered severely. The controversy was revived after Gregory IX was dead, whenInnocent IV was Pope; and again a devastating letter, which men were bound toremember, was written by Frederick against the church. He denounced the prideand irreligion of the clergy, and ascribed all the corruptions of the time totheir pride and wealth. He proposed to his fellow princes a general confiscationof church property—for the good of the church. It was a suggestion that neverafterwards left the imagination of the European princes.We will not go on to tell of his last years or of the disaster at Parma, due tohis carelessness, which cast a shadow of failure over his end. The particularevents of his life are far less significant than its general atmosphere. It ispossible to piece together something of his court life in Sicily. He isdescribed towards the end of his life as “red, bald, and short-sighted”; but hisfeatures were good and pleasing. He was luxurious in his way of living, and fondof beautiful thing. He is described as licentious. But it is clear that his mindwas not satisfied by religious scepticism, and that he was a man of veryeffectual curiosity and inquiry. He gathered Jewish and Moslem as well asChristian philosophers at his court, and he did much to irrigate the Italianmind with Saracenic influences. Through him Arabic numerals and algebra wereintroduced to Christian students, and among other philosophers at his court wasMichael Scott, who translated portions of Aristotle and the commentaries thereonof the great Arab philosopher Averroes (of Cordoba). In 1224 Frederick foundedthe University of Naples, and he enlarged and enriched the great medical schoolat Salerno University, the most ancient of universities. He also founded azoological garden. He left a book on hawking, which shows him to have been anacute observer of the habits of birds, and he was one of the first Italians towrite Italian verse. Italian poetry was indeed born at his court. He has beencalled by an able writer, “the first of the moderns,” and the phrase expressesaptly the unprejudiced detachment of his intellectual side. His was an all-roundoriginality. During a gold shortage he introduced and made a success of acoinage of stamped leather, bearing his promise to pay in gold, a sort ofleather bank-note issue.18 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en46]In spite of the torrent of abuse and calumny in which Frederick was drenched, heleft a profound impression upon the popular imagination. He is still rememberedin South Italy almost as vividly as is Napoleon I by the peasants of France; heis the “Gran Federigo.” And German scholars declare that, in spite ofFrederick’s manifest dislike for Germany, it is he, and not Frederick I,Frederick Barbarossa, to whom that German legend originally attached—that legendwhich represents a great monarch slumbering in a deep cavern, his beard grownround a stone table, against a day of awakening when the world will be restoredby him from an extremity of disorder to peace. Afterwards, it seems, the storywas transferred to the Crusader Barbarossa, the grandfather of Frederick II.A difficult child was Frederick II for Mother Church, and he was only theprecursor of many such difficult children. The princes and educated gentlementhroughout Europe read his letters and discussed them. The more enterprisinguniversity students found, marked, and digested the Arabic Aristotle he had madeaccessible to them in Latin. Salerno cast a baleful light upon Rome. All sortsof men must have been impressed by the futility of the excommunications andinterdicts that were levelled at Frederick.§ 13We have said that Innocent III never seemed to realize that his ward, FrederickII, was growing up. It is equally true that the papacy never seemed to realizethat Europe was growing up. It is impossible for an intelligent modern studentof history not to sympathize with the underlying idea of the papal court, withthe idea of one universal rule of righteousness keeping the peace of the earth,and not to recognize the many elements of nobility that entered into the Lateranpolicy. Sooner or later mankind must come to one universal peace, unless ourrace is to be destroyed by the increasing power of its own destructiveinventions; and that universal peace must needs take the form of a government,that is to say a law-sustaining organization, in the best sense of the wordreligious; a government ruling men through the educated coordination of theirminds in a common conception of human history and human destiny.The papacy we must now recognize as the first clearly conscious attempt toprovide such a government in the world. We cannot too earnestly examine itsdeficiencies and inadequacies, for every lesson we can draw from them isnecessarily of the greatest value to us in forming our ideas of our owninternational relationships. We have tried to suggest the main factors in thebreakdown of the Roman Republic, and it now behoves us to attempt a diagnosis ofthe failure of the Roman Church to secure and organize the good will of mankind.The first thing that will strike the student is the intermittence of the effortsof the church to establish the world City of God. The policy of the church wasnot whole-heartedly and continuously set upon that end. It was only now and thenthat some fine personality or some group of fine personalities dominated it inthat direction. The kingdom of God that Jesus of Nazareth had preached wasoverlaid, as we have explained, almost from the beginning by the doctrines andceremonial traditions of an earlier age, and of an intellectually inferior type.Christianity almost from its commencement ceased to be purely prophetic andcreative. It entangled itself with archaic traditions of human sacrifice, withMithraic blood-cleansing, with priestcraft as ancient as human society, and withelaborate doctrines about the structure of the divinity. The gory forefinger ofthe Etruscan pontifex maximus emphasized the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth; themental complexity of the Alexandrian Greek entangled them. In the inevitablejangle of these incompatibles the church had become dogmatic. In despair ofother solutions to its intellectual discords it had resorted to arbitraryauthority. Its priests and bishops were more and more men moulded to creeds anddogmas and set procedures; by the time they became cardinals or popes they wereusually oldish men, habituated to a politic struggle for immediate ends and nolonger capable of world-wide views. They no longer wanted to see the Kingdom ofGod established in the hearts of men—they had forgotten about that; they wantedto see the power of the church, which was their own power, dominating men. Theywere prepared to bargain even with the hates and fears and lusts in men’s heartsto ensure that power. And it was just because many of them probably doubtedsecretly of the entire soundness of their vast and elaborate doctrinal fabric,that they would brook no discussion of it. They were intolerant of questions ordissent, not because they were sure of their faith, but because they were not.They wanted conformity for reasons of policy. By the thirteenth century thechurch was evidently already morbidly anxious about the gnawing doubts thatmight presently lay the whole structure of its pretensions in ruins. It had noserenity of soul. It was hunting everywhere for heretics as timid old ladies aresaid to look under beds and in cupboards for burglars before retiring for thenight.We have already mentioned the Persian Mani, who was crucified and flayed in theyear 277. His way of representing the struggle between good and evil was as astruggle between a power of light which was, as it were, in rebellion against apower of darkness inherent in the universe. All these profound mysteries arenecessarily represented by symbols and poetic expressions, and the ideas of Manistill find a response in many intellectual temperaments today. One may hearManichæan doctrines from many Christian pulpits. But the orthodox Catholicsymbol was a different one. These Manichæan ideas had spread very widely inEurope, and particularly in Bulgaria and the south of France. In the south ofFrance the people who held them were called the Cathars or Albigenses. Theirideas jarred so little with the essentials of Christianity, that they believedthemselves to be devout Christians. As a body they lived lives of conspicuousvirtue and purity in a violent, undisciplined, and vicious age. But theyquestioned the doctrinal soundness of Rome and the orthodox interpretation ofthe Bible. They thought Jesus was a rebel against the cruelty of the God of theOld Testament, and not his harmonious son. Closely associated with theAlbigenses were the Waldenses, the followers of a man called Waldo, who seems tohave been quite soundly Catholic in his theology, but equally offensive to thechurch because he denounced the riches and luxury of the clergy. This was enoughfor the Lateran, and so we have the spectacle of Innocent III preaching acrusade against these unfortunate sectaries and permitting the enlistment ofevery wandering scoundrel at loose ends to carry fire and sword and rape andevery conceivable outrage among the most peaceful subjects of the King ofFrance. The accounts of the cruelties and abominations of this crusade are farmore terrible to read than any account of Christian martyrdoms by the pagans,and they have the added horror of being indisputably true.This black and pitiless intolerance was an evil spirit to be mixed into theproject of a rule of God on earth. This was a spirit entirely counter to that ofJesus of Nazareth. We do not hear of his smacking the faces or wringing thewrists of recalcitrant or unresponsive disciples. But the Popes during theircenturies of power were always raging against the slightest reflection upon theintellectual sufficiency of the church.And the intolerance of the church was not confined to religious matters. Theshrewd, pompous, irascible, and rather malignant old men who manifestlyconstituted a dominant majority in the councils of the church resented anyknowledge but their own knowledge, and distrusted any thought at all that theydid not correct and control. They set themselves to restrain science, of whichthey were evidently jealous. Any mental activity but their own struck them asbeing insolent. Later on they were to have a great struggle upon the question ofthe earth’s position in space, and whether it moved round the sun or not. Thiswas really not the business of the church at all. She might very well have leftto reason the things that are reason’s, but she seems to have been impelled byan inner necessity to estrange the intellectual conscience in men.Had this intolerance sprung from a real intensity of conviction it would havebeen bad enough, but it was accompanied by a scarcely disguised contempt for theintelligence and mental dignity of the common man that makes it far lessacceptable to our modern judgments, and which no doubt made it far lessacceptable to the free spirits of the time. We have told quite dispassionatelythe policy of the Roman church towards her troubled sister in the East. Many ofthe tools and expedients she used were abominable. In her treatment of her ownpeople a streak of real cynicism is visible. She destroyed her prestige bydisregarding her own teaching of righteousness. Of dispensations we have alreadyspoken (§ 11). Her crowning folly in the sixteenth century was the sale ofindulgences, whereby the sufferings of the soul in purgatory could be commutedfor a money payment. But the spirit that led at last to this shameless and, asit proved, disastrous proceeding, was already very evident in the twelfth andthirteenth centuries.Long before the seed of criticism that Frederick II had sown had germinated inmen’s minds and produced its inevitable crop of rebellion, there was apparent astrong feeling in Christendom that all was not well with the spiritualatmosphere. There began movements, movements that nowadays we should call“revivalist,” within the church, that implied rather than uttered a criticism ofthe sufficiency of her existing methods and organization. Men sought fresh formsof righteous living outside the monasteries and priesthood. One notable figureis that of St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226). We cannot tell here in any detailof how this pleasant young gentleman gave up all the amenities and ease of hislife and went forth to seek God; the opening of the story is not unlike theearly experiences of Gautama Buddha. He had a sudden conversion in the midst ofa life of pleasure, and, taking a vow of extreme poverty, he gave himself up toan imitation of the life of Christ, and to the service of the sick and wretched,and more particularly to the service of the lepers, who then abounded in Italy.He was joined by great multitudes of disciples, and so the first Friars of theFranciscan Order came into existence. An order of women devotees was set upbeside the original confraternity, and in addition great numbers of men andwomen were brought into less formal association. He preached, unmolested by theMoslems, be it noted, in Egypt and Palestine, though the Fifth Crusade was thenin progress. His relations with the church are still a matter for discussion.His work had been sanctioned by Pope Innocent III, but while he was in the Eastthere was a reconstitution of his order, intensifying its discipline andsubstituting authority for responsive impulse, and as a consequence of thesechanges he resigned its headship. To the end he clung passionately to the idealof poverty, but he was hardly dead before the order was holding property throughtrustees and building a great church and monastery to his memory at Assisi. Thedisciplines of the order that were applied after his death to his immediateassociates are scarcely to be distinguished from a persecution; several of themore conspicuous zealots for simplicity were scourged, others were imprisoned,one was killed while attempting to escape, and Brother Bernard, the “firstdisciple,” passed a year in the woods and hills, hunted like a wild beast.This struggle within the Franciscan Order is a very interesting one, because itforeshadows the great troubles that were coming to Christendom. All through thethirteenth century a section of the Franciscans were straining at the rule ofthe church, and in 1318 four of them were burnt alive at Marseilles asincorrigible heretics. There seems to have been little difference between theteaching and spirit of St. Francis and that of Waldo in the twelfth century, thefounder of the murdered sect of Waldenses. Both were passionately enthusiasticfor the spirit of Jesus of Nazareth. But while Waldo rebelled against thechurch, St. Francis did his best to be a good child of the church, and hiscomment on the spirit of official Christianity was only implicit. But both wereinstances of an outbreak of conscience against authority and the ordinaryprocedure of the church. And it is plain that in the second instance, as in thefirst, the church scented rebellion.A very different character to St. Francis was the Spaniard St. Dominic(1170-1221), who was, of all things, orthodox. He had a passion for theargumentative conversion of heretics, and he was commissioned by Pope InnocentIII to go and preach to the Albigenses. His work went on side by side with thefighting and massacres of the crusade; whom Dominic could not convert,Innocent’s crusaders slew; yet his very activities and the recognition andencouragement of his order by the Pope witness to the rising tide of discussion,and to the persuasion even of the papacy that force was no remedy. In severalrespects the development of the Black Friars or Dominicans—the Franciscans werethe Grey Friars —shows the Roman church at the parting of the ways, committingitself more and more deeply to organized dogma, and so to a hopeless conflictwith the quickening intelligence and courage of mankind. She whose one duty wasto lead, chose to compel. The last discourse of St. Dominic to the heretics hehad sought to convert is preserved to us. It is a signpost in history. Itbetrays the fatal exasperation of a man who has lost his faith in the power oftruth because his truth has not prevailed. “For many years,” he said, “I haveexhorted you in vain, with gentleness, preaching, praying, and weeping. Butaccording to the proverb of my country, ‘where blessing can accomplish nothing,blows may avail.’ We shall rouse against you princess and prelates, who, alas!will arm nations and kingdoms against this land . . . and thus blows will availwhere blessings and gentleness have been powerless.”19[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en47]The thirteenth century saw the development of a new institution in the church,the papal Inquisition. Before this time it had been customary for the Pope tomake occasional inquests or inquiries into heresy in this region or that, butnow Innocent III saw in the new order of the Dominicans a powerful instrument ofsuppression. The Inquisition was organized as a standing inquiry under theirdirection, and with fire and torment the church set itself, through thisinstrument, to assail and weaken the human conscience in which its sole hope ofworld dominion resided. Before the thirteenth century the penalty of death hadbeen inflicted but rarely upon heretics and unbelievers. Now in a hundredmarket-places in Europe the dignitaries of the church watched the blackenedbodies of its antagonists, for the most part poor and insignificant people, burnand sink pitifully, and their own great mission to mankind burn and sink withthem into dust and ashes.The beginnings of the Franciscans and the Dominicans were but two among many ofthe new forces that were arising in Christendom, either to help or shatter thechurch, as its own wisdom might decide. Those two orders the church didassimilate and use, though with a little violence in the case of the former. Butother forces were more frankly disobedient and critical. A century and a halflater came Wycliffe (1320-1384). He was a learned doctor at Oxford; for a timehe was Master of Balliol; and he held various livings in the church. Quite latein his life he began a series of outspoken criticisms of the corruption of theclergy and the unwisdom of the church. He organized a number of poor priests,the Wycliffites, to spread his ideas throughout England; and in order thatpeople should judge between the church and himself, he translated the Bible intoEnglish. He was a more learned and far abler man than either St. Francis or St.Dominic. He had supporters in high places and a great following among thepeople; and though Rome raged against him, and ordered his imprisonment, he dieda free man, still administering the Sacraments as parish priest of Lutterworth.But the black and ancient spirit that was leading the Catholic church to itsdestruction would not let his bones rest in his grave. By a decree of theCouncil of Constance in 1415, his remains were ordered to be dug up and burnt,an order which was carried out at the command of Pope Martin V by Bishop Flemingin 1428. This desecration was not the act of some isolated fanatic; it was theofficial act of the church.§ 14The history of the papacy is confusing to the general reader because of themultitude and abundance of the Popes. They mostly began to reign as old men, andtheir reigns were short, averaging less than two years each. But certain of thePopes stand out and supply convenient handles for the student to grasp. Suchwere Gregory I (590-604) the Great, the first monkish Pope, the friend ofBenedict, the sender of the English mission. Other noteworthy Popes are Leo III(795-816), who crowned Charlemagne, the scandalous Popes John XI (931-936) andJohn XII (955-963), which latter was deposed by the Emperor Otto I, and thegreat Hildebrand, who ended his days as Pope Gregory VII (1073-1085), and whodid so much by establishing the celibacy of the clergy, and insisting upon thesupremacy of the church over kings and princes, to centralize the power of thechurch in Rome. There was a great struggle between Hildebrand and the Emperorelect Henry IV upon the question of investitures. The emperor attempted todepose the pope; the pope excommunicated the emperor and released his subjectsfrom their allegiance. The emperor was obliged to go in penitence to the pope atCanossa and to await forgiveness for three days and nights in the courtyard ofthe castle, clad in sackcloth and barefooted to the snow. The next Pope but oneafter Gregory VII was Urban II (1087-1099), the Pope of the First Crusade. Theperiod from the time of Gregory VII onward for a century and a half, was thegreat period of ambition and effort for the church. There was a real sustainedattempt to unite all Christendom under a purified and reorganized church.The setting up of Latin kingdoms in Syria and the Holy Land, in religiouscommunion with Rome, after the First Crusade, marked the opening stage of aconquest of Eastern Christianity by Rome that reached its climax during theLatin rule in Constantinople (1204-1261).In 1176, at Venice, the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (Frederick I) knelt to thePope Alexander III, recognized his spiritual supremacy, and swore fealty to him.But after the death of Alexander III, in 1181, the peculiar weakness of thepapacy, its liability to fall to old and enfeebled men, became manifest. FivePopes tottered to the Lateran to die within the space of ten years. Only withInnocent III (1198-1216) did another vigorous Pope take up the great policy ofthe City of God.Under Innocent III, the guardian of that Emperor Frederick II, whose career wehave already studied in §§ 10 and 12, and the five Popes who followed him, thePope of Rome came nearer to being the monarch of a united Christendom than hehad ever been before, and was ever to be again. The empire was weakened byinternal dissensions, Constantinople was in Latin hands, from Bulgaria toIreland and from Norway to Sicily and Jerusalem the Pope was supreme. Yet thissupremacy was more apparent than real. For, as we have seen, while in the timeof Urban the power of faith was strong in all Christian Europe, in the time ofInnocent III the papacy had lost its hold upon the hearts of princes, and thefaith and conscience of the common people was turning against a merely politicaland aggressive church.The church in the thirteenth century was extending its legal power in the world,and losing its grip upon men’s consciences. It was becoming less persuasive andmore violent. No intelligent man can tell of this process, or read of thisprocess of failure without very mingled feelings. The church had sheltered andformed a new Europe throughout the long ages of European darkness and chaos; ithad been the matrix in which the new civilization had been cast. But thisnew-formed civilization was impelled to grow by its own inherent vitality, andthe church lacked sufficient power of growth and accommodation. The time wasfast approaching when this matrix was to be broken.The first striking intimation of the decay of the living and sustaining forcesof the papacy appeared when presently the Popes came into conflict with thegrowing power of the French king. During the lifetime of the Emperor FrederickII, Germany fell into disunion, and the French king began to play the rôle ofguard, supporter, and rival to the Pope that had hitherto fallen to theHohenstaufen emperors. A series of Popes pursued the policy of supporting theFrench monarchs. French princes were established in the kingdom of Sicily andNaples, with the support and approval of Rome, and the French kings saw beforethem the possibility of restoring and ruling the Empire of Charlemagne. When,however, the German interregnum after the death of Frederick II, the last of theHohenstaufens, came to an end and Rudolf of Habsburg was elected first HabsburgEmperor (1273), the policy of the Lateran began to fluctuate between France andGermany, veering about with the sympathies of each successive Pope. In the Eastin 1261 the Greeks recaptured Constantinople from the Latin emperors, and thefounder of the new Greek dynasty, Michael Palæologus, Michael VIII, after someunreal tentatives of reconciliation with the Pope, broke away from the Romancommunion altogether, and with that, and the fall of the Latin kingdoms in Asia,the eastward ascendancy of the Popes came to an end.In 1294 Boniface VIII became Pope. He was an Italian, hostile to the French, andfull of a sense of the great traditions and mission of Rome. For a time hecarried things with a high hand. In 1300 he held a jubilee, and a vast multitudeof pilgrims assembled in Rome. “So great was the influx of money into the papaltreasury, that two assistants were kept busy with rakes collecting the offeringsthat were deposited at the tomb of St. Peter.”20[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en48] But this festival was adelusive triumph. It is easier to raise a host of excursionists than a band ofcrusaders. Boniface came into conflict with the French king in 1302, and in1303, as he was about to pronounce sentence of excommunication against thatmonarch, he was surprised and arrested in his own ancestral palace, at Anagni,by Guillaume de Nogaret. This agent from the French king forced an entrance intothe palace, made his way into the bedroom of the frightened Pope—he was lying inbed with a cross in his hands—and heaped threats and insults upon him. The Popewas liberated a day or so later by the townspeople, and returned to Rome; butthere he was seized upon and again made prisoner by the Orsini family, and in afew weeks’ time the shocked and disillusioned old man died a prisoner in theirhands.The people of Anagni did resent the first outrage, and rose against Nogaret toliberate Boniface, but then Anagni was the Pope’s native town. The importantpoint to note is that the French king, in this rough treatment of the head ofChristendom, was acting with the full approval of his people; he had summoned acouncil of the Three Estates of France (lords, church, and commons) and gainedtheir consent before proceeding to extremities. Neither in Italy, Germany, norEngland was there the slightest general manifestation of disapproval at thisfree handling of the sovereign pontiff. The idea of Christendom had decayeduntil its power over the minds of men had gone.Throughout the fourteenth century the papacy did nothing to recover its moralsway. The next Pope elected, Clement V, was a Frenchman, the choice of KingPhilip of France. He never came to Rome. He set up his court in the town ofAvignon, which then belonged not to France, but to the Papal See, thoughembedded in French territory, and there his successors remained until 1377, whenPope Gregory XI returned to the Vatican palace in Rome. But Gregory XI did nottake the sympathies of the whole church with him. Many of the cardinals were ofFrench origin, and their habits and associations were rooted deep at Avignon.When in 1378 Gregory XI died, and an Italian, Urban VI, was elected, thesedissentient cardinals declared the election invalid, and elected another Pope,the anti-Pope, Clement VII. This split is called the Great Schism. The Popesremained in Rome, and all the anti-French powers, the Emperor, the King ofEngland, Hungary, Poland, and the North of Europe were loyal to them. Theanti-Popes, on the other hand, continued in Avignon, and were supported by theKing of France, his ally the King of Scotland, Spain, Portugal, and variousGerman princes. Each Pope excommunicated and cursed the adherents of his rival,so that by one standard or another all Christendom was damned during this time(1378-1417). The lamentable effect of this split upon the solidarity ofChristendom it is impossible to exaggerate. Is it any marvel that such men asWycliffe began to teach men to think on their own account when the fountain oftruth thus squirted against itself? In 1417 the Great Schism was healed at theCouncil of Constance, the same council that dug up and burnt Wycliffe’s bones,and which, as we shall tell later, caused the burning of John Huss; at thiscouncil, Pope and anti-Pope resigned or were swept aside, and Martin V becamethe sole Pope of a formally reunited but spiritually very badly strainedChristendom.How later on the Council of Basle (1437) led to a fresh schism, and to furtheranti-Popes, we cannot relate here.Such, briefly, is the story of the great centuries of papal ascendancy and papaldecline. It is the story of the failure to achieve the very noble and splendididea of a unified and religious world. We have pointed out in the previoussection how greatly the inheritance of a complex dogmatic theology encumberedthe church in this its ambitious adventure. It had too much theology, and notenough religion. But it may not be idle to point out here how much theindividual insufficiency of the Popes also contributed to the collapse of itsscheme and dignity. There was no such level of education in the world as toprovide a succession of cardinals and popes with the breadth of knowledge andoutlook needed for the task they had undertaken; they were not sufficientlyeducated for their task, and only a few, by sheer force of genius, transcendedthat defect. And, as we have already pointed out, they were, when at last theygot to power, too old to use it. Before they could grasp the situation they hadto control, most of them were dead. It would be interesting to speculate how farit would have tilted the balance in favour of the church if the cardinals hadretired at fifty, and if no one could have been elected Pope after fifty-five.This would have lengthened the average reign of each Pope, and enormouslyincreased the continuity of the policy of the church. And it is perhaps possiblethat a more perfect system of selecting the cardinals, who were the electors andcounsellors of the Pope, might have been devised. The rules and ways by whichmen reach power are of very great importance in human affairs. The psychology ofthe ruler is a science that has still to be properly studied. We have seen theRoman Republic wrecked, and here we see the church failing in its world missionvery largely through ineffective electoral methods."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VTHE GREAT EMPIRE OF JENGIS KHAN AND HIS SUCCESSORS(The Age of the Land Ways)§ 1.

We have traced in this history thedevelopment side by side of these two ways of living, and we have pointed outthat as the civilizations grew more extensive and better organized, the arms,the mobility, and the intelligence of the nomads also improved. The nomad wasnot simply an uncivilized man, he was a man specialized and specializing alonghis own line. From the very beginning of history the nomad and the settledpeople have been in reaction. We have told of the Semitic and Elamite raids uponSumeria; we have seen the Western empire smashed by the nomads of the greatplains and Persia conquered and Byzantium shaken by the nomads of Arabia.Whenever civilization seems to be choking amidst its weeds of wealth and debtand servitude, when its faiths seem rotting into cynicism and its powers offurther growth are hopelessly entangled in effete formulæ, the nomad drives inlike a plough to break up the festering stagnation and release the world to newbeginnings. The Mongol aggression, which began with the thirteenth century, wasthe greatest, and so far it has been the last, of all these destructivereploughings of human association.From entire obscurity the Mongols came very suddenly into history towards theclose of the twelfth century. They appeared in the country to the north ofChina, in the land of origin of the Huns and Turks, and they were manifestly ofthe same strain as these peoples. They were gathered together under a chief,with whose name we will not tax the memory of the reader; under his son JengisKhan their power grew with extraordinary swiftness.The reader will already have an idea of the gradual breaking up of the originalunity of Islam. In the beginning of the thirteenth century there were a numberof separate and discordant Moslem states in Western Asia. There was Egypt (withPalestine and much of Syria) under the successors of Saladin, there was theSeljuk power in Asia Minor, there was still an Abbasid caliphate in Bagdad, andto the east of this again there had grown up a very considerable empire, theKharismian empire, that of the Turkish princes from Khiva who had conquered anumber of fragmentary Seljuk principalities and reigned from the Ganges valleyto the Tigris. They had but an insecure hold on the Persian and Indianpopulations.The state of the Chinese civilization was equally inviting to an enterprisinginvader. One last glimpse of China in this history was in the seventh centuryduring the opening years of the Tang dynasty, when that shrewd and able emperorTai-tsung was weighing the respective merits of Nestorian Christianity, Islam,Buddhism, and the teachings of Lao Tse, and on the whole inclining to theopinion that Lao Tse was as good a teacher as any. We have described hisreception of the traveller Yuan Chwang. Tai-tsung tolerated all religions, butseveral of his successors conducted a pitiless persecution of the Buddhistfaith; it flourished in spite of these persecutions, and its monasteries playeda somewhat analogous part in at first sustaining learning and afterwardsretarding it, that the Christian monastic organization did in the West. By thetenth century the great Tang dynasty was in an extreme state of decay; the usualdegenerative process through a series of voluptuaries and incapables had goneon, and China broke up again politically into a variable number of contendingstates, “The age of the Ten States,” an age of confusion that lasted through thefirst half of the tenth century. Then arose a dynasty, the Northern Sung(960-1127), which established a sort of unity, but which was in constantstruggle with a number of Hunnish peoples from the north who were pressing downthe eastern coast. For a time one of these peoples, the Khitan, prevailed. Inthe twelfth century these people had been subjugated and had given place toanother Hunnish empire, the empire of the Kin, with its capital at Pekin and itssouthern boundary south of Hwangho. The Sung empire shrank before this Kinempire. In 1138 the capital was shifted from Nankin, which was now too close tothe northern frontier, to the city of Han Chau on the coast. From 1127 onward to1295, the Sung dynasty is known as the Southern Sung. To the north-west of itsterritories there was now the Tartar empire of the Hsia; to the north, the Kinempire, both states in which the Chinese population was under rulers in whomnomadic traditions were still strong. So that here on the east also the mainmasses of Asiatic mankind were under uncongenial rulers and ready to accept, ifnot to welcome, the arrival of a conqueror.Northern India we have already noted was also a conquered country at the openingof the thirteenth century. It was at first a part of the Khivan empire, but in1206 an adventurous ruler, Kutub, who had been a slave and who had risen as aslave to be governor of the Indian province, set up a separate Moslem state ofHindustan in Delhi. Brahminism had long since ousted Buddhism from India, butthe converts to Islam were still but a small ruling minority in the land.023 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_023_r1.gif]Such was the political state of Asia when Jengis Khan began to consolidate hispower among the nomads in the country between Lakes Balkash and Baikal in thebeginning of the thirteenth century.§ 2The career of conquest of Jengis Khan and his immediate successors astounded theworld, and probably astounded no one more than these Mongol Khans themselves.The Mongols were in the twelfth century a tribe subject to those Kin who hadconquered North-east China. They were a horde of nomadic horsemen living intents, and subsisting mainly upon mare’s milk products and meat. Theiroccupations were pasturage and hunting, varied by war. They drifted northward asthe snows melted for summer pasture, and southward to winter pasture after thecustom of the steppes. Their military education began with a successfulinsurrection against the Kin. The empire of Kin had the resources of half Chinabehind it, and in the struggle the Mongols learnt very much of the militaryscience of the Chinese. By the end of the twelfth century they were already afighting tribe of exceptional quality.The opening years of the career of Jengis were spent in developing his militarymachine, in assimilating the Mongols and the associated tribes about them intoone organized army. His first considerable extension of power was westward, whenthe Tartar Kirghis and the Uigurs (who were the Tartar people of the Tarimbasin) were not so much conquered as induced to join his organization. He thenattacked the Kin empire and took Pekin (1214). The Khitan people, who had beenso recently subdued by the Kin, threw in their fortunes with his, and were ofvery great help to him. The settled Chinese population went on sowing andreaping and trading during this change of masters without lending its weight toeither side.024 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_024_r1.gif]We have already mentioned the very recent Kharismian empire of Turkestan,Persia, and North India. This empire extended eastward to Kashgar, and it musthave seemed one of the most progressive and hopeful empires of the time. JengisKhan, while still engaged in this war with the Kin empire, sent envoys toKharismia. They were put to death, an almost incredible stupidity. TheKharismian government, to use the political jargon of today, had decided not to“recognize” Jengis Khan, and took this spirited course with him. Thereupon(1218) the great host of horsemen that Jengis Khan had consolidated anddisciplined swept over the Pamirs and down into Turkestan. It was well armed,and probably it had some guns and gunpowder for siege work—for the Chinese werecertainly using gunpowder at this time, and the Mongols learnt its use fromthem. Kashgar, Khokand, Bokhara fell and then Samarkand, the capital of theKharismian empire. Thereafter nothing held the Mongols in the Kharismianterritories. They swept westward to the Caspian, and southward as far as Lahore.To the north of the Caspian a Mongol army encountered a Russian force fromKieff. There was a series of battles, in which the Russian armies were finallydefeated and the Grand Duke of Kieff taken prisoner. So it was the Mongolsappeared on the northern shores of the Black Sea. A panic swept Constantinople,which set itself to reconstruct its fortifications. Meanwhile other armies wereengaged in the conquest of the empire of the Hsia in China. This was annexed,and only the southern part of the Kin empire remained unsubdued. In 1227 JengisKhan died in the midst of a career of triumph. His empire reached already fromthe Pacific to the Dnieper. And it was an empire still vigorously expanding.Like all the empires founded by nomads, it was, to begin with, purely a militaryand administrative empire, a framework rather than a rule. It centred on thepersonality of the monarch, and its relations with the mass of the populationsover which it ruled was simply one of taxation for the maintenance of the horde.But Jengis Khan had called to his aid a very able and experienced administratorof the Kin empire, who was learned in all the traditions and science of theChinese. This statesman, Yeliu Chutsai, was able to carry on the affairs of theMongols long after the death of Jengis Khan, and there can be little doubt thathe is one of the great political heroes of history. He tempered the barbaricferocity of his masters, and saved innumerable cities and works of art fromdestruction. He collected archives and inscriptions, and when he was accused ofcorruption, his sole wealth was found to consist of documents and a few musicalinstruments. To him perhaps quite as much as to Jengis is the efficiency of theMongol military machine to be ascribed. Under Jengis, we may note further, wefind the completest religious toleration established across the entire breadthof Asia.At the death of Jengis the capital of the new empire was still in the greatbarbaric town of Karakorum in Mongolia. There an assembly of Mongol leaderselected Ogdai Khan, the son of Jengis, as his successor. The war against thevestiges of the Kin empire was prosecuted until Kin was altogether subdued(1234). The Chinese empire to the south under the Sung dynasty helped theMongols in this task, so destroying their own bulwark against the universalconquerors. The Mongol hosts then swept right across Asia to Russia (1235), anamazing march. Kieff was destroyed in 1240, and nearly all Russia becametributary to the Mongols. Poland was ravaged, and a mixed army of Poles andGermans was annihilated at the battle of Liegnitz in Lower Silesia in 1241. TheEmperor Frederick II does not seem to have made any great efforts to stay theadvancing tide.“It is only recently,” says Bury in his notes to Gibbon’s Decline and Fall ofthe Roman Empire, “that European history has begun to understand that thesuccesses of the Mongol army which overran Poland and occupied Hungary in thespring of A.D. 1241 were won by consummate strategy and were not due to a mereoverwhelming superiority of numbers. But this fact has not yet become a matterof common knowledge; the vulgar opinion which represents the Tartars as a wildhorde carrying all before them solely by their multitude, and galloping throughEastern Europe without a strategic plan, rushing at all obstacles and overcomingthem by mere weight, still prevails. . . .“It was wonderful how punctually and effectually the arrangements of thecommander were carried out in operations extending from the Lower Vistula toTransylvania. Such a campaign was quite beyond the power of any European army ofthe time, and it was beyond the vision of any European commander. There was nogeneral in Europe, from Frederick II downward, who was not a tyro in strategycompared to Subutai. It should also be noticed that the Mongols embarked uponthe enterprise with full knowledge of the political situation of Hungary and thecondition of Poland—they had taken care to inform themselves by a well-organizedsystem of spies; on the other hand, the Hungarians and Christian powers, likechildish barbarians, knew hardly anything about their enemies.”But though the Mongols were victorious at Liegnitz, they did not continue theirdrive westward. They were getting into woodlands and hilly country, which didnot suit their tactics; and so they turned southward and prepared to settle inHungary, massacring or assimilating the kindred Magyar, even as these hadpreviously massacred and assimilated the mixed Scythians and Avars and Hunsbefore them. From the Hungarian plain they would probably have made raids westand south as the Hungarians had done in the ninth century, the Avars in theseventh and eighth, and the Huns in the fifth. But in Asia the Mongols werefighting a stiff war of conquest against the Sung, and they were also raidingPersia and Asia Minor; Ogdai died suddenly, and in 1242 there was trouble aboutthe succession, and recalled by this, the undefeated hosts of Mongols began topour back across Hungary and Rumania towards the east.To the great relief of Europe the dynastic troubles at Karakorum lasted for someyears, and this vast new empire showed signs of splitting up. Mangu Khan becamethe Great Khan in 1251, and he nominated his brother Kublai Khan asGovernor-General of China. Slowly but surely the entire Sung empire wassubjugated, and as it was subjugated the eastern Mongols became more and moreChinese in their culture and methods. Tibet was invaded and devastated by Mangu,and Persia and Syria invaded in good earnest. Another brother of Mangu, Hulagu,was in command of this latter war. He turned his arms against the caliphate andcaptured Bagdad, in which city he perpetrated a massacre of the entirepopulation. Bagdad was still the religious capital of Islam, and the Mongols hadbecome bitterly hostile to the Moslems. This hostility exacerbated the naturaldiscord of nomad and townsman. In 1259 Mangu died, and in 1260—for it took thebest part of a year for the Mongol leaders to gather from the extremities ofthis vast empire, from Hungary and Syria and Scind and China—Kublai was electedGreat Khan. He was already deeply interested in Chinese affairs; he made hiscapital Pekin instead of Karakorum, and Persia, Syria, and Asia Minor becamevirtually independent under his brother Hulagu, while the hordes of Mongols inRussia and Asia next to Russia, and various smaller Mongol groups in Turkestanbecame also practically separate. Kublai died in 1294, and with his death eventhe titular supremacy of the Great Khan disappeared.At the death of Kublai there was a main Mongol empire, with Pekin as itscapital, including all China and Mongolia; there was a second great Mongolempire, that of Kipchak in Russia; there was a third in Persia, that founded byHulagu, the Ilkhan empire, to which the Seljuk Turks in Asia Minor weretributary; there was a Siberian state between Kipchak and Mongolia; and anotherseparate state “Great Turkey” in Turkestan. It is particularly remarkable thatIndia beyond the Punjab was never invaded by the Mongols during this period, andthat an army under the Sultan of Egypt completely defeated Ketboga, Hulagu’sgeneral, in Palestine (1260), and stopped them from entering Africa. By 1260 theimpulse of Mongol conquest had already passed its zenith. Thereafter the Mongolstory is one of division and decay.The Mongol dynasty that Kublai Khan had founded in China, the Yuan dynasty,lasted from 1280 until 1368. Later on a recrudescence of Mongolian energy inWestern Asia was destined to create a still more enduring monarchy in India.§ 3Now this story of Mongolian conquests is surely the most remarkable in allhistory. The conquests of Alexander the Great cannot compare with them inextent. And their effect in diffusing and broadening men’s ideas, though suchthings are more difficult to estimate, is at least comparable to the spread ofthe Hellenic civilization which is associated with Alexander’s adventure. For atime all Asia and Western Europe enjoyed an open intercourse; all the roads weretemporarily open, and representatives of every nation appeared at the court ofKarakorum. The barriers between Europe and Asia set up by the religious feud ofChristianity and Islam were lowered. Great hopes were entertained by the papacyfor the conversion of the Mongols to Christianity. Their only religion so farhad been Shamanism, a primitive paganism. Envoys of the Pope, Buddhist priestsfrom India, Parisian and Italian and Chinese artificers, Byzantine and Armenianmerchants, mingled with Arab officials and Persian and Indian astronomers andmathematicians at the Mongol court. We hear too much in history of the campaignsand massacres of the Mongols, and not enough of their indubitable curiosity andzest for learning. Not perhaps as an originative people, but as transmitters ofknowledge and method their influence upon the world’s history has been enormous.And everything one can learn of the vague and romantic personalities of Jengisor Kublai tends to confirm the impression that these men were built upon alarger scale, and were at least as understanding and creative monarchs as eitherthat flamboyant but egotistical figure Alexander the Great, or that raiser ofpolitical ghosts, that energetic but illiterate theologian, Charlemagne.The missionary enterprises of the papacy in Mongolia ended in failure.Christianity was losing its persuasive power. The Mongols had no prejudiceagainst Christianity; they evidently preferred it at first to Islam; but themissions that came to them were manifestly using the power in the greatteachings of Jesus to advance the vast claims of the Pope to world dominion.Christianity so vitiated was not good enough for the Mongol mind. To make theempire of the Mongols part of the kingdom of God might have appealed to them;but not to make it a fief of a group of French and Italian priests, whose claimswere as gigantic as their powers and outlook were feeble, who were now thecreatures of the Emperor of Germany, now the nominees of the King of France, andnow the victims of their own petty spites and vanities. In 1269 Kublai Khan senta mission to the Pope with the evident intention of finding some common mode ofaction with Western Christendom. He asked that a hundred men of learning andability should be sent to his court to establish an understanding. His missionfound the Western world popeless, and engaged in one of those disputes about thesuccession that are so frequent in the history of the papacy. For two yearsthere was no pope at all. When at last a pope was appointed, he dispatched twoDominican friars to convert the greatest power in Asia to his rule! Those worthymen were appalled by the length and hardship of the journey before them, andfound an early excuse for abandoning the expedition.025 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_025_r1.gif]But this abortive mission was only one of a number of attempts to communicate,and always they were feeble and feeble-spirited attempts, with nothing of theconquering fire of the earlier Christian missions. Innocent IV had already sentsome Dominicans to Karakorum, and St. Louis of France had also dispatchedmissionaries and relics by way of Persia; Mangu Khan had numerous NestorianChristians at his court, and subsequent papal envoys actually reached Pekin. Wehear of the appointment of various legates and bishops to the East, but many ofthese seem to have lost themselves and perhaps their lives before they reachedChina. There was a papal legate in Pekin in 1346, but he seems to have been amere papal diplomatist. With the downfall of the Mongolian (Yuan) dynasty(1368), the dwindling opportunity of the Christian missions passed altogether.The house of Yuan was followed by that of Ming, a strongly nationalist Chinesedynasty, at first very hostile to all foreigners. There may have been a massacreof the Christian missions. Until the later days of the Mings (1644) little moreis heard of Christianity, whether Nestorian or Catholic, in China. Then a freshand rather more successful attempt to propagate Catholic Christianity in Chinawas made by the Jesuits, but this second missionary wave reached China by thesea.In the year 1298 a naval battle occurred between the Genoese and the Venetians,in which the latter were defeated. Among the 7,000 prisoners taken by theGenoese was a Venetian gentleman named Marco Polo, who had been a greattraveller, and who was very generally believed by his neighbours to be given toexaggeration. He had taken part in that first mission to Kublai Khan, and hadgone on when the two Dominicans turned back. While this Marco Polo was aprisoner in Genoa, he beguiled his tedium by talking of his travels to a certainwriter named Rusticiano, who wrote them down. We will not enter here into thevexed question of the exact authenticity of Rusticiano’s story —we do notcertainly know in what language it was written—but there can be no doubt of thegeneral truth of this remarkable narrative, which became enormously popular inthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries with all men of active intelligence. TheTravels of Marco Polo is one of the great books of history. It opens this worldof the thirteenth century, this century which saw the reign of Frederick II andthe beginnings of the Inquisition, to our imaginations as no mere historian’schronicle can do. It led directly to the discovery of America.It begins by telling of the journey of Marco’s father, Nicolo Polo, and uncle,Maffeo Polo, to China. These two were Venetian merchants of standing, living inConstantinople, and somewhen about 1260 they went to the Crimea and thence toKazan; from that place they journeyed to Bokhara, and at Bokhara they fell inwith a party of envoys from Kublai Khan in China to his brother Hulagu inPersia. These envoys pressed them to come on to the Great Khan, who at that timehad never seen men of the “Latin” peoples. They went on; and it is clear theymade a very favourable impression upon Kublai, and interested him greatly in thecivilization of Christendom. They were made the bearers of that request for ahundred teachers and learned men, “intelligent men acquainted with the SevenArts, able to enter into controversy and able clearly to prove to idolators andother kinds of folk that the Law of Christ was best,” to which we have justalluded. But when they returned Christendom was in a phase of confusion, and itwas only after a delay of two years that they got their authorization to startfor China again in the company of those two faint-hearted Dominicans. They tookwith them young Marco, and it is due to his presence and the boredom of hissubsequent captivity at Genoa that this most interesting experience has beenpreserved to us.The three Polos started by way of Palestine and not by the Crimea, as in theprevious expedition. They had with them a gold tablet and other indications fromthe Great Khan that must have greatly facilitated their journey. The Great Kahnhad asked for some oil from the lamp that burns in the Holy Sepulchre atJerusalem; and so thither they first went, and then by way of Cilicia intoArmenia. They went thus far north because the Sultan of Egypt was raiding theIlkhan domains at this time. Thence they came by way of Mesopotamia to Ormuz onthe Persian Gulf, as if they contemplated a sea voyage. At Ormuz they metmerchants from India. For some reason they did not take ship, but instead turnednorthward through the Persian deserts, and so by way of Balkh over the Pamir toKashgar, and by way of Kotan and the Lob Nor (so following in the footsteps ofYuan Chwang) into the Hwangho valley and on to Pekin. Pekin, Polo calls“Cambaluc”; Northern China, “Cathay” (= Khitan); and Southern China of theformer Sung dynasty, “Manzi.” At Pekin was the Great Khan, and they werehospitably entertained. Marco particularly pleased Kublai; he was young andclever, and it is clear he had mastered the Tartar language very thoroughly. Hewas given an official position and sent on several missions, chiefly inSouth-west China. The tale he had to tell of vast stretches of smiling andprosperous country, “all the way excellent hostelries for travellers,” and “finevineyards, fields and gardens,” of “many abbeys” of Buddhist monks, ofmanufactures of “cloth of silk and gold and many fine taffetas,” a “constantsuccession of cities and boroughs,” and so on, first roused the incredulity andthen fired the imagination of all Europe. He told of Burmah, and of its greatarmies with hundreds of elephants, and how these animals were defeated by theMongol bowmen, and also of the Mongol conquest of Pegu. He told of Japan, andgreatly exaggerated the amount of gold in that country. And, still morewonderful, he told of Christians and Christian rulers in China, and of a certain“Prester John,” John the Priest, who was the “king” of a Christian people. Thosepeople he had not seen. Apparently they were a tribe of Nestorian Tartars inMongolia. An understandable excitement probably made Rusticiano over-emphasizewhat must have seemed to him the greatest marvel of the whole story, and PresterJohn became one of the most stimulating legends of the fourteenth and fifteenthcenturies. It encouraged European enterprise enormously to think that far awayin China was a community of their coreligionists, presumably ready to welcomeand assist them. For three years Marco ruled the city of Yang-chow as governor,and he probably impressed the Chinese inhabitants as being very little more of aforeigner than any Tartar would have been. He may also have been sent on amission to India. Chinese records mention a certain Polo attached to theimperial council in 1277, a very valuable confirmation of the general truth ofthe Polo story.The Polos had taken about three and a half years to get to China. They stayedthere upwards of sixteen. Then they began to feel homesick. They were theprotégés of Kublai, and possibly they felt that his favours roused a certainenvy that might have disagreeable results after his death. They sought hispermission to return. For a time he refused it, and then an opportunityoccurred. Argon, the Ilkhan monarch of Persia, the grandson of Hulagu, Kublai’sbrother, had lost his Mongol wife, and on her deathbed had promised not to wedany other woman but a Mongol of her own tribe. He sent ambassadors to Pekin, anda suitable princess was selected, a girl of seventeen. To spare her the fatiguesof the caravan route, it was decided to send her by sea with a suitable escort.The “Barons” in charge of her asked for the company of the Polos because theselatter were experienced travellers and sage men, and the Polos snatched at thisopportunity of getting homeward. The expedition sailed from some port on theeast of South China; they stayed long in Sumatra and South India, and theyreached Persia after a voyage of two years. They delivered the young lady safelyto Argon’s successor—for Argon was dead—and she married Argon’s son. The Polesthen went by Tabriz to Trebizond, sailed to Constantinople, and got back toVenice about 1295. It is related that the returned travellers, dressed in Tartargarb, were refused admission to their own house. It was some time before theycould establish their identity. Many people who admitted that, were stillinclined to look askance at them as shabby wanderers; and, in order to dispelsuch doubts, they gave a great feast, and when it was at its height they hadtheir old padded suits brought to them, dismissed the servants, and then rippedopen these garments, whereupon an incredible display of “rubies, sapphires,carbuncles, emeralds, and diamonds” poured out before the dazzled company. Evenafter this, Marco’s accounts of the size and population of China were receivedwith much furtive mockery. The wits nicknamed him Il Milione, because he wasalways talking of millions of people and millions of ducats.Such was the story that raised eyebrows first in Venice and then throughout theWestern world. The European literature, and especially the European romance ofthe fifteenth century, echoes with the names in Marco Polo’s story, with Cathayand Cambaluc and the like.§ 4These travels of Marco Polo were only the beginning of a very considerableintercourse. That intercourse was to bring many revolutionary ideas and manyrevolutionary things to Europe, including a greatly extended use of paper andprinting from blocks, the almost equally revolutionary use of gunpowder inwarfare, and the mariner’s compass which was to release the European shippingfrom navigation by coasting. The popular imagination has always been disposed toascribe every such striking result to Marco Polo. He has become the type andsymbol for all such interchanges. As a matter of fact, there is no evidence thathe had any share in these three importations. There were many mute Marco Poloswho never met their Rusticianos, and history has not preserved their names.Before we go on, however, to describe the great widening of the mental horizonsof Europe that was now beginning, and to which this book of travels was tocontribute very materially, it will be convenient first to note a curious sideconsequence of the great Mongol conquests, the appearance of the Ottoman Turksupon the Dardanelles, and next to state in general terms the breaking up anddevelopment of the several parts of the empire of Jengis Khan.The Ottoman Turks were a little band of fugitives who fled south-westerly beforethe first invasion of Western Turkestan by Jengis. They made their long way fromCentral Asia, over deserts and mountains and through alien populations, seekingsome new lands in which they might settle. “A small band of alien herdsmen,”says Sir Mark Sykes, “wandering unchecked through crusades and counter-crusades,principalities, empires, and states. Where they camped, how they moved andpreserved their flocks and herds, where they found pasture, how they made theirpeace with the various chiefs through whose territories they passed, arequestions which one may well ask in wonder.”They found a resting-place at last and kindred and congenial neighbours on thetable-lands of Asia Minor among the Seljuk Turks. Most of this country, themodern Anatolia, was now largely Turkish in speech and Moslem in religion,except that there was a considerable proportion of Greeks, Jews, and Armeniansin the town populations. No doubt the various strains of Hittite, Phrygian,Trojan, Lydian, Ionian Greek, Cimmerian, Galatian, and Italian (from thePergamus times) still flowed in the blood of the people, but they had long sinceforgotten these ancestral elements. They were indeed much the same blend ofancient Mediterranean dark whites, Nordic Aryans, Semites and Mongolians as werethe inhabitants of the Balkan peninsula, but they believed themselves to be apure Turanian race, and altogether superior to the Christians on the other sideof the Bosphorus.Gradually the Ottoman Turks became important, and at last dominant among thesmall principalities into which the Seljuk empire, the empire of “Roum,” hadfallen. Their relations with the dwindling empire of Constantinople remained forsome centuries tolerantly hostile. They made no attack upon the Bosphorus, butthey got a footing in Europe at the Dardanelles, and, using this route, theroute of Xerxes and not the route of Darius, they pushed their way steadily intoMacedonia, Epirus, Illyria, Yugo-Slavia, and Bulgaria. In the Serbs (Yugo-Slavs)and Bulgarians the Turks found people very like themselves in culture and,though neither side recognized it, probably very similar in racial admixture,with a little less of the dark Mediterranean and Mongolian strains than theTurks and a trifle more of the Nordic element. But these Balkan peoples wereChristians, and bitterly divided among themselves. The Turks on the other handspoke one language; they had a greater sense of unity, they had the Moslemhabits of temperance and frugality, and they were on the whole better soldiers.They converted what they could of the conquered people to Islam; the Christiansthey disarmed, and conferred upon them the monopoly of tax-paying. Gradually theOttoman princes consolidated an empire that reached from the Taurus mountains inthe east to Hungary and Roumania in the west. Adrianople became their chiefcity. They surrounded the shrunken empire of Constantinople on every side.The Ottomans organized a standing military force, the Janissaries, rather on thelines of the Mamelukes who dominated Egypt. “These troops were formed of leviesof Christian youths to the extent of one thousand per annum, who were affiliatedto the Bektashi order of dervishes, and though at first not obliged to embraceIslam, were one and all strongly imbued with the mystic and fraternal ideas ofthe confraternity to which they were attached. Highly paid, well disciplined, aclose and jealous secret society, the Janissaries provided the newly formedOttoman state with a patriotic force of trained infantry soldiers, which, in anage of light cavalry and hired companies of mercenaries, was an invaluableasset....“The relations between the Ottoman Sultans and the Emperors has been singular inthe annals of Moslem and Christian states. The Turks had been involved in thefamily and dynastic quarrels of the Imperial City, were bound by ties of bloodto the ruling families, frequently supplied troops for the defence ofConstantinople, and on occasion hired parts of its garrison to assist them intheir various campaigns; the sons of the Emperors and Byzantine statesmen evenaccompanied the Turkish forces in the field, yet the Ottomans never ceased toannex Imperial territories and cities both in Asia and Thrace. This curiousintercourse between the House of Osman and the Imperial government had aprofound effect on both institutions; the Greeks grew more and more debased anddemoralized by the shifts and tricks that their military weakness obliged themto adopt towards their neighbours, the Turks were corrupted by the alienatmosphere of intrigue and treachery which crept into their domestic life.Fratricide and parricide, the two crimes which most frequently stained theannals of the Imperial Palace, eventually formed a part of the policy of theOttoman dynasty. One of the sons of Murad I embarked on an intrigue withAndronicus, the son of the Greek Emperor, to murder their respective fathers. .. .“The Byzantine found it more easy to negotiate with the Ottoman Pasha than withthe Pope. For years the Turks and Byzantines had intermarried, and hunted incouples in strange bypaths of diplomacy. The Ottoman had played the Bulgar andthe Serb of Europe against the Emperor, just as the Emperor had played theAsiatic Amir against the Sultan; the Greek and Turkish Royal Princes hadmutually agreed to hold each other’s rivals as prisoners and hostages; in fact,Turk and Byzantine policy had so intertwined that it is difficult to say whetherthe Turks regarded the Greeks as their allies, enemies, or subjects, or whetherthe Greeks looked upon the Turks as their tyrants, destroyers, or protectors. .. .”1 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en49]026 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_026_r1.gif]It was in 1453, under the Ottoman Sultan, Muhammad II, that Constantinople atlast fell to the Moslems. He attacked it from the European side, and with agreat power of artillery. The Greek Emperor was killed, and there was muchlooting and massacre. The great church of St. Sophia which Justinian the Greathad built (532) was plundered of its treasures and turned at once into a mosque.This event sent a wave of excitement throughout Europe, and an attempt was madeto organize a crusade, but the days of the crusades were past.Says Sir Mark Sykes: “To the Turks the capture of Constantinople was a crowningmercy and yet a fatal blow. Constantinople had been the tutor and polisher ofthe Turks. So long as the Ottomans could draw science, learning, philosophy,art, and tolerance from a living fountain of civilization in the heart of theirdominions, so long had the Ottomans not only brute force, but intellectualpower. So long as the Ottoman Empire had in Constantinople a free port, amarket, a centre of world finance, a pool of gold, an exchange, so long did theOttomans never lack for money and financial support. Muhammad was a greatstatesman, the moment he entered Constantinople he endeavoured to stay thedamage his ambition had done; he supported the patriarch, he conciliated theGreeks, he did all he could to continue Constantinople the city of the Emperors. . . but the fatal step had been taken, Constantinople as the city of theSultans was Constantinople no more; the markets died away, the culture andcivilization fled, the complex finance faded from sight; and the Turks had losttheir governors and their support. On the other hand, the corruptions ofByzantium remained, the bureaucracy, the eunuchs, the palace guards, the spies,the bribers, go-betweens —all these the Ottomans took over, and all thesesurvived in luxuriant life. The Turks, in taking Stambul, let slip a treasureand gained a pestilence. . . .”Muhammad’s ambition was not sated by the capture of Constantinople. He set hiseyes also upon Rome. He captured and looted the Italian town of Otranto, and itis probable that a very vigorous and perhaps successful attempt to conquerItaly—for the peninsula was divided against itself—was averted only by his death(1481). His sons engaged in fratricidal strife. Under Bayezid II (1481-1512),his successor, war was carried into Poland, and most of Greece was conquered.Selim (1512-1520), the son of Bayezid, extended the Ottoman power over Armeniaand conquered Egypt. In Egypt, the last Abbasid Caliph was living under theprotection of the Mameluke Sultan—for the Fatimite caliphate was a thing of thepast. Selim bought the title of Caliph from this last degenerate Abbasid, andacquired the sacred banner and other relics of the Prophet. So the OttomanSultan became also Caliph of all Islam. Selim was followed by Suleiman theMagnificent (1520-1566), who conquered Bagdad in the east and the greater partof Hungary in the west, and very nearly captured Vienna. His fleets also tookAlgiers, and inflicted a number of reverses upon the Venetians. In most of hiswarfare with the empire he was in alliance with the French. Under him theOttoman power reached its zenith.§ 5Let us now very briefly run over the subsequent development of the main massesof the empire of the Great Khan. In no case did Christianity succeed incapturing the imagination of these Mongol states. Christianity was in a phase ofmoral and intellectual insolvency, without any collective faith, energy, orhonour; we have told of the wretched brace of timid Dominicans which was thePope’s reply to the appeal of Kublai Khan, and we have noted the general failureof the overland missions of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Thatapostolic passion that could win whole nations to the Kingdom of Heaven was deadin the church.In 1305, as we have told, the Pope became the kept pontiff of the French king.All the craft and policy of the Popes of the thirteenth century to oust theEmperor from Italy had only served to let in the French to replace him. From1305 to 1377 the Popes remained at Avignon; and such slight missionary effort asthey made was merely a part of the strategy of Western European politics. In1377 the Pope Gregory XI did indeed re-enter Rome and die there, but the Frenchcardinals split off from the others at the election of his successor, and twoPopes were elected, one at Avignon and one at Rome. This split, the GreatSchism, lasted from 1378 to 1418. Each Pope cursed the other, and put all hissupporters under an interdict. Such was the state of Christianity, and such werenow the custodians of the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. All Asia was whiteunto harvest, but there was no effort to reap it.When at last the church was reunited and missionary energy returned with thefoundation of the order of the Jesuits, the days of opportunity were over. Thepossibility of a world-wide moral unification of East and West throughChristianity had passed away. The Mongols in China and Central Asia turned toBuddhism; in South Russia, Western Turkestan, and the Ilkhan Empire theyembraced Islam.027 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_027_r1.gif]§ 5AIn China the Mongols were already saturated with Chinese civilization by thetime of Kublai. After 1280 the Chinese annals treat Kublai as a Chinese monarch,the founder of the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368). This Mongol dynasty was finallyoverthrown by a Chinese nationalist movement which set up the Ming dynasty(1368-1644), a cultivated and artistic line of emperors, ruling until a northernpeople, the Manchus, who were the same as the Kin whom Jengis had overthrown,conquered China and established a dynasty which gave way only to a nativerepublican form of government in 1912.It was the Manchus who obliged the Chinese to wear pigtails as a mark ofsubmission. The pigtailed Chinaman is quite a recent figure in history. With thecoming of the republic the wearing of the pigtail has ceased to be compulsory,and many Chinamen no longer wear it.§ 5BIn the Pamirs, in much of Eastern and Western Turkestan, and to the north, theMongols dropped back towards the tribal conditions from which they had beenlifted by Jengis. It is possible to trace the dwindling succession of many ofthe small Khans who became independent during this period, almost down to thepresent time. The Kalmuks in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries founded aconsiderable empire, but dynastic troubles broke it up before it had extendedits power beyond Central Asia. The Chinese recovered Eastern Turkestan from themabout 1757.Tibet was more and more closely linked with China, and became the great home ofBuddhism and Buddhist monasticism.Over most of the area of Western Central Asia and Persia and Mesopotamia, theancient distinction of nomad and settled population remains to this day. Thetownsmen despise and cheat the nomads, the nomads ill-treat and despise thetownsfolk.§ 5CThe Mongols of the great realm of Kipchak remained nomadic, and grazed theirstock across the wide plains of South Russia and Western Asia adjacent toRussia. They became not very devout Moslems, retaining many traces of theirearlier barbaric Shamanism. Their chief Khan was the Khan of the Golden Horde.To the west, over large tracts of open country, and more particularly in what isnow known as Ukrainia, the old Scythian population, Slavs with a Mongoladmixture, reverted to a similar nomadic life. These Christian nomads, theCossacks, formed a sort of frontier screen against the Tartars, and their freeand adventurous life was so attractive to the peasants of Poland and Lithuaniathat severe laws had to be passed to prevent a vast migration from theplough-lands to the steppes. The serf-owning landlords of Poland regarded theCossacks with considerable hostility on this account, and war was as frequentbetween the Polish chivalry and the Cossacks as it was between the latter andthe Tartars.In the empire of Kipchak, as in Turkestan almost up to the present time, whilethe nomads roamed over wide areas, a number of towns and cultivated regionssustained a settled population which usually paid tribute to the nomad Khan. Insuch towns as Kieff, Moscow, and the like, the pre-Mongol, Christian town lifewent on under Russian dukes or Tartar governors, who collected the tribute forthe Khan of the Golden Horde. The Grand Duke of Moscow gained the confidence ofthe Khan, and gradually, under his authority, obtained an ascendancy over manyof his fellow tributaries. In the fifteenth century, under its grand duke, IvanIII, Ivan the Great (1462-1505), Moscow threw off its Mongol allegiance andrefused to pay tribute any longer (1480). The successors of Constantine nolonger reigned in Constantinople, and Ivan took possession of the Byzantinedouble-headed eagle for his arms. He claimed to be the heir to Byzantium becauseof his marriage (1472) with Zoe Palæologus of the imperial line. This ambitiousgrand dukedom of Moscow assailed and subjugated the ancient Northman tradingrepublic of Novgorod to the north, and so the foundations of the modern RussianEmpire were laid and a link with the mercantile life of the Baltic established.Ivan III did not, however, carry his claim to be the heir of the Christianrulers of Constantinople to the extent of assuming the imperial title. This stepwas taken by his grandson, Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible, because of his insanecruelties; 1533-1584). Although the ruler of Moscow thus came to be called Tsar(Cæsar), his tradition was in many respects Tartar rather than European; he wasautocratic after the unlimited Asiatic pattern, and the form of Christianity heaffected was the Eastern, court-ruled, “orthodox” form, which had reached Russialong before the Mongol conquest, by means of Bulgarian missionaries fromConstantinople.To the west of the domains of Kipchak, outside the range of Mongol rule, asecond centre of Slav consolidation had been set up during the tenth andeleventh centuries in Poland. The Mongol wave had washed over Poland, but hadnever subjugated it. Poland was not “orthodox,” but Roman Catholic in religion;it used the Latin alphabet instead of the strange Russian letters, and itsmonarch never assumed an absolute independence of the Emperor. Poland was infact in its origins an outlying part of Christendom and of the Holy Empire;Russia never was anything of the sort.§ 5DThe nature and development of the empire of the Ilkhans in Persia, Mesopotamia,and Syria is perhaps the most interesting of all the stories of these Mongolpowers, because in this region nomadism really did attempt, and really did to avery considerable degree succeed in its attempt to stamp a settled civilizedsystem out of existence. When Jengis Kahn first invaded China, we are told thatthere was a serious discussion among the Mongol chiefs whether all the towns andsettled populations should not be destroyed. To these simple practitioners ofthe open-air life the settled populations seemed corrupt, crowded, vicious,effeminate, dangerous, and incomprehensible; a detestable human efflorescenceupon what would otherwise have been good pasture. They had no use whatever forthe towns. The early Franks and the Anglo-Saxon conquerors of South Britain seemto have had much the same feeling towards townsmen. But it was only under Hulaguin Mesopotamia that these ideas seem to have been embodied in a deliberatepolicy. The Mongols here did not only burn and massacre; they destroyed theirrigation system that had endured for at least eight thousand years, and withthat the mother civilization of all the Western world came to an end. Since thedays of the priest-kings of Sumeria there had been a continuous cultivation inthese fertile regions, an accumulation of tradition, a great population, asuccession of busy cities, Eridu, Nippur, Babylon, Nineveh, Ctesiphon, Bagdad.Now the fertility ceased. Mesopotamia became a land of ruins and desolation,through which great waters ran to waste, or overflowed their banks to makemalarious swamps. Later on Mosul and Bagdad revived feebly as second-rate towns.. . .028 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_028_r1.gif]But for the defeat and death of Hulagu’s general Kitboga in Palestine (1260),the same fate might have overtaken Egypt. But Egypt was now a Turkish sultanate;it was dominated by a body of soldiers, the Mamelukes, whose ranks, like thoseof their imitators, the Janissaries of the Ottoman Empire, were recruited andkept vigorous by the purchase and training of boy slaves. A capable Sultan suchmen would obey; a weak or evil one they would replace. Under this ascendancyEgypt remained an independent power until 1517, when it fell to the OttomanTurks.The first destructive vigor of Hulagu’s Mongols soon subsided, but in thefifteenth century a last tornado of nomadism arose in Western Turkestan underthe leadership of a certain Timur the Lame, or Timurlane. He was descended inthe female line from Jengis Khan. He established himself in Samarkand, andspread his authority over Kipchak (Turkestan to South Russia), Siberia, andsouthward as far as the Indus. He assumed the title of Great Khan in 1369. Hewas a nomad of the savage school, and he created an empire of desolation fromNorth India to Syria. Pyramids of skulls were his particular architecturalfancy; after the storming of Ispahan he made one of 70,000. His ambition was torestore the empire of Jengis Kahn as he conceived it, a project in which hecompletely failed. He spread destruction far and wide; the Ottoman Turks—it wasbefore the taking of Constantinople and their days of greatness —and Egypt paidhim tribute; the Punjab he devastated; and Delhi surrendered to him. After Delhihad surrendered, however, he made a frightful massacre of its inhabitants. Atthe time of his death (1405) very little remained to witness to his power but aname of horror, ruins and desolated countries, and a shrunken and impoverisheddomain in Persia.The dynasty founded by Timur in Persia was extinguished by another Turkomanhorde fifty years later.§ 5EIn 1505 a small Turkoman chieftain, Baber, a descendant of Timur and thereforeof Jengis, was forced after some years of warfare and some temporarysuccesses—for a time he held Samarkand—to fly with a few followers over theHindu Kush to Afghanistan. There his band increased, and he made himself masterof Cabul. He assembled an army, accumulated guns, and then laid claim to thePunjab, because Timur had conquered it a hundred and seven years before. Hepushed his successes beyond the Punjab. India was in a state of division, andquite ready to welcome any capable invader who promised peace and order. Aftervarious fluctuations of fortune Baber met the Sultan of Delhi at Panipat (1525),ten miles north of that town, and though he had but 25,000 men, provided,however, with guns, against a thousand elephants and four times as many men —thenumbers, by the by, are his own estimate—he gained a complete victory. He ceasedto call himself King of Cabul, and assumed the title of Emperor of Hindustan.“This,” he wrote, “is quite a different world from our countries.” It was finer,more fertile, altogether richer. He conquered as far as Bengal, but his untimelydeath in 1530 checked the tide of Mongol conquest for a quarter of a century,and it was only after the accession of his grandson Akbar that it flowed again.Akbar subjugated all India as far as Berar, and his great-grandson Aurungzeb(1658- 1707) was practically master of the entire peninsula. This great dynastyof Baber (1526-1530), Humayun (1530-1556), Akbar (1556-1605), Jehangir(1605-1628), Shah Jehan (1628-1658), and Aurungzeb (1658-1707), in which sonsucceeded father for six generations, this “Mogul (= Mongol) dynasty,”2[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en50] marks the most splendid agethat had hitherto dawned upon India. Akbar, next perhaps to Asoka, was one ofthe greatest of Indian monarchs, and one of the few royal figures that approachthe stature of great men.To Akbar it is necessary to give the same distinctive attention that we haveshown to Charlemagne or Constantine the Great. He is one of the hinges ofhistory. Much of his work of consolidation and organization in India survives tothis day. It was taken over and continued by the British when they became thesuccessors of the Mogul emperors. The British monarch, indeed, now uses as hisIndian title the title of the Mogul emperors, Kaisar-i-Hind. All the other greatadministrations of the descendants of Jengis Khan, in Russia, throughout Westernand Central Asia and in China, have long since dissolved away and given place toother forms of government. Their governments were indeed little more than taxinggovernments; a system of revenue-collecting to feed the central establishment ofthe ruler, like the Golden Horde in South Russia or the imperial city atKarakorum or Pekin. The life and ideas of the people they left alone, carelesshow they lived—so long as they paid. So it was that after centuries ofsubjugation, a Christian Moscow and Kieff, a Shiite Persia, and a thoroughlyChinese China rose again from their Mongol submergence. But Akbar made a newIndia. He gave the princes and ruling classes of India some inklings at least ofa common interest. If India is now anything more than a sort of rag-bag ofincoherent states and races, a prey to every casual raider from the north, it isvery largely due to him.His distinctive quality was his openness of mind. He set himself to make everysort of able man in India, whatever his race or religion, available for thepublic work of Indian life. His instinct was the true statesman’s instinct forsynthesis. His empire was to be neither a Moslem nor a Mongol one, nor was it tobe Rajput or Aryan, or Dravidian, or Hindu, or high or low caste; it was to beIndian. “During the years of his training he enjoyed many opportunities ofnoting the good qualities, the fidelity, the devotion, often the nobility ofsoul, of those Hindu princes, whom, because they were followers of Brahma, hisMoslem courtiers devoted mentally to eternal torments. He noted that these men,and men who thought like them, constituted the vast majority of his subjects. Henoted, further, of many of them, and those the most trustworthy, that thoughthey had apparently much to gain from a worldly point of view by embracing thereligion of the court, they held fast to their own. His reflective mind,therefore, was unwilling from the outset to accept the theory that because he,the conqueror, the ruler, happened to be born a Muhammadan, thereforeMuhammadanism was true for all mankind. Gradually his thoughts found words inthe utterance: ‘Why should I claim to guide men before I myself am guided?’ and,as he listened to other doctrines and other creeds, his honest doubts becameconfirmed, and, noting daily the bitter narrowness of sectarianism, no matter ofwhat form of religion, he became more and more wedded to the principle oftoleration for all.”“The son of a fugitive emperor,” says Dr. Emil Schmit, “born in the desert,brought up in nominal confinement, he had known the bitter side of life from hisyouth up. Fortune had given him a powerful frame, which he trained to supportthe extremities of exertion. Physical exercise was with him a passion; he wasdevoted to the chase and especially to the fierce excitement of catching thewild horse or elephant or slaying the dangerous tiger. On one occasion, when itwas necessary to dissuade the Raja of Jodhpore to abandon his intention offorcing the widow of his deceased son to mount the funeral pyre, Akbar rode twohundred and twenty miles in two days. In battle he displayed the utmost bravery.He led his troops in person during the dangerous part of a campaign, leaving tohis generals the lighter task of finishing the war. In every victory hedisplayed humanity to the conquered, and decisively opposed any exhibition ofcruelty. Free from all those prejudices which separate society and createdissension, tolerant to men of other beliefs, impartial to men of other races,whether Hindu or Dravidian, he was a man obviously marked out to weld theconflicting elements of his kingdom into a strong and prosperous whole.“In all seriousness he devoted himself to the work of peace. Moderate in allpleasures, needing but little sleep and accustomed to divide his time with theutmost accuracy, he found leisure to devote himself to science and art after thecompletion of his State duties. The famous personages and scholars who adornedthe capital he had built for himself at Fatepur-Sikri were at the same time hisfriends; every Thursday evening a circle of these was collected for intellectualconversation and philosophical discussion. His closest friends were two highlytalented brothers, Faizi and Abul Fazl, the sons of a learned free-thinker. Theelder of these was a famous scholar in Hindu literature; with his help, andunder his direction, Akbar had the most important of the Sanskrit workstranslated into Persian. Fazl, on the other hand, who was an especially closefriend of Akbar, was a general, a statesman, and an organizer, and to hisactivity Akbar’s kingdom chiefly owed the solidarity of its internalorganization.”3 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en51](Such was the quality of the circle that used to meet in the palaces ofFatehpur-Sikri, buildings which still stand in the Indian sunlight—but empty nowand desolate. Fatehpur-Sikri, like the city of Ambar, is now a dead city. A fewyears ago the child of a British official was killed by a panther in one of itssilent streets.)All this that we have quoted reveals a pre-eminent monarch. But Akbar, like allmen, great or petty, lived within the limitations of his period and its circleof ideas. And a Turkoman, ruling in India, was necessarily ignorant of much thatEurope had been painfully learning for a thousand years. He knew nothing of thegrowth of a popular consciousness in Europe, and little or nothing of the wideeducational possibilities that the church had been working out in the West. Hisupbringing in Islam and his native genius made it plain to him that a greatnation in India could only be cemented by common ideas upon a religious basis,but the knowledge of how such a solidarity could be created and sustained byuniversal schools, cheap books, and a university system at once organized andfree to think, to which the modern state is still feeling its way, was asimpossible to him as a knowledge of steamboats or aeroplanes. The form of Islamhe knew best was the narrow and fiercely intolerant form of the TurkishSunnites. The Moslems were only a minority of the population. The problem hefaced was indeed very parallel to the problem of Constantine the Great. But ithad peculiar difficulties of its own. He never got beyond an attempt to adaptIslam to a wider appeal by substituting for “There is one God, and Muhammad ishis prophet,” the declaration, “There is one God, and the Emperor is hisvice-regent.” This he thought might form a common platform for every variety offaith in India, that kaleidoscope of religions. With this faith he associated asimple ritual borrowed from the Persian Zorastrians (the Parsees) who stillsurvived, and survive today, in India. This new state religion, however, diedwith him, because it had no roots in the minds of the people about him.The essential factor in the organization of a living state, the world is comingto realize, is the organization of an education. This Akbar never understood.And he had no class of men available who would suggest such an idea to him orhelp him to carry it out. The Moslem teachers in India were not so much teachersas conservators of an intense bigotry; they did not want a common mind in India,but only a common intolerance in Islam. The Brahmins, who had the monopoly ofteaching among the Hindus, had all the conceit and slackness of hereditaryprivilege. Yet though Akbar made no general educational scheme for India, he setup a number of Moslem and Hindu schools. He knew less and he did more for Indiain these matters than the British who succeeded him. Some of the Britishviceroys have aped his magnificence, his costly tents and awnings, his palatialbuildings and his elephants of state, but none have gone far enough beyond thepolitical outlook of this mediæval Turkoman to attempt that popular educationwhich is an absolute necessity to India before she can play her fitting part inthe commonweal of mankind.§ 5FA curious side result of these later Mongol perturbations, those of thefourteenth century of which Timurlane was the head and centre, was theappearance of drifting batches of a strange refugee Eastern people in Europe,the Gipsies. They appeared somewhen about the end of the fourteenth and earlyfifteenth centuries in Greece, where they were believed to be Egyptians (henceGipsy), a very general persuasion which they themselves accepted anddisseminated. Their leaders, however, styled themselves “Counts of Asia Minor.”They had probably been drifting about Western Asia for some centuries before themassacres of Timurlane drove them over the Hellespont. They may have beendislodged from their original homeland—as the Ottoman Turks were—by the greatcataclysm of Jengis or even earlier. They had drifted about as the Ottoman Turkshad drifted about, but with less good fortune. They spread slowly westwardacross Europe, strange fragments of nomadism in a world of plough and city,driven off their ancient habitat of the Bactrian steppes to harbour uponEuropean commons and by hedgerows and in wild woodlands and neglected patches.The Germans called them “Hungarians” and “Tartars,” the French, “Bohemians.”They do not seem to have kept the true tradition of their origin, but they havea distinctive language which indicates their lost history; it contains manyNorth Indian words, and is probably in its origin North Indian. There are alsoconsiderable Armenian and Persian elements in their speech. They are found inall European countries today; they are tinkers, pedlars, horse-dealers, showmen,fortune-tellers, and beggars. To many imaginative minds their waysideencampments, with their smoking fires, their rounded tents, their hobbledhorses, and their brawl of sunburnt children, have a very strong appeal.Civilization is so new a thing in history, and has been for most of the time sovery local a thing, that it has still to conquer and assimilate most of ourinstincts to its needs. In most of us, irked by its conventions andcomplexities, there stirs the nomad strain. We are but half-heartedhome-keepers. The blood in our veins was brewed on the steppes as well as on theplough lands."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VITHE RENASCENCE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION1[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en52](Land Ways Give Place to Sea Ways)§ 1.

Thesecenturies were the Age of the Mongolian peoples. Nomadism from Central Asiadominated the known world. At the crest of this period there were rulers ofMongol or the kindred Turkish race and nomadic tradition in China, India,Persia, Egypt, North Africa, the Balkan peninsula, Hungary, and Russia. TheOttoman Turk had even taken to the sea, and fought the Venetian upon his ownMediterranean waters. In 1529 the Turks besieged Vienna, and were defeatedrather by the weather than by the defenders. The Habsburg empire of Charles Vpaid the Sultan tribute. It was not until the battle of Lepanto in 1571, thebattle in which Cervantes, the author of Don Quixote, lost his left arm, thatChristendom, to use his words, “broke the pride of the Osmans and undeceived theworld which had regarded the Turkish fleet as invincible.” The sole region ofChristian advance was Spain. A man of foresight surveying the world in the earlysixteenth century might well have concluded that it was only a matter of a fewgenerations before the whole world became Mongolian—and probably Moslem. Just astoday most people seem to take it for granted that European rule and a sort ofliberal Christianity are destined to spread over the whole world. Few peopleseem to realize how recent a thing is this European ascendancy. It was only asthe fifteenth century drew to its close that any indications of the realvitality of Western Europe became clearly apparent.029 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_029_r1.gif]Our history is now approaching our own times, and our study becomes more andmore a study of the existing state of affairs. The European or Europeanizedsystem in which the reader is living, is the same system that we see developingin the crumpled-up, Mongol-threatened Europe of the early fifteenth century. Itsproblems then were the embryonic form of the problems of today. It is impossibleto discuss that time without discussing our own time. We become political inspite of ourselves. “Politics without history has no root,” said Sir J. R.Seeley; “history without politics has no fruit.”Let us try, with as much detachment as we can achieve, to discover what theforces were that were dividing and holding back the energies of Europe duringthis tremendous outbreak of the Mongol peoples, and how we are to explain theaccumulation of mental and physical energy that undoubtedly went on during thisphase of apparent retrocession, and which broke out so impressively at itsclose.Now, just as in the Mesozoic Age, while the great reptiles lorded it over theearth, there were developing in odd out-of-the-way corners those hairy mammalsand feathered birds who were finally to supersede that tremendous faunaaltogether by another far more versatile and capable, so in the limitedterritories of Western Europe of the Middle Ages, while the Mongolian monarchiesdominated the world from the Danube to the Pacific and from the Arctic seas toMadras and Morocco and the Nile, the fundamental lines of a new and harder andmore efficient type of human community were being laid down. This type ofcommunity, which is still only in the phase of formation, which is still growingand experimental, we may perhaps speak of as the “modern state.” This is, wemust recognize, a vague expression, but we shall endeavour to get meaning intoit as we proceed. We have noted the appearance of its main root ideas in theGreek republics and especially in Athens, in the great Roman republic, inJudaism, in Islam, and in the story of Western Catholicism. Essentially thismodern state, as we see it growing under our eyes today, is a tentativecombination of two apparently contradictory ideas, the idea of a community offaith and obedience, such as the earliest civilizations undoubtedly were, andthe idea of a community of will, such as were the primitive political groupingsof the Nordic and Hunnish peoples. For thousands of years the settled civilizedpeoples, who were originally in most cases dark-white Caucasians, or Dravidianor Southern Mongolian peoples, seem to have developed their ideas and habitsalong the line of worship and personal subjection, and the nomadic peoplestheirs along the line of personal self-reliance and self-assertion. Naturallyenough under the circumstances the nomadic peoples were always supplying thecivilizations with fresh rulers and new aristocracies. That is the rhythm of allearly history. It was only after thousands of years of cyclic changes betweenrefreshment by nomadic conquest, civilization, decadence, and fresh conquestthat the present process of a mutual blending of “civilized” and “free”tendencies into a new type of community, that now demands our attention andwhich is the substance of contemporary history, began.We have traced in this history the slow development of larger and larger“civilized” human communities from the days of the primitive Palæolithic familytribe. We have seen how the advantages and necessities of cultivation, the fearof tribal gods, the ideas of the priest-king and the god-king, played their partin consolidating continually larger and more powerful societies in regions ofmaximum fertility. We have watched the interplay of priest, who was usuallynative, and monarch, who was usually a conqueror, in these early civilizations,the development of a written tradition and its escape from priestly control, andthe appearance of novel forces, at first apparently incidental and secondary,which we have called the free intelligence and the free conscience of mankind.We have seen the rulers of the primitive civilizations of the river valleyswidening their area and extending their sway, and simultaneously over the lessfertile areas of the earth we have seen mere tribal savagery develop into a moreand more united and politically competent nomadism. Steadily and divergentlymankind pursued one or other of these two lines. For long ages all thecivilizations grew and developed along monarchist lines, upon lines of absolutemonarchy, and in every monarchy and dynasty we have watched, as if it were anecessary process, efficiency and energy give way to pomp, indolence, and decay,and finally succumb to some fresher lineage from the desert or the steppe. Thestory of the early cultivating civilizations and their temples and courts andcities bulks large in human history, but it is well to remember that the sceneof that story was never more than a very small part of the land surface of theglobe. Over the greater part of the earth until quite recently, until the lasttwo thousand years, the hardier, less numerous tribal peoples of forest andparkland and the nomadic peoples of the seasonal grasslands maintained anddeveloped their own ways of life.The primitive civilizations were, we may say, “communities of obedience”;obedience to god-kings or kings under gods was their cement; the nomadictendency on the other hand has always been towards a different type ofassociation which we shall here call a “community of will.” In a wandering,fighting community the individual must be at once self-reliant and disciplined.The chiefs of such communities must be chiefs who are followed, not masters whocompel. This community of will is traceable throughout the entire history ofmankind; everywhere we find the original disposition of all the nomads alike,Nordic, Semitic, or Mongolian, was individually more willing and more erect thanthat of the settled folk. The Nordic peoples came into Italy and Greece underleader kings; they did not bring any systematic temple cults with them, theyfound such things in the conquered lands and adapted as they adopted them. TheGreeks and Latins lapsed very easily again into republics, and so did the Aryansin India. There was a tradition of election also in the early Frankish andGerman kingdoms, though the decision was usually taken between one or othermembers of a royal caste or family. The early Caliphs were elected, the Judgesof Israel and the “kings” of Carthage and Tyre were elected, and so was theGreat Khan of the Mongols until Kublai became a Chinese monarch. . . . Equallyconstant in the settled lands do we find the opposite idea, the idea of anon-elective divinity in kings and of their natural and inherent right to rule.. . . As our history has developed we have noted the appearance of new andcomplicating elements in the story of human societies; we have seen that nomadturned go-between, the trader, appear, and we have noted the growing importanceof shipping in the world. It seems as inevitable that voyaging should make menfree in their minds as that settlement within a narrow horizon should make mentimid and servile. . . . But in spite of all such complications, the broadantagonism between the method of obedience and the method of will runs throughhistory down into our own times. To this day their reconciliation is incomplete.Civilization even in its most servile forms has always offered much that isenormously attractive, convenient, and congenial to mankind; but somethingrestless and untamed in our race has striven continually to convert civilizationfrom its original reliance upon unparticipating obedience into a community ofparticipating wills. And to the lurking nomadism in our blood, and particularlyin the blood of monarchs and aristocracies, we must ascribe also that incessanturgency towards a wider range that forces every state to extend its boundariesif it can, and to spread its interests to the ends of the earth. The power ofnomadic restlessness that tends to bring all the earth under one rule, seems tobe identical with the spirit that makes most of us chafe under direction andrestraint, and seek to participate in whatever government we tolerate. And thisnatural, this temperamental struggle of mankind to reconcile civilization withfreedom has been kept alive age after age by the military and politicalimpotence of every “community of obedience” that has ever existed. Obedience,once men are broken to it, can be easily captured and transferred; witness thepassive rôle of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India, the original and typical lands ofsubmission, the “cradles of civilization,” as they have passed from one lordshipto another. A servile civilization is a standing invitation to predatory freemen. But on the other hand a “community of will” necessitates a fusion ofintractable materials; it is a far harder community to bring about, and stillmore difficult to maintain. The story of Alexander the Great displays thecommunity of will of the Macedonian captains gradually dissolving before hisdemand that they should worship him. The incident of the murder of Clitus isquite typical of the struggle between the free and the servile tradition thatwent on whenever a new conqueror from the open lands and the open air foundhimself installed in the palace of an ancient monarchy.In the case of the Roman Republic, history tells of the first big community ofwill in the world’s history, the first free community much larger than a city,and how it weakened with growth and spent itself upon success until at last itgave way to a monarchy of the ancient type, and decayed swiftly into one of thefeeblest communities of servitude that ever collapsed before a handful ofinvaders. We have given some attention in this book to the factors in thatdecay, because they are of primary importance in human history. One of the mostevident was the want of any wide organization of education to base the ordinarycitizens’ minds upon the idea of service and obligation to the republic, to keepthem willing, that is; another was the absence of any medium of generalinformation to keep their activities in harmony, to enable them to will as onebody. The community of will is limited in size by the limitations set upon thepossibilities of a community of knowledge. The concentration of property in afew hands and the replacement of free workers by slaves were rendered possibleby the decay of public spirit and the confusion of the public intelligence thatresulted from these limitations. There was, moreover, no efficient religiousidea behind the Roman state; the dark Etruscan liver-peering cult of Rome was aslittle adapted to the political needs of a great community as the very similarShamanism of the Mongols. It is in the fact that both Christianity and Islam, intheir distinctive ways, did at least promise to supply, for the first time inhuman experience, this patent gap in the Roman republican system as well as inthe nomadic system, to give a common moral education for a mass of people, andto supply them with a common history of the past and a common idea of a humanpurpose and destiny, that their enormous historical importance lies. Aristotle,as we have noted, had set a limit to the ideal community of a few thousandcitizens, because he could not conceive how a larger multitude could be heldtogether by a common idea. He had had no experience of any sort of educationbeyond the tutorial methods of his time. Greek education was almost purelyviva-voce education; it could reach therefore only to a limited aristocracy.Both the Christian church and Islam demonstrated the unsoundness of Aristotle’slimitation. We may think they did their task of education in their vast fieldsof opportunity crudely or badly, but the point of interest to us is that theydid it at all. Both sustained almost world-wide propagandas of idea andinspiration. Both relied successfully upon the power of the written word to linkgreat multitudes of diverse men together in common enterprises. By the eleventhcentury, as we have seen, the idea of Christendom had been imposed upon all thevast warring miscellany of the smashed and pulverized Western empire, and uponEurope far beyond its limits, as a uniting and inspiring idea. It had made ashallow but effective community of will over an unprecedented area and out of anunprecedented multitude of human beings. Only one other thing at all like thishad ever happened to any great section of mankind before, and that was the ideaof a community of good behaviour that the literati had spread throughout China.2[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en53]The Catholic Church provided what the Roman Republic had lacked, a system ofpopular teaching, a number of universities and methods of intellectualinter-communication. By this achievement it opened the way to the newpossibilities of human government that now become apparent in this Outline,possibilities that are still being apprehended and worked out in the world inwhich we are living. Hitherto the government of states had been eitherauthoritative, under some uncriticized and unchallenged combination of priestand monarch, or it had been a democracy, uneducated and uninformed, degeneratingwith any considerable increase of size, as Rome and Athens did, into a mere ruleby mob and politician. But by the thirteenth century the first intimations hadalready dawned of an ideal of government which is still making its way torealization, the modern ideal, the ideal of a world-wide educational government,in which the ordinary man is neither the slave of an absolute monarch nor of ademagogue-ruled state, but an informed, inspired, and consulted part of hiscommunity. It is upon the word educational that stress must be laid, and uponthe idea that information must precede consultation. It is in the practicalrealization of this idea that education is a collective function and not aprivate affair that one essential distinction of the “modern state” from any ofits precursors lies. The modern citizen, men are coming to realize, must beinformed first and then consulted. Before he can vote he must hear the evidence;before he can decide he must know. It is not by setting up polling booths, butby setting up schools and making literature and knowledge and news universallyaccessible that the way is opened from servitude and confusion to that willinglycooperative state which is the modern ideal. Votes in themselves are worthlessthings. Men had votes in Italy in the time of the Gracchi. Their votes did nothelp them. Until a man has education, a vote is a useless and dangerous thingfor him to possess. The ideal community towards which we move is not a communityof will simply; it is a community of knowledge and will, replacing a communityof faith and obedience. Education is the adapter which will make the nomadicspirit of freedom and self-reliance compatible with the cooperations and wealthand security of civilization.§ 2But though it is certain that the Catholic Church, through its propagandas, itspopular appeals, its schools and universities, opened up the prospect of themodern educational state in Europe, it is equally certain that the CatholicChurch never intended to do anything of the sort. It did not send out knowledgewith its blessing; it let it loose inadvertently. It was not the Roman Republicwhose heir the Church esteemed itself, but the Roman Emperor. Its conception ofeducation was not release, not an invitation to participate, but the subjugationof minds. Two of the greatest educators of the Middle Ages were indeed notchurchmen at all, but monarchs and statesmen, Charlemagne and Alfred the Greatof England, who made use of the church organization. But it was the church thathad provided the organization. Church and monarchs in their mutual grapple forpower were both calling to their aid the thoughts of the common man. In responseto these conflicting appeals appeared the common man, the unofficial outsideindependent man, thinking for himself.Already in the thirteenth century we have seen Pope Gregory IX and the EmperorFrederick II engaging in a violent public controversy. Already then there was asense that a new arbitrator greater than pope or monarchy had come into theworld, that there were readers and a public opinion. The exodus of the popes toAvignon, and the divisions and disorders of the Papacy during the fourteenthcentury, stimulated this free judgment upon authority throughout Europeenormously.At first the current criticism upon the church concerned only moral and materialthings. The wealth and luxury of the higher clergy and the heavy papal taxationwere the chief grounds of complaint. And the earlier attempts to restoreChristian simplicity, the foundation of the Franciscans, for example, were notmovements of separation, but movements of revival. Only later did a deeper andmore distinctive criticism develop which attacked the central fact of thechurch’s teaching and the justification of priestly importance; namely, thesacrifice of the mass.We have sketched in broad outlines the early beginnings of Christianity, and wehave shown how rapidly that difficult and austere conception of the Kingdom ofGod, which was the central idea of the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, wasoverlaid by a revival of the ancient sacrificial idea, a doctrine more difficultindeed to grasp, but easier to reconcile with the habits and dispositions andacquiescences of everyday life in the Near East. We have noted how a sort oftheocrasia went on between Christianity and Judaism and the cult of the Serapeumand Mithraism and other competing cults, by which the Mithraist Sunday, theJewish idea of blood as a religious essential, the Alexandrian importance of theMother of God, the shaven and fasting priest, self-tormenting asceticism, andmany other matters of belief and ritual and practice, became grafted upon thedeveloping religion. These adaptations, no doubt, made the new teaching muchmore understandable and acceptable in Egypt and Syria and the like. They werethings in the way of thought of the dark-white Mediterranean race; they werecongenial to that type. But as we have shown in our story of Muhammad, theseacquisitions did not make Christianity more acceptable to the Arab nomads; tothem these features made it disgusting. And so, too, the robed and shaven monkand nun and priest seem to have roused something like an instinctive hostilityin the Nordic barbarians of the North and West. We have noted the peculiar biasof the early Anglo-Saxons and Northmen against the monks and nuns. They seem tohave felt that the lives and habits of these devotees were queer and unnatural.The clash between what we may call the “dark-white” factors and the newerelements in Christianity was no doubt intensified by Pope Gregory Vll’simposition of celibacy upon the Catholic priests in the eleventh century. TheEast had known religious celibates for thousands of years; in the West they wereregarded with scepticism and suspicion.And now in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, as the lay mind of theNordic peoples began to acquire learning, to read and write and express itself,and as it came into touch with the stimulating activities of the Arab mind, wefind a much more formidable criticism of Catholicism beginning, an intellectualattack upon the priest as priest, and upon the ceremony of the mass as thecentral fact of the religious life, coupled with a demand for a return to thepersonal teachings of Jesus as recorded in the Gospels.We have already mentioned the career of the Englishman Wycliffe (c. 1320-1384),and how he translated the Bible into English in order to set up a counterauthority to that of the Pope. He denounced the doctrines of the church aboutthe mass as disastrous error, and particularly the teaching that the consecratedbread eaten in that ceremony becomes in some magical way the actual body ofChrist. We will not pursue the question of transubstantiation, as this processof the mystical change of the elements in the sacrament is called, into itsintricacies. These are matters for the theological specialist. But it will beobvious that any doctrine, such as the Catholic doctrine, which makes theconsecration of the elements in the sacrament a miraculous process performed bythe priest, and only to be performed by the priest, and which makes thesacrament the central necessity of the religious system, enhances the importanceof the priestly order enormously. On the other hand, the view, which was thetypical “Protestant” view, that this sacrament is a mere eating of bread anddrinking of wine as a personal remembrance of Jesus of Nazareth, does away atlast with any particular need for a consecrated priest at all. Wycliffe himselfdid not go to this extremity; he was a priest, and he remained a priest to theend of his life, he held that God was spiritually if not substantially presentin the consecrated bread, but his doctrine raised a question that carried menfar beyond his positions. From the point of view of the historian, the struggleagainst Rome that Wycliffe opened became very speedily a struggle of what onemay call rational or layman’s religion making its appeal to the freeintelligence and the free conscience in mankind, against authoritative,traditional, ceremonial, and priestly religion. The ultimate tendency of thiscomplicated struggle was to strip Christianity as bare as Islam of every vestigeof ancient priestcraft, to revert to the Bible documents as authority, and torecover, if possible, the primordial teachings of Jesus. Most of its issues arestill undecided among Christians to this day.Wycliffe’s writings had nowhere more influence than in Bohemia. About 1396 alearned Czech, John Huss, delivered a series of lectures in the university ofPrague based upon the doctrines of the great Oxford teacher. Huss became rectorof the university, and his teachings roused the church to excommunicate him(1412). This was at the time of the Great Schism, just before the Council ofConstance (1414-1418) gathered to discuss the scandalous disorder of the church.We have already told how the schism was ended by the election of Martin V. Thecouncil aspired to reunite Christendom completely. But the methods by which itsought this reunion jar with our modern consciences. Wycliffe’s bones werecondemned to be burnt. Huss was decoyed to Constance under promise of a safeconduct, and he was then put upon his trial for heresy. He was ordered to recantcertain of his opinions. He replied that he could not recant until he wasconvinced of his error. He was told that it was his duty to recant if hissuperiors required it of him, whether he was convinced or not. He refused toaccept this view. In spite of the Emperor’s safe conduct, he was burnt alive(1415), a martyr not for any specific doctrine, but for the free intelligenceand free conscience of mankind.It would be impossible to put the issue between priest and anti-priest moreclearly than it was put at this trial of John Huss, nor to demonstrate morecompletely the evil spirit in priestcraft. A colleague of Huss, Jerome ofPrague, was burnt in the following year.These outrages were followed by an insurrection of the Hussites in Bohemia(1419), the first of a series of religious wars that marked the breaking-up ofChristendom. In 1420 the Pope, Martin V, issued a bull proclaiming a crusade“for the destruction of the Wycliffites, Hussites, and all other heretics inBohemia,” and attracted by this invitation the unemployed soldiers of fortuneand all the drifting blackguardism of Europe converged upon that valiantcountry. They found in Bohemia, under its great leader Ziska, more hardship andless loot than crusaders were disposed to face. The Hussites were conductingtheir affairs upon extreme democratic lines, and the whole country was aflamewith enthusiasm. The crusaders beleaguered Prague, but failed to take it, andthey experienced a series of reverses that ended in their retreat from Bohemia.A second crusade (1421) was no more successful. Two other crusades failed. Thenunhappily the Hussites fell into internal dissensions. Encouraged by this, afifth crusade (1431) crossed the frontier under Frederick, Margrave ofBrandenburg.The army of these crusaders, according to the lowest estimates, consisted of90,000 infantry and 40,000 horsemen. Attacking Bohemia from the west, they firstlaid siege to the town of Tachov, but failing to capture the strongly fortifiedcity, they stormed the little town of Most, and here, as well as in thesurrounding country, committed the most horrible atrocities on a population alarge part of which was entirely innocent of any form of theology whatever. Thecrusaders, advancing by slow marches, penetrated further into Bohemia, till theyreached the neighbourhood of the town of Domazlice (Tauss). “It was at threeo’clock on August 14th, 1431, that the crusaders, who were encamped in the plainbetween Domazlice and Horsuv Tyn, received the news that the Hussites, under theleadership of Prokop the Great, were approaching. Though the Bohemians werestill four miles off, the rattle of their war-wagons and the song, ‘All yewarriors of God,’ which their whole host was chanting, could already be heard.”The enthusiasm of the crusaders evaporated with astounding rapidity. Lützow3[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en54] describes how the papalrepresentative and the Duke of Saxony ascended a convenient hill to inspect thebattlefield. It was, they discovered, not going to be a battlefield. The Germancamp was in utter confusion. Horsemen were streaming off in every direction, andthe clatter of empty wagons being driven off almost drowned the sound of thatterrible singing. The crusaders were abandoning even their loot. Came a messagefrom the Margrave of Brandenburg advising flight; there was no holding any oftheir troops. They were dangerous now only to their own side, and the papalrepresentative spent an unpleasant night hiding from them in the forest. . . .So ended the Bohemian crusade.In 1434 civil war again broke out among the Hussites, in which the extreme andmost valiant section was defeated, and in 1436 an agreement was patched upbetween the Council of Basle and the moderate Hussites, in which the Bohemianchurch was allowed to retain certain distinctions from the general Catholicpractice, which held good until the German Reformation in the sixteenth century.§ 3The split among the Hussites was largely due to the drift of the extremersection towards a primitive communism, which alarmed the wealthier and moreinfluential Czech noblemen. Similar tendencies had already appeared among theEnglish Wycliffites. They seem to follow naturally enough upon the doctrines ofequal human brotherhood that emerge whenever there is an attempt to reach backto the fundamentals of Christianity.The development of such ideas had been greatly stimulated by a stupendousmisfortune that had swept the world and laid bare the foundations of society, apestilence of unheard-of virulence. It was called the Black Death, and it camenearer to the extirpation of mankind than any other evil has ever done. It wasfar more deadly than the plague of Pericles, or the plague of Marcus Aurelius,or the plague waves of the time of Justinian and Gregory the Great that pavedthe way for the Lombards in Italy. It arose in South Russia or Central Asia, andcame by way of the Crimea and a Genoese ship to Genoa and Western Europe. Itpassed by Armenia to Asia Minor, Egypt, and North Africa. It reached England in1348. Two-thirds of the students at Oxford died, we are told; it is estimatedthat between a quarter and a half of the whole population of England perished atthis time. Throughout all Europe there was as great a mortality. Heckerestimates the total as twenty-five million dead. It spread eastward to China,where, the Chinese records say, thirteen million people perished. In China thesocial disorganization led to a neglect of the river embankments, and as aconsequence great floods devastated the crowded agricultural lands.4[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en55]Never was there so clear a warning to mankind to seek knowledge and cease frombickering, to unite against the dark powers of nature. All the massacres ofHulagu and Timurlane were as nothing to this. “Its ravages,” says J. R. Green,“were fiercest in the greater towns, where filthy and undrained streets affordeda constant haunt to leprosy and fever. In the burial-ground which the piety ofSir Walter Manny purchased for the citizens of London, a spot whose site wasafterwards marked by the Charter House, more than fifty thousand corpses aresaid to have been interred. Thousands of people perished at Norwich, while inBristol the living were hardly able to bury the dead. But the Black Death fellon the villages almost as fiercely as on the towns. More than one-half of thepriests of Yorkshire are known to have perished; in the diocese of Norwichtwo-thirds of the parishes changed their incumbents. The whole organization oflabour was thrown out of gear. The scarcity of hands made it difficult for theminor tenants to perform the services due for their lands, and only a temporaryabandonment of half the rent by the landowners induced the farmers to refrainfrom the abandonment of their farms. For a time cultivation became impossible.‘The sheep and cattle strayed through the fields and corn,’ says a contemporary,‘and there were none left who could drive them.’”It was from these distresses that the peasant wars of the fourteenth centurysprang. There was a great shortage of labour and a great shortage of goods, andthe rich abbots and monastic cultivators who owned so much of the land, and thenobles and rich merchants, were too ignorant of economic laws to understand thatthey must not press upon the toilers in this time of general distress. They sawtheir property deteriorating, their lands going out of cultivation, and theymade violent statutes to compel men to work without any rise in wages, and toprevent their straying in search of better employment. Naturally enough thisprovoked “a new revolt against the whole system of social inequality which hadtill then passed unquestioned as the divine order of the world. The cry of thepoor found a terrible utterance in the words of ‘a mad priest of Kent,’ as thecourtly Froissart calls him, who for twenty years (1360-1381) found audience forhis sermons, in defiance of interdict and imprisonment, in the stout yeomen whogathered in the Kentish churchyards. ‘Mad,’ as the landowners called him, it wasin the preaching of John Ball that England first listened to a declaration ofnatural equality and the rights of man. ‘Good people,’ cried the preacher,‘things will never go well in England so long as goods be not in common, and solong as there be villeins and gentlemen. By what right are they whom we calllords greater folk than we? On what grounds have they deserved it? Why do theyhold us in serfage? If we all came of the same father and mother, of Adam andEve, how can they say or prove that they are better than we, if it be not thatthey make us gain for them by our toil what they spend in their pride? They areclothed in velvet and warm in their furs and their ermines, while we are coveredwith rags. They have wine and spices and fair bread; and we oat-cake and straw,and water to drink. They have leisure and fine houses; we have pain and labour,the rain and the wind in the fields. And yet it is of us and of our toil thatthese men hold their state.’ A spirit fatal to the whole system of the MiddleAges breathed in the popular rhyme which condensed the levelling doctrine ofJohn Ball: ‘When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?’”5[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en56]030 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_030_r1.gif]Wat Tyler, the leader of the English insurgents, was assassinated by the Mayorof London in the presence of the young King Richard II (1381), and his movementcollapsed. The communist side of the Hussite movement was a part of the samesystem of disturbance. A little earlier than the English outbreak had occurredthe French “Jacquerie” (1358), in which the French peasants had risen, burntchâteaux, and devastated the countryside. A century later the same urgency wasto sweep Germany into a series of bloody Peasant Wars. These began late in thefifteenth century. Economic and religious disturbance mingled in the case ofGermany even more plainly than in England. One conspicuous phase of these Germantroubles was the Anabaptist outbreak. The sect of the Anabaptists appeared inWittenberg in 1521 under three “prophets,” and broke out into insurrection in1525. Between 1532 and 1535 the insurgents held the town of Münster inWestphalia, and did their utmost to realize their ideas of a religiouscommunism. They were besieged by the Bishop of Münster, and under the distressesof the siege a sort of insanity ran rife in the town; cannibalism is said tohave occurred, and a certain John of Leyden seized power, proclaimed himself thesuccessor of King David, and followed that monarch’s evil example by practisingpolygamy. After the surrender of the city the victorious bishop had theAnabaptist leaders tortured very horribly and executed in the market-place,their mutilated bodies being hung in cages from a church tower to witness to allthe world that decency and order were now restored in Münster. . . .These upheavals of the common labouring men of the Western European countries inthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were more serious and sustained thananything that had ever happened in history before. The nearest previous approachto them were certain communistic Muhammadan movements in Persia. There was apeasant revolt in Normandy about A.D. 1000, and there were revolts of peasants(Bagaudæ) in the later Roman Empire, but these were not nearly so formidable.They show a new spirit growing in human affairs, a spirit altogether differentfrom the unquestioning apathy of the serfs and peasants in the original regionsof civilization or from the anarchist hopelessness of the serf and slave labourof the Roman capitalists. All these early insurrections of the workers that wehave mentioned were suppressed with much cruelty, but the movement itself wasnever completely stamped out. From that time to this there has been a spirit ofrevolt in the lower levels of the pyramid of civilization. There have beenphases of insurrection, phases of repression, phases of compromise andcomparative pacification; but from that time until this, the struggle has neverwholly ceased. We shall see it flaring out during the French Revolution at theend of the eighteenth century, insurgent again in the middle and at the openingof the last quarter of the nineteenth century, and achieving vast proportions inthe world of today. The socialist movement of the nineteenth century was onlyone version of that continuing revolt.In many countries, in France and Germany and Russia, for example, this labourmovement has assumed at times an attitude hostile to Christianity, but there canbe little doubt that this steady and, on the whole, growing pressure of thecommon man in the West against a life of toil and subservience is closelyassociated with Christian teaching. The church and the Christian missionary maynot have intended to spread equalitarian doctrines, but behind the church wasthe unquenchable personality of Jesus of Nazareth, and even in spite of himselfthe Christian preacher brought the seeds of freedom and responsibility with him,and sooner or later they shot up where he had been.This steady and growing upheaval of “Labour,” its development of a consciousnessof itself as a class and of a definite claim upon the world at large, quite asmuch as the presence of schools and universities, quite as much as abundantprinted books and a developing and expanding process of scientific research,mark off our present type of civilization, the “modern civilization,” from anypre-existing state of human society, and mark it, for all its incidentalsuccesses, as a thing unfinished and transitory. It is an embryo or it issomething doomed to die. It may be able to solve this complex problem ofcoordinated toil and happiness, and so adjust itself to the needs of the humansoul, or it may fail and end in a catastrophe as the Roman system did. It may bethe opening phase of some more balanced and satisfying order of society, or itmay be a system destined to disruption and replacement by some differentlyconceived method of human association. Like its predecessor, our presentcivilization may be no more than one of those crops farmers sow to improve theirland by the fixation of nitrogen from the air; it may have grown only that,accumulating certain traditions, it may be ploughed into the soil again forbetter things to follow. Such questions as these are the practical realities ofhistory, and in all that follows we shall find them becoming clearer and moreimportant, until in our last chapter we shall end, as all our days and yearsend, with a recapitulation of our hopes and fears—and a note of interrogation.§ 4The development of free discussion in Europe during this age of fermentation wasenormously stimulated by the appearance of printed books. It was theintroduction of paper from the East that made practicable the long latent methodof printing. It is still difficult to assign the honour of priority in the useof the simple expedient of printing for multiplying books. It is a trivialquestion that has been preposterously debated. Apparently the glory, such as itis, belongs to Holland. In Haarlem, one Coster was printing from movable typesomewhen before 1446. Gutenberg was printing at Mainz about the same time. Therewere printers in Italy by 1465, and Caxton set up his press in Westminster in1477. But long before this time there had been a partial use of printing.Manuscripts as early as the twelfth century display initial letters that mayhave been printed from wooden stamps.Far more important is the question of the manufacture of paper. It is scarcelytoo much to say that paper made the revival of Europe possible. Paper originatedin China, where its use probably goes back to the second century B.C. In 751 theChinese made an attack upon the Arab Moslems in Samarkand; they were repulsed,and among the prisoners taken from them were some skilled paper-makers, fromwhom the art was learnt. Arabic paper manuscripts from the ninth century onwardstill exist. The manufacture entered Christendom either through Greece or by thecapture of Moorish paper-mills during the Christian reconquest of Spain. Butunder the Christian Spanish the product deteriorated sadly. Good paper was notmade in Christian Europe until near the end of the thirteenth century, and thenit was Italy which led the world. Only by the fourteenth century did themanufacture reach Germany, and not until the end of that century was it abundantand cheap enough for the printing of books to be a practicable businessproposition. Thereupon printing followed naturally and necessarily, and theintellectual life of the world entered upon a new and far more vigorous phase.It ceased to be a little trickle from mind to mind; it became a broad flood, inwhich thousands and presently scores and hundreds of thousands of mindsparticipated.One immediate result of this achievement of printing was the appearance of anabundance of Bibles in the world. Another was a cheapening of school-books. Theknowledge of reading spread swiftly. There was not only a great increase ofbooks in the world, but the books that were now made were plainer to read and soeasier to understand. Instead of toiling at a crabbed text and then thinkingover its significance, readers now could think unimpeded as they read. With thisincrease in the facility of reading, the reading public grew. The book ceased tobe a highly decorated toy or a scholar’s mystery. People began to write books tobe read as well as looked at by ordinary people. With the fourteenth century thereal history of the European literatures begins. We find a rapid replacement oflocal dialects by standard Italian, standard English, standard French, standardSpanish, and, later, standard German. These languages became literary languagesin their several countries; they were tried over, polished by use, and madeexact and vigorous. They became at last as capable of the burden ofphilosophical discussion as Greek or Latin.§ 5Here we devote a section to certain elementary statements about the movement inmen’s religious ideas during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. They are anecessary introduction to the political history of the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries that follows.We have to distinguish clearly between two entirely different systems ofopposition to the Catholic church. They intermingled very confusingly. Thechurch was losing its hold upon the consciences of princes and rich and ablepeople; it was also losing the faith and confidence of common people. The effectof its decline of spiritual power upon the former class was to make them resentits interference, its moral restrictions, its claims to overlordship, its claimto tax, and to dissolve allegiances. They ceased to respect its power and itsproperty. This insubordination of princes and rulers was going on throughout theMiddle Ages, but it was only when in the sixteenth century the church began toside openly with its old antagonist the Emperor, when it offered him its supportand accepted his help in its campaign against heresy, that princes began tothink seriously of breaking away from the Roman communion and setting upfragments of a church. And they would never have done so if they had notperceived that the hold of the church upon the masses of mankind had relaxed.The revolt of the princes was essentially an irreligious revolt against theworld-rule of the church. The Emperor Frederick II, with his epistles to hisfellow princes, was its forerunner. The revolt of the people against the church,on the other hand, was as essentially religious. They objected not to thechurch’s power, but to its weaknesses. They wanted a deeply righteous andfearless church to help them and organize them against the wickedness ofpowerful men. Their movements against the church, within it and without, weremovements not for release from a religious control, but for a fuller and moreabundant religious control. They did not want less religious control, butmore—but they wanted to be assured that it was religious. They objected to thePope not because he was the religious head of the world, but because he was not;because he was a wealthy earthly prince when he ought to have been theirspiritual leader.The contest in Europe from the fourteenth century onward therefore was athree-cornered contest. The princes wanted to use the popular forces against thePope, but not to let those forces grow too powerful for their own power andglory. For a long time the church went from prince to prince for an ally withoutrealizing that the lost ally it needed to recover was popular veneration.Because of this triple aspect of the mental and moral conflicts that were goingon in the fourteenth and fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the series ofensuing changes, those changes that are known collectively in history as theReformation, took on a threefold aspect. There was the Reformation according tothe princes, who wanted to stop the flow of money to Rome and to seize the moralauthority, the educational power, and the material possessions of the churchwithin their dominions. There was the Reformation according to the people, whosought to make Christianity a power against unrighteousness, and particularlyagainst the unrighteousness of the rich and powerful. And finally there was theReformation within the church, of which St. Francis of Assisi was the precursor,which sought to restore the goodness of the church and, through its goodness, torestore its power.The Reformation according to the princes took the form of a replacement of thePope by the prince as the head of the religion and the controller of theconsciences of his people. The princes had no idea and no intention of lettingfree the judgments of their subjects more particularly with the object-lessonsof the Hussites and the Anabaptists before their eyes; they sought to establishnational churches dependent upon the throne. As England, Scotland, Sweden,Norway, Denmark, North Germany, and Bohemia broke away from the Roman communion,the princes and other ministers showed the utmost solicitude to keep themovement well under control. Just as much reformation as would sever the linkwith Rome they permitted; anything beyond that, any dangerous break towards theprimitive teachings of Jesus or the crude direct interpretation of the Bible,they resisted. The Established Church of England is one of the most typical andsuccessful of the resulting compromises. It is still sacramental and sacerdotal;but its organization centres in the Court and the Lord Chancellor, and thoughsubversive views may, and do, break out in the lower and less prosperous ranksof its priesthood, it is impossible for them to struggle up to any position ofinfluence and authority.The Reformation according to the common man was very different in spirit fromthe Princely Reformation. We have already told something of the popular attemptsat Reformation in Bohemia and Germany. The wide spiritual upheavals of the timewere at once more honest, more confused, more enduring, and less immediatelysuccessful than the reforms of the princes. Very few religious-spirited men hadthe daring to break away or the effrontery to confess that they had broken awayfrom all authoritative teaching, and that they were now relying entirely upontheir own minds and consciences. That required a very high intellectual courage.The general drift of the common man in this period in Europe was to set up hisnew acquisition, the Bible, as a counter authority to the church. This wasparticularly the case with the great leader of German Protestanism, MartinLuther (1483-1546). All over Germany, and indeed all over Western Europe, therewere now men spelling over the black-letter pages of the newly translated andprinted Bible, over the Book of Leviticus and the Song of Solomon and theRevelation of St. John the Divine—strange and perplexing books —quite as much asover the simple and inspiring record of Jesus in the Gospels. Naturally theyproduced strange views and grotesque interpretations. It is surprising that theywere not stranger and grotesquer. But the human reason is an obstinate thing,and will criticize and select in spite of its own resolutions. The bulk of thesenew Bible students took what their consciences approved from the Bible andignored its riddles and contradictions. All over Europe, wherever the newProtestant churches of the princes were set up, a living and very activeresiduum of Protestants remained who declined to have their religion made overfor them in this fashion. These were the Nonconformists, a medley of sects,having nothing in common but their resistance to authoritative religion, whetherof the Pope or the State.6 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en57]Most, but not all of these Nonconformists held to the Bible as a divinelyinspired and authoritative guide. This was a strategic rather than an abidingposition, and the modern drift of Nonconformity has been onward away from thisoriginal Bibliolatry towards a mitigated and sentimentalized recognition of thebare teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Beyond the range of Nonconformity, beyondthe range of professed Christianity at all, there is also now a great andgrowing mass of equalitarian belief and altruistic impulse in the moderncivilizations, which certainly owes, as we have already asserted, its spirit toChristianity, which began to appear in Europe as the church lost its grip uponthe general mind.031 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_031_r1.gif]Let us say a word now of the third phase of the Reformation process, theReformation within the church. This was already beginning in the twelfth andthirteenth centuries with the appearance of the Black and Grey Friars (Chap. iv,§ 13). In the sixteenth century, and when it was most needed, came a freshimpetus of the same kind. This was the foundation of the Society of the Jesuitsby Inigo Lopez de Recalde, better known to the world of today as St. Ignatius ofLoyola.Ignatius began his career as a very tough and gallant young Spaniard. He wasclever and dexterous and inspired by a passion for pluck, hardihood, and rathershowy glory. His love affairs were free and picturesque. In 1521 the French tookthe town of Pampeluna in Spain from the Emperor Charles V, and Ignatius was oneof the defenders. His legs were smashed by a cannon-ball, and he was takenprisoner. One leg was badly set and had to be broken again, and these painfuland complex operations nearly cost him his life. He received the lastsacraments. In the night, thereafter, he began, to mend, and presently he wasconvalescent and facing the prospect of a life in which he would perhaps alwaysbe a cripple. His thoughts turned to the adventure of religion. Sometimes hewould think of a certain great lady, and how, in spite of his broken state, hemight yet win her admiration by some amazing deed; and sometimes he would thinkof being in some especial and personal way the Knight of Christ. In the midst ofthese confusions, one night as he lay awake, he tells us, a new great ladyclaimed his attention; he had a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary carrying theInfant Christ in her arms. “Immediately a loathing seized him for the formerdeeds of his life.” He resolved to give up all further thoughts of earthlywomen, and to lead a life of absolute chastity and devotion to the Mother ofGod. He projected great pilgrimages and a monastic life.His final method of taking his vows marks him the countryman of Don Quixote. Hehad regained his strength, and he was riding out into the world ratheraimlessly, a penniless soldier of fortune with little but his arms and the muleon which he rode, when he fell into company with a Moor. They went on togetherand talked, and presently disputed about religion. The Moor was the bettereducated man; he had the best of the argument, he said offensive things aboutthe Virgin Mary that were difficult to answer, and he parted triumphantly fromIgnatius. The young Knight of our Lady was boiling with shame and indignation.He hesitated whether he should go after the Moor and kill him or pursue thepilgrimage he had in mind. At a fork in the road he left things to his mule,which spared the Moor. He came to the Benedictine Abbey of Manresa nearMontserrat, and here he imitated that peerless hero of the mediæval romance,Amadis de Gaul, and kept an all-night vigil before the Altar of the BlessedVirgin. He presented his mule to the abbey, he gave his worldly clothes to abeggar, he laid his sword and dagger upon the altar, and clothed himself in arough sackcloth garment and hempen shoes. He then took himself to a neighbouringhospice and gave himself up to scourgings and austerities. For a whole week hefasted absolutely. Thence he went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.For some years he wandered, consumed with the idea of founding a new order ofreligious knighthood, but not knowing clearly how to set about this enterprise.He became more and more aware of his own illiteracy, and the Inquisition, whichwas beginning to take an interest in his proceedings, forbade him to attempt toteach others until he had spent at least four years in study. So much crueltyand intolerance is laid at the door of the Inquisition that it is pleasant torecord that in its handling of this heady, imaginative young enthusiast itshowed itself both sympathetic and sane. It recognized his vigour and possibleuses; it saw the dangers of his ignorance. He studied at Salamanca and Paris,among other places. He was ordained a priest in 1538, and a year later hislong-dreamt-of order was founded under the military title of the “Company ofJesus.” Like the Salvation Army of modern England, it made the most directattempt to bring the generous tradition of military organization and disciplineto the service of religion.This Ignatius of Loyola who founded the order of Jesuits was a man offorty-seven; he was a very different man, much wiser and steadier, than therather absurd young man who had aped Amadis de Gaul and kept vigil in the abbeyof Manresa; and the missionary and educational organization he now created andplaced at the disposal of the Pope was one of the most powerful instruments thechurch had ever handled. These men gave themselves freely and wholly to be usedby the church. It was the Order of the Jesuits which carried Christianity toChina again after the downfall of the Ming Dynasty, and Jesuits were the chiefChristian missionaries in India and North America. To their civilizing workamong the Indians in South America we shall presently allude. But their mainachievement lay in raising the standard of Catholic education. Their schoolsbecame and remained for a long time the best schools in Christendom. Says LordVerulam (= Sir Francis Bacon): “As for the pedagogic part . . . consult theschools of the Jesuits, for nothing better has been put in practice.” Theyraised the level of intelligence, they quickened the conscience of all CatholicEurope, they stimulated Protestant Europe to competitive educational efforts. .. . Some day it may be we shall see a new order of Jesuits, vowed not to theservice of the Pope, but to the service of mankind.And concurrently with this great wave of educational effort, the tone andquality of the church was also greatly improved by the clarification of doctrineand the reforms in organization and discipline that were made by the Council ofTrent. This council met intermittently either at Trent or Bologna between theyears 1545 and 1563, and its work was at least as important as the energy of theJesuits in arresting the crimes and blunders that were causing state after stateto fall away from the Roman communion. The change wrought by the Reformationwithin the Church of Rome was as great as the change wrought in the Protestantchurches that detached themselves from the mother body. There are henceforth nomore open scandals or schisms to record. But if anything, there has been anintensification of doctrinal narrowness, and such phases of imaginative vigouras are represented by Gregory the Great, or by the group of Popes associatedwith Gregory VII and Urban II, or by the group that began with Innocent III, nolonger enliven the sober and pedestrian narrative. The world war of 1914-1918was a unique opportunity for the Papacy; the occasion was manifest for someclear strong voice proclaiming the universal obligation to righteousness, thebrotherhood of men, the claims of human welfare over patriotic passion. No suchmoral lead was given. The Papacy seemed to be balancing its traditional relianceupon the faithful Habsburgs against its quarrel with republican France.§ 6The reader must not suppose that the destructive criticism of the CatholicChurch and of Catholic Christianity, and the printing and study of the Bible,were the only or even the most important of the intellectual activities of thefourteenth and fifteenth centuries. That was merely the popular and mostconspicuous aspect of the intellectual revival of the time. Behind thisconspicuous and popular awakening to thought and discussion, other lessimmediately striking but ultimately more important mental developments were inprogress. Of the trend of these developments we must now give some briefindications. They had begun long before books were printed, but it was printingthat released them from obscurity.We have already told something of the first appearance of the free intelligence,the spirit of inquiry and plain statement, in human affairs. One name is centralin the record of that first attempt at systematic knowledge, the name ofAristotle. We have noted also the brief phase of scientific work at Alexandria.From that time onward the complicated economic and political and religiousconflicts of Europe and Western Asia impeded further intellectual progress.These regions, as we have seen, fell for long ages under the sway of theOriental type of monarchy and of Oriental religious traditions. Rome tried andabandoned a slave system of industry. The first great capitalistic systemdeveloped and fell into chaos through its own inherent rottenness. Europerelapsed into universal insecurity. The Semite rose against the Aryan, andreplaced Hellenic civilization throughout Western Asia and Egypt by an Arabicculture. All Western Asia and half of Europe fell under Mongolian rule. It isonly in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that we find the Nordicintelligence struggling through again to expression.We then find in the growing universities of Paris, Oxford, and Bologna anincreasing amount of philosophical discussion going on. In form it is chiefly adiscussion of logical questions. As the basis of this discussion we find part ofthe teachings of Aristotle, not the whole mass of writings he left behind him,but his logic only. Later on his work became better known through the Latintranslations of the Arabic edition annotated by Averroes. Except for thesetranslations of Aristotle, and they were abominably bad translations, verylittle of the Greek philosophical literature was read in Western Europe untilthe fifteenth century. The creative Plato—as distinguished from the scientificAristotle—was almost unknown. Europe had the Greek criticism without the Greekimpulse. Some neo-Platonic writers were known, but neo-Platonism had much thesame relation to Plato that Christian Science has to Christ.It has been the practice of recent writers to decry the philosophical discussionof the mediæval “schoolmen” as tedious and futile. It was nothing of the sort.It had to retain a severely technical form because the dignitaries of thechurch, ignorant and intolerant, were on the watch for heresy. It lacked thesweet clearness, therefore, of fearless thought. It often hinted what it darednot say. But it dealt with fundamentally important things, it was a long andnecessary struggle to clear up and correct certain inherent defects of the humanmind, and many people today blunder dangerously through their neglect of theissues the schoolmen discussed.There is a natural tendency in the human mind to exaggerate the differences andresemblances upon which classification is based, to suppose that things calledby different names are altogether different, and that things called by the samename are practically identical. This tendency to exaggerate classificationproduces a thousand evils and injustices. In the sphere of race or nationality,for example, a “European” will often treat an “Asiatic” almost as if he were adifferent animal, while he will be disposed to regard another “European” asnecessarily as virtuous and charming as himself. He will, as a matter of course,take sides with Europeans against Asiatics. But, as the reader of this historymust realize, there is no such difference as the opposition of these namesimplies. It is a phantom difference created by two names....The main mediæval controversy was between the “Realists” and the “Nominalists,”and it is necessary to warm the reader that the word “Realist” in mediævaldiscussion has a meaning almost diametrically opposed to “Realist” as it is usedin the jargon of modern criticism. The modern “Realist” is one who insists onmaterialist details; the mediæval “Realist” was far nearer what nowadays weshould call an Idealist, and his contempt for incidental detail was profound.The Realists outdid the vulgar tendency to exaggerate the significance of class.They held that there was something in a name, in a common noun that is, that wasessentially real. For example, they held there was a typical “European,” anideal European, who was far more real than any individual European. EveryEuropean was, as it were, a failure, a departure, a flawed specimen of thisprofounder reality. On the other hand the Nominalist held that the onlyrealities in the case were the individual Europeans, that the name “European”was merely a name and nothing more than a name applied to all these instances.Nothing is quite so difficult as the compression of philosophical controversies,which are by their nature voluminous and various and tinted by the mentalcolours of a variety of minds. With the difference of Realist and Nominaliststated baldly, as we have stated it here, the modern reader unaccustomed tophilosophical discussion may be disposed to leap at once to the side of theNominalist. But the matter is not so simple that it can be covered by oneinstance, and here we have purposely chosen an extreme instance. Names andclassifications differ in their value and reality. While it is absurd to supposethat there can be much depth of class difference between men called Thomas andmen called William, or that there is an ideal and quintessential Thomas orWilliam, yet on the other hand there may be much profounder differences betweena white man and a Hottentot, and still more between Homo sapiens and Homoneanderthalensis. While again the distinction between the class of pets and theclass of useful animals is dependent upon very slight differences of habit andapplication, the difference of a cat and dog is so profound that the microscopecan trace it in a drop of blood or a single hair. When this aspect of thequestion is considered, it becomes understandable how Nominalism had ultimatelyto abandon the idea that names were as insignificant as labels, and how, out ofa revised and amended Nominalism, there grew up that systematic attempt to findthe true—the most significant and fruitful—classification of things andsubstances which is called Scientific Research.And it will be almost as evident that while the tendency of Realism, which isthe natural tendency of every untutored mind was towards dogma, harsh divisions,harsh judgments, and uncompromising attitudes, the tendency of earlier and laterNominalism was towards qualified statements, towards an examination ofindividual instances, and towards inquiry and experiment and scepticism.So while in the market-place and the ways of the common life men werequestioning the morals and righteousness of the clergy, the good faith andpropriety of their celibacy, and the justice of papal taxation; while intheological circles their minds were set upon the question oftransubstantiation, the question of the divinity or not of the bread and wine inthe mass, in studies and lecture-rooms a wider-reaching criticism of the methodsof ordinary Catholic teaching was in progress. We cannot attempt here to gaugethe significance in this process of such names as Peter Abelard (1079-1142),Albertus Magnus (1193-1280), and Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274). These men sought toreconstruct Catholicism on a sounder system of reasoning. They turned towardsNominalism. Chief among their critics and successors were Duns Scotus (?-1308),an Oxford Franciscan and, to judge by his sedulous thought and deliberatesubtleties, a Scotchman, and Occam, an Englishman (?-1347). Both these latter,like Averroes (see Chap. iii., § 8), made a definite distinction betweentheological and philosophical truth; they placed theology on a pinnacle, butthey placed it where it could no longer obstruct research; Duns Scotus declaredthat it was impossible to prove by reasoning the existence of God or of theTrinity or the credibility of the Act of Creation; Occam was still moreinsistent upon this separation—which manifestly released scientific inquiry fromdogmatic control. A later generation, benefiting by the freedoms towards whichthese pioneers worked, and knowing not the sources of its freedom, had theingratitude to use the name of Scotus as a term for stupidity, and so we haveour English word “Dunce.” Says Professor Pringle Pattison,7[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en58] “Occam, who is still aScholastic, gives us the Scholastic justification of the spirit which hadalready taken hold upon Roger Bacon, and which was to enter upon its rights inthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.”Standing apart by himself because of his distinctive genius is this Roger Bacon(about 1210 to about 1293), who was also English. He was a Franciscan of Oxford,and a very typical Englishman indeed, irritable, hasty, honest, and shrewd. Hewas two centuries ahead of his world. Says H. O. Taylor of him8[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en59]:“The career of Bacon was an intellectual tragedy, conforming to the oldprinciples of tragic art: that the hero’s character shall be large and noble,but not flawless, inasmuch as the fatal consummation must issue from character,and not happen through chance. He died an old man, as in his youth, so in hisage, a devotee of tangible knowledge. His pursuit of a knowledge which was notaltogether learning had been obstructed by the Order of which he was an unhappyand rebellious member; quite as fatally his achievement was deformed from withinby the principles which he accepted from his time. But he was responsible forhis acceptance of current opinions; and as his views roused the distrust of hisbrother Friars, his intractable temper drew their hostility on his head.Persuasiveness and tact were needed by one who would impress such novel views ashis upon his fellows, or, in the thirteenth century, escape persecution fortheir divulgence. Bacon attacked dead and living worthies, tactlessly,fatuously, and unfairly. Of his life scarcely anything is known, save from hisallusions to himself and others; and these are insufficient for the constructionof even a slight consecutive narrative. Born; studied at Oxford; went to Paris,studied, experimented; is at Oxford again, and a Franciscan studies, teaches,becomes suspect to his Order, is sent back to Paris, kept under surveillance,receives a letter from the Pope, writes, writes, writes—his three best-knownworks; is again in trouble, confined for many years, released, and dead, so verydead, body and fame alike, until partly unearthed after five centuries.”The bulk of these “three best-known works” is a hotly phrased and sometimesquite abusive, but entirely just attack on the ignorance of the times, combinedwith a wealth of suggestions for the increase of knowledge. In his passionateinsistence upon the need of experiment and of collecting knowledge, the spiritof Aristotle lives again in him. “Experiment, experiment,” that is the burthenof Roger Bacon. Yet of Aristotle himself Roger Bacon fell foul. He fell foul ofhim because men, instead of facing facts boldly, sat in rooms and pored over thebad Latin translations which were then all that was available of the master. “IfI had my way,” he wrote, in his intemperate fashion, “I should burn all thebooks of Aristotle, for the study of them can only lead to a loss of time,produce error, and increase ignorance,” a sentiment that Aristotle wouldprobably have echoed could he have returned to a world in which his works werenot so much read as worshipped—and that, as Roger Bacon showed, in these mostabominable translations.Throughout his books, a little disguised by the necessity of seeming to squareit all with orthodoxy for fear of the prison and worse, Roger Bacon shouted tomankind, “Cease to be ruled by dogmas and authorities; look at the world!” Fourchief sources of ignorance he denounced; respect for authority, custom, thesense of the ignorant crowd, and the vain proud unteachableness of ourdispositions. Overcome but these, and a world of power would open to men:—“Machines for navigating are possible without rowers, so that great ships suitedto river or ocean, guided by one man, may be borne with greater speed than ifthey were full of men. Likewise cars may be made so that without a draughtanimal they may be moved cum impetu inœstimabili, as we deem the scythedchariots to have been from which antiquity fought. And flying machines arepossible, so that a man may sit in the middle turning some device by whichartificial wings may beat the air in the manner of a flying bird.”Occam, Roger Bacon, these are the early precursors of a great movement in Europeaway from “Realism” towards reality. For a time the older influences foughtagainst the naturalism of the new Nominalists. In 1339 Occam’s books were putunder a ban and Nominalism solemnly condemned. As late as 1473 an attempt,belated and unsuccessful, was made to bind teachers of Paris by an oath to teachRealism. It was only in the sixteenth century with the printing of books and theincrease of intelligence that the movement from absolutism towards experimentbecame massive, and that one investigator began to cooperate with another.Throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries experimenting with materialthings was on the increase, items of knowledge were being won by men, but therewas no interrelated advance. The work was done in a detached, furtive, andinglorious manner. A tradition of isolated investigation came into Europe fromthe Arabs, and a considerable amount of private and secretive research wascarried on by the alchemists, for whom modern writers are a little too apt withtheir contempt. These alchemists were in close touch with the glass and metalworkers and with the herbalists and medicine-makers of the times; they priedinto many secrets of nature, but they were obsessed by “practical” ideas; theysought not knowledge, but power; they wanted to find out how to manufacture goldfrom cheaper materials, how to make men immortal by the elixir of life, andsuch-like vulgar dreams. Incidentally in their researches they learnt much aboutpoisons, dyes, metallurgy, and the like; they discovered various refractorysubstances, and worked their way towards clear glass and so to lenses andoptical instruments; but as scientific men tell us continually, and as“practical” men still refuse to learn, it is only when knowledge is sought forher own sake that she gives rich and unexpected gifts in any abundance to herservants. The world of today is still much more disposed to spend money ontechnical research than on pure science. Half the men in our scientificlaboratories still dream of patents and secret processes. We live today largelyin the age of alchemists, for all our sneers at their memory. The “business man”of today still thinks of research as a sort of alchemy.Closely associated with the alchemists were the astrologers, who were also a“practical” race. They studied the stars—to tell fortunes. They lacked thatbroader faith and understanding which induces men simply to study the stars.Not until the fifteenth century did the ideas which Roger Bacon first expressedbegin to produce their first-fruits in new knowledge and a widening outlook.Then suddenly, as the sixteenth century dawned, and as the world recovered fromthe storm of social trouble that had followed the pestilences of the fourteenthcentury, Western Europe broke out into a galaxy of names that outshine theutmost scientific reputations of the best age of Greece. Nearly every nationcontributed, the reader will note, for science knows no nationality.One of the earliest and most splendid in this constellation is the Florentine,Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), a man with an almost miraculous vision forreality. He was a naturalist, an anatomist, an engineer, as well as a very greatartist. He was the first modern to realize the true nature of fossils,9[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en60] he made note-books ofobservations that still amaze us, he was convinced of the practicability ofmechanical flight. Another great name is that of Copernicus, a Pole (1473-1543),who made the first clear analysis of the movements of the heavenly bodies andshowed that the earth moves round the sun. Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), a Daneworking at, the university of Prague, rejected this latter belief, but hisobservations of celestial movements were of the utmost value to his successors,and especially to the German, Kepler (1571-1630). Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)was the founder of the science of dynamics. Before his time it was believed thata weight a hundred times greater than another would fall a hundred times asfast. Galileo denied this. Instead of arguing about it like a scholar and agentleman, he put it to the coarse test of experiment by dropping two unequalweights from an upper gallery of the leaning tower of Pisa—to the horror of allerudite men. He made what was almost the first telescope, and he developed theastronomical views of Copernicus; but the church, still struggling gallantlyagainst the light, decided that to believe that the earth was smaller andinferior to the sun made man and Christianity of no account, and diminished theimportance of the Pope; so Galileo, under threats of dire punishment, when hewas an old man of sixty-nine, was made to recant this view and put the earthback in its place as the immovable centre of the universe. He knelt before tencardinals in scarlet, an assembly august enough to overawe truth itself, whilehe amended the creation he had disarranged. The story has it that as he rosefrom his knees, after repeating his recantation, he muttered, “Eppur siMuove”—“it moves nevertheless.”Newton (1642-1727) was born in the year of Galileo’s death. By his discovery ofthe law of gravitation he completed the clear vision of the starry universe thatwe have today. But Newton carries us into the eighteenth century. He carries ustoo far for the present chapter. Among the earlier names, that of Dr. Gilbert(1540-1603), of Colchester, is pre-eminent. Roger Bacon had preached experiment,Gilbert was one of the first to practise it. There can be little doubt that hiswork, which was chiefly upon magnetism, helped to form the ideas of FrancisBacon, Lord Verulam (1561-1626), Lord Chancellor to James I of England. ThisFrancis Bacon has been called the “Father of Experimental Philosophy,” but ofhis share in the development of scientific work far too much has been made.10[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en61] He was, says Sir R. A.Gregory, “not the founder but the apostle” of the scientific method. Hisgreatest service to science was a fantastic book, The New Atlantis. “In his NewAtlantis, Francis Bacon planned in somewhat fanciful language a palace ofinvention, a great temple of science, where the pursuit of knowledge in all itsbranches was to be organized on principles of the highest efficiency.”From this Utopian dream arose the Royal Society of London, which received aRoyal Charter from Charles II of England in 1662. The essential use and virtueof this society was and is publication. Its formation marks a definite step fromisolated inquiry towards cooperative work, from the secret and solitaryinvestigations of the alchemist to the frank report and open discussion which isthe life of the modern scientific process. For the true scientific method isthis: to trust no statements without verification, to test all things asrigorously as possible, to keep no secrets, to attempt no monopolies, to giveout one’s best modestly and plainly, serving no other end but knowledge.The long-slumbering science of anatomy was revived by Harvey (1578-1657), whodemonstrated the circulation of the blood. . . . Presently the Dutchman,Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) brought the first crude microscope to bear upon thehidden minutiæ of life.These are but some of the brightest stars amidst that increasing multitude ofmen who have from the fifteenth century to our own time, with more and morecollective energy and vigour, lit up our vision of the universe, and increasedour power over the conditions of our lives.§ 7We have dealt thus fully with the recrudescence of scientific studies in theMiddle Ages because of its ultimate importance in human affairs. In the longrun, Roger Bacon is of more significance to mankind than any monarch of histime. But the contemporary world, for the most part, knew nothing of thissmouldering activity in studies and lecture-rooms and alchemist’s laboratoriesthat was presently to alter all the conditions of life. The church did indeedtake notice of what was afoot, but only because of the disregard of herconclusive decisions. She had decided that the earth was the very centre ofGod’s creation, and that the Pope was the divinely appointed ruler of the earth.Men’s ideas on these essential points, she insisted, must not be disturbed byany contrary teaching. So soon, however, as she had compelled Galileo to saythat the world did not move she was satisfied; she does not seem to haverealized how ominous it was for her that, after all, the earth did move.Very great social as well as intellectual developments were in progress inWestern Europe throughout this period of the later Middle Ages. But the humanmind apprehends events far more vividly than changes; and men for the most part,then as now, kept on in their own traditions in spite of the shifting sceneabout them.In an outline such as this it is impossible to crowd in the clustering events ofhistory that do not clearly show the main process of human development, howeverbright and picturesque they may be. We have to record the steady growth of townsand cities, the reviving power of trade and money, the gradual re-establishmentof law and custom, the extension of security, the supersession of privatewarfare that went on in Western Europe in the period between the first crusadeand the sixteenth century. Of much that looms large in our national histories wecannot tell anything. We have no space for the story of the repeated attempts ofthe English kings to conquer Scotland and set themselves up as kings of France,nor of how the Norman English established themselves insecurely in Ireland(twelfth century), and how Wales was linked to the English crown (1282). Allthrough the Middle Ages the struggle of England with Scotland and France was inprogress; there were times when it seemed that Scotland was finally subjugatedand when the English king held far more land in France than its titularsovereign. In the English histories this struggle with France is too oftenrepresented as a single-handed and almost successful attempt to conquer France.In reality it was a joint enterprise undertaken in concert first with theFlemings and Bavarians and afterwards with the powerful French vassal state ofBurgundy to conquer and divide the patrimony of Hugh Capet. Of the English routby the Scotch at Bannockburn (1314), and of William Wallace, and Robert theBruce, the Scottish national heroes, of the battles of Crecy (1346) and Poitiers(1356) and Agincourt (1415) in France, which shine like stars in the Englishimagination, little battles in which sturdy bowmen through some sunny hours madea great havoc among French knights in armour, of the Black Prince and Henry V ofEngland, and of how a peasant girl, Joan of Arc, the Maid of Orleans, drove theEnglish out of her country again (1429-1430), this history relates nothing. Forevery country has such cherished national events. They are the ornamentaltapestry of history, and no part of the building. Rajputana or Poland, Russia,Spain, Persia, and China can all match or outdo the utmost romance of westernEurope, with equally adventurous knights and equally valiant princesses andequally stout fights against the odds. Nor can we tell how Louis XI of France(1461- 1483), the son of Joan of Arc’s Charles VII, brought Burgundy to heel andlaid the foundations of a centralized French monarchy. It signifies more that inthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, gunpowder, that Mongol gift, came toEurope so that the kings (Louis XI included) and the law, relying upon thesupport of the growing towns, were able to batter down the castles of thehalf-independent robber knights and barons of the earlier Middle Ages andconsolidate a more centralized power. The fighting nobles and knights of thebarbaric period disappear slowly from history during these centuries; theCrusades consumed them, such dynastic wars as the English Wars of the Roseskilled them off, the arrows from the English long-bow pierced them and stuck outa yard behind, infantry so armed swept them from the stricken field; they becamereconciled to trade and changed their nature. They disappeared in everything buta titular sense from the west and south of Europe before they disappeared fromGermany. The knight in Germany remained a professional fighting man into thesixteenth century.Between the eleventh and the fifteenth centuries in western Europe, andparticularly in France and England, there sprang up like flowers a multitude ofvery distinctive and beautiful buildings, cathedrals, abbeys, and the like, theGothic architecture. This lovely efflorescence marks the appearance of a body ofcraftsmen closely linked in its beginnings to the church. In Italy and Spain,too, the world was beginning to build freely and beautifully again. At first itwas the wealth of the church that provided most of these buildings; then kingsand merchants also began to build.From the twelfth century onward, with the increase of trade, there was a greatrevival of town life throughout Europe. Prominent among these towns were Venice,with its dependents Ragusa and Corfu, Genoa, Verona, Bologna, Pisa, Florence,Naples, Milan, Marseilles, Lisbon, Barcelona, Narbonne, Tours, Orleans,Bordeaux, Paris, Ghent, Bruges. Boulogne, London, Oxford, Cambridge,Southampton, Dover, Antwerp, Hamburg, Bremen, Cologne, Mayence, Nuremberg,Munich, Leipzig, Magdeburg, Breslau, Stettin, Dantzig, Königsberg, Riga, Pskof,Novgorod, Wisby, and Bergen.“A West German town, between 1400 and 1500,11[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en62] embodied all the achievementsof progress at that time, although from a modern standpoint much seems wanting.. . . The streets were mostly narrow and irregularly built, the houses chieflyof wood, while almost every burgher kept his cattle in the house, and the herdof swine which was driven every morning by the town herdsman to thepasture-ground formed an inevitable part of city life.12[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en63] In Frankfort-on-Main it wasunlawful after 1481 to keep swine in the Altstadt, but in the Neustadt and inSachsenhausen this custom remained as a matter of course. It was only in 1645,after a corresponding attempt in 1556 had failed, that the swine-pens in theinner town were pulled down at Leipzig. The rich burghers, who occasionally tookpart in the great trading companies, were conspicuously wealthy landowners, andhad extensive courtyards with large barns inside the town walls. The mostopulent of them owned those splendid patrician houses which we still admire eventoday. But even in the older towns most houses of the fifteenth century havedisappeared; only here and there a building with open timber-work andoverhanging storeys, as in Bacharach or Miltenburg, reminds us of the style ofarchitecture then customary in the houses of burghers. The great bulk of theinferior population, who lived on mendicancy, or got a livelihood by theexercise of the inferior industries, inhabited squalid hovels outside the town;the town wall was often the only support for these wretched buildings. Theinternal fittings of the houses, even amongst the wealthy population, were verydefective according to modern ideas; the Gothic style was as little suitable forthe petty details of objects of luxury as it was splendidly adapted for thebuilding of churches and town halls. The influence of the Renaissance added muchto the comfort of the house.“The fourteenth and fifteenth century saw the building of numerous Gothic townchurches and town halls throughout Europe which still in many cases serve theiroriginal purpose. The power and prosperity of the towns find their bestexpression in these and in the fortifications, with their strong towers andgateways. Every picture of a town of the sixteenth or later centuries showsconspicuously these latter erections for the protection and honour of the town.The town did many things which in our time are done by the State. Socialproblems were taken up by town administration or the corresponding municipalorganization. The regulation of trade was the concern of the guilds in agreementwith the council, the care of the poor belonged to the church, while the councillooked after the protection of the town walls and the very necessary firebrigades. The council, mindful of its social duties, superintended the fillingof the municipal granaries, in order to have supplies in years of scarcity. Suchstore-houses were erected in almost every town during the fifteenth century.Tariffs of prices for the sale of all wares, high enough to enable every artisanto make a good livelihood, and to give the purchaser a guarantee for the qualityof the wares, were maintained. The town was also the chief capitalist; as aseller of annuities on lives and inheritances it was a banker and enjoyedunlimited credit. In return it obtained means for the construction offortifications or for such occasions as the acquisition of sovereign rights fromthe hand of an impecunious prince.”For the most part these European towns were independent or quasi-independentaristocratic republics. Most admitted a vague overlordship on the part of thechurch, or of the emperor or of a king. Others were parts of kingdoms, or eventhe capitals of dukes or kings. In such cases their internal freedom wasmaintained by a royal or imperial charter. In England the Royal City ofWestminster on the Thames stood cheek by jowl with the walled city of London,into which the King came only with ceremony and permission. The entirely freeVenetian republic ruled an empire of dependent islands and trading ports, ratherafter the fashion of the Athenian republic. Genoa also stood alone. The Germanictowns of the Baltic and North Sea from Riga to Middelburg in Holland, Dortmund,and Cologne were loosely allied in a confederation, the confederation of theHansa towns, under the leadership of Hamburg, Bremen, and Lubeck, aconfederation which was still more loosely attached to the empire. Thisconfederation, which included over seventy towns in all, and which had depôts inNovgorod, Bergen, London, and Bruges, did much to keep the northern seas cleanof piracy, that curse of the Mediterranean and of the Eastern seas. The EasternEmpire throughout its last phase, from the Ottoman conquest of its Europeanhinterland in the fourteenth and early fifteenth century until its fall in 1453,was practically only the trading town of Constantinople, a town state like Genoaor Venice, except that it was encumbered by a corrupt imperial court.The fullest and most splendid developments of this city life of the later MiddleAges occurred in Italy. After the end of the Hohenstaufen line in the thirteenthcentury, the hold of the Holy Roman Empire upon North and Central Italyweakened, although, as we shall tell, German Emperors were still crowned askings and emperors in Italy up to the time of Charles V (circ. 1530). Therearose a number of quasi-independent city states to the north of Rome, the papalcapital. South Italy and Sicily, however, remained under foreign dominion. Genoaand her rival, Venice, were the great trading seaports of this time; their noblepalaces, their lordly paintings, still win our admiration. Milan, at the foot ofthe St. Gothard pass, revived to wealth and power. Inland was Florence, atrading and financial centre which, under the almost monarchical rule of theMedici family in the fifteenth century, enjoyed a second “Periclean age.” Butalready before the time of these cultivated Medici “bosses” Florence hadproduced much beautiful art. Giotto’s tower (Giotto, born 1266, died 1337) andthe Duomo (by Brunellesco, born 1377, died 1446) already existed. Towards theend of the fourteenth century Florence became the centre of the rediscovery,restoration, and imitation of antique art (the “Renaissance” in its narrowersense). Artistic productions, unlike philosophical thought and scientificdiscovery, are the ornaments and expression rather than the creative substanceof history, and here we cannot attempt to trace the development of the art ofFilippo Lippi, Botticelli, Donatello (died 1466), Leonardo da Vinci (died 1519),Michelangelo (1475-1564), and Raphael (died 1520). Of the scientific speculationof Leonardo we have already had occasion to speak.032 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_032_r1.gif]§ 8In 1453, as we have related, Constantinople fell. Throughout the next centurythe Turkish pressure upon Europe was heavy and continuous. The boundary linebetween Mongol and Aryan, which had lain somewhere east of the Pamirs in thedays of Pericles, had receded now to Hungary. Constantinople had long been amere island of Christians in a Turk-ruled Balkan peninsula. Its fall did much tointerrupt the trade with the East.Of the two rival cities of the Mediterranean, Venice was generally on muchbetter terms with the Turks than Genoa. Every intelligent Genoese sailor frettedat the trading monopoly of Venice, and tried to invent some way of gettingthrough it or round it. And there were now new peoples taking to the sea trade,and disposed to look for new ways to the old markets because the ancient routeswere closed to them. The Portuguese, for example, were developing an Atlanticcoasting trade. The Atlantic was waking up again after a vast period of neglectthat dated from the Roman murder of Carthage. It is rather a delicate matter todecide whether the western European was pushing out into the Atlantic or whetherhe was being pushed out into it by the Turk, who lorded it in the Mediterraneanuntil the Battle of Lepanto (1571). The Venetian and Genoese ships were creepinground to Antwerp, and the Hansa town seamen were coming south and extendingtheir range. And there were considerable developments of seamanship andshipbuilding in progress. The Mediterranean is a sea for galleys and coasting.But upon the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea winds are more prevalent, seas runhigher, the shore is often a danger rather than a refuge. The high seas calledfor the sailing ship, and in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries it appearskeeping its course by the compass and the stars.By the thirteenth century the Hansa merchants were already sailing regularlyfrom Bergen across the grey cold seas to the Northmen in Iceland. In Iceland menknew of Greenland, and adventurous voyagers had long ago found a further landbeyond, Vinland, where the climate was pleasant and where men could settle ifthey chose to cut themselves off from the rest of human kind. This Vinland waseither Nova Scotia or, what is more probable, New England.All over Europe in the fifteenth century merchants and sailors were speculatingabout new ways to the East. The Portuguese, unaware that Pharaoh Necho hadsolved the problem ages ago, were asking whether it was not possible to go roundto India by the coast of Africa. Their ships followed in the course that Hannotook to Cape Verde (1445). They put out to sea to the west and found the CanaryIsles, Madeira, and the Azores.13[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en64] That was a fairly long strideacross the Atlantic. In 1486 a Portuguese, Diaz, reported that he had roundedthe south of Africa. . . .A certain Genoese, Christopher Columbus, began to think more and more of what isto us a very obvious and natural enterprise, but which strained the imaginationof the fifteenth century to the utmost, a voyage due west across the Atlantic.At that time nobody knew of the existence of America as a separate continent.Columbus knew that the world was a sphere, but he underestimated its size; thetravels of Marco Polo had given him an exaggerated idea of the extent of Asia,and he supposed therefore that Japan, with its reputation for a great wealth ofgold, lay across the Atlantic in about the position of Mexico. He had madevarious voyages in the Atlantic; he had been to Iceland and perhaps heard ofVinland, which must have greatly encouraged these ideas of his, and this projectof sailing into the sunset became the ruling purpose of his life. He was apenniless man, some accounts say he was a bankrupt, and his only way of securinga ship was to get someone to entrust him with a command. He went first to KingJohn II of Portugal, who listened to him, made difficulties, and then arrangedfor an expedition to start without his knowledge, a purely Portugueseexpedition. This highly diplomatic attempt to steal a march on an original manfailed, as it deserved to fail; the crew became mutinous, the captain lost heartand returned (1483). Columbus then went to the Court of Spain.At first he could get no ship and no powers. Spain was assailing Granada, thelast foothold of the Moslems in western Europe. Most of Spain had been recoveredby the Christians between the eleventh and the thirteenth century; then had comea pause; and now all Spain, united by the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon andIsabella of Castile, was setting itself to the completion of the Christianconquest. Despairing of Spanish help, Columbus sent his brother Bartholomew toHenry VII of England, but the adventure did not attract that canny monarch.Finally in 1492 Granada fell, and then, helped by some merchants of the town ofPalos, Columbus got his ships, three ships, of which only one, the Santa Maria,of 100 tons burthen, was decked. The two other were open boats of half thattonnage.The little expedition—it numbered altogether eighty-eight men!—went south to theCanaries, and then stood out across the unknown seas, in beautiful weather andwith a helpful wind.The story of that momentous voyage of two months and nine days must be read indetail to be appreciated. The crew was full of doubts and fears; they might,they feared, sail on for ever. They were comforted by seeing some birds, andlater on by finding a pole worked with tools, and a branch with strange berries.At ten o’clock, on the night of October 11th, 1492, Columbus saw a light ahead;the next morning land was sighted, and, while the day was still young, Columbuslanded on the shores of the new world, richly apparelled and bearing the royalbanner of Spain. . . .Early in 1493 Columbus returned to Europe. He brought gold, cotton, strangebeasts and birds, and two wild-eyed painted Indians to be baptized. He had notfound Japan, it was thought, but India. The islands he had found were calledtherefore the West Indies. The same year he sailed again with a great expeditionof seventeen ships and fifteen thousand men, with the express permission of thePope to take possession of these new lands for the Spanish crown. . . .We cannot tell of his experiences as Governor of this Spanish colony, nor how hewas superseded and put in chains. In a little while a swarm of Spanishadventurers were exploring the new lands. But it is interesting to note thatColumbus died ignorant of the fact that he had discovered a new continent. Hebelieved to the day of his death that he had sailed round the world to Asia.The news of his discoveries caused a great excitement throughout western Europe.It spurred the Portuguese to fresh attempts to reach India by the South Africanroute. In 1497, Vasco da Gama sailed from Lisbon to Zanzibar, and thence, withan Arab pilot, he struck across the Indian Ocean to Calicut in India. In 1515there were Portuguese ships in Java and the Moluccas. In 1519 a Portuguesesailor, Magellan, in the employment of the Spanish King, coasted to the south ofSouth America, passed through the dark and forbidding “Strait of Magellan,” andso came into the Pacific Ocean, which had already been sighted by Spanishexplorers who had crossed the Isthmus of Panama.Magellan’s expedition continued across the Pacific Ocean westward. This was afar more heroic voyage than that of Columbus; for eight and ninety days Magellansailed unflinchingly over that vast, empty ocean, sighting nothing but twolittle desert islands. The crews were rotten with scurvy; there was little waterand that bad, and putrid biscuit to eat. Rats were hunted eagerly; cowhide wasgnawed and sawdust devoured to stay the pangs of hunger. In this state theexpedition reached the Ladrones. They discovered the Philippines, and hereMagellan was killed in a fight with the natives. Several other captains weremurdered. Five ships had started with Magellan in August 1519 and two hundredand eighty men; in July 1522 the Vittoria, with a remnant of one and thirty menaboard, returned up the Atlantic to her anchorage near the Mole of Seville, inthe river Guadalquivir—the first ship that ever circumnavigated this planet.The English and French and Dutch and the sailors of the Hansa towns came ratherlater into this new adventure of exploration. They had not the same keeninterest in the eastern trade. And when they did come in, their first effortswere directed to sailing round the north of America as Magellan had sailed roundthe south, and to sailing round the north of Asia as Vasco da Gama had sailedround the south of Africa. Both these enterprises were doomed to failure by thenature of things. Both in America and the East, Spain and Portugal had half acentury’s start of England and France and Holland. And Germany never started.The King of Spain was Emperor of Germany in those crucial years, and the Popehad given the monopoly of America to Spain, and not simply to Spain, but to thekingdom of Castile. This must have restrained both Germany and Holland at firstfrom American adventures. The Hansa towns were quasi-independent; they had nomonarch behind them to support them, and no unity among themselves for so big anenterprise as oceanic exploration. It was the misfortune of Germany, and perhapsof the world, that, as we will presently tell, a storm of warfare exhausted herwhen all the Western powers were going to this newly opened school of trade andadministration upon the high seas.033 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_033_r1.gif]Slowly throughout the sixteenth century the immense good fortune of Castileunfolded itself before the dazzled eyes of Europe. She had found a new world,abounding in gold and silver and wonderful possibilities of settlement. It wasall hers, because the Pope had said so. The Court of Rome, in an access ofmagnificence, had divided this new world of strange lands which was now openingout to the European imagination, between the Spanish, who were to haveeverything west of a line 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, and thePortuguese, to whom everything east of this line was given.At first the only people encountered by the Spaniards in America were savages ofa Mongoloid type. Many of these savages were cannibals. It is a misfortune forscience that the first, Europeans to reach America were these rather incuriousSpaniards, without any scientific passion, thirsty for gold, and full of theblind bigotry of a recent religious war. They made few intelligent observationsof the native methods and ideas of these primordial people. They slaughteredthem, they robbed them, they enslaved them, and baptized them; but they madesmall note of the customs and motives that changed and vanished under theirassault. They were as destructive and reckless as the British in Tasmania, whoshot the last Palæolithic men at sight, and put out poisoned meat for them tofind.Great areas of the American interior were prairie land, whose nomadic tribessubsisted upon vast herds of the now practically extinct bison. In their mannerof life, in their painted garments and their free use of paint, in their generalphysical characters, these prairie Indians showed remarkable resemblances to theLater Palæolithic men of the Solutrian age in Europe. But they had no horses.They seem to have made no very great advance from that primordial state, whichwas probably the state in which their ancestors had reached America. They had,however, a knowledge of metals, and most notably a free use of native copper,but no knowledge of iron. As the Spaniards penetrated into the continent, theyfound and they attacked, plundered, and destroyed two separate civilized systemsthat had developed in America, perhaps quite independently of the civilizedsystems of the old world. One of them was the Aztec civilization of Mexico; theother, that of Peru. They had probably arisen out of the heliolithicsub-civilization that had drifted in canoes across the Pacific, island byisland, step by step, age after age, from its region of origin round and aboutthe Mediterranean. We have already noted one or two points of interest in theseunique developments. Along their own lines these civilized peoples of Americahad reached to a state of affairs roughly parallel with the culture ofpre-dynastic Egypt or the early Sumerian cities. Before the Aztecs and thePeruvians there had been still earlier civilized beginnings which had eitherbeen destroyed by their successors, or which had failed and relapsed of theirown accord.The Aztecs seem to have been a conquering, less civilized people, dominating amore civilized community, as the Aryans dominated Greece and North India. Theirreligion was a primitive, complex, and cruel system, in which human sacrificesand ceremonial cannibalism played a large part. Their minds were haunted by theidea of sin and the need for bloody propitiations.The Aztec civilization was destroyed by an expedition under Cortez. He hadeleven ships, four hundred Europeans, two hundred Indians, sixteen horses, andfourteen guns. But in Yucatan he picked up a stray Spaniard who had been acaptive with the Indians for some years, and who had more or less learnt variousIndian languages, and knew that the Aztec rule was deeply resented by many ofits subjects. It was in alliance with these that Cortez advanced over themountains into the valley of Mexico (1519). How he entered Mexico, how itsmonarch, Montezuma, was killed by his own people for favouring the Spaniards,how Cortez was besieged in Mexico, and escaped with the loss of his guns andhorses, and how after a terrible retreat to the coast he was able to return andsubjugate the whole land, is a romantic and picturesque story which we cannoteven attempt to tell here. The population of Mexico to this day is largely ofnative blood, but Spanish has replaced the native languages, and such culture asexists is Catholic and Spanish.The still more curious Peruvian state fell a victim to another adventurer,Pizarro. He sailed from the Isthmus of Panama in 1530, with an expedition of ahundred and sixty-eight Spaniards. Like Cortez in Mexico, he availed himself ofthe native dissensions to secure possession of the doomed state. Like Cortez,too, who had made a captive and tool of Montezuma, he seized the Inca of Peru bytreachery, and attempted to rule in his name. Here again we cannot do justice tothe tangle of subsequent events, the ill-planned insurrections of the natives,the arrival of Spanish reinforcements from Mexico, and the reduction of thestate to a Spanish province. Nor can we tell much more of the swift spread ofSpanish adventurers over the rest of America, outside the Portuguese reservationof Brazil. To begin with, each story is nearly always a story of adventurers andof cruelty and loot. The Spaniards ill-treated the natives, they quarrelledamong themselves, the law and order of Spain were months and years away fromthem; it was only very slowly that the phase of violence and conquest passedinto a phase of government and settlement. But long before there was much orderin America, a steady stream of gold and silver began to flow across the Atlanticto the Spanish government and people.After the first violent treasure hunt came plantation and the working of mines.With that arose the earliest labour difficulty in the new world. At first theIndians were enslaved with much brutality and injustice; but to the honour ofthe Spaniards this did not go uncriticized. The natives found champions, andvery valiant champions, in the Dominican Order and in a secular priest, LasCasas, who was for a time a planter and slave-owner in Cuba until his consciencesmote him. An importation of negro slaves from West Africa also began quiteearly in the sixteenth century. After some retrogression, Mexico, Brazil, andSpanish South America began to develop into great slave-holding,wealth-producing lands. . . .034 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_034_r1.gif]We cannot tell here, as we would like to do, of the fine civilizing work done inSouth America, and more especially among the natives, by the Franciscans, andpresently by the Jesuits, who came into America in the latter half of thesixteenth century (after 1549) . . . .So it was that Spain rose to a temporary power and prominence in the world’saffairs. It was a very sudden and very memorable rise. From the eleventh centurythis infertile and corrugated peninsula had been divided against itself, itsChristian population had sustained a perpetual conflict with the Moors; then bywhat seems like an accident it achieved unity just in time to reap the firstharvest of benefit from the discovery of America. Before that time Spain hadalways been a poor country; it is a poor country today, almost its only wealthlies in its mines. For a century, however, through its monopoly of the gold andsilver of America, it dominated the world. The east and centre of Europe werestill overshadowed by the Turk and Mongol; the discovery of America was itself aconsequence of the Turkish conquests; very largely through the Mongolianinventions of compass and paper, and under the stimulus of travel in Asia and ofthe growing knowledge of eastern Asiatic wealth and civilization, came thisastonishing blazing up of the mental, physical, and social energies of the“Atlantic fringe.” For close in the wake of Portugal and Spain came France andEngland, and presently Holland, each in its turn taking up the rôle of expansionand empire overseas. The centre of interest for European history which once layin the Levant shifts now from the Alps and the Mediterranean Sea to theAtlantic. For some centuries the Turkish Empire and Central Asia and China arerelatively neglected by the limelight of the European historian. Nevertheless,these central regions of the world remain central, and their welfare andparticipation is necessary to the permanent peace of mankind.§ 9And now let us consider the political consequences of this vast release andexpansion of European ideas in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries with thenew development of science, the exploration of the world, the greatdissemination of knowledge through paper and printing, and the spread of a newcraving for freedom and equality. How was it affecting the mentality of thecourts and kings that directed the formal affairs of mankind? We have alreadyshown how the hold of the Catholic church upon the consciences of men wasweakening at this time. Only the Spaniards, fresh from a long and finallysuccessful religious war against Islam, had any great enthusiasm left for thechurch. The Turkish conquests and the expansion of the known world robbed theRoman Empire of its former prestige of universality. The old mental and moralframework of Europe was breaking up. What was happening to the dukes, princes,and kings of the old dispensation during this age of change?In England, as we shall tell later, very subtle and interesting tendencies wereleading towards a new method in government, the method of parliament, that wasto spread later on over nearly all the world. But of these tendencies the worldat large was as yet practically unconscious in the sixteenth century.Few monarchs have left us intimate diaries; to be a monarch and to be frank areincompatible feats; monarchy is itself necessarily a pose. The historian isobliged to speculate about the contents of the head that wears a crown as besthe can. No doubt regal psychology has varied with the ages. We have, however,the writings of a very able man of this period who set himself to study andexpound the arts of kingcraft as they were understood in the later fifteenthcentury. This was the celebrated Florentine, Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527). Hewas of good birth and reasonable fortune, and he had entered the publicemployment of the republic by the time he was twenty-five. For eighteen years hewas in the Florentine diplomatic service; he was engaged upon a number ofembassies, and in 1500 he was sent to France to deal with the French king. From1502 to 1512 he was the right hand man of the gonfalonier (the life president)of Florence, Soderini. Machiavelli reorganized the Florentine army, wrotespeeches for the gonfalonier, was indeed the ruling intelligence in Florentineaffairs. When Soderini, who had leant upon the French, was overthrown by theMedici family whom the Spanish supported, Machiavelli, though he tried totransfer his services to the victors, was tortured on the rack and expelled. Hetook up his quarters in a villa near San Casciano, twelve miles or so fromFlorence, and there entertained himself partly by collecting and writingsalacious stories to a friend in Rome, and partly by writing books about Italianpolitics in which he could no longer play a part. Just as we owe Marco Polo’sbook of travels to his imprisonment, so we owe Machiavelli’s Prince, hisFlorentine History, and The Art of War to his downfall and the boredom, of SanCasciano.The enduring value of these books lies in the clear idea they give us of thequality and limitations of the ruling minds of this age. Their atmosphere washis atmosphere. If he brought an exceptionally keen intelligence to theirbusiness, that merely throws it into a brighter light.His susceptible mind had been greatly impressed by the cunning, cruelty,audacity, and ambition of Cæsar Borgia, the Duke of Valentine, in whose camp hehad spent some months as an envoy. In his Prince he idealized this dazzlingperson. Cæsar Borgia (1476-1507), the reader must understand, was the son ofPope Alexander VI, Rodrigo Borgia (1492-1503). The reader will perhaps bestartled at the idea of a Pope having a son, but this, we must remember, was apre-reformation Pope. The Papacy at this time was in a mood of moral relaxation,and though Alexander was, as a priest, pledged to live unmarried, this did nothinder him from living openly with a sort of unmarried wife, and devoting theresources of Christendom to the advancement of his family. Cæsar was a youth ofspirit even for the times in which he lived; he had early caused his elderbrother to be murdered, and also the husband of his sister, Luerezia. He hadindeed betrayed and murdered a number of people. With his father’s assistance hehad become duke of a wide area of Central Italy when Machiavelli visited him. Hehad shown little or no military ability, but considerable dexterity andadministrative power. His magnificence was of the most temporary sort. Whenpresently his father died, it collapsed like a pricked bladder. Its unsoundnesswas not evident to Machiavelli. Our chief interest in Cæsar Borgia is that herealized Machiavelli’s highest ideals of a superb and successful prince.Much has been written to show that Machiavelli had wide and noble intentionsbehind his political writings, but all such attempts to ennoble him will leavethe sceptical reader, who insists on reading the lines instead of readingimaginary things between the lines of Machiavelli’s work, cold towards him. Thisman manifestly had no belief in any righteousness at all, no belief in a Godruling over the world or in a God in men’s hearts, no understanding of the powerof conscience in men. Not for him were Utopian visions of world-wide humanorder, or attempts to realize the City of God. Such things he did not want. Itseemed to him that to get power, to gratify one’s desires and sensibilities andhates, to swagger triumphantly in the world, must be the crown of human desire.Only a prince could fully realize such a life. Some streak of timidity or hissense of the poorness of his personal claims had evidently made him abandon suchdreams for himself; but at least he might hope to serve a prince, to live closeto the glory, to share the plunder and the lust and the gratified malice. Hemight even make himself indispensable! He set himself, therefore, to become an“expert” in prince-craft. He assisted Soderini to fail. When he was racked andrejected by the Medicis, and had no further hopes of being even a successfulcourt parasite, he wrote these handbooks of cunning to show what a cleverservant some prince had lost. His ruling thought, his great contribution topolitical literature, was that the moral obligations upon ordinary men cannotbind princes.There is a disposition to ascribe the virtue of patriotism to Machiavellibecause he suggested that Italy, which was weak and divided—she had been invadedby the Turks and saved from conquest only by the death of the Sultan Muhammad,and she was being fought over by the French and Spanish as though she wassomething inanimate—might be united and strong; but he saw in that possibilityonly a great opportunity for a prince. And he advocated a national army onlybecause he saw the Italian method of carrying on war by hiring bands of foreignmercenaries was a hopeless one. At any time such troops might go over to abetter paymaster or decide to plunder the state they protected. He had beendeeply impressed by the victories of the Swiss over the Milanese, but he neverfathomed the secret of the free spirit that made those victories possible. TheFlorentine militia he created was a complete failure. He was a man born blind tothe qualities that make peoples free and nations great.Yet this morally blind man was living in a little world of morally blind men. Itis clear that his style of thought was the style of thought of the court of histime. Behind the princes of the new states that had grown up out of the wreckageof the empire and the failure of the Church, there were everywhere chancellorsand secretaries and trusted ministers of the Machiavellian type. Cromwell, forinstance, the minister of Henry VIII of England after his breach with Rome,regarded Machiavelli’s Prince as the quintessence of political wisdom. When theprinces were themselves sufficiently clever they, too, were Machiavellian. Theywere scheming to outdo one another, to rob weaker contemporaries, to destroyrivals, so that they might for a brief interval swagger. They had little or novision of any scheme of human destinies greater than this game they playedagainst one another.035 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_035_r1.gif]§ 10It is interesting to note that this Swiss infantry which had so impressedMachiavelli was no part of the princely system of Europe. At the very centre ofthe European system there had arisen a little confederation of free states, theSwiss Confederation, which after some centuries of nominal adhesion to the HolyRoman Empire, became frankly republican in 1499. As early as the thirteenthcentury, the peasant farmers of three valleys round about the Lake of Lucernetook it into their heads that they would dispense with an overlord and managetheir own affairs in their own fashion. Their chief trouble came from the claimsof a noble family of the Aar valley, the Habsburg family. In 1245 the men ofSchwyz burnt the castle of New Habsburg which had been set up near Lucerne toover awe them; its ruins are still to be seen there.This Habsburg family was a growing and acquisitive one; it had lands andpossessions throughout Germany; and in 1273, after the extinction of theHohenstaufen house, Rudolf of Habsburg was elected Emperor of Germany, adistinction that became at last practically hereditary in his family. None theless, the men of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden did not mean to be ruled by anyHabsburg; they formed an Everlasting League in 1291, and they held their ownamong the mountains from that time onward to this day, first as free members ofthe empire and then as an absolutely independent confederation. Of the heroiclegend of William Tell we have no space to tell here, nor have we room in whichto trace the gradual extension of the confederation to its present boundaries.Romansh, Italian, and French-speaking valleys were presently added to thisvaliant little republican group. The red cross flag of Geneva has become thesymbol of international humanity in the midst of warfare. The bright andthriving cities of Switzerland have been a refuge for free men from a score oftyrannies.§ 11AMost of the figures that stand out in history, do so through some exceptionalpersonal quality, good or bad, that makes them more significant than theirfellows. But there was born at Ghent in Belgium in 1500 a man of commonplaceabilities and melancholy temperament, the son of a mentally defective mother whohad been married for reasons of state, who was, through no fault of his own, tobecome the focus of the accumulating stresses of Europe. The historian must givehim a quite unmerited and accidental prominence side by side with such markedindividualities as Alexander and Charlemagne and Frederick II. This was theEmperor Charles V. For a time he had an air of being the greatest monarch inEurope since Charlemagne. Both he and his illusory greatness were the results ofthe matrimonial statecraft of his grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian I (born1459, died 1519).Some families have fought, others have intrigued their way to world power; theHabsburg married their way. Maximilian began his career with the inheritance ofthe Habsburgs, Austria, Styria, part of Alsace and other districts; hemarried—the lady’s name scarcely matters to us—the Netherlands and Burgundy.Most of Burgundy slipped from him after his first wife’s death, but theNetherlands he held. Then he tried unsuccessfully to marry Brittany. He becameEmperor in succession to his father, Frederick III, in 1493, and married theduchy of Milan. Finally he married his son to the weak-minded daughter ofFerdinand and Isabella, the Ferdinand and Isabella of Columbus, who not onlyreigned over a freshly united Spain, and over Sardinia and the kingdom of thetwo Sicilies, but by virtue of the papal gifts to Castile, over all America westof Brazil. So it was that Charles, his grandson, inherited most of the Americancontinent and between a third and a half of what the Turks had left of Europe.The father of Charles died in 1506, and Maximilian did his best to secure hisgrandson’s election to the imperial throne.036 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_036_r1.gif]Charles succeeded to the Netherlands in 1506; he became practically king of theSpanish dominions, his mother being imbecile, when his grandfather Ferdinanddied in 1516; and his grandfather Maximilian dying in 1519, he was in 1520elected Emperor at the still comparatively tender age of twenty.His election as Emperor was opposed by the young and brilliant French King,Francis I, who had succeeded to the French throne in 1515 at the age oftwenty-one. The candidature of Francis was supported by Leo X (1513), who alsorequires from us the epithet brilliant. It was indeed an age of brilliantmonarchs. It was the age of Baber in India (1526-1530) and Suleiman in Turkey(1520). Both Leo and Francis dreaded the concentration of so much power in thehands of one man as the election of Charles threatened. The only other monarchwho seemed to matter in Europe was Henry VIII, who had become King of England in1509 at the age of eighteen. He also offered himself as a candidate for theempire, and the imaginative English reader may amuse himself by working out thepossible consequences of such an election. There was much scope for diplomacy inthis triangle of kings. Charles on his way from Spain to Germany visited Englandand secured the support of Henry against Francis by bribing his minister,Cardinal Wolsey. Henry also made a great parade of friendship with Francis,there was feasting, tournaments, and such-like antiquated gallantries in France,in a courtly picnic known to historians as the Field of the Cloth of Gold(1520). Knighthood was becoming a picturesque affectation in the sixteenthcentury. The Emperor Maximilian I is still called “the last of the knights” byGerman historians.037 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_037_r1.gif]The election of Charles was secured, it is to be noted, by a vast amount ofbribery. He had as his chief supporters and creditors the great German businesshouse of the Fuggers. That large treatment of money and credit which we callfinance, which had gone out of European political life with the collapse of theRoman Empire, was now coming back to power. This appearance of the Fuggers,whose houses and palaces outshone those of the emperors, marks the upwardmovement of forces that had begun two or three centuries earlier in Cahors inFrance and in Florence and other Italian towns. Money, public debts, and socialunrest and discontent re-enter upon the miniature stage of this Outline. CharlesV was not so much a Habsburg as a Fugger emperor.For a time this fair, not very intelligent-looking young man with the thickupper lip and long, clumsy chin—features which still afflict his descendants—waslargely a puppet in the hands of his ministers. Able servants after the order ofMachiavelli guided him at first in the arts of kingship. Then in a slow buteffectual way he began to assert himself. He was confronted at the very outsetof his reign in Germany with the perplexing dissensions of Christendom. Therevolt against the papal rule which had been going on since the days of Huss andWycliffe had been recently exasperated by a new and unusually cynical selling ofindulgences to raise money for the completion of St. Peter’s at Rome. A monknamed Luther, who had been consecrated as a priest, who had taken to reading theBible, and who, while visiting Rome on the business of his order, had been muchshocked by the levity and worldly splendour of the Papacy, had come forwardagainst these papal expedients at Wittenberg (1517), offering disputation andpropounding certain theses. An important controversy ensued. At first Luthercarried on this controversy in Latin, but presently took to German, and speedilyhad the people in a ferment. Charles found this dispute raging when he came fromSpain to Germany. He summoned an assembly or “diet” of the empire at Worms onthe Rhine. To this, Luther, who had been asked to recant his views by Pope LeoX, and who had refused to do so, was summoned. He came, and, entirely in thespirit of Huss, refused to recant unless he was convinced of his error bylogical argument or the authority of Scripture. But his protectors among theprinces were too powerful for him to suffer the fate of John Huss.Here was a perplexing situation for the young Emperor. There is reason tosuppose that he was inclined at first to support Luther against the Pope. Leo Xhad opposed the election of Charles, and was friendly with his rival, Francis I.But Charles V was not a good Machiavellian, and he had acquired in Spain aconsiderable religious sincerity. He decided against Luther. Many of the Germanprinces, and especially the Elector of Saxony, sided with the reformer. Lutherwent into hiding under the protection of the Saxon Elector, and Charles foundhimself in the presence of the opening rift that was to split Christendom intotwo contending camps.Close upon these disturbances, and probably connected with them, came awidespread peasants’ revolt throughout Germany. This outbreak frightened Luthervery effectually. He was shocked by its excesses, and from that time forth theReformation he advocated ceased to be a Reformation according to the people andbecame a Reformation according to the princes. He lost his confidence in thatfree judgment for which he had stood up so manfully.Meanwhile Charles realized that his great empire was in very serious danger bothfrom the west and from the east. On the west of him was his spirited rival,Francis I; to the east was the Turk in Hungary, in alliance with Francis andclamouring for certain arrears of tribute from the Austrian dominions. Charleshad the money and army of Spain at his disposal, but it was extremely difficultto get any effective support in money from Germany. His grandfather haddeveloped a German infantry on the Swiss model, very much upon the linesexpounded in Machiavelli’s Art of War, but these troops had to be paid and hisimperial subsidies had to be supplemented by unsecured borrowings, which werefinally to bring his supporters, the Fuggers, to ruin.038 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_038_r1.gif]On the whole, Charles, in alliance with Henry VIII, was successful againstFrancis I and the Turk. Their chief battlefield was north Italy; the generalshipwas dull on both sides; their advances and retreats depended chiefly on thearrival of reinforcements. The German army invaded France, failed to takeMarseilles, fell back into Italy, lost Milan, and was besieged in Pavia. FrancisI made a long and unsuccessful siege of Pavia, was caught by fresh Germanforces, defeated, wounded, and taken prisoner. He sent back a message to hisqueen that all was “lost but honour,” made a humiliating peace, and broke it assoon as he was liberated, so that even the salvage of honour was but temporary.Henry VIII and the Pope, in obedience to the rules of Machiavellian strategy,now went over to the side of France in order to prevent Charles becoming toopowerful. The German troops in Milan, under the Constable of Bourbon, beingunpaid, forced rather than followed their commander into a raid upon Rome. Theystormed the city and pillaged it (1527). The Pope took refuge in the Castle ofSt. Angelo while the looting and slaughter went on. He bought off the Germantroops at last by the payment of four hundred thousand ducats. Ten years of suchstupid and confused fighting impoverished all Europe and left the Emperor inpossession of Milan. In 1530 he was crowned by the Pope—he was the last GermanEmperor to be crowned by the Pope —at Bologna. One thinks of the ratherdull-looking blonde face, with its long lip and chin, bearing the solemnexpression of one who endures a doubtful though probably honourable ceremony.Meanwhile the Turks were making great headway in Hungary. They had defeated andkilled the King of Hungary in 1526, they held Buda-Pesth, and in 1529, as wehave already noted, Suleiman the Magnificent very nearly took Vienna. TheEmperor was greatly concerned by these advances, and did his utmost to driveback the Turks, but he found the greatest difficulty in getting the Germanprinces to unite even with this formidable enemy upon their very borders.Francis I remained implacable for a time, and there was a new French war; but in1538 Charles won his rival over to a more friendly attitude by ravaging thesouth of France. Francis and Charles then formed an alliance against the Turk,but the Protestant princes, the German princes who were resolved to break awayfrom Rome, had formed a league, the Schmalkaldic League (named after the littletown of Schmalkalden in Hesse, at which its constitution was arranged), againstthe Emperor, and in the place of a great campaign to recover Hungary forChristendom Charles had to turn his mind to the gathering internal struggle inGermany. Of that struggle he saw only the opening war. It was a struggle, asanguinary irrational bickering of princes for ascendancy, now flaming into warand destruction, now sinking back to intrigues and diplomacies; it was a snake’ssack of Machiavellian policies, that was to go on writhing incurably right intothe nineteenth century, and to waste and desolate Central Europe again andagain.The Emperor never seems to have grasped the true forces at work in thesegathering troubles. He was for his time and station an exceptionally worthy man,and he seems to have taken the religious dissensions that were tearing Europeinto warring fragments as genuine theological differences. He gathered diets andcouncils in futile attempts at reconciliation. Formulæ and confessions weretried over. The student of German history must struggle with the details of theReligious Peace of Nuremberg, the settlement at the diet of Ratisbon, theInterim of Augsburg, and the like. Here we do but mention them as details in theworried life of this culminating emperor. As a matter of fact, hardly one of themultifarious princes and rulers in Europe seems to have been acting in goodfaith. The wide-spread religious trouble of the world, the desire of the commonpeople for truth and social righteousness, the spreading knowledge of the time,all those things were merely counters in the imaginations of princely diplomacy.Henry VIII of England, who had begun his career with a book written againstheresy, and who had been rewarded by the Pope with the title of “Defender of theFaith,” being anxious to divorce his first wife in favour of an animated younglady named Anne Boleyn,14 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en65] andwishing also to turn against the Emperor in favour of Francis I and to loot thevast wealth of the church in England, joined the company of Protestant princesin 1530. Sweden, Denmark, and Norway had already gone over to the Protestantside.039 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_039_r1.gif]040 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_040_r1.gif]The German religious war began in 1546, a few months after the death of MartinLuther. We need not trouble about the incidents of the campaign. The ProtestantSaxon army was badly beaten at Lochau. By something very like a breach of faithPhilip of Hesse, the Emperor’s chief remaining antagonist, was caught andimprisoned, and the Turks were bought off by the payment of an annual tribute.In 1547, to the great relief of the Emperor, Francis I died. So by 1547 Charlesgot to a kind of settlement, and made his last efforts to effect peace wherethere was no peace. In 1552 all Germany was at war again, only a precipitateflight from Innsbruck saved Charles from capture, and in 1552, with the treatyof Passau, came another unstable equilibrium. Charles was now utterly weary ofthe cares and splendours of empire; he had never had a very sound constitution,he was naturally indolent, and he was suffering greatly from gout. He abdicated.He made over all his sovereign rights in Germany to his brother Ferdinand, andSpain and the Netherlands he resigned to his son Philip. He then retired to amonastery at Yuste, among the oak and chestnut forests in the hills to the northof the Tagus valley, and there he died in 1558.Much has been written in a sentimental vein of this retirement, thisrenunciation of the world by this tired majestic Titan, world-weary, seeking inan austere solitude his peace with God. But his retreat was neither solitary noraustere; he had with him nearly a hundred and fifty attendants; hisestablishment had all the indulgences without the fatigues of a court, andPhilip II was a dutiful son to whom his father’s advice was a command. As forhis austerities, let Prescott witness: “In the almost daily correspondencebetween Quixada, or Gaztelu, and the Secretary of State at Valladolid, there isscarcely a letter that does not turn more or less on the Emperor’s eating or hisillness. The one seems naturally to follow, like a running commentary, on theother. It is rare that such topics have formed the burden of communications withthe department of state. It must have been no easy matter for the secretary topreserve his gravity in the perusal of despatches in which politics andgastronomy were so strangely mixed together. The courier from Valladolid toLisbon was ordered to make a detour, so as to take Jarandilla in his route, andbring supplies for the royal table. On Thursdays he was to bring fish to servefor the jour maigre that was to follow. The trout in the neighbourhood Charlesthought too small; so others, of a larger size, were to be sent from Valladolid.Fish of every kind was to his taste, as, indeed, was anything that in its natureor habits at all approached to fish. Eels, frogs, oysters, occupied an importantplace in the royal bill of fare. Potted fish, especially anchovies, found greatfavour with him; and he regretted that he had not brought a better supply ofthese from the Low Countries. On an eel-pasty he particularly doted.” . . .15[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en66]In 1554 Charles had obtained a bull from Pope Julius III granting him adispensation from fasting, and allowing him to break his fast early in themorning even when he was to take the sacrament.“That Charles was not altogether unmindful of his wearing apparel in Yuste, maybe inferred from the fact that his wardrobe contained no less than sixteen robesof silk and velvet, lined with ermine, or eider down, or the soft hair of theBarbary goat. As to the furniture and upholstery of his apartments, how littlereliance is to be placed on the reports so carelessly circulated about these maybe gathered from a single glance at the inventory of his effects, prepared byQuixada and Gaztelu soon after their master’s death. Among the items we findcarpets from Turkey and Alcarez, canopies of velvet and other stuffs, hangingsof fine black cloth, which since his mother’s death he had always chosen for hisown bedroom; while the remaining apartments were provided with no less thantwenty-five suits of tapestry, from the looms of Flanders, richly embroideredwith figures of animals and with landscapes.” ... “Among the different pieces ofplate we find some of pure gold, and others especially noted for their curiousworkmanship; and as this was an age in which the art of working the preciousmetals was carried to the highest perfection, we cannot doubt that some of thefinest specimens had come into the Emperor’s possession. The whole amount ofplate was estimated at between twelve and thirteen thousand ounces in weight.” .. .16 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en67]Charles had never acquired the habit of reading, but he would be read aloud toat meals after the fashion of Charlemagne, and would make what one narratordescribes as a “sweet and heavenly commentary.” He also amused himself withtechnical toys, by listening to music or sermons, and by attending to theimperial business that still came drifting in to him. The death of the Empress,to whom he was greatly attached, had turned his mind towards religion, which inhis case took a punctilious and ceremonial form; every Friday in Lent hescourged himself with the rest of the monks with such good will as to drawblood. These exercises and the gout released a bigotry in Charles that had beenhitherto restrained by considerations of policy. The appearance of Protestantteaching close at hand in Valladolid roused him to fury. “Tell the grandinquisitor and his council from me to be at their posts, and to lay the axe atthe root of the evil before it spreads further.” . . . He expressed a doubtwhether it would not be well, in so black an affair, to dispense with theordinary course of justice, and to show no mercy; “lest the criminal, ifpardoned, should have the opportunity of repeating his crime.” He recommended,as an example, his own mode of proceeding in the Netherlands, “where all whoremained obstinate in their errors were burned alive, and those who wereadmitted to penitence were beheaded.”Among the chief pleasures of the Catholic monarch between meals during this timeof retirement were funeral services. He not only attended every actual funeralthat was celebrated at Yuste, but he had services conducted for the absent dead,he held a funeral service in memory of his wife on the anniversary of her death,and finally he celebrated his own obsequies. “The chapel was hung with black,and the blaze of hundreds of wax-lights was scarcely sufficient to dispel thedarkness. The brethren in their conventual dress, and all the Emperor’shousehold clad in deep mourning, gathered round a huge catafalque, shrouded alsoin black, which had been raised in the centre of the chapel. The service for theburial of the dead was then performed; and, amidst the dismal wail of the monks,the prayers ascended for the departed spirit, that it might be received into themansions of the blessed. The sorrowful attendants were melted to tears, as theimage of their master’s death was presented to their minds—or they were touched,it may be, with compassion by this pitiable display of weakness. Charles,muffled in a dark mantle, and bearing a lighted candle in his hand, mingled withhis household, the spectator of his own obsequies; and the doleful ceremony wasconcluded by his placing the taper in the hands of the priest, in sign of hissurrendering up his soul to the Almighty.”Other accounts make Charles wear a shroud and lie in the coffin, remaining therealone until the last mourner had left the chapel.Within two months of this masquerade he was dead. And the greatness of the HolyRoman Empire died with him. The Holy Roman Empire struggled on indeed to thedays of Napoleon, but as an invalid and dying thing.§ 11BFerdinand, the brother of Charles V, took over his abandoned work and met theGerman princes at the diet of Augsburg in 1555. Again there was an attempt toestablish a religious peace. Nothing could better show the quality of thatattempted settlement and the blindness of the princes and statesmen concerned init, to the deeper and broader processes of the time, than the form thatsettlement took. The recognition of religious freedom was to apply to the statesand not to individual citizens; cujus regio ejus religio, “the confession of thesubject was to be dependent on that of the territorial lord.”§ 11CWe have given as much attention as we have done to the writings of Machiavelliand to the personality of Charles V because they throw a flood of light upon theantagonisms of the next period in our history. This present chapter has told thestory of a vast expansion of human horizons and of a great increase anddistribution of knowledge, we have seen the conscience of common men awakeningand intimations of a new and profounder social justice spreading throughout thegeneral body of the Western civilization. But this process of light and thoughtwas leaving courts and the political life of the world untouched. There islittle in Machiavelli that might not have been written by some clever secretaryin the court of Chosroes I or Shi Hwang-ti—or even of Sargon Ior Pepi. While theworld in everything else was moving forward, in political ideas, in ideas aboutthe relationship of state to state and of sovereign to citizen, it was standingstill. Nay, it was falling back. For the great idea of the Catholic Church asthe world city of God had been destroyed in men’s minds by the church itself,and the dream of a world imperialism had, in the person of Charles V, beencarried in effigy through Europe to limbo. Politically the world seemed fallingback towards personal monarchy of the Assyrian or Macedonian pattern.It is not that the newly awakened intellectual energies of western European menwere too absorbed in theological restatement, in scientific investigations, inexploration and mercantile development, to give a thought to the claims andresponsibilities of rulers. Not only were common men drawing ideas of atheocratic or republican or communistic character from the now accessible Bible,but the renewed study of the Greek classics was bringing the creative andfertilizing spirit of Plato to bear upon the Western mind. In England Sir ThomasMore produced a quaint imitation of Plato’s Republic in his Utopia, setting outa sort of autocratic communism. In Naples, a century later, a certain friarCampanella was equally bold in his City of the Sun. But such discussions werehaving no immediate effect upon political arrangements. Compared with themassiveness of the task, these books do indeed seem poetical and scholarly andflimsy. (Yet later on the Utopia was to bear fruit in the English Poor Laws.)The intellectual and moral development of the Western mind and this drifttowards Machiavellian monarchy in Europe were for a time going on concurrentlyin the same world, but they were going on almost independently. The statesmenstill schemed and manœuvred as if nothing grew but the power of wary andfortunate kings. It was only in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries thatthese two streams of tendency, the stream of general ideas and the drift oftraditional and egoistic monarchical diplomacy, interfered and came intoconflict."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIIPRINCES, PARLIAMENTS, AND POWERS§ 1.

The Social Truce Draws to anEnd.§ 1IN the preceding chapter we have traced the beginnings of a new civilization,the civilization of the “modern” type which becomes at the present timeworld-wide. It is still a vast unformed thing, still only in the opening phasesof growth and development today. We have seen the mediæval ideas of the HolyRoman Empire and of the Roman Church, as forms of universal law and order, fadein its dawn. They fade out, as if it were necessary in order that these ideas ofone law and one order for all men should be redrawn on world-wide lines. Andwhile in nearly every other field of human interest there was advance, theeffacement of these general political ideas of the Church and Empire led backfor a time in things political towards merely personal monarchy and monarchistnationalism of the Macedonian type. There came an interregnum, as it were, inthe consolidation of human affairs, a phase of the type the Chinese annalistswould call an “Age of Confusion.” This interregnum has lasted as long as thatbetween the fall of the Western Empire and the crowning of Charlemagne in Rome.We are living in it today. It may be drawing to its close; we cannot tell yet.The old leading ideas had broken down, a medley of new and untried projects andsuggestions perplexed men’s minds and actions, and meanwhile the world at largehad to fall back for leadership upon the ancient tradition of an individualprince. There was no new way clearly apparent for men to follow, and the princewas there.All over the world the close of the sixteenth century saw monarchy prevailingand tending towards absolutism. Germany and Italy were patchworks of autocraticprincely dominions, Spain was practically autocratic, the throne had never beenso powerful in England, and as the seventeenth century drew on, the Frenchmonarchy gradually became the greatest and most consolidated power in Europe.The phases and fluctuations of its ascent we cannot record here.At every court there were groups of ministers and secretaries who played aMachiavellian game against their foreign rivals. Foreign policy is the naturalemployment of courts and monarchies. Foreign offices are, so to speak, theleading characters in all the histories of the seventeenth and eighteenthcenturies. They kept Europe in a fever of wars. And wars were becomingexpensive. Armies were no longer untrained levies, no longer assemblies offeudal knights who brought their own horses and weapons and retainers with them;they needed more and more artillery; they consisted of paid troops who insistedon their pay; they were professional and slow and elaborate, conducting longsieges, necessitating elaborate fortifications. War expenditure increasedeverywhere and called for more and more taxation. And here it was that thesemonarchies of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries came into conflict withnew and shapeless forces of freedom in the community. In practice the princesfound they were not masters of their subjects’ lives or property. They found aninconvenient resistance to the taxation that was necessary if their diplomaticaggressions and alliances were to continue. Finance became an unpleasant spectrein every council chamber. In theory the monarch owned his country. James I ofEngland (1603) declared that “As it is atheism and blasphemy to dispute what Godcan do; so it is presumption and high contempt in a subject to dispute what aking can do, or say that a king cannot do this or that.” In practice, however,he found, and his son Charles I (1625) was to find still more effectually, thatthere were in his dominions a great number of landlords and merchants,substantial and intelligent persons, who set a very definite limit to the callsand occasions of the monarch and his ministers. They were prepared to toleratehis rule if they themselves might also be monarchs of their lands and businessesand trades and what not. But not otherwise.Everywhere in Europe there was a parallel development. Beneath the kings andprinces there were these lesser monarchs, the private owners, noblemen, wealthycitizens and the like, who were now offering the sovereign prince much the sameresistance that the kings and princes of Germany had offered the Emperor. Theywanted to limit taxation so far as it pressed upon themselves, and to be free intheir own houses and estates. And the spread of books and reading andintercommunication was enabling these smaller monarchs, these monarchs ofownership, to develop such a community of ideas and such a solidarity ofresistance as had been possible at no previous stage in the world’s history.Everywhere they were disposed to resist the prince, but it was not everywherethat they found the same faculties for an organized resistance. The economiccircumstances and the political traditions of the Netherlands and England madethose countries the first to bring this antagonism of monarchy and privateownership to an issue.At first this seventeenth-century “public,” this public of property owners,cared very little for foreign policy. They did not perceive at first how itaffected them. They did not want to be bothered with it; it was, they conceded,the affairs of kings and princes. They made no attempt therefore to controlforeign entanglements. But it was with the direct consequences of theseentanglements that they quarrelled; they objected to heavy taxation, tointerference with trade, to arbitrary imprisonment, and to the control ofconsciences by the monarch. It was upon these questions that they joined issuewith the Crown.§ 2The breaking away of the Netherlands from absolutist monarchy was the beginningof a series of such conflicts throughout the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies. They varied very greatly in detail according to local and racialpeculiarities, but essentially they were all rebellious against the idea of apredominating personal “prince” and his religious and political direction.In the twelfth century all the lower Rhine country was divided up among a numberof small rulers, and the population was a Low German one on a Celtic basis,mixed with subsequent Danish ingredients very similar to the English admixture.The south-eastern fringe of it spoke French dialects; the bulk, Frisian, Dutch,and other Low German languages. The Netherlands figured largely in the crusades.Godfrey of Bouillon, who took Jerusalem (First Crusade), was a Belgian; and thefounder of the so-called Latin Dynasty of emperors in Constantinople (FourthCrusade) was Baldwin of Flanders. (They were called Latin emperors because theywere on the side of the Latin church.) In the thirteenth and fourteenthcenturies considerable towns grew up in the Netherlands: Ghent, Bruges, Ypres,Utrecht, Leyden, Haarlem, and so forth; and these towns developedquasi-independent municipal governments and a class of educated townsmen. Wewill not trouble the reader with the dynastic accidents that linked the affairsof the Netherlands with Burgundy (Eastern France), and which finally made theiroverlordship the inheritance of the Emperor Charles V.It was under Charles that the Protestant doctrines that now prevailed in Germanyspread into the Netherlands. Charles persecuted with some vigour, but in 1556,as we have told, he handed over the task to his son Philip (Philip II). Philip’sspirited foreign policy—he was carrying on a war with France —presently became asecond source of trouble between himself and the Netherlandish noblemen andtownsmen, because he had to come to them for supplies. The great nobles, led byWilliam the Silent, Prince of Orange, and the Counts of Egmont and Horn, madethemselves the heads of a popular resistance, in which it is now impossible todisentangle the objection to taxation from the objection to religiouspersecution. The great nobles were not at first Protestants. They becameProtestants as the struggle grew in bitterness. The people were often bitterlyProtestant.Philip was resolved to rule both the property and consciences of hisNetherlanders. He sent picked Spanish troops into the country, and he madegovernor-general a nobleman named Alva, one of those ruthless “strong” men whowreck governments and monarchies. For a time he ruled the land with a hand ofiron, but the hand of iron begets a soul of iron in the body it grips, and in1567 the Netherlands were in open revolt. Alva murdered, sacked, andmassacred—in vain. Counts Egmont and Horn were executed. William the Silentbecame the great leader of the Dutch, a king de facto. For a long time, and withmany complications, the struggle for liberty continued, and through it all it isnoteworthy that the rebels continued to cling to the plea that Philip II wastheir king—if only he would be a reasonable and limited king. But the idea oflimited monarchy was distasteful to the crowned heads of Europe at that time,and at last Philip drove the United Provinces, for which we now use the name ofHolland, to the republican form of government. Holland, be it noted—not all theNetherlands; the southern Netherlands, Belgium as we now call that country,remained at the end of the struggle a Spanish possession and Catholic.The siege of Alkmaar (1573), as Motley1[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en68] describes it, may be taken asa sample of that long and hideous conflict between the little Dutch people andthe still vast resources of Catholic Imperialism.“‘If I take Alkmaar,’ Alva wrote to Philip, ‘I am resolved not to leave a singlecreature alive; the knife shall be put to every throat.’ . . .“And now, with the dismantled and desolate Haarlem before their eyes, aprophetic phantom, perhaps, of their own imminent fate, did the handful ofpeople shut up within Alkmaar prepare for the worst. Their main hope lay in thefriendly sea. The vast sluices called the Zyp, through which the inundation ofthe whole northern province could be very soon effected, were but a few milesdistant. By opening these gates, and by piercing a few dykes, the ocean might bemade to fight for them. To obtain this result, however, the consent of theinhabitants was requisite, as the destruction of all the standing crops would beinevitable. The city was so closely invested, that it was a matter of life anddeath to venture forth, and it was difficult, therefore, to find an envoy forthis hazardous mission. At last, a carpenter in the city, Peter Van der Mey byname, undertook the adventure. . . .“Affairs soon approached a crisis within the beleaguered city. Daily skirmishes,without decisive results, had taken place outside the walls. At last, on the18th of September, after a steady cannonade of nearly twelve hours, DonFrederick, at three in the afternoon, ordered an assault. Notwithstanding hisseven months’ experience at Haarlem, he still believed it certain that he shouldcarry Alkmaar by storm. The attack took place at once upon the Frisian gate andupon the red tower on the opposite side. Two choice regiments, recently arrivedfrom Lombardy, led the onset, rending the air with their shouts and confident ofan easy victory. They were sustained by what seemed an overwhelming force ofdisciplined troops. Yet never, even in the recent history of Haarlem, had anattack been received by more dauntless breasts. Every living man was on thewalls. The storming parties were assailed with cannon, with musketry, withpistols. Boiling water, pitch and oil, molten lead, and unslaked lime werepoured upon them every moment. Hundreds of tarred and burning hoops wereskilfully quoited around the necks of the soldiers, who struggled in vain toextricate themselves from these fiery ruffs, while as fast as any of theinvaders planted foot upon the breach, they were confronted face to face withsword and dagger by the burghers, who hurled them headlong into the moat below.“Thrice was the attack renewed with ever-increasing rage—thrice repulsed withunflinching fortitude. The storm continued four hours long. During all thatperiod not one of the defenders left his post, till he dropped from it dead orwounded. . . . The trumpet of recall was sounded, and the Spaniards, utterlydiscomfited, retired from the walls, leaving at least one thousand dead in thetrenches, while only thirteen burghers and twenty-four of the garrison losttheir lives. . . . Ensign Solis, who had mounted the breach for an instant, andmiraculously escaped with life, after having been hurled from the battlements,reported that he had seen ‘neither helmet nor harness’ as he looked down intothe city: only some plain-looking people, generally dressed like fishermen. Yetthese plain-looking fishermen had defeated the veterans of Alva. . . .“Meantime, as Governor Sonoy had opened many of the dykes, the land in theneighbourhood of the camp was becoming plashy, although as yet the threatenedinundation had not taken place. The soldiers were already very uncomfortable andvery refractory. The carpenter-envoy had not been idle. . . .”He returned with despatches for the city. By accident or contrivance he lostthese despatches as he made his way into the town, so that they fell into Alva’shands. They contained a definite promise from the Duke of Orange to flood thecountry so as to drown the whole Spanish army. Incidentally this would also havedrowned most of the Dutch harvest and cattle. But Alva, when he had read thesedocuments, did not wait for the opening of any more sluices. Presently the stoutmen of Alkmaar, cheering and jeering, watched the Spaniards breaking camp. . . .The form assumed by the government of liberated Holland was a patrician republicunder the headship of the house of Orange. The States-General was far lessrepresentative of the whole body of citizens than was the English Parliament weshall next relate.Though the worst of the struggle was over after Alkmaar, Holland was noteffectively independent until 1609, and its independence was only fully andcompletely recognized by the treaty of Westphalia in 1648.§ 3The open struggle of the private property owner against the aggressions of the“Prince” begins in England far back in the twelfth century. The phase in thisstruggle that we have to study now is the phase that opened with the attempts ofHenry VII and VIII and their successors, Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth, to makethe government of England a “personal monarchy” of the continental type. Itbecame more acute when, by dynastic accidents, James, King of Scotland, becameJames I, King of both Scotland and England (1603), and began to talk in themanner we have already quoted of his “divine right” to do as he pleased. Butnever had the path of English monarchy been a smooth one. In all the monarchiesof the Northmen and Germanic invaders of the empire there had been a traditionof a popular assembly of influential and representative men to preserve theirgeneral liberties, and in none was it more living than in England. France hadher tradition of the assembly of the Three Estates, Spain her Cortes, but theEnglish assembly was peculiar in two respects; that it had behind it adocumentary declaration of certain elementary and universal rights, and that itcontained elected “Knights of the Shire,” as well as elected burghers from thetowns. The French and Spanish assemblies had the latter, but not the formerelement.These two features gave the English Parliament a peculiar strength in itsstruggle with the Throne. The document in question was Magna Carta, the GreatCharter, a declaration which was forced from King John (1199-1216), the brotherand successor of Richard Cœur de Lion (1189-99), after a revolt of the Barons in1215. It rehearsed a number of fundamental rights that made England a legal andnot a regal state. It rejected the power of the king to control the personalproperty and liberty of every sort, of citizen—save with the consent of thatman’s equals.The presence of the elected shire representatives in the English Parliament, thesecond peculiarity of the British situation, came about from very simple andapparently innocuous beginnings. From the shires, or county divisions, knightsseem to have been summoned to the national council to testify to the taxablecapacity of their districts. They were sent up by the minor gentry, freeholdersand village elders of their districts as early as 1254, two knights from eachshire. This idea inspired Simon de Montfort,2[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en69] who was in rebellion againstHenry III, the successor of John, to summon to the national council two knightsfrom each shire and two citizens from each city or borough. Edward I, thesuccessor to Henry III, continued this practice because it seemed a convenientway of getting into financial touch with the growing towns. At first there wasconsiderable reluctance on the parts of the knights and townsmen to attendParliament, but gradually the power they possessed of linking the redress ofgrievances with the granting of subsidies wag realized. Quite early, if not fromthe first, these representatives of the general property owners in town andcountry, the Commons, sat and debated apart from the great Lords and Bishops. Sothere grew up in England a representative assembly, the Commons, beside anepiscopal and patrician one, the Lords. There was no profound and fundamentaldifference between the personnel of the two assemblies; many of the knights ofthe shire were substantial men who might be as wealthy and influential as peersand also the sons and brothers of peers, but on the whole the Commons was themore plebeian assembly. From the first these two assemblies, and especially theCommons, displayed a disposition to claim the entire power of taxation in theland. Gradually they extended their purview of grievances to a criticism of allthe affairs of the realm. We will not follow the fluctuations of the power andprestige of the English Parliament through the time of the Tudor monarchs (i.e.,Henry VII and VIII, Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth), but it will be manifest fromwhat has been said that when at last James Stuart made his open claim toautocracy, the English merchants, peers, and private gentlemen found themselveswith a tried and honoured traditional means of resisting him such as no otherpeople in Europe possessed.Another peculiarity of the English political conflict, was its comparativedetachment from the great struggle between Catholic and Protestant that was nowbeing waged all over Europe. There were, it is true, very distinct religiousissues mixed up in the English struggle, but upon its main lines it was apolitical struggle of King against the Parliament embodying the class ofprivate-property-owning citizens. Both Crown and people were formally reformedand Protestant. It is true that many people on the latter side were Protestantsof a Bible-respecting, non-sacerdotal type, representing the reformationaccording to the peoples, and that the king was the nominal head of a specialsacerdotal and sacramental church, the established Church of England,representing the reformation according to the princes, but this antagonism nevercompletely obscured the essentials of the conflict.The struggle of King and Parliament had already reached an acute phase beforethe death of James I (1625), but only in the reign of his son Charles I did itculminate in civil war. Charles did exactly what one might have expected a kingto do in such a position, in view of the lack of Parliamentary control overforeign policy; he embroiled the country in a conflict with both Spain andFrance, and then came to the country for supplies in the hope that patrioticfeeling would override the normal dislike to giving him money. When Parliamentrefused supplies, he demanded loans from various subjects, and attempted similarillegal exactions. This produced from Parliament in 1628 a very memorabledocument, the Petition of Right, citing the Great Charter and rehearsing thelegal limitations upon the power of the English king, denying his right to levycharges upon, or to imprison, or punish anyone, or to quarter soldiers on thepeople, without due process of law. The Petition of Right stated the case of theEnglish Parliament. The disposition to “state a case” has always been a verymarked English characteristic. When President Wilson, during the Great War of1914-18, prefaced each step in his policy by a “Note,” he was walking in themost respectable traditions of the English. Charles dealt with this Parliamentwith a high hand, he dismissed it in 1629, and for eleven years he summoned noParliament. He levied money illegally, but not enough for his purpose; andrealizing that the church could be used as an instrument of obedience, he madeLaud, an aggressive high churchman, very much of a priest and a very strongbeliever in “divine right,” Archbishop of Canterbury, and so head of the Churchof England.In 1638 Charles tried to extend the half-Protestant, half-Catholiccharacteristics of the Church of England to his other kingdom of Scotland, wherethe secession from catholicism had been more complete, and where anon-sacerdotal, non-sacramental form of Christianity, Presbyterianism, had beenestablished as the national church. The Scotch revolted, and the English leviesCharles raised to fight them mutinied. Insolvency, at all times the naturalresult of a “spirited” foreign policy, was close at hand. Charles, without moneyor trustworthy troops, had to summon a Parliament at last in 1640. ThisParliament, the Short Parliament, he dismissed in the same year; he tried aCouncil of Peers at York (1640), and then in the November of that year summonedhis last Parliament.This body, the Long Parliament, assembled in the mood for conflict. It seizedLaud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and charged him with treason. It published a“Grand Remonstrance,” which was a long and full statement of its case againstCharles. It provided by a bill for a meeting of Parliament at least once inthree years, whether the King summoned it or no. It prosecuted the King’s chiefministers who had helped him to reign for so long without Parliament, and inparticular the Earl of Strafford. To save Strafford the King plotted for asudden seizure of London by the army. This was discovered, and the Bill forStrafford’s condemnation was hurried on in the midst of a vast popularexcitement. Charles I, who was probably one of the meanest and most treacherousoccupants the English throne has ever known, was frightened by the Londoncrowds. Before Strafford could die by due legal process, it was necessary forthe King to give his assent. Charles gave it—and Strafford was beheaded.Meanwhile the King was plotting and looking for help in strange quarters —fromthe Catholic Irish, from treasonable Scotchmen. Finally he resorted to aforcible-feeble display of violence. He went down to the Houses of Parliament toarrest five of his most active opponents. He entered the House of Commons andtook the Speaker’s chair. He was prepared with some bold speech about treason,but when he saw the places of his five antagonists vacant, he was baffled,confused, and spoke in broken sentences. He learnt that they had departed fromhis royal city of Westminster and taken refuge in the city of London (see Chap.XXIV, § 7). London defied him. A week later the Five Members were escorted backin triumph to the Parliament House in Westminster by the Trained Bands ofLondon, and the King, to avoid the noise and hostility of the occasion, leftWhitehall for Windsor.Both parties then prepared openly for war.The King was the traditional head of the army, and the habit of obedience insoldiers is to the King. The Parliament had the greater resources. The King setup his standard at Nottingham on the eve of a dark and stormy August day in1642. There followed a long and obstinate civil war, the King holding Oxford,the Parliament, London. Success swayed from side to side, but the King couldnever close on London nor Parliament take Oxford. Each antagonist was weakenedby moderate adherents who “did not want to go too far.” There emerged among theParliamentary commanders a certain Oliver Cromwell, who had raised a small troopof horse and who rose to the position of general. Lord Warwick, hiscontemporary, describes him as a plain man, in a cloth suit “made by an illcountry tailor.” He was no mere fighting soldier, but a military organizer; herealized the inferior quality of many of the Parliamentary forces, and sethimself to remedy it. The Cavaliers of the King had the picturesque tradition ofchivalry and loyalty on their side; Parliament was something new anddifficult—without any comparable traditions. “Your troops are most of them olddecayed serving men and tapsters,” said Cromwell. “Do you think that the spiritsof such base and mean fellows will ever be able to encounter gentlemen that havehonour and courage and resolution in them?” But there is something better andstronger than picturesque chivalry in the world, religious enthusiasm. He sethimself to get together a “godly” regiment. They were to be earnest,sober-living men. Above all, they were to be men of strong convictions. Hedisregarded all social traditions, and drew his officers from every class. “Ihad rather have a plain, russet-coated captain that knows what he fights for andloves what he knows, than what you call a gentleman and is nothing else.”England discovered a new force, the Ironsides, in its midst, in which footmen,draymen, and ships’ captains held high command, side by side with men of family.They became the type on which the Parliament sought to reconstruct its entirearmy. The Ironsides were the backbone of this “New Model.” From Marston Moor toNaseby these men swept the Cavaliers before them. The King was at last a captivein the hands of Parliament.There were still attempts at settlement that would have left the King a sort ofking, but Charles was a man doomed to tragic issues, incessantly scheming, “sofalse a man that he is not to be trusted.” The English were drifting towards asituation new in the world’s history, in which a monarch should be formallytried for treason to his people and condemned.Most revolutions are precipitated, as this English one was, by the excesses ofthe ruler, and by attempts at strength and firmness beyond the compass of thelaw; and most revolutions swing by a kind of necessity towards an extremerconclusion than is warranted by the original quarrel. The English revolution wasno exception. The English are by nature a compromising and even a vacillatingpeople, and probably the great majority of them still wanted the King to be Kingand the people to be free, and all the lions and lambs to lie down together inpeace and liberty. But the army of the New Model could not go back. There wouldhave been scant mercy for these draymen and footmen who had ridden down theKing’s gentlemen if the King came back. When Parliament began to treat againwith this regal trickster, the New Model intervened; Colonel Pride turned outeighty members from the House of Commons who favoured the King, and the illegalresidue, the Rump Parliament, then put the King on trial.But indeed the King was already doomed. The House of Lords rejected theordinance for the trial, and the Rump then proclaimed “that the People are,under God, the original of all just power,” and that “the Commons of England . .. have the supreme power in this nation,” and—assuming that it was itself theCommons—proceeded with the trial. The King was condemned as a “tyrant, traitor,murderer, and enemy of his country.” He was taken one January morning in 1649 toa scaffold erected outside the windows of his own banqueting-room at Whitehall.There he was beheaded. He died with piety and a certain noble self-pity—eightyears after the execution of Strafford, and after six and a half years of adestructive civil war which had been caused almost entirely by his ownlawlessness.This was indeed a great and terrifying thing that Parliament had done. The likeof it had never been heard of in the world before. Kings had killed each othertimes enough; parricide, fratricide, assassination, those are the privilegedexpedients of princes; but that a section of the people should rise up, try itsking solemnly and deliberately for disloyalty, mischief, and treachery, andcondemn and kill him, sent horror through every court in Europe. The RumpParliament had gone beyond the ideas and conscience of its time. It was as if acommittee of jungle deer had taken and killed a tiger—a crime against nature.The Tsar of Russia chased the English envoy from his court. France and Hollandcommitted acts of open hostility. England, confused and conscience-stricken ather own sacrilege, stood isolated before the world.But for a time the personal quality of Oliver Cromwell and the discipline andstrength of the army he had created maintained England in the republican courseshe had taken. The Irish Catholics had made a massacre of the Protestant Englishin Ireland, and now Cromwell suppressed the Irish insurrection with greatvigour. Except for certain friars at the storm of Drogheda, none but men witharms in their hands were killed by his troops; but the atrocities of themassacre were fresh in his mind, no quarter was given in battle, and so hismemory still rankles in the minds of the Irish, who have a long memory for theirown wrongs. After Ireland came Scotland, where Cromwell shattered a Royalistarmy at the Battle of Dunbar (1650). Then he turned his attention to Holland,which country had rashly seized upon the divisions among the English as anexcuse for the injury of a trade rival. The Dutch were then the rulers of thesea, and the English fleet fought against odds; but after a series of obstinatesea fights the Dutch were driven from the British seas and the English tooktheir place as the ascendant naval power. Dutch and French ships must dip theirflags to them. An English fleet went into the Mediterranean—the first Englishnaval force to enter those waters; it put right various grievances of theEnglish shippers with Tuscany and Malta, and bombarded the pirate nest ofAlgiers and destroyed the pirate fleet—which in the lax days of Charles had beenwont to come right up to the coasts of Cornwall and Devon to intercept ships andcarry off slaves to Africa. The strong arm of England also intervened to protectthe Protestants in the south of France, who were being hunted to death by theDuke of Savoy. France, Sweden, Denmark, all found it wiser to overcome theirfirst distaste for regicide and allied themselves with England. Came a war withSpain, and the great English Admiral Blake destroyed the Spanish Plate Fleet atTeneriffe in an action of almost incredible daring. He engaged land batteries.He was the first man “that brought ships to contemn castles on the shore.” (Hedied in 1657, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, but after the restoration ofthe monarchy his bones were dug out by the order of Charles II, and removed toSt. Margaret’s, Westminster.) Such was the figure that England cut in the eyesof the world during her brief republican days.On September 3rd, 1658, Cromwell died in the midst of a great storm that did notfail to impress the superstitious. Once his strong hand lay still, England fellaway from this premature attempt to realize a righteous commonweal of free men.In 1660 Charles II, the son of Charles the “Martyr,” was welcomed back toEngland with all those manifestations of personal loyalty dear to the Englishheart, and the country relaxed from its military and naval efficiency as asleeper might, wake and stretch and yawn after too intense a dream. The Puritanswere done with. “Merrie England” was herself again, and in 1667 the Dutch, oncemore masters of the sea, sailed up the Thames to Gravesend and burnt an Englishfleet in the Medway. “On the night when our ships were burnt by the Dutch,” saysPepys, in his diary, “the King did sup with my Lady Castelmaine, and there theywere all mad, hunting a poor moth.” Charles, from the date of his return, 1660,took control of the foreign affairs of the state, and in 1670 concluded a secrettreaty with Louis XIV of France by which he undertook to subordinate entirelyEnglish foreign policy to that of France for an annual pension of £100,000.Dunkirk, which Cromwell had taken, had already been sold back to France. TheKing was a great sportsman; he had the true English love for watching horseraces, and the racing centre at Newmarket is perhaps his most characteristicmonument.While Charles lived, his easy humour enabled him to retain the British crown,but he did so by wariness and compromise, and when in 1685 he was succeeded byhis brother James II, who was a devout Catholic, and too dull to recognize thehidden limitation of the monarchy in Britain, the old issue between Parliamentand Crown became acute. James set himself to force his country into a religiousreunion with Rome. In 1688 he was in flight to France. But this time the greatlords and merchants and gentlemen were too circumspect to let this revoltagainst the King fling them into the hands of a second Pride or a secondCromwell. They had already called in another king, William, Prince of Orange, toreplace James. The change was made rapidly. There was no civil war—except inIreland—and no release of the deeper revolutionary forces of the country.Of William’s claim to the throne, or rather of his wife Mary’s claim, we cannottell here, its interest is purely technical, nor how William III and Mary ruled,nor how, after the widower William had reigned alone for a time, the thronepassed on to Mary’s sister Anne (1702-14). Anne seems to have thought favourablyof a restoration of the Stuart line, but the Lords and the Commons, who nowdominated English affairs, preferred a less competent king. Some sort of claimcould be made out for the Elector of Hanover, who became King of England asGeorge I (1714-27). He was entirely German, he could speak no English, and hebrought a swarm of German women and German attendants to the English court; adullness, a tarnish, came over the intellectual life of the land with hiscoming, but this isolation of the court from English life was his conclusiverecommendation to the great landowners and the commercial interests who chieflybrought him over. England entered upon a phase which Lord Beaconsfield hascalled the “Venetian oligarchy” stage; the supreme power resided in Parliament,dominated now by the Lords, for the art of bribery and a study of the methods ofworking elections carried to a high pitch by Sir Robert Walpole had robbed theHouse of Commons of its original freedom and vigour. By ingenious devices theparliamentary vote was restricted to a shrinking number of electors, old townswith little or no population would return one or two members (old Sarum had onenon-resident voter, no population, and two members), while newer populouscentres had no representation at all. And by insisting upon a high propertyqualification for members, the chance of the Commons speaking in common accentsof vulgar needs was still more restricted. George I was followed by the verysimilar George II (1727-60), and it was only at his death that England had againa king who had been born in England, and one who could speak English fairlywell, his grandson George III. On this monarch’s attempt to recover some of thelarger powers of monarchy we shall have something to say in a later section.Such briefly is the story of the struggle in England during the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries between the three main factors in the problem of the“modern state”; between the crown, the private property owners, and that vaguepower, still blind and ignorant, the power of the quite common people. Thislatter factor appears as yet only at moments when the country is most deeplystirred; then it sinks back into the depths. But the end of the story, thus far,is a very complete triumph of the British private property owner over the dreamsand schemes of Machiavellian absolutism. With the Hanoverian Dynasty, Englandbecame—as the Times recently styled her—a “crowned republic.” She had worked outa new method of government, Parliamentary government, recalling in many ways theSenate and Popular Assembly of Rome, but more steadfast and efficient because ofits use, however restricted, of the representative method. Her assembly atWestminster was to become the “Mother of Parliaments” throughout the world.Towards the crown the English Parliament has held and still holds much therelation of the mayor of the palace to the Merovingian kings. The king isconceived of as ceremonial and irresponsible, a living symbol of the royal andimperial system. But much power remains latent in the tradition and prestige ofthe crown, and the succession of the four Hanoverian Georges, William IV (1830),Victoria (1837), Edward VII (1901), and the present king, George V (1910), is ofa quite different strain from the feeble and short-lived Merovingian monarchs.In the affairs of the church, the military and naval organizations, and theforeign office, these sovereigns have all in various degrees exercised aninfluence which is none the less important because it is indefinable.§ 4Upon no part of Europe did the collapse of the idea of a unified Christendombring more disastrous consequences than to Germany. Naturally one would havesupposed that the Emperor, being by origin a German, both in the case of theearlier lines and in the case of the Habsburgs, would have developed into thenational monarch of a united German-speaking state. It was the accidentalmisfortune of Germany that her Emperors never remained German. Frederick II, thelast Hohenstaufen, was, as we have seen, a half-Orientalized Sicilian; theHabsburgs, by marriage and inclination, became in the person of Charles V, firstBurgundian and then Spanish in spirit. After the death of Charles V, his brotherFerdinand took Austria and the empire, and his son Philip II took Spain, theNetherlands, and South Italy; but the Austrian line, obstinately Catholic,holding its patrimony mostly on the eastern frontiers, deeply entangledtherefore with Hungarian affairs and paying tribute, as Ferdinand and his twosuccessors did, to the Turk, retained no grip upon the north Germans with theirdisposition towards Protestantism, their Baltic and westward affinities, andtheir ignorance of or indifference to the Turkish danger.The sovereign princes, dukes, electors, prince bishops and the like, whosedomains cut up the map of the Germany of the Middle Ages into a crazy patchwork,were really not the equivalents of the kings of England and France. They wererather on the level of the great land-owning dukes and peers of France andEngland. Until 1701 none of them had the title of “King.” Many of theirdominions were less both in size and value than the larger estates of theBritish nobility. The German Diet was like the States-General or like aparliament without the presence of elected representatives. So that the greatcivil war in Germany that presently broke out, the Thirty Years’ War (1618-48)was in its essential nature much more closely akin to the civil war in England(1643-49) and to the war of the Fronde (1648-53), the league of feudal noblesagainst the Crown in France, than appears upon the surface. In all these casesthe Crown was either Catholic or disposed to become Catholic, and therecalcitrant nobles found their individualistic disposition tending to aProtestant formula. But while in England and Holland the Protestant nobles andrich merchants ultimately triumphed and in France the success of the Crown waseven more complete, in Germany neither was the Emperor strong enough, nor hadthe Protestant princes a sufficient unity and organization among themselves tosecure a conclusive triumph. It ended there in a torn-up Germany. Moreover, theGerman issue was complicated by the fact that various non-German peoples, theBohemians and the Swedes (who had a new Protestant monarchy which had arisenunder Gustava Vasa as a direct result of the Reformation), were entangled in thestruggle. Finally, the French monarchy, triumphant now over its own nobles,although it was Catholic, came in on the Protestant side with the evidentintention of taking the place of the Habsburgs as the imperial line.041 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_041_r1.gif]The prolongation of the war, and the fact that it was not fought along adeterminate frontier, but all over an empire of patches, Protestant here,Catholic there, made it one of the most cruel and destructive that Europe hadknown since the days of the barbarian raids. Its peculiar mischief lay not inthe fighting, but in the concomitants of the fighting. It came at a time whenmilitary tactics had developed to a point that rendered ordinary levies uselessagainst trained professional infantry. Volley firing with muskets at a range ofa few score yards had abolished the individualistic knight in armour, but thecharge of disciplined masses of cavalry could still disperse any infantry thathad not been drilled into a mechanical rigidity. The infantry with theirmuzzle-loading muskets could not keep up a steady enough fire to witherdetermined cavalry before it charged home. They had, therefore, to meet theshock standing or kneeling behind a bristling wall of pikes or bayonets. Forthis they needed great discipline and experience. Iron cannon were still ofsmall size and not very abundant, and they did not play a decisive part as yetin warfare. They could “plough lanes” in infantry, but they could not easilysmash and scatter it if it was sturdy and well drilled. War under theseconditions was entirely in the hands of seasoned professional soldiers, and thequestion of their pay was as important a one to the generals of that time as thequestion of food or munitions. As the long struggle dragged on from phase tophase, and the financial distress of the land increased, the commanders of bothsides were forced to fall back upon the looting of towns and villages, both forsupply and to make up the arrears of their soldiers’ pay. The soldiers became,therefore, more and more mere brigands living on the country, and the ThirtyYears’ War set up a tradition of looting as a legitimate operation in warfareand of outrage as a soldier’s privilege that has tainted the good name ofGermany right down to the Great War of 1914. The earlier chapters of Defoe’sMemoirs of a Cavalier, with its vivid description of the massacre and burning ofMagdeburg, will give the reader a far better idea of the warfare of this timethan any formal history. So harried was the land that the farmers ceased fromcultivation, what snatch crops could be harvested were hidden away, and greatcrowds of starving women and children became camp followers of the armies, andsupplied a thievish tail to the rougher plundering. At the close of the struggleall Germany was ruined and desolate. Central Europe did not fully recover fromthese robberies and devastations for a century.Here we can but name Tilly and Wallenstein, the great plunder captains on theHabsburg side, and Gustavus Adolphus, the King of Sweden, the Lion of the North,the champion of the Protestants, whose dream was to make the Baltic Sea a“Swedish Lake.” Gustavus Adolphus was killed in his decisive victory overWallenstein at Lützen (1632), and Wallenstein was murdered in 1634. In 1648 theprinces and diplomatists gathered amidst the havoc they had made to patch up theaffairs of Central Europe at the Peace of Westphalia. By that peace the power ofthe Emperor was reduced to a shadow, and the acquisition of Alsace broughtFrance up to the Rhine. And one German prince, the Hohenzollern Elector ofBrandenburg, acquired so much territory as to become the greatest German powernext to the Emperor, a power that presently (1701) became the kingdom ofPrussia. The Treaty also recognized two long accomplished facts, the separationfrom the empire and the complete independence of both Holland and Switzerland.§ 5We have opened this chapter with the stories of two countries, the Netherlandsand Britain, in which the resistance of the private citizen to this new type ofmonarchy, the Machiavellian monarchy, that was arising out of the moral collapseof Christendom, succeeded. But in France, Russia, in many parts of Germany andof Italy—Saxony and Tuscany e.g.—personal monarchy was not so restrained andoverthrown; it established itself indeed as the ruling European system duringthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. And even in Holland and Britain themonarchy was recovering power during the eighteenth century.(In Poland conditions were peculiar, and they will be dealt with in a latersection.)In France there had been no Magna Carta, and there was not quite so definite andeffective a tradition of parliamentary rule. There was the same opposition ofinterests between the crown on the one hand and the landlords and merchants onthe other, but the latter had no recognized gathering-place, and no dignifiedmethod of unity. They formed oppositions to the crown, they made leagues ofresistance—such was the “Fronde,” which was struggling against the young KingLouis XIV and his great minister Mazarin, while Charles I was fighting for hislife in England—but ultimately (1652), after a civil war, they were conclusivelydefeated; and while in England after the establishment of the Hanoverians theHouse of Lords and their subservient Commons ruled the country, in France, onthe contrary, after 1652, the court entirely dominated the aristocracy. CardinalMazarin was himself building upon a foundation that Cardinal Richelieu, thecontemporary of King James I of England, had prepared for him. After the time ofMazarin we hear of no great French nobles unless they are at court as courtservants and officials. They have been tamed—but at a price, the price ofthrowing the burthen of taxation upon the voiceless mass of the common people.From many taxes both the clergy and the nobility—everyone indeed who bore atitle—were exempt. In the end this injustice became intolerable, but for a whilethe French monarchy flourished like the Psalmist’s green bay tree. By theopening of the eighteenth century English writers are already calling attentionto the misery of the French lower classes and the comparative prosperity, atthat time, of the English poor.042 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_042_r1.gif]On such terms of unrighteousness what we may call “Grand Monarchy” establisheditself in France. Louis XIV, styled the Grand Monarque, reigned for theunparalleled length of seventy-two years (1643-1715), and set a pattern for allthe kings of Europe. At first he was guided by his Machiavellian minister,Cardinal Mazarin; after the death of the Cardinal he himself in his own properperson became the ideal “Prince.” He was, within his limitations, anexceptionally capable king; his ambition was stronger than his baser passions,and he guided his country towards bankruptcy, through the complication of aspirited foreign policy, with an elaborate dignity that still extorts ouradmiration. His immediate desire was to consolidate and extend France to theRhine and Pyrenees, and to absorb the Spanish Netherlands; his remoter view sawthe French kings as the possible successors of Charlemagne in a recast HolyRoman Empire. He made bribery a state method almost more important than warfare.Charles II of England was in his pay, and so were most of the Polish nobility,presently to be described. His money, or rather the money of the tax-payingclasses in France, went everywhere. But his prevailing occupation was splendour.His great palace at Versailles, with its salons, its corridors, its mirrors, itsterraces and fountains and parks and prospects, was the envy and admiration ofthe world. He provoked a universal imitation. Every king and princelet in Europewas building his own Versailles as much beyond his means as his subjects andcredits would permit. Everywhere the nobility rebuilt or extended their chateauxto the new pattern. A great industry of beautiful and elaborate fabrics andfurnishings developed. The luxurious arts flourished everywhere; sculpture inalabaster, faience, gilt woodwork, metal work, stamped leather, much music,magnificent painting, beautiful printing and bindings, fine cookery, finevintages. Amidst the mirrors and fine furniture went a strange race of“gentlemen” in vast powdered wigs, silks and laces, poised upon high red heels,supported by amazing canes; and still more wonderful “ladies,” under towers ofpowdered hair and wearing vast expansions of silk and satin sustained on wire.Through it all postured the great Louis, the sun of his world, unaware of themeagre and sulky and bitter faces that watched him from those lower darknessesto which his sunshine did not penetrate.We cannot give here at any length the story of the wars and doings of thismonarch. In many ways Voltaire’s Siècle de Louis XIV is still the best and mostwholesome account. He created a French navy fit to face the English and Dutch; avery considerable achievement. But because his intelligence did not rise abovethe lure of that Fata Morgana, that crack in the political wits of Europe, thedream of a world-wide Holy Roman Empire, he drifted in his later years to thepropitiation of the Papacy, which had hitherto been hostile to him. He sethimself against those spirits of independence and disunion, the Protestantprinces, and he made war against Protestantism in France. Great numbers of hismost sober and valuable subjects were driven abroad by his religiouspersecutions, taking arts and industries with them. The English silkmanufacture, for instance, was founded by French Protestants. Under his rulewere carried out the “dragonnades,” a peculiarly malignant and effectual form ofpersecution. Rough soldiers were quartered in the houses of the Protestants, andwere free to disorder the life of their hosts and insult their womankind as theythought, fit. Men yielded to that sort of pressure who would not have yielded torack and fire. The education of the next generation of Protestants was brokenup, and the parents had to give Catholic instruction or none. They gave it, nodoubt, with a sneer and an intonation that destroyed all faith in it. While moretolerant countries became mainly sincerely Catholic or sincerely Protestant, thepersecuting countries, like France and Spain and Italy, so destroyed honestProtestant teaching that these peoples became mainly Catholic believers orCatholic atheists, ready to break out into blank atheism whenever theopportunity offered. The next reign, that of Louis XV, was the age of thatsupreme mocker, Voltaire (1694-1778), an age in which everybody in Frenchsociety conformed to the Roman church and hardly anyone believed in it.It was part—and an excellent part—of the pose of Grand Monarchy to patronizeliterature and the sciences. Louis XIV set up an academy of sciences in rivalrywith the English Royal Society of Charles II and the similar association atFlorence. He decorated his court with poets, playwrights, philosophers, andscientific men. If the scientific process got little inspiration from thispatronage, it did at any rate acquire resources for experiment and publication,and a certain prestige in the eyes of the vulgar.Louis XV was the great-grandson of Louis XIV, and an incompetent imitator of hispredecessor’s magnificence. He posed as a king, but his ruling passion was thatcommon obsession of our kind, the pursuit of women, tempered by a superstitiousfear of hell. How such women as the Duchess of Châteauroux, Madame de Pompadour,and Madame du Barry dominated the pleasures of the king, and how wars andalliances were made, provinces devastated, thousands of people killed, becauseof the vanities and spites of these creatures, and how all the public life ofFrance and Europe was tainted with intrigue and prostitution and imposturebecause of them, the reader must learn from the memoirs of the time. Thespirited foreign policy went on steadily under Louis XV towards its final smash.043 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_043_r1.gif]In 1774 this Louis, Louis the Well-Beloved, as his flatterers called him, diedof smallpox, and was succeeded by his grandson, Louis XVI (1774-93), a dull,well-meaning man, an excellent shot, and an amateur locksmith of some ingenuity.Of how he came to follow Charles I to the scaffold we shall tell in a latersection. Our present concern is with Grand Monarchy in the days of its glory.Among the chief practitioners of Grand Monarchy outside France we may note firstthe Prussian kings, Frederick William I (1713-40), and his son and successor,Frederick II, Frederick the Great (1740-86). The story of the slow rise of theHohenzollern family, which ruled the kingdom of Prussia, from inconspicuousbeginnings is too tedious and unimportant for us to follow here. It is a storyof luck and violence, of bold claims and sudden betrayals. It is told with greatappreciation in Carlyle’s Frederick the Great. By the eighteenth century thePrussian kingdom was important enough to threaten the empire; it had a strong,well-drilled army, and its king was an attentive and worthy student ofMachiavelli. Frederick the Great perfected his Versailles at Potsdam. There thepark of Sans Souci, with its fountains, avenues, statuary, aped its model; therealso was the New Palace, a vast brick building erected at enormous expense, theOrangery in the Italian style, with a collection of pictures, a Marble Palace,and so on. Frederick carried culture to the pitch of authorship, andcorresponded with and entertained Voltaire, to their mutual exasperation.The Austrian dominions were kept too busy between the hammer of the French andthe anvil of the Turks to develop the real Grand Monarch style until the reignof Maria Theresa (who, being a woman, did not hear the title of Empress)(1740-80). Joseph II, who was Emperor from 1765-92, succeeded to her palaces in1780.With Peter the Great (1682-1725) the empire of Muscovy broke away from herTartar traditions and entered the sphere of French attraction. Peter shaved theOriental beards of his nobles and introduced Western costume. These were but theoutward and visible symbols of his westering tendencies. To release himself fromthe Asiatic feeling and traditions of Moscow, which, like Pekin, has a sacredinner city, the Kremlin, be built himself a new capital, Petrograd, upon theswamp of the Neva. And of course he built his Versailles, the Peterhof, abouteighteen miles from this new Paris, employing a French architect and having aterrace, fountains, cascades, picture gallery, park, and all the recognizedfeatures. His more distinguished successors were Elizabeth (1741-62) andCatherine the Great, a German princess, who, after obtaining the crown in soundOriental fashion through the murder of her husband, the legitimate Tsar,reverted to advanced Western ideals and ruled with great vigour from 1762 to1796. She set up an academy, and corresponded with Voltaire. And she lived towitness the end of the system of Grand Monarchy in Europe and the execution ofLouis XVI.We cannot even catalogue here the minor Grand Monarchs of the time in Florence(Tuscany) and Savoy and Saxony and Denmark and Sweden. Versailles, under a scoreof names, is starred in every volume of Bædeker, and the tourist gapes in theirpalaces. Nor can we deal with the war of the Spanish Succession. Spain,overstrained by the imperial enterprises of Charles V and Philip II, andenfeebled by a bigoted persecution of Protestants, Moslems, and Jews, wasthroughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries sinking down from hertemporary importance in European affairs to the level of a secondary poweragain.These European monarchs ruled their kingdoms as their noblemen ruled theirestates: they plotted against one another, they were politic and far-seeing inan unreal fashion, they made wars, they spent the substance of Europe uponabsurd “policies” of aggression and resistance. At last there burst upon them agreat storm out of the depths. That storm, the First French Revolution, theindignation of the common man in Europe, took their system unawares. It was butthe opening outbreak of a great cycle of political and social storms that stillcontinue, that will perhaps continue until every vestige of nationalist monarchyhas been swept out of the world and the skies clear again for the great peace ofthe federation of mankind.§ 6We have seen how the idea of a world-rule and a community of mankind first cameinto human affairs, and we have traced how the failure of the Christian churchesto sustain and establish those conceptions of its founder, led to a moralcollapse in political affairs and a reversion to egotism and want of faith. Wehave seen how Machiavellian monarchy set itself up against the spirit ofbrotherhood in Christendom, and how Machiavellian monarchy developed throughouta large part of Europe into the Grand Monarchies and Parliamentary Monarchies ofthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. But the mind and imagination of man isincessantly active, and beneath the sway of the grand monarchs, a complex ofnotions and traditions was being woven as a net is woven, to catch and entanglemen’s minds, the conception of international politics not as a matter ofdealings between princes, but as a matter of dealings between a kind of immortalBeings, the Powers. The Princes came and went; a Louis XIV would be followed bya petticoat-hunting Louis XV, and he again by that dull-witted amateurlocksmith, Louis XVI. Peter the Great gave place to a succession of empresses;the chief continuity of the Habsburgs after Charles V, either in Austria orSpain, was a continuity of thick lips, clumsy chins, and superstition; theamiable scoundrelism of a Charles II would make a mock of his own pretensions.But what remained much more steadfast were the secretariats of the foreignministries and the ideas of people who wrote of state concerns. The ministersmaintained a continuity of policy during the “off days” of their monarchs, andbetween one monarch and another.So we find that the prince gradually became less important in men’s minds thanthe “Power” of which he was the head. We begin to read less and less of theschemes and ambitions of King This or That, and more of the “Designs of France”or the “Ambitions of Prussia.” In an age when religious faith was declining, wefind men displaying a new and vivid belief in the reality of thesepersonifications. These vast vague phantoms, the “Powers,” crept insensibly intoEuropean political thought, until in the later eighteenth and in the nineteenthcenturies they dominated it entirely. To this day they dominate it. Europeanlife remained nominally Christian, but to worship one God in spirit and in truthis to belong to one community with all one’s fellow worshippers. In practicalreality Europe does not do this, she has given herself up altogether to theworship of this strange state mythology. To these sovereign deities, to theunity of “Italy,” to the hegemony of “Prussia,” to the glory of “France,” andthe destinies of “Russia,” she has sacrificed many generations of possibleunity, peace, and prosperity and the lives of millions of men.To regard a tribe or a state as a sort of personality is a very old dispositionof the human mind. The Bible abounds in such personifications. Judah, Edom,Moab, Assyria, figure in the Hebrew Scriptures as if they were individuals; itis sometimes impossible to say whether the Hebrew writer is dealing with aperson or with a nation. It is manifestly a primitive and natural tendency. Butin the case of modern Europe it is a retrocession. Europe, under the idea ofChristendom, had gone far towards unification. And while such tribal persons as“Israel” or “Tyre” did represent a certain community of blood, a certainuniformity of type, and a homogeneity of interest, the European powers whicharose in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were entirely fictitiousunities. Russia was in truth an assembly of the most incongruous elements,Cossacks, Tartars, Ukrainians, Muscovites, and, after the time of Peter,Esthonians and Lithuanians; the France of Louis XV comprehended German Alsaceand freshly assimilated regions of Burgundy; it was a prison of suppressedHuguenots and a sweating-house for peasants. In “Britain,” England carried onher back the Hanoverian dominions in Germany, Scotland, the profoundly alienWelsh and the hostile and Catholic Irish. Such powers as Sweden, Prussia, andstill more so Poland and Austria, if we watch them in a series of historicalmaps, contract, expand, thrust out extensions, and wander over the map of Europeas amœbæ do under the microscope. . . .If we consider the psychology of international relationship as we see itmanifested in the world about us, and as it is shown by the development of the“Power” idea in modern Europe, we shall realize certain historically veryimportant facts about the nature of man. Aristotle said that man is a politicalanimal, but in our modern sense of the word politics, which now coversworld-politics, he is nothing of the sort. He has still the instincts of thefamily tribe, and beyond that he has a disposition to attach himself and hisfamily to something larger, to a tribe, a city, a nation, or a state. But thatdisposition, left to itself, is a vague and very uncritical disposition. Ifanything, he is inclined to fear and dislike criticism of this something largerthat encloses his life and to which he has given himself, and to avoid suchcriticism. Perhaps he has a subconscious fear of the isolation that may ensue ifthe system is broken or discredited. He takes the milieu in which he findshimself for granted; he accepts his city or his government, just as he acceptsthe nose or the digestion which fortune has bestowed upon him. But men’sloyalties, the sides they take in political things, are not innate, they areeducational results. For most men their education in these matters is thesilent, continuous education of things about them. Men find themselves a part ofMerry England or Holy Russia; they grow up into these devotions; they acceptthem as a part of their nature.It is only slowly that the world is beginning to realize how profoundly thetacit education of circumstances can be supplemented, modified, or corrected bypositive teaching, by literature, discussion, and properly criticizedexperience. The real life of the ordinary man is his everyday life, his littlecircle of affections, fears, hungers, lusts, and imaginative impulses. It isonly when his attention is directed to political affairs as something vitallyaffecting this personal circle, that he brings his reluctant mind to bear uponthem. It is scarcely too much to say that the ordinary man thinks as littleabout political matters as he can, and stops thinking about them as soon aspossible. It is still only very curious and exceptional minds, or minds thathave by example or good education acquired the scientific habit of wanting toknow why, or minds shocked and distressed by some public catastrophe and rousedto wide apprehensions of danger, that will not accept governments andinstitutions, however preposterous, that do not directly annoy them, assatisfactory. The ordinary human being, until he is so aroused, will acquiescein any collective activities that are going on in this world in which he findshimself, and any phrasing or symbolization that meets his vague need forsomething greater to which his personal affairs, his individual circle, can beanchored.If we keep these manifest limitations of our nature in mind, it no longerbecomes a mystery how, as the idea of Christianity as a world brotherhood of mensank into discredit because of its fatal entanglement with priestcraft and thePapacy on the one hand and with the authority of princes on the other, and theage of faith passed into our present age of doubt and disbelief, men shifted thereference of their lives from the kingdom of God and the brotherhood of mankindto these apparently more living realities, France and England, Holy Russia,Spain, Prussia, which were at least embodied in active courts, which maintainedlaws, exerted power through armies and navies, waved flags with a compellingsolemnity, and were self-assertive and insatiably greedy in an entirely humanand understandable fashion. Certainly such men as Cardinal Richelieu andCardinal Mazarin thought of themselves as serving greater ends than their own ortheir monarch’s; they served the quasi-divine France of their imaginations. Andas certainly these habits of mind percolated down from them to theirsubordinates and to the general body of the population. In the thirteenth andfourteenth centuries the general population of Europe was religious and onlyvaguely patriotic; by the nineteenth it had become wholly patriotic. In acrowded English or French or German railway carriage of the later nineteenthcentury it would have aroused far less hostility to have jeered at God than tohave jeered at one of those strange beings, England or France or Germany. Tothese things men’s minds clung, and they clung to them because in all the worldthere appeared nothing else so satisfying to cling to. They were the real andliving gods of Europe.This idealization of governments and foreign offices, this mythology of “Powers”and their loves and hates and conflicts, has so obsessed the imaginations ofEurope and Western Asia as to provide it with its “forms of thought.” Nearly allthe histories, nearly all the political literature of the last two centuries inEurope, have been written in its phraseology. Yet a time is coming when aclear-sighted generation will read with perplexity how in the community ofwestern Europe, consisting everywhere of very slight variations of a commonracial mixture of Nordic and Iberian peoples and immigrant Semitic and Mongolianelements, speaking nearly everywhere modifications of the same Aryan speech,having a common past in the Roman Empire, common religious forms, common socialusages, and a common art and science, and intermarrying so freely that no onecould tell with certainty the “nationality” of any of his great-grandchildren,men could be moved to the wildest excitement upon the question of the ascendancyof “France,” the rise and unification of “Germany,” the rival claims of “Russia”and “Greece” to possess Constantinople. These conflicts will seem then asreasonless and insane as those dead, now incomprehensible feuds of the “greens”and “blues” that once filled the streets of Byzantium with shouting andbloodshed.Tremendously as these phantoms, the Powers, rule our minds and lives today, theyare, as this history shows clearly, things only of the last few centuries, amere hour, an incidental phase, in the vast deliberate history of our kind. Theymark a phase of relapse, a backwater, as the rise of Machiavellian monarchymarks a backwater; they are part of the same eddy of faltering faith, in aprocess altogether greater and altogether different in its general tendency, theprocess of the moral and intellectual reunion of mankind. For a time men haverelapsed upon these national or imperial gods of theirs; it is but for a time.The idea of the world state, the universal kingdom of righteousness of whichevery living soul shall be a citizen, was already in the world two thousandyears ago never more to leave it. Men know that it is present even when theyrefuse to recognize it. In the writings and talk of men about internationalaffairs today, in the current discussions of historians and politicaljournalists, there is an effect of drunken men growing sober, and terriblyafraid of growing sober. They still talk loudly of their “love” for France, oftheir “hatred” of Germany, of the “traditional ascendancy of Britain at sea,”and so on and so on, like those who sing of their cups in spite of the steadfastonset of sobriety and a headache. These are dead gods they serve. By sea or landmen want no Powers ascendant, but only law and service. That silent unavoidablechallenge is in all our minds like dawn breaking slowly, shining between theshutters of a disordered room.§ 7The seventeenth century in Europe was the century of Louis XIV; he and Frenchascendancy and Versailles are the central motif of the story. The eighteenthcentury was equally the century of the “rise of Prussia as a great power,” andthe chief figure in the story is Frederick II, Frederick the Great. Interwovenwith his history is the story of Poland.The condition of affairs in Poland was peculiar. Unlike its three neighbours,Prussia, Russia, and the Austro-Hungarian monarchy of the Habsburgs, Poland hadnot developed a Grand Monarchy. Its system of government may be best describedas republican with a king, an elected life-president. Each king was separatelyelected. It was in fact rather more republican than Britain, but itsrepublicanism was more aristocratic in form. Poland had little trade and fewmanufactures; she was agricultural and still with great areas of grazing,forest, and waste; she was a poor country, and her landowners were pooraristocrats. The mass of her population was a downtrodden and savagely ignorantpeasantry, and she also harboured great masses of very poor Jews. She hadremained Catholic. She was, so to speak, a poor Catholic inland Britain,entirely surrounded by enemies instead of by the sea. She had no definiteboundaries at all, neither sea nor mountain. And it added to her misfortunesthat some of her elected kings had been brilliant and aggressive rulers.Eastward her power extended weakly into regions inhabited almost entirely byRussians; westward she overlapped a German subject population.Because she had no great trade, she had no great towns to compare with those ofwestern Europe, and no vigorous universities to hold her mind together. Hernoble class lived on their estates, without much intellectual intercourse. Theywere patriotic, they had an aristocratic sense of freedom—which was entirelycompatible with the systematic impoverishment of their serfs—but theirpatriotism and freedom were incapable of effective cooperation. While warfarewas a matter of levies of men and horses, Poland was a comparatively strongpower; but it was quite unable to keep pace with the development of military artthat was making standing forces of professional soldiers the necessary weapon inwarfare. Yet divided and disabled as she was, she could yet count some notablevictories to her credit. The last Turkish attack upon Vienna (1683) was defeatedby the Polish cavalry under King John Sobiesky, King John III. (This sameSobiesky, before he was elected king, had been in the pay of Louis XIV, and hadalso fought for the Swedes against his native country.) Needless to say, thisweak aristocratic republic, with its recurrent royal elections, invitedaggression from all three of its neighbours. “Foreign money,” and every sort ofexterior interference, came into the country at each election. And like theGreeks of old, every disgruntled Polish patriot flew off to some foreign enemyto wreak his indignation upon his ungrateful country.Even when the King of Poland was elected, he had very little power because ofthe mutual jealousy of the nobles. Like the English peers, they preferred aforeigner, and for much the same reason, because he had no roots of power in theland; but, unlike the British, their own government had not the solidarity whichthe periodic assembling of Parliament in London, the “coming up to town,” gavethe British peers. In London there was “Society,” a continuous intermingling ofinfluential persons and ideas. Poland had no London and no “Society.” Sopractically Poland had no central government at all. The King of Poland couldnot make war nor peace, levy a tax nor alter the law, without the consent of theDiet, and any single member of the Diet had the power of putting a veto upon anyproposal before it. He had merely to rise and say, “I disapprove,” and thematter dropped. He could even carry his free veto, his liberum veto, further. Hecould object to the assembly of the Diet, and the Diet was thereby dissolved.Poland was not simply a crowned aristocratic republic like the British, it was aparalyzed crowned aristocratic republic.044 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_044_r1.gif]To Frederick the Great the existence of Poland was particularly provocativebecause of the way in which an arm of Poland reached out to the Baltic atDantzig and separated his ancestral dominions in East Prussia from histerritories within the empire. It was he who incited Catherine the Second ofRussia and Maria Theresa of Austria, whose respect he had earned by deprivingher of Silesia, to a joint attack upon Poland.Let four maps of Poland tell the tale.After this first outrage of 1772 Poland underwent a great change of heart.Poland was indeed born as a nation on the eve of her dissolution. There was ahasty but very considerable development of education, literature, and art;historians and poets sprang up, and the impossible constitution that had madePoland impotent was swept aside. The free veto was abolished, the crown was madehereditary to save Poland from the foreign intrigues that attended everyelection, and a Parliament in imitation of the British was set up. There were,however, lovers of the old order in Poland who resented these necessary changes,and these obstructives were naturally supported by Prussia and Russia, whowanted no Polish revival. Came the second partition, and, after a fiercepatriotic struggle that began in the region annexed by Prussia and found aleader and national hero in Kosciusko, the final obliteration of Poland from themap. So for a time ended this Parliamentary threat to Grand Monarchy in EasternEurope. But the patriotism of the Poles grew stronger and clearer withsuppression. For a hundred and twenty years Poland struggled like a submergedcreature beneath the political and military net that held her down. She roseagain in 1918, at the end of the Great War.§ 8We have given some account of the ascendancy of France in Europe, the swiftdecay of the sappy growth of Spanish power and its separation from Austria, andthe rise of Prussia. So far as Portugal, Spain, France, Britain, and Hollandwere concerned, their competition for ascendancy in Europe was extended andcomplicated by a struggle for dominion overseas.The discovery of the huge continent of America, thinly inhabited, undeveloped,and admirably adapted for European settlement and exploitation, the simultaneousdiscovery of great areas of unworked country south of the torrid equatorialregions of Africa that had hitherto limited European knowledge, and the gradualrealization of vast island regions in the Eastern seas, as yet untouched byWestern civilization, was a presentation of opportunity to mankind unprecedentedin all history. It was as if the peoples of Europe had come into some splendidlegacy. Their world had suddenly quadrupled. There was more than enough for all;they had only to take these lands and continue to do well by them, and theircrowded poverty would vanish like a dream. And they received this gloriouslegacy like ill-bred heirs; it meant no more to them than a fresh occasion foratrocious disputes. But what community of human beings has ever yet preferredcreation to conspiracy? What nation in all our story has ever worked withanother when, at any cost to itself, it could contrive to do that other aninjury? The Powers of Europe began by a frantic “claiming” of the new realms.They went on to exhausting conflicts. Spain, who claimed first and most, and whowas for a time “mistress” of two-thirds of America, made no better use of herpossession than to bleed herself nearly to death therein.We have told how the Papacy in its last assertion of world dominion, instead ofmaintaining the common duty of all Christendom to make a great commoncivilization in the new lands, divided the American continent, between Spain andPortugal. This naturally roused the hostility of the excluded nations. Theseamen of England showed no respect for either claim, and set themselvesparticularly against the Spanish; the Swedes turned their Protestantism to asimilar account. The Hollanders, so soon as they had shaken off their Spanishmasters, also set their sails westward to flout the Pope and share in the goodthings of the new world. His Most Catholic Majesty of France hesitated as littleas any Protestant. All these powers were soon busy staking out claims in NorthAmerica and the West Indies.Neither the Danish kingdom (which at that time included Norway and Iceland) northe Swedes secured very much in the scramble. The Danes annexed some of the WestIndian islands. Sweden got nothing. Both Denmark and Sweden at this time weredeep in the affairs of Germany. We have already named Gustavus Adolphus, theProtestant “Lion of the North,” and mentioned his campaigns in Germany, Poland,and Russia. These Eastern European regions are great absorbents of energy, andthe strength that, might have given Sweden a large share in the new world reapeda barren harvest of glory in Europe. Such small settlements as the Swedes madein America presently fell to the Dutch.The Hollanders, too, with the French monarchy under Cardinal Richelieu and underLouis XIV eating its way across the Spanish Netherlands towards their frontier,had not the undistracted resources that Britain, behind her “silver streak” ofsea, could put into overseas adventures.Moreover, the absolutist efforts of James I and Charles I, and the restorationof Charles II, had the effect of driving out from England a great number ofsturdy-minded, republican-spirited Protestants, men of substance and character,who set up in America, and particularly in New England, out of reach, as theysupposed, of the king and his taxes. The Mayflower was only one of the pioneervessels of a stream of emigrants. It was the luck of Britain that they remained,though dissentient in spirit, under the British flag. The Dutch never sent outsettlers of the same quantity and quality, first because their Spanish rulerswould not let them, and then because they had got possession of their owncountry. And though there was a great emigration of Protestant Huguenots fromthe dragonnades and persecution of Louis XIV, they had Holland and England closeat hand as refuges, and their industry, skill, and sobriety went mainly tostrengthen those countries, and particularly England. A few of them foundedsettlements in Carolina, but these did not remain French; they fell first to theSpanish and finally to the English.The Dutch settlements, with the Swedish, also succumbed to Britain; NieuwAmsterdam became British in 1674, and its name was changed to New York, as thereader may learn very cheerfully in Washington Irving’s Knickerbocker’s Historyof New York. The state of affairs in North America in 1750 is indicated veryclearly by a map we have adapted from one in Robinson’s Medieval and ModernTimes. The British power was established along the east coast from Savannah tothe St. Lawrence River, and Newfoundland and considerable northern areas, theHudson Bay Company territories, had been acquired by treaty from the French. TheBritish occupied Barbados (almost our oldest possession) in 1605, and acquiredJamaica, the Bahamas, and British Honduras from the Spaniards. But France waspursuing a very dangerous and alarming game, a game even more dangerous andalarming on the map than in reality. She had made real settlements in Quebec andMontreal to the north and at New Orleans in the south, and her explorers andagents had pushed south and north, making treaties with the American Indians ofthe great plains and setting up claims—without setting up towns—right across thecontinent behind the British. But the realities of the case are not adequatelyrepresented in this way. The British colonies were being very solidly settled bya good class of people; they already numbered a population of over a million;the French at that time hardly counted a tenth of that. They had a number ofbrilliant travellers and missionaries at work, but no substance of populationbehind them.Many old maps of America in this period are still to be found, maps designed toscare and “rouse” the British to a sense of the “designs of France” in America.War broke out in 1754, and in 1759 the British and Colonial forces under GeneralWolfe took Quebec and completed the conquest of Canada in the next year. In 1763Canada was finally ceded to Britain. (But the western part of the ratherindefinite region of Louisiana in the south, named after Louis XIV, remainedoutside the British sphere. It was taken over by Spain; and in 1800 it wasrecovered by France. Finally, in 1803, it was bought from France by the UnitedStates government.) In this Canadian war the American colonists gained aconsiderable experience of the military art, and a knowledge of British militaryorganization that was to be of great use to them a little later.045 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_045_r1.gif]§ 9It was not only in America that the French and British powers clashed. Thecondition of India at this time was one very interesting and attractive toEuropean adventurers. The great Mongol Empire of Baber, Akbar, and Aurangzeb wasnow far gone in decay. What had happened to India was very parallel to what hadhappened to Germany. The Great Mogul at Delhi in India, like the Holy RomanEmperor in Germany, was still legally overlord, but after the death of Aurangzebhe exerted only a nominal authority except in the immediate neighbourhood of hiscapital. In the south-west a Hindu people, the Mahrattas, had risen againstIslam, restored Brahminism as the ruling religion, and for a time extended theirpower over the whole southern triangle of India. In Rajputana also the rule ofIslam was replaced by Brahminism, and at Bhurtpur and Jaipur there ruledpowerful Rajput princes. In Oudh there was a Shiite kingdom, with its capital atLucknow, and Bengal was also a separate (Moslem) kingdom. Away in the Punjab tothe north had arisen a very interesting religious body, the Sikhs, proclaimingthe universal rule of one God and assailing both the Hindu Vedas and the MoslemKoran. Originally a pacific sect, the Sikhs presently followed the example ofIslam, and sought—at first very disastrously to themselves—to establish thekingdom of God by the sword. And into this confused and disordered India therepresently (1738) came an invader from the north, Nadir Shah (1736-47), theTurcoman ruler of Persia, who swept down through the Kyber pass, broke everyarmy that stood in his way, and captured and sacked Delhi, carrying off anenormous booty. He left the north of India go utterly broken, that in the nexttwenty years there were no less than six other successful plundering raids intoNorth India from Afghanistan, which had become an independent state at the deathof Nadir Shah. For a time Mahrattas fought with Afghans for the rule of NorthIndia; then the Mahratta power broke up into a series of principalities, Indore,Gwalior, Baroda, and others. . . .This was the India into which the French and English were thrusting during theeighteenth century. A succession of other European powers had been strugglingfor a commercial and political footing in India and the east ever since Vasco daGama had made his memorable voyage round the Cape to Calicut. The sea trade ofIndia had previously been in the hands of the Red Sea Arabs, and the Portuguesewon it from them in a series of sea fights. The Portuguese ships were thebigger, and carried a heavier armament. For a time the Portuguese held theIndian trade as their own, and Lisbon outshone Venice as a mart for orientalspices; the seventeenth century, however, saw the Dutch grasping at thismonopoly. At the crest of their power the Dutch had settlements at the Cape ofGood Hope, they held Mauritius, they had two establishments in Persia, twelve inIndia, six in Ceylon, and all over the East Indies they had dotted theirfortified stations. But their selfish resolution to exclude traders of any otherEuropean nationality forced the Swedes, Danes, French, and English into hostilecompetition. The first effectual blows at their overseas monopoly were struck inEuropean waters by the victories of Blake, the English republican admiral; andby the opening of the eighteenth century both the English and French were invigorous competition with the Dutch for trade and privileges throughout India.At Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta the English established their headquarters;Pondicherry and Chandernagore were the chief French settlements.At first all these European powers came merely as traders, and the onlyestablishments they attempted were warehouses; but the unsettled state of thecountry, and the unscrupulous methods of their rivals, made it natural for themto fortify and arm their settlements, and this armament made them attractiveallies of the various warring princes who now divided India. And it was entirelyin the spirit of the new European nationalist politics that when the French tookone side, the British should take another. The great leader upon the Englishside was Robert Clive, who was born in 1725, and went to India in 1743. Hischief antagonist was Dupleix. The story of this struggle throughout the firsthalf of the eighteenth century is too long and intricate to be told here. By1761 the British found themselves completely dominant in the Indian peninsula.At Plassey (1757) and at Buxar (1764) their armies gained striking andconclusive victories over the army of Bengal and the army of Oudh. The GreatMogul, nominally their overlord, became in effect their puppet. They leviedtaxes over great areas; they exacted indemnities for real or fancied opposition.046 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_046_r1.gif]These successes were not gained directly by the forces of the King of England;they were gained by the East India Trading Company, which had been originally atthe time of its incorporation under Queen Elizabeth no more than a company ofsea adventurers. Step by step they had been forced to raise troops and arm theirships. And now this trading company, with its tradition of gain, found itselfdealing not merely in spices and dyes and tea and jewels, but in the revenuesand territories of princes and the destinies of India. It had come to buy andsell, and it found itself achieving a tremendous piracy. There was no one tochallenge its proceedings. Is it any wonder that its captains and commanders andofficials, nay, even its clerks and common soldiers, came back to England loadedwith spoils? Men under such circumstances, with a great and wealthy land attheir mercy, could not determine what they might or might not do. It was astrange land to them, with a strange sunlight; its brown people were a differentrace, outside their range of sympathy; its temples and buildings seemed tosustain fantastic standards of behaviour. Englishmen at home were perplexed whenpresently these generals and officials came back to make dark accusationsagainst each other of extortions and cruelties. Upon Clive Parliament passed avote of censure. He committed suicide in 1774. In 1788 Warren Hastings, a secondgreat Indian administrator, was impeached and acquitted (1792). It was a strangeand unprecedented situation in the world’s history. The English Parliament founditself ruling over a London trading company, which in its turn was dominating anempire far greater and more populous than all the domains of the British crown.To the bulk of the English people India was a remote, fantastic, almostinaccessible land, to which adventurous poor young men went out, to return aftermany years very rich and very choleric old gentlemen. It was difficult for theEnglish to conceive what the life of these countless brown millions in theeastern sunshine could be. Their imaginations declined the task. India remainedromantically unreal. It was impossible for the English, therefore, to exert anyeffective supervision and control over the company’s proceedings.§ 10And while the great peninsula of the south of Asia was thus falling under thedominion of the English sea traders, an equally remarkable reaction of Europeupon Asia was going on in the north. We have told in Chap. V, § 5c, how theChristian states of Russia recovered their independence from the Golden Horde,and how the Tsar of Moscow became master of the republic of Novgorod; and in § 5of this chapter we have told of Peter the Great joining the circle of GrandMonarchs and, as it were, dragging Russia into Europe. The rise of this greatcentral power of the old world, which is neither altogether of the East noraltogether of the West, is one of the utmost importance to our human destiny. Wehave also told in the same chapter of the appearance of a Christian steppepeople, the Cossacks, who formed a barrier between the feudal agriculture ofPoland and Hungary to the west and the Tartar to the east. The Cossacks were thewild east of Europe, and in many ways not unlike the wild west of the UnitedStates in the middle nineteenth century. All who had made Russia too hot to holdthem, criminals as well as the persecuted innocent, rebellious serfs, religioussectaries, thieves, vagabonds, murderers, sought asylum in the southern steppes,and there made a fresh start and fought for life and freedom against Pole,Russian, and Tartar alike. Doubtless fugitives from the Tartars to the east alsocontributed to the Cossack mixture. Chief among these new nomad tribes were theUkraine Cossacks on the Dnieper and the Don Cossacks on the Don. Slowly theseborder folk were incorporated in the Russian imperial service, much as theHighland clans of Scotland were converted into regiments by the Britishgovernment. New lands were offered them in Asia. They became a weapon againstthe dwindling power of the Mongolian nomads, first in Turkestan and then acrossSiberia as far as the Amur.The decay of Mongol energy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is verydifficult to explain. Within two or three centuries from the days of Jengis andTimurlane, central Asia had relapsed from a period of world ascendancy toextreme political impotence. Changes of climate, unrecorded pestilences,infections of a malarial type, may have played their part in thisrecession—which may be only a temporary recession measured by the scale ofuniversal history—of the Central Asian peoples. Some authorities think that thespread of Buddhist teaching from China also had a pacifying influence upon them.At any rate, by the sixteenth century the Mongol Tartar and Turkish peoples wereno longer pressing outward, but were being invaded, subjugated, and pushed backboth by Christian Russia in the west and by China in the east.047 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_047_r1.gif]All through the seventeenth century the Cossacks were spreading eastward fromEuropean Russia, and settling wherever they found agricultural conditions.Cordons of forts and stations formed a moving frontier to these settlements tothe south, where the Turkomans were still strong and active; to the northeast,however, Russia had no frontier until she reached right to the Pacific. . . .At the same time China was in a phase of expansion. In 1644 the Ming Dynasty, ina state of artistic decay and greatly weakened by a Japanese invasion, fell toManchu conquerors, a people apparently identical with the former Kin Dynasty,which had ruled at Pekin over North China until the days of Jengis. It was theManchus who imposed the pigtail as a mark of political loyalty upon the Chinesepopulation. They brought a new energy into Chinese affairs, and their northerninterests led to a considerable northward expansion of the Chinese civilizationand influence into Manchuria and Mongolia. So it was that by the middle of theeighteenth century the Russians and Chinese were in contact in Mongolia. At thisperiod China ruled eastern Turkestan, Tibet, Nepal, Burmah, and Annam. . . .We have mentioned a Japanese invasion of China (or rather of Korea). Except forthis aggression upon China, Japan plays no part in our history before thenineteenth century. Like China under the Mings, Japan had set her faceresolutely against the interference of foreigners in her affairs. She was acountry leading her own civilized life, magically sealed against intruders. Wehave told little of her hitherto because there was little to tell. Herpicturesque and romantic history stands apart from the general drama of humanaffairs. Her population was chiefly a Mongolian population, with some veryinteresting white people of a Nordic type, the Hairy Ainu, in the northernislands. Her civilization seems to have been derived almost entirely from Koreaand China; her art is a special development of Chinese art, her writing anadaptation of the Chinese script.§ 11In these preceding ten sections we have been dealing with an age of division, ofseparated nationalities. We have already described this period of theseventeenth and eighteenth centuries as an interregnum in the progress ofmankind towards a world- wide unity. Throughout this period there was no rulingunifying idea in men’s minds. The impulse of the empire had failed until theEmperor was no more than one of a number of competing princes, and the dream ofChristendom also was a fading dream. The developing “powers” jostled one anotherthroughout the world; but for a time it seemed that they might jostle oneanother indefinitely without any great catastrophe to mankind. The greatgeographical discoveries of the sixteenth century had so enlarged humanresources that, for all their divisions, for all the waste of their wars andpolicies, the people of Europe enjoyed a considerable and increasing prosperity.Central Europe recovered steadily from the devastation of the Thirty Years’ War.Looking back upon this period, which came to its climax in the eighteenthcentury, looking back, as we can begin to do nowadays, and seeing its events inrelation to the centuries that came before it and to the great movements of thepresent time, we are able to realize how transitory and provisional were itspolitical forms and how unstable its securities. Provisional it was as no otherage has been provisional, an age of assimilation and recuperation, a politicalpause, a gathering up of the ideas of men and the resources of science for awider human effort. But the contemporary mind did not see it in that light. Thefailure of the great creative ideas as they had been formulated in the MiddleAges had left human thought for a time destitute of the guidance of creativeideas; even educated and imaginative men saw the world undramatically; no longeras an interplay of effort and destiny, but as the scene in which a tritehappiness was sought and the milder virtues were rewarded. It was not simply thecontented and conservative-minded who, in a world of rapid changes, were underthe sway of this assurance of an achieved fixity of human conditions. Evenhighly critical and insurgent intelligences, in default of any sustainingmovements in the soul of the community, betrayed the same disposition. Politicallife, they felt, had ceased to be the urgent and tragic thing it had once been;it had become a polite comedy. The eighteenth was a century of comedy—which atthe end grew grim. It is inconceivable that that world of the middle eighteenthcentury could have produced a Jesus of Nazareth, a Gautama, a Francis of Assisi,an Ignatius of Loyola. If one may imagine an eighteenth-century John Huss, it isimpossible to imagine anyone with sufficient passion to burn him. Until thestirrings of conscience in Britain that developed into the Methodist revivalbegan, we can detect scarcely a suspicion that there still remained great tasksin hand for our race to do, that enormous disturbances were close at hand, orthat the path of man through space and time was dark with countless dangers, andmust to the end remain a high and terrible enterprise.We have quoted again and again in this history from Gibbon’s Decline and Fall ofthe Roman Empire. Now we shall quote from it for the last time and bid itfarewell, for we have come to the age in which it was written. Gibbon was bornin 1737, and the last volume of his history was published in 1787, but thepassage we shall quote was probably written in the year 1780. Gibbon was a youngman of delicate health and fairly good fortune; he had a partial and interruptededucation at Oxford, and then he completed his studies in Geneva; on the wholehis outlook was French and cosmopolitan rather than British, and he was muchunder the intellectual influence of that great Frenchman who is best known underthe name of Voltaire (François Marie Arouet de Voltaire, 1694-1778). Voltairewas an author of enormous industry; seventy volumes of him adorn the presentwriter’s shelves, and another edition of Voltaire’s works runs to ninety-four;he dealt largely with history and public affairs, and he corresponded withCatherine the Great of Russia, Frederick the Great of Prussia, Louis XV, andmost of the prominent people of the time. Both Voltaire and Gibbon had the senseof history strong in them; both have set out very plainly and fully theirvisions of human life; and it is clear that to both of them the system in whichthey lived, the system of monarchy, of leisurely and privileged gentlefolks, ofrather despised industrial and trading people and of downtrodden and negligiblelabourers and poor and common people, seemed the most stably established way ofliving that the world has ever seen. They postured a little as republicans, andsneered at the divine pretensions of monarchy; but the republicanism thatappealed to Voltaire was the crowned republicanism of the Britain of those days,in which the king was simply the official head, the first and greatest of thegentlemen.The ideal they sustained was the ideal of a polite and polished world in whichmen—men of quality, that is, for no others counted—would be ashamed to be cruelor gross or enthusiastic, in which the appointments of life would be spaciousand elegant, and the fear of ridicule the potent auxiliary of the law inmaintaining the decorum and harmonies of life. Voltaire had in him thepossibility of a passionate hatred of injustice, and his interventions on behalfof persecuted or ill-used men are the high lights of his long and complicatedlife-story. And this being the mental disposition of Gibbon and Voltaire, and ofthe age in which they lived, it is natural that they should find the existenceof religion in the world, and in particular the existence of Christianity, aperplexing and rather unaccountable phenomenon. The whole of that side of lifeseemed to them a kind of craziness in the human make-up. Gibbon’s great historyis essentially an attack upon Christianity as the operating cause of the declineand fall. He idealized the crude and gross plutocracy of Rome into a world offine gentlemen upon the eighteenth-century model, and told how it fell beforethe Barbarian from without because of the decay through Christianity within. Inour history here we have tried to set that story in a better light. To Voltaireofficial Christianity was “l’infâme”; something that limited people’s lives,interfered with their thoughts, persecuted harmless dissentients. And indeed inthat period of the interregnum there was very little life or light in either theorthodox Christianity of Rome or in the orthodox tame churches of Russia and ofthe Protestant princes. In an interregnum incommoded with an abundance of sleekparsons and sly priests it was hard to realize what fires had once blazed in theheart of Christianity, and what fires of political and religious passion mightstill blaze in the hearts of men.At the end of his third volume Gibbon completed his account of the breaking upof the Western Empire. He then raised the question whether civilization mightever undergo again a similar collapse. This led him to review the existing stateof affairs (1780) and to compare it with the state of affairs during the declineof imperial Rome. It will be very convenient to our general design to quote somepassages from that comparison here, for nothing could better illustrate thestate of mind of the liberal thinkers of Europe at the crest of the politicalinterregnum of the age of the Great Powers, before the first intimations ofthose profound political and social forces of disintegration that have producedat length the dramatic interrogations of our own times.“This awful revolution,” wrote Gibbon of the Western collapse, “may be usefullyapplied to the useful instruction of the present age. It is the duty of apatriot to prefer and promote the exclusive interest and glory of his nativecountry; but a philosopher may be permitted to enlarge his views, and toconsider Europe as one great republic, whose various inhabitants have attainedalmost the same level of politeness and cultivation. The balance of power willcontinue to fluctuate, and the prosperity of our own or the neighbouringkingdoms may be alternately exalted or depressed; but these partial eventscannot essentially injure our general state of happiness, the system of arts,and laws, and manners, which so advantageously distinguish, above the rest ofmankind, the Europeans and their colonies. The savage nations of the globe arethe common enemies of civilized society; and we may enquire with anxiouscuriosity whether Europe is still threatened with a repetition of thosecalamities which formerly oppressed the arms and institutions of Rome. Perhapsthe same reflections will illustrate the fall of that mighty empire and explainthe probable causes of our actual security.“The Romans were ignorant of the extent of their danger, and the number of theirenemies. Beyond the Rhine and Danube, the northern countries of Europe and Asiawere filled with innumerable tribes of hunters and shepherds, poor, voracious,and turbulent; bold in arms, and impatient to ravish the fruits of industry. TheBarbarian world was agitated by the rapid impulse of war; and the peace of Gaulor Italy was shaken by the distant revolutions of China. The Huns, who fledbefore a victorious enemy, directed their march towards the west; and thetorrent was swelled by the gradual accession of captives and allies. The flyingtribes who yielded to the Huns assumed in their turn the spirit of conquest; theendless column of barbarians pressed on the Roman Empire with accumulated weightand, if the foremost were destroyed, the vacant space was instantly replenishedby new assailants. Such formidable emigrations can no longer issue from theNorth; and the long repose, which has been imputed to the decrease ofpopulation, is the happy consequence of the progress of arts and agriculture.Instead of some rude villages, thinly scattered among its woods and morasses,Germany now produces a list of two thousand three hundred walled towns; theChristian kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Poland have been successivelyestablished; and the Hanse merchants, with the Teutonic knights, have extendedtheir colonies along the coast of the Baltic, as far as the Gulf of Finland.From the Gulf of Finland to the Eastern Ocean, Russia now assumes the form of apowerful and civilized empire. The plough, the loom, and the forge areintroduced on the banks of the Volga, the Oby, and the Lena; and the fiercest ofthe Tartar hordes have been taught to tremble and obey. . . .“The Empire of Rome was firmly established by the singular and perfect coalitionof its members. . . . But this union was purchased by the loss of nationalfreedom and military spirit; and the servile provinces, destitute of life andmotion, expected their safety from the mercenary troops and governors, who weredirected by the orders of a distant court. The happiness of a hundred millionsdepended on the personal merit of one or two men, perhaps children, whose mindswere corrupted by education, luxury, and despotic power. Europe is now dividedinto twelve powerful, though unequal kingdoms, three respectable commonwealths,and a variety of smaller, though independent states; the chances of royal andministerial talents are multiplied, at least with the number of its rulers: anda Julian3 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en70] or Semiramis4[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en71] may reign in the north, whileArcadius and Honorius5 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en72] againslumber on the thrones of the House of Bourbon. The abuses of tyranny arerestrained by the mutual influence of fear and shame; republics have acquiredorder and stability; monarchies have imbibed the principles of freedom, or, atleast, of moderation; and some sense of honour and justice is introduced intothe most defective constitutions by the general manners of the times. In peace,the progress of knowledge and industry is accelerated by the emulation of somany active rivals: in war, the European forces are exercised by temperate andundecisive contests. If a savage conqueror should issue from the deserts ofTartary, he must repeatedly vanquish the robust peasants of Russia, the numerousarmies of Germany, the gallant nobles of France, and the intrepid freemen ofBritain; who, perhaps, might confederate for their common defence. Should thevictorious Barbarians carry slavery and desolation as far as the Atlantic Ocean,ten thousand vessels would transport beyond their pursuit the remains ofcivilized society; and Europe would revive and flourish in the American worldwhich is already filled with her colonies and institutions.“Cold, poverty, and a life of danger and fatigue fortify the strength andcourage of Barbarians. In every age they have oppressed the polite and peacefulnations of China, India, and Persia, who neglected, and still neglect, tocounterbalance these natural powers by the resources of military art. Thewarlike states of antiquity, Greece, Macedonia, and Rome, educated a race ofsoldiers; exercised their bodies, disciplined their courage, multiplied theirforces by regular evolutions, and converted the iron which they possessed intostrong and serviceable weapons. But this superiority insensibly declined withtheir laws and manners; and the feeble policy of Constantine and his successorsarmed and instructed, for the ruin of the empire, the rude valour of theBarbarian mercenaries. The military art has been changed by the invention ofgunpowder; which enables man to command the two most powerful agents of nature,air and fire. Mathematics, chemistry, mechanics, architecture, have been appliedto the service of war; and the adverse parties oppose to each other the mostelaborate modes of attack and of defence. Historians may indignantly observethat the preparations of a siege would found and maintain a flourishing colony;yet we cannot be displeased that the subversion of a city should be a work ofcost and difficulty, or that an industrious people should be protected by thosearts, which survive and supply the decay of military virtue. Cannon andfortifications now form an impregnable barrier against the Tartar horse6[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en73]; and Europe is secure from anyfuture irruption of Barbarians; since, before they can conquer, they must ceaseto be barbarous. . . .“Should these speculations be found doubtful or fallacious, there still remainsa more humble source of comfort and hope. The discoveries of ancient and modernnavigators, and the domestic history, or tradition, of the most enlightenednations, represent the human savage, naked both in mind and body, and destituteof laws, of arts, of ideas, and almost of language. From this abject condition,perhaps the primitive and universal state of man, he has gradually arisen tocommand the animals, to fertilize the earth, to traverse the ocean, and tomeasure the heavens. His progress in the improvement and exercise of his mentaland corporeal faculties has been irregular and various, infinitely slow in thebeginning, and increasing by degrees with redoubled velocity; ages of laboriousascent have been followed by a moment of rapid downfall; and the severalclimates of the globe have felt the vicissitudes of light and darkness. Yet theexperience of four thousand years should enlarge our hopes, and diminish ourapprehensions; we cannot determine to what height the human species may aspirein their advances towards perfection; but it may safely be presumed that nopeople, unless the face of nature is changed, will relapse into their originalbarbarism.“Since the first discovery of the arts, war, commerce, and religious zeal havediffused, among the savages of the Old and New World, those inestimable gifts,they have been successively propagated; they can never be lost. We may thereforeacquiesce in the pleasing conclusion that every age of the world has increased,and still increases, the real wealth, the happiness, the knowledge, and perhapsthe virtue, of the human race.”§ 12One of the most interesting aspects of this story of Europe in the seventeenthand earlier eighteenth century during the phase of the Grand and ParliamentaryMonarchies, is the comparative quiescence of the peasants and workers. Theinsurrectionary fires of the fourteenth and fifteenth and sixteenth centuriesseem to have died down. The acute economic clashes of the earlier period hadbeen mitigated by rough adjustments. The discovery of America had revolutionizedand changed the scale of business and industry, had brought a vast volume ofprecious metal for money into Europe, had increased and varied employment. For atime life and work ceased to be intolerable to the masses of the poor. This didnot, of course, prevent much individual misery and discontent; the poor we havealways had with us, but this misery and discontent was divided and scattered. Itbecame inaudible.In the earlier period the common people had had an idea to crystallize upon, theidea of Christian communism. They had found an educated leadership in thedissentient priests and doctors of the Wycliffe type. As the movement for arevival in Christianity spent its force, as Lutheranism fell back for leadershipfrom Jesus upon the Protestant Princes, this contact and reaction of the fresherminds of the educated class upon the illiterate mass was interrupted. Howevernumerous a downtrodden class may be, and however extreme its miseries, it willnever be able to make an effective protest until it achieves solidarity by thedevelopment of some common general idea. Educated men and men of ideas are morenecessary to a popular political movement than to any other political process. Amonarchy learns by ruling, and an oligarchy of any type has the education ofaffairs; but the common man, the peasant or toiler, has no experience in largematters, and can exist politically only through, the services, devotion, andguidance of educated men. The Reformation, the Reformation that succeeded, theReformation that is of the Princes, by breaking up educational facilities,largely destroyed the poor scholar and priest class whose persuasion of thecrowd had rendered the Reformation possible.The Princes of the Protestant countries when they seized upon the nationalchurches early apprehended the necessity of gripping the universities also.Their idea of education was the idea of capturing young clever people for theservice of their betters. Beyond that they were disposed to regard education asa mischievous thing. The only way to an education, therefore, for a poor man wasthrough patronage. Of course there was a parade of encouragement towardslearning in all the Grand Monarchies, a setting up of Academies and RoyalSocieties, but these benefited only a small class of subservient scholars. Thechurch also had learnt to distrust the educated poor man. In the greataristocratic “crowned republic” of Britain there was the same shrinkage ofeducational opportunity. “Both the ancient universities,” says Hammond, in hisaccount of the eighteenth century, “were the universities of the rich. There isa passage in Macaulay describing the state and pomp of Oxford at the end of theseventeenth century, ‘when her Chancellor, the Venerable Duke of Ormonde, sat inhis embroidered mantle on his throne under the painted ceiling of the Sheldoniantheatre, surrounded by hundreds of graduates robed according to their rank,while the noblest youths of England were solemnly presented to him as candidatesfor academical honours.’ The university was a power, not in the sense in whichthat could be said of a university like the old university of Paris, whoselearning could make Popes tremble, but in the sense that the university was partof the recognized machinery of aristocracy. What was true of the universitieswas true of the public schools. Education in England was the nursery not of asociety, but of an order; not of a state, but of a race of owner-rulers.” Themissionary spirit had departed from education throughout Europe. To that quiteas much as to the amelioration of things by a diffused prosperity, this phase ofquiescence among the lower classes is to be ascribed. They had lost brains andspeech, and they were fed. The community was like a pithed animal in the handsof the governing class.7 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en74]Moreover, there had been considerable changes in the proportions of class toclass. One of the most difficult things for the historian to trace is therelative amount of the total property of the community held at any time by anyparticular class in that community. These things fluctuate very rapidly. Thepeasant wars of Europe indicate a phase of comparatively concentrated propertywhen large masses of people could feel themselves expropriated and at a commondisadvantage, and so take mass action. This was the time of the rise andprosperity of the Fuggers and their like, a time of international finance. Thenwith the vast importation of silver and gold and commodities into Europe fromAmerica, there seems to have been a restoration of a more diffused state ofwealth. The poor were just as miserable as ever, but there were perhaps not somany poor relatively, and they were broken up into a variety of types withoutany ideas in common. In Great Britain the agricultural life which had beendislocated by the confiscations of the Reformation had settled down again into asystem of tenant farming under great landowners. Side by side with the largeestates there was still, however, much common land for pasturing the beasts ofthe poorer villagers, and much land cultivated in strips upon communal lines.The middling sort of man, and even the poorer sort of man upon the land, wereleading an endurable existence in 1700. The standard of life, the idea, that is,of what is an endurable existence, was, however, rising during the opening phaseof Grand Monarchy; after a time the process of the upward concentration ofwealth seems to have been resumed, the larger landowners began to acquire andcrowd out the poorer free cultivators, and the proportion of poor people and ofpeople who felt they were leading impoverished lives increased again. The biggermen were unchallenged rulers of Great Britain, and they set themselves to enactlaws, the Enclosure Acts, that practically confiscated the unenclosed and commonlands, mainly for the benefit of the larger landowners. The smaller men sank tothe level of wage workers upon the land over which they had once possessedrights of cultivation and pasture.The peasant in France and upon the Continent generally was not so expropriated;his enemy was not the landlord, but the taxgatherer; he was squeezed on his landinstead of being squeezed off it.As the eighteenth century progressed, it is apparent in the literature of thetime that what to do with “the poor” was again exercising men’s thoughts. Wefind such active-minded English writers as Defoe (1659-1731) and Fielding(1707-54) deeply exercised by this problem. But as yet there is no such revivalof the communistic and equalitarian ideas of primitive Christianity asdistinguished the time of Wycliffe and John Huss. Protestantism in breaking upthe universal church had for a time broken up the idea of a universal humansolidarity. Even if the universal church of the Middle Ages had failedaltogether to realize that idea, it had at any rate been the symbol of thatidea.Defoe and Fielding were men of a livelier practical imagination than Gibbon, andthey realized something of the economic processes that were afoot in their time.So did Oliver Goldsmith (1728-74); his Deserted Village (1770) is a pamphlet onenclosures disguised as a poem. But Gibbon’s circumstances had never broughteconomic facts very vividly before his eyes, he saw the world as a strugglebetween barbarism and civilization, but he perceived nothing of that otherstruggle over which he floated, the mute, unconscious struggle of the commonaltyagainst able, powerful, rich, and selfish men. He did not perceive theaccumulation of stresses that were presently to strain and break up all thebalance of his “twelve powerful, though unequal, kingdoms,” his “threerespectable commonwealths,” and their rag, tag, and bobtail of independent minorprinces, reigning dukes, and so forth. Even the civil war that had begun in theBritish colonies in America did not rouse him to the nearness of what we nowcall “Democracy.”From what we have been saying hitherto, the reader may suppose that thesqueezing of the small farmer and the peasant off the land by the greatlandowners, the mere grabbing of commons and the concentration of property inthe hands of a powerful privileged and greedy class, was all that was happeningto the English land in the eighteenth century. So we do but state the worse sideof the change. Concurrently with this change of ownership there was going on agreat improvement in agriculture. There can be little doubt that the methods ofcultivation pursued by the peasants, squatters, and small farmers wereantiquated, wasteful, and comparatively unproductive, and that the largerprivate holdings and estates created by the Enclosure Acts were much moreproductive (one authority says twenty times more productive) than the old ways.The change was perhaps a necessary one and the evil of it was not that it wasbrought about, but that it was brought about so as to increase both wealth andthe numbers of the poor. Its benefits were intercepted by the bigger privateowners. The community was injured to the great profit of this class.And here we come upon one of the chief problems of our lives at the presenttime, the problem of the deflection of the profits of progress. For two hundredyears there has been, mainly under the influence of the spirit of science andenquiry, a steady improvement in the methods of production of almost everythingthat humanity requires. If our sense of community and our social science wereequal to the tasks required of them, there can be little question that thisgreat increment in production would have benefited the whole community, wouldhave given everyone an amount of education, leisure, and freedom such as mankindhad never dreamt of before. But though the common standard of living has risen,the rise has been on a scale disproportionately small. The rich have developed afreedom and luxury unknown in the world hitherto, and there has been an increasein the proportion of rich people and stagnantly prosperous and unproductivepeople in the community; but that also fails to account for the full benefit.There has been much sheer waste. Vast accumulations of material and energy havegone into warlike preparations and warfare. Much has been devoted to the futileefforts of unsuccessful business competition. Huge possibilities have remainedundeveloped because of the opposition of owners, forestallers, and speculatorsto their economical exploitation. The good things that science and organizationhave been bringing within the reach of mankind have not been taken methodicallyand used to their utmost, but they have been scrambled for, snatched at, seizedupon by gambling adventurers and employed upon selfish and vain ends. Theeighteenth century in Europe, and more particularly in Great Britain and Poland,was the age of private ownership. “Private enterprise,” which meant in practicethat everyone was entitled to get everything he could out of the business of thecommunity, reigned supreme. No sense of obligation to the state in businessmatters is to be found in the ordinary novels, plays, and such-likerepresentative literature of the time. Everyone is out “to make his fortune,”there is no recognition that it is wrong to be an unproductive parasite on thecommunity, and still less that a financier or merchant or manufacturer can everbe overpaid for his services to mankind. This was the moral atmosphere of thetime, and those lords and gentlemen who grabbed the people’s commons, assumedpossession of the mines under their lands, and crushed down the yeoman farmersand peasants to the status of pauper labourers, had no idea that they wereliving anything but highly meritorious lives.Concurrently with this change in Great Britain from traditional patchagriculture and common pasture to large and more scientific agriculture, verygreat changes were going on in the manufacture of commodities. In these changesGreat Britain was, in the eighteenth century, leading the world. Hitherto,throughout the whole course of history from the beginnings of civilization,manufactures, building, and industries generally had been in the hands ofcraftsmen and small masters who worked in their own houses. They had beenorganized in guilds, and were mostly their own employers. They formed anessential and permanent middle class. There were capitalists among them, who letout looms and the like, supplied material, and took the finished product, butthey were not big capitalists. There had been no rich manufacturers. The richmen of the world before this time had been great landowners or money-lenders andmoney manipulators or merchants. But in the eighteenth century, workers incertain industries began to be collected together into factories in order toproduce things in larger quantities through a systematic division of labour, andthe employer, as distinguished from the master worker, began to be a person ofimportance. Moreover, mechanical invention was producing machines thatsimplified the manual work of production, and were capable of being driven bywater power and presently by steam. In 1765 Watt’s steam engine was constructed,a very important date in the history of industrialism.The cotton industry was one of the first to pass into factory production(originally with water-driven machinery). The woollen industry followed. At thesame time iron smelting, which had been restrained hitherto to small methods bythe use of charcoal, resorted to coke made from coal, and the coal and ironindustries also began to expand. The iron industry shifted from the woodedcountry of Sussex and Surrey to the coal districts. By 1800 this change-over ofindustry from a small scale business with small employers to a large scaleproduction under big employers was well in progress. Everywhere there sprang upfactories using first water, then steam power. It was a change of fundamentalimportance in human economy. From the dawn of history the manufacturer andcraftsman had been, as we have said, a sort of middle-class townsman. Themachine and the employer now superseded his skill, and he either became anemployer of his fellows, and grew towards wealth and equality with the otherrich classes, or he remained a worker and sank very rapidly to the level of amere labourer. This great change in human affairs is known as the IndustrialRevolution. Beginning in Great Britain, it spread during the nineteenth centurythroughout the world.As the Industrial Revolution went on, a great gulf opened between employer andemployed. In the past every manufacturing worker had the hope of becoming anindependent master. Even the slave craftsmen of Babylon and Rome were protectedby laws that enabled them to save and buy their freedom and to set up forthemselves. But now a factory and its engines and machines became a vast andcostly thing measured by the scale of the worker’s pocket. Wealthy men had tocome together to create an enterprise; credit and plant, that is to say,“Capital,” were required. “Setting up for oneself” ceased to be a normal hopefor an artisan. The worker was henceforth a worker from the cradle to the grave.Besides the landlords and merchants and the money-dealers who financed tradingcompanies and lent their money to the merchants and the state, there arose nowthis new wealth of industrial capital—a new sort of power in the state.Of the working out of these beginnings we shall tell later. The immediate effectof the industrial revolution upon the countries to which it came, was to cause avast, distressful shifting and stirring of the mute, uneducated, leaderless, andnow more and more propertyless common population. The small cultivators andpeasants, ruined and dislodged by the Enclosure Acts, drifted towards the newmanufacturing regions, and there they joined the families of the impoverishedand degraded craftsmen in the factories. Great towns of squalid houses came intoexistence. Nobody seems to have noted clearly what was going on at the time. Itis the keynote of “private enterprise” to mind one’s own business, secure theutmost profit, and disregard any other consequences. Ugly great factories grewup, built as cheaply as possible, to hold as many machines and workers aspossible. Around them gathered the streets of workers’ homes, built at thecheapest rate, without space, without privacy, barely decent, and let at theutmost rent that could be exacted. These new industrial centres were at firstwithout schools, without churches. . . .The English gentleman of the closing decades of the eighteenth century readGibbon’s third volume and congratulated himself that there was henceforth noserious fear of the Barbarians, with this new barbarism growing up, with thismetamorphosis of his countrymen into something dark and desperate, in fullprogress, within an easy walk perhaps of his door."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIIITHE NEW DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICS OF AMERICA AND FRANCE§ 1.

The Pause in Reconstruction and the Dawn ofModern Socialism.§ 1WHEN Gibbon, nearly a century and a half ago, was congratulating the world ofrefined and educated people that the age of great political and socialcatastrophes was past, he was neglecting many signs which we—in the wisdom ofaccomplished facts—could have told him portended far heavier jolts anddislocations than any he foresaw. We have told how the struggle of the sixteenthand seventeenth-century princes for ascendancies and advantages developed into amore cunning and complicated struggle of foreign offices, masquerading asidealized “Great Powers,” as the eighteenth century wore on. The intricate andpretentious art of diplomacy developed. The “Prince” ceased to be a single andsecretive Machiavellian schemer, and became merely the crowned symbol of aMachiavellian scheme. Prussia, Russia, and Austria fell upon and divided Poland.France was baffled in profound schemes against Spain. Britain circumvented the“designs of France” in America and acquired Canada, and got the better of Francein India. And then a remarkable thing occurred, a thing very shocking toEuropean diplomacy. The British colonies in America flatly refused to havefurther part or lot in this game of “Great Powers.” They objected that they hadno voice and no great interest in these European schemes and conflicts, and theyrefused to bear any portion of the burthen of taxation these foreign policiesentailed. “Taxation without representation is tyranny”; this was their dominantidea.Of course this decision to separate did not flash out complete and finished fromthe American mind at the beginning of these troubles. In America in theeighteenth century, just as in England in the seventeenth, there was an entirewillingness, indeed a desire on the part of ordinary men, to leave foreignaffairs in the hands of the king and his ministers. But there was an equallystrong desire on the part of ordinary men to be neither taxed nor interferedwith in their ordinary pursuits. These are incompatible wishes. Common mencannot shirk world politics and at the same time enjoy private freedom; but ithas taken them countless generations to learn this. The first impulse in theAmerican revolt against the government in Great Britain was therefore simply aresentment against the taxation and interference that followed necessarily from“foreign policy” without any clear recognition of what was involved in thatobjection. It was only when the revolt was consummated that the people of theAmerican colonies recognized at all clearly that they had repudiated the GreatPower view of life. The sentence in which that repudiation was expressed wasWashington’s injunction to “avoid entangling alliances.” For a full century theunited colonies of Great Britain in North America, liberated and independent asthe United States of America, stood apart altogether from the blood-stainedintrigues and conflicts of the European foreign offices. Soon after (1810 to1823) they were able to extend their principle of detachment to the rest of thecontinent, and to make all the New World “out of bounds” for the schemingexpansionists of the old. When at length, in 1917, they were obliged to re-enterthe arena of world politics, it was to bring the new spirit and new aims theiraloofness had enabled them to develop into the tangle of internationalrelationships. They were not, however, the first to stand aloof. Since thetreaty of Westphalia (1648), the confederated states of Switzerland, in theirmountain fastnesses, had sustained their right to exclusion from the schemes ofkings and empires.But since the North American peoples are now to play an increasingly importantpart in our history, it will be well to devote a little more attention than wehave hitherto given to their development. We have already glanced at this storyin § 8 of the preceding chapter. We will now tell a little more fully—thoughstill in the barest outline—what these colonies were, whose recalcitrance was sodisconcerting to the king and ministers of Great Britain in their diplomaticgame against the rest of mankind.§ 2The extent of the British colonies in America in the early half of theeighteenth century is shown in the accompanying map. The darker shadingrepresents the districts settled in 1700, the lighter the growth of thesettlements up to 1760. It will be seen that the colonies were a mere fringe ofpopulation along the coast, spreading gradually inland and finding in theAlleghany and Blue Mountains a very serious barrier. Among the oldest of thesesettlements was the colony of Virginia, the name of which commemorates QueenElizabeth, the Virgin Queen of England. The first expedition to found a colonyin Virginia was made by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584, but there was no permanentsettlement at that time; and the real beginnings of Virginia date from thefoundation of the Virginia Company in 1606 in the reign of James I (1603-25).The story of John Smith and the early founders of Virginia and of how the Indian“princess” Pocahontas married one of his gentlemen, is an English classic.1[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en75] In growing tobacco theVirginians found the beginning of prosperity. At the same time that theVirginian Company was founded, the Plymouth Company obtained a charter for thesettlement of the country to the north of Long Island Sound, to which theEnglish laid claim. But it was only in 1620 that the northern region began to besettled, and that under fresh charters. The settlers of the northern region (NewEngland), which became Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, andMassachusetts, were men of a different stamp to the Virginia people. They wereProtestants discontented with the Anglican Church compromise. andrepublican-spirited men hopeless of resistance to the Grand Monarchy of James Iand Charles I. Their pioneer ship was the Mayflower, which founded New Plymouthin 1620. The dominant northern colony was Massachusetts. Differences inreligious method and in ideas of toleration led to the separation of the threeother Puritan colonies from Massachusetts. It illustrates the scale upon whichthings were done in those days that the whole state of New Hampshire was claimedas belonging to a certain Captain John Mason, and that he offered to sell it tothe king (King Charles II in 1671) in exchange for the right to import 300 tonsof French wine free of duty—an offer which was refused. The present state ofMaine was bought by Massachusetts from its alleged owner for twelve hundred andfifty pounds.In the Civil War that ended with the decapitation of Charles I the sympathies ofNew England were for the Parliament, and Virginia was Cavalier; but two hundredand fifty miles separated these settlements, and there were no serioushostilities. With the return of the monarchy in 1660, there was a vigorousdevelopment of British colonization in America. Charles II and his associateswere greedy for gain, and the British crown had no wish to make any furtherexperiments in illegal taxation at home. But the undefined relations of thecolonies to the crown and the British government seemed to afford promise offinancial adventure across the Atlantic. There was a rapid development ofplantations and proprietary colonies. Lord Baltimore had already in 1632 set upa colony that was to be a home of religious freedom for Catholics under theattractive name of Maryland, to the north and east of Virginia; and now theQuaker Penn (whose father had rendered valuable services to Charles II)established himself to the north at Philadelphia and founded the colony ofPennsylvania. Its main boundary with Maryland and Virginia was delimited by twomen, Mason and Dixon, whose “Mason and Dixon’s Line” was destined to become avery important line indeed in the later affairs of the United States. Carolina,which was originally an unsuccessful French Protestant establishment, and whichowed its name not to Charles (Carolus) II of England, but to Charles IX ofFrance, had fallen into English hands and was settled at several points. BetweenMaryland and New England stretched a number of small Dutch and Swedishsettlements, of which the chief town was New Amsterdam. These settlements werecaptured from the Dutch by the British in 1664, lost again in 1673, and restoredby treaty when Holland and England made peace in 1674. Thereby the whole coastfrom Maine to Carolina became in some form or other a British possession. To thesouth the Spanish were established; their headquarters were at Fort St.Augustine in Florida, and in 1732 the town of Savannah was settled by aphilanthropist Oglethorpe from England, who had taken pity on the miserablepeople imprisoned for debt in England, and rescued a number of them from prisonto become the founders of a new colony, Georgia, which was to be a bulwarkagainst the Spanish. So by the middle of the eighteenth century we have thesesettlements along the American coast-line: the New England group of Puritans andfree Protestants, Maine (belonging to Massachusetts), New Hampshire,Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts; the captured Dutch group, whichwas now divided up into New York (New Amsterdam rechristened), New Jersey, andDelaware (Swedish before it was Dutch, and in its earliest British phaseattached to Pennsylvania); then came Catholic Maryland; Cavalier Virginia;Carolina (which was presently divided into North and South) and Oglethorpe’sGeorgia. Later on a number of Tyrolese Protestants took refuge in Georgia, andthere was a considerable immigration of a good class of German cultivators intoPennsylvania.048 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_048_r1.gif]Such were the miscellaneous origins of the citizens of the Thirteen Colonies.The possibility of their ever becoming closely united would have struck animpartial observer in 1760 as being very slight. Superadded to the initialdifferences of origin, fresh differences were created by climate. North of theMason and Dixon line farming was practised mainly upon British or CentralEuropean lines by free white cultivators. The settled country of New Englandtook on a likeness to the English countryside; considerable areas ofPennsylvania developed fields and farmhouses like those of South Germany. Thedistinctive conditions in the north had, socially, important effects. Mastersand men had to labour together as backwoodsmen, and were equalized in theprocess. They did not start equally; many “servants” are mentioned in the rosterof the Mayflower. But they rapidly became equal under colonial conditions; therewas, for instance, a vast tract of land to be had for the taking, and the“servant” went off and took land like his master. The English class systemdisappeared. Under colonial conditions there arose equality “in the facultiesboth of body and mind,” and an individual independence of judgment impatient ofinterference from England. But south of the Mason and Dixon line tobacco growingbegan, and the warmer climate encouraged the establishment of plantations withgang labour. Red Indian captives were tried, but found to be too homicidal;Cromwell sent Irish prisoners of war to Virginia, which did much to reconcilethe Royalist planters to republicanism; convicts were sent out, and there was aconsiderable trade in kidnapped children, who were “spirited away” to America tobecome apprentices or bond slaves. But the most convenient form of gang labourproved to be that of negro slaves. The first negro slaves were brought toJamestown in Virginia by a Dutch ship as early as 1620. By 1700 negro slaveswere scattered all over the states, but Virginia, Maryland, and the Carolinaswere their chief regions of employment, and while the communities to the northwere communities of not very rich and not very poor farming men, the southdeveloped a type of large proprietor and a white community of overseers andprofessional men subsisting on slave labour. Slave labour was a necessity to thesocial and economic system that had grown up in the south; in the north thepresence of slaves was unnecessary and in some respects inconvenient.Conscientious scruples about slavery were more free, therefore, to develop andflourish in the northern atmosphere. To this question of the revival of slaveryin the world we must return when we come to consider the perplexities ofAmerican Democracy. Here we note it simply as an added factor in theheterogeneous mixture of the British Colonies.But if the inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies were miscellaneous in theirorigins and various in their habits and sympathies, they had three very strongantagonisms in common. They had a common interest against the Red Indians. For atime they shared a common dread of French conquest and dominion. And thirdly,they were all in conflict with the claims of the British crown and thecommercial selfishness of the narrow oligarchy who dominated the BritishParliament and British affairs.So far as the first danger went, the Indians were a constant evil, but nevermore than a threat of disaster. They remained divided against themselves. Yetthey had shown possibilities of combination upon a larger scale. The FiveNations of the Iroquois (see map, p. 364) was a very important league of tribes.But it never succeeded in playing off the French against the English to secureitself, and no Red Indian Jengis Khan ever arose among these nomads of the newworld. The French aggression was a more serious threat. The French never madesettlements in America on a scale to compete with the English, but theirgovernment set about the encirclement of the colonies and their subjugation in aterrifyingly systematic manner. The English in America were colonists; theFrench were explorers, adventurers, agents, missionaries, merchants, andsoldiers. Only in Canada did they strike root. French statesmen sat over mapsand dreamt dreams, and their dreams are to be seen in our map in the chain offorts creeping southward from the great lakes and northward up the Mississippiand Ohio rivers. The struggle of France and Britain was a world-wide struggle.It was decided in India, in Germany, and on the high seas. In the Peace of Paris(1763) the French gave England Canada, and relinquished Louisiana to the inerthands of declining Spain. It was the complete abandonment of America by France.The lifting of the French danger left the colonists unencumbered to face theirthird common antagonist —the crown and government of their mother land.§ 3We have noted in the previous chapter how the governing class of Great Britainsteadily acquired the land and destroyed the liberty of the common peoplethroughout the eighteenth century, and how greedily and blindly the newindustrial revolution was brought about. We have noted also how the BritishParliament, through the decay of the representative methods of the House ofCommons, had become both in its upper and lower houses merely the instrument ofgovernment through the big landowners. Both these big property-holders and thecrown were deeply interested in America; the former as private adventurers, thelatter partly as representing the speculative exploitations of the Stuart kings,and partly as representing the state in search of funds for the expenses offoreign policy, and neither lords nor crown were disposed to regard the traders,planters, and common people of the colonies with any more consideration thanthey did the yeomen and small cultivators at home. At bottom the interests ofthe common man in Great Britain, Ireland, and America were the same. Each wasbeing squeezed by the same system. But while in Britain oppressor and oppressedwere closely tangled up in one intimate social system, in America the crown andthe exploiter were far away, and men could get together and develop a sense ofcommunity against their common enemy.Moreover, the American colonist had the important advantage of possessing aseparate and legal organ of resistance to the British government in the assemblyor legislature of his colony that was necessary for the management of localaffairs. The common man in Britain, cheated out of his proper representation inthe Commons, had no organ, no centre of expression and action for hisdiscontents.It will be evident to the reader, bearing in mind the variety of the colonies,that here was the possibility of an endless series of disputes, aggressions, andcounter-aggressions. The story of the development of irritations between thecolonies and Britain is a story far too intricate, subtle, and lengthy for thescheme of this Outline. Suffice it that the grievances fell under three mainheads: attempts to secure for British adventurers or the British government theprofits of the exploitation of new lands; systematic restrictions upon tradedesigned to keep the foreign trade of the colonies entirely in British hands, sothat the colonial exports all went through Britain and only British-made goodswere used in America; and finally attempts at taxation through the BritishParliament as the supreme taxing authority of the empire. Under the pressure ofthis triple system of annoyances, the American colonists were forced to do avery considerable amount of hard political thinking. Such men as Patrick Henryand James Otis began to discuss the fundamental ideas of government andpolitical association very much as they had been discussed in England in thegreat days of Cromwell’s Commonweal. They began to deny both the divine originof kingship and the supremacy of the British Parliament, and (James Otis, 1762)to say such things as:—“God made all men naturally equal.“Ideas of earthly superiority are educational, not innate.“Kings were made for the good of the people, and not the people for them.“No government has a right to make slaves of its subjects.“Though most governments are de facto arbitrary, and consequently the curse andscandal of human nature, yet none are de jure arbitrary.”Some of which propositions reach far.This ferment in the political ideas of the Americans was started by Englishleaven. One very influential English writer was John Locke (1632-1704), whoseTwo Treatises on Civil Government may be taken, as much as any one single bookcan be taken in such cases, as the point of departure for modern democraticideas. He was the son of a Cromwellian soldier, he was educated at ChristChurch, Oxford, during the republican ascendancy, he spent some years inHolland, in exile, and his writings form a bridge between the bold politicalthinking of those earlier republican days and the revolutionary movement both inAmerica and France.But men do not begin to act upon theories. It is always some real danger, somepractical necessity, that produces action; and it is only after action hasdestroyed old relationships and produced a new and perplexing state of affairsthat theory comes to its own. Then it is that theory is put to the test. Thediscord in interests and ideas between the colonists was brought to a fightingissue by the obstinate resolve of the British Parliament after the peace of 1763to impose taxation upon the American colonies. Britain was at peace and flushedwith successes; it seemed an admirable opportunity for settling accounts withthese recalcitrant settlers. But the great British property-owners found a powerbeside their own, of much the same mind with them, but a little divergent in itsends—the reviving crown. King George III, who had begun his reign in 1760, wasresolved to be much more of a king than his two German predecessors. He couldspeak English; he claimed to “glory in the name of Briton”—and indeed it is nota bad name for a man without a perceptible drop of English, Welsh, or Scotchblood in his veins. In the American colonies and the overseas possessionsgenerally, with their indefinite charters or no charters at all, it seemed tohim that the crown might claim authority and obtain resources and powersabsolutely denied to it by the strong and jealous aristocracy in Britain. Thisinclined many of the Whig noblemen to a sympathy with the colonists that theymight not otherwise have shown. They had no objection to the exploitation of thecolonies in the interests of British “private enterprise,” but they had verystrong objections to the strengthening of the crown by that exploitation so asto make it presently independent of themselves.The war that broke out was therefore in reality not a war between Britain andthe colonists, it was a war between the British government and the colonists,with a body of Whig noblemen and a considerable amount of public feeling inEngland on the side of the latter. An early move after 1763 was an attempt toraise revenue for Britain in the colonies by requiring that newspapers anddocuments of various sorts should be stamped. This was stiffly resisted, theBritish crown was intimidated, and the Stamp Acts were repealed (1766). Theirrepeal was greeted by riotous rejoicings in London, more hearty even than thosein the colonies.But the Stamp Act affair was only one eddy in a turbulent stream flowing towardscivil war. Upon a score of pretexts, and up and down the coast, therepresentatives of the British government were busy asserting their authorityand making British government intolerable. The quartering of soldiers upon thecolonists was a great nuisance. Rhode Island was particularly active in defyingthe trade restrictions; the Rhode Islanders were “free traders,”—that is to say,smugglers; a government schooner, the Gaspee, ran aground off Providence; shewas surprised, boarded, and captured by armed men in boats, and burnt. In 1773,with a total disregard of the existing colonial tea trade, special advantagesfor the importation of tea into America were given by the British Parliament tothe East India Company. It was resolved by the colonists to refuse and boycottthis tea. When the tea importers at Boston showed themselves resolute to landtheir cargoes, a band of men disguised as Indians, in the presence of a greatcrowd of people, boarded the three tea ships and threw the tea overboard(December 16th, 1773).All 1774 was occupied in the gathering up of resources on either side for thecoming conflict. It was decided by the British Parliament in the spring of 1774to punish Boston by closing her port. Her trade was to be destroyed unless sheaccepted that tea. It was a quite typical instance of that silly “firmness”which shatters empires. In order to enforce this measure, British troops wereconcentrated at Boston under General Gage. The colonists took counter-measures.The first colonial Congress met at Philadelphia in September, at which twelvecolonies were represented: Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, RhodeIsland, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, andNorth and South Carolina. Georgia was not present. True to the best Englishtraditions, the Congress documented its attitude by a “Declaration of Rights.”Practically this Congress was an insurrectionary government, but no blow wasstruck until the spring of 1775. Then came the first shedding of blood.Two of the American leaders, Hancock and Samuel Adams, had been marked down bythe British Government for arrest and trial for treason; they were known to beat Lexington, about eleven miles from Boston; and in the night of April 18th,1775, Gage set his forces in motion for their arrest.049 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_049_r1.gif]That night was a momentous one in history. The movement of Gage’s troops hadbeen observed, signal lanterns were shown from a church tower in Boston, and twomen, Dawes and Paul Revere, stole away in boats across the Back Bay to takehorse and warn the countryside. The British were also ferried over the water,and as they marched through the night towards Lexington, the firing of signalcannon and the ringing of church bells went before them. As they enteredLexington at dawn, they saw a little company of men drawn up in militaryfashion. It seems that the British fired first. There was a single shot and thena volley, and the little handful decamped, apparently without any answeringshots, leaving eight dead and nine wounded upon the village green.The British then marched on to Concord, ten miles further, occupied the village,and stationed a party on the bridge at that place. The expedition had failed inits purpose of arresting Hancock and Adams, and the British commander seems tohave been at a loss what to do next. Meanwhile the colonial levies were comingup from all directions, and presently the picket upon the bridge found itselfsubjected to an increasing fire from a gathering number of assailants firingfrom behind trees and fences. A retreat to Boston was decided upon. It was adisastrous retreat. The country had risen behind the British; all the morningthe colonials had been gathering. Both sides of the road were now swarming withsharpshooters firing from behind rock and fence and building; the soldiers werein conspicuous scarlet uniforms, with yellow facings and white gaiters andcravats; this must have stood out very vividly against the cold sharp colours ofthe late New England spring; the day was bright, hot, and dusty, and they werealready exhausted by a night march. Every few yards a man fell, wounded orkilled. The rest tramped on, or halted to fire an ineffectual volley. Nocounter-attack was possible. Their assailants lurked everywhere. At Lexingtonthere were British reinforcements and two guns, and after a brief rest theretreat was resumed in better order. But the sharpshooting and pursuit waspressed to the river, and after the British had crossed back into Boston, thecolonial levies took up their quarters in Cambridge and prepared to blockade thecity.§ 4So the war began. It was not a war that promised a conclusive end. The colonistshad no one vulnerable capital; they were dispersed over a great country, with alimitless wilderness behind it, and so they had great powers of resistance. Theyhad learnt their tactics largely from the Indians; they could fight well in openorder, and hurry and destroy troops in movement. But they had no disciplinedarmy that could meet the British in a pitched battle, and little militaryequipment; and their levies grew impatient at a long campaign, and tended to gohome to their farms. The British, on the other hand, had a well-drilled army,and their command of the sea gave them the power of shifting their attack up anddown the long Atlantic seaboard. They were at peace with all the world. But theking was stupid and greedy to interfere in the conduct of affairs; the generalshe favoured were stupid “strong men” or flighty men of birth and fashion; andthe heart of England was not in the business. He trusted rather to being able toblockade, raid, and annoy the colonists into submission than to a conclusiveconquest and occupation of the land. But the methods employed, and particularlythe use of hired German troops, who still retained the cruel traditions of theThirty Years’ War, and of Indian auxiliaries, who harried the outlying settlers,did not so much weary the Americans of the war as of the British. The Congress,meeting for the second time in 1775, endorsed the actions of the New Englandcolonists, and appointed George Washington the American commander-in-chief. In1777, General Burgoyne, in an attempt to get down to New York from Canada, wasdefeated at Freeman’s Farm on the Upper Hudson, and surrounded and obliged tocapitulate at Saratoga with his whole army. This disaster encouraged the Frenchand Spanish to come into the struggle on the side of the colonists. The Frenchsent General Lafayette to the States to assist them with his advice, and theirfleet did much to minimize the advantage of the British at sea. GeneralCornwallis was caught in the Yorktown peninsula in Virginia in 1781, andcapitulated with his army. The British Government, now heavily engaged withFrance and Spain in Europe, was at the end of its resources.At the outset of the war the colonists in general seem to have been as littledisposed to repudiate monarchy and claim complete independence as were theHollanders in the opening phase of Philip II’s persecutions and follies. Theseparatists were called radicals; they were mostly extremely democratic, as weshould say in England today, and their advanced views frightened many of thesteadier and wealthier colonists, for whom class privileges and distinctions hadconsiderable charm. But early in 1776 an able and persuasive Englishman, ThomasPaine, published a pamphlet at Philadelphia with the title of Common Sense,which had an enormous effect on public opinion. Its style was rhetorical bymodern standards. “The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of Nature cries,‘’Tis time to part,’” and so forth. But its effects were very great. Itconverted thousands to the necessity of separation. The turn-over of opinion,once it had begun, was rapid.Only in the summer of 1776 did Congress take the irrevocable step of declaringfor separation. “The Declaration of Independence,” another of those exemplarydocuments which it has been the peculiar service of the English to produce formankind, was drawn up by Thomas Jefferson; and after various amendments andmodifications it was made the fundamental document of the United States ofAmerica. There were two noteworthy amendments to Jefferson’s draft. He haddenounced the slave trade fiercely, and blamed the home government forinterfering with colonial attempts to end it. This was thrown out, and so, too,was a sentence about the British: “we must endeavour to forget our former lovefor them . . . we might have been a free and a great people together.”Towards the end of 1782, the preliminary articles of the treaty in which Britainrecognized the complete independence of the United States were signed at Paris.The end of the war was proclaimed on April 19th, 1783, exactly eight years afterPaul Revere’s ride, and the retreat of Gage’s men from Concord to Boston. TheTreaty of Peace was finally signed at Paris in September.§ 5From the point of view of human history, the way in which the Thirteen Statesbecame independent is of far less importance than the fact that they did becomeindependent. And with the establishment of their independence came a new sort ofcommunity into the world. It was like something coming out of an egg. It was awestern European civilization that had broken free from the last traces ofEmpire and Christendom; it had not a vestige of monarchy left and no statereligion. It had no dukes, princes, counts, nor any sort of title-bearersclaiming to ascendancy or respect as a right. Even its unity was as yet a mereunity for defence and freedom. It was in these respects such a clean start inpolitical organization as the world had not seen before. The absence of anybinding religious tie is especially noteworthy. It had a number of forms ofChristianity, its spirit was indubitably Christian; but as a state document of1796 explicitly declared, “The government of the United States is not in anysense founded on the Christian religion.”2[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en76] The new community had in factgone right down to the bare and stripped fundamentals of human association, andit was building up a new sort of society and a new sort. of state upon thosefoundations.050 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_050_r1.gif]Here were about four million people scattered over vast areas with very slow anddifficult means of intercommunication, poor as yet, but with the potentiality oflimitless wealth, setting out to do in reality on a huge scale such a feat ofconstruction as the Athenian philosophers twenty-two centuries before had donein imagination and theory.This situation marks a definite stage in the release of man from precedent andusage, and a definite step forward towards the conscious and deliberatereconstruction of his circumstances to suit his needs and aims. It was a newmethod becoming practical in human affairs. The modern states of Europe havebeen evolved institution by institution slowly and planlessly out of precedingthings. The United States were planned and made.In one respect, however, the creative freedom of the new nation was veryseriously restricted. This new sort of community and state was not built upon acleared site. It was not even so frankly an artificiality as some of the laterAthenian colonies, which went out from the mother city to plan and build brandnew city states with brand new constitutions. The thirteen colonies by the endof the war had all of them constitutions either like that of Connecticut andRhode Island dating from their original charters (1662) or, as in the case ofthe rest of the states, where a British governor had played a large part in theadministration, re-made during the conflict. But we may well consider thesereconstructions as contributory essays and experiments in the generalconstructive effort.Upon the effort certain ideas stood out very prominently. One is the idea ofpolitical and social equality. This idea, which we saw coming into the world asan extreme and almost incredible idea in the age between Buddha and Jesus ofNazareth, is now asserted in the later eighteenth century as a practicalstandard of human relationship. Says the fundamental statement of Virginia: “Allmen are by nature equally free and independent,” and it proceeds to rehearsetheir “rights,” and to assert that all magistrates and governors are but“trustees and servants” of the commonweal. All men are equally entitled to thefree exercise of religion. The king by right, the aristocrat, the “naturalslave,” the god king, and the god have all vanished from this politicalscheme—so far as these declarations go. Most of the states produced similarpreludes to government. The Declaration of Independence said that “all men areborn equal.” It is everywhere asserted in eighteenth-century terms that the newcommunity is to be—to use the phraseology we have introduced in an earlierchapter—a community of will and not a community of obedience. But the thinkersof that time had a rather clumsier way of putting the thing, they imagined asort of individual choice of and assent to citizenship that never in factoccurred—the so-called Social Contract. The Massachusetts preamble, forinstance, asserts that the state is a voluntary association, “by which the wholepeople covenants with each citizen and each citizen with the whole people thatall shall be governed by certain laws for the common good.”Now it will be evident that most of these fundamental statements are veryquestionable statements. Men are not born equal, they are not born free; theyare born a most various multitude enmeshed in an ancient and complex social net.Nor is any man invited to sign the social contract or, failing that, to departinto solitude. These statements, literally interpreted, are so manifestly falsethat it is impossible to believe that the men who made them intended them to beliterally interpreted. They made them in order to express certain elusive butprofoundly important ideas—ideas that after another century and a half ofthinking the world is in a better position to express. Civilization, as thisoutline has shown, arose as a community of obedience, and was essentially acommunity of obedience. But generation after generation the spirit was abused bypriests and rulers. There was a continual influx of masterful will from theforests, parklands, and steppes. The human spirit had at last rebelledaltogether against the blind obediences of the common life; it was seeking —andat first it was seeking very clumsily—to achieve a new and better sort ofcivilization that should also be a community of will. To that end it wasnecessary that every man should be treated as the sovereign of himself; hisstanding was to be one of fellowship and not of servility. His real use, hisreal importance depended upon his individual quality.The method by which these creators of political America sought to secure thiscommunity of will was an extremely simple and crude one. They gave what was forthe time, and in view of American conditions, a very wide franchise. Conditionsvaried in the different states; the widest franchise was in Pennsylvania, whereevery adult male taxpayer voted, but, compared with Britain, all the UnitedStates were well within sight of manhood suffrage by the end of the eighteenthcentury. These makers of America also made efforts, considerable for theirtimes, but puny by more modern standards, to secure a widely diffused commoneducation. The information of the citizens as to what was going on at home andabroad, they left, apparently without any qualms of misgiving, to publicmeetings and the privately owned printing press.The story of the various state constitutions, and of the constitution of theUnited States as a whole, is a very intricate one, and we can only deal with ithere in the broadest way. The most noteworthy point in a modern view is thedisregard of women as citizens. The American community was a simple, largelyagricultural community, and most women were married; it seemed natural that theyshould be represented by their men folk. But New Jersey admitted a few women tovote on a property qualification. Another point of great interest is the almostuniversal decision to have two governing assemblies, confirming or checking eachother, on the model of the Lords and Commons of Britain. Only Pennsylvania had asingle representative chamber, and that was felt to be a very dangerous andultra-democratic state of affairs. Apart from the argument that legislationshould be slow as well as sure, it is difficult to establish any necessity forthis “bi-cameral” arrangement. It seems to have been a fashion with constitutionplanners in the eighteenth century rather than a reasonable imperative. TheBritish division was an old one; the Lords, the original parliament, was anassembly of “notables,” the leading men of the kingdom; the House of Commonscame in as a new factor, as the elected spokesmen of the burghers and the smalllanded men. It was a little too hastily assumed in the eighteenth century thatthe commonalty would be given to wild impulses and would need checking; opinionwas for democracy, but for democracy with powerful brakes always on, whether itwas going up hill or down. About all the upper houses there was therefore aflavour of selectness; they were elected on a more limited franchise. This ideaof making an upper chamber which shall be a stronghold for the substantial mandoes not appeal to modern thinkers so strongly as it did to the men of theeighteenth century, but the bi-cameral idea in another form still has itsadvocates. They suggest that a community may with advantage consider its affairsfrom two points of view—through the eyes of a body elected to represent trades,industries, professions, public services, and the like, a body representingfunction, and through the eyes of a second body elected by localities torepresent communities. For the members of the former a man would vote by hiscalling, for the latter by his district of residence. They point out that theBritish House of Lords is in effect a body representing function, in which theland, the law, and the church are no doubt disproportionately represented, butin which industrialism, finance, the great public services, art, science, andmedicine, also find places; and that the British House of Commons is purelygeographical in its reference. It has even been suggested in Britain that thereshould be “labour peers,” selected from among the leaders of the greatindustrial trade unions. But these are speculations beyond our present scope.The Central Government of the United States was at first a very feeble body, aCongress of representatives of the thirteen governments, held together bycertain Articles of Confederation. This Congress was little more than aconference of sovereign representatives; it had no control, for instance, overthe foreign trade of each state, it could not coin money nor levy taxes by itsown authority. When John Adams, the first minister from the United States toEngland, went to discuss a commercial treaty with the British foreign secretary,he was met by a request for thirteen representatives, one from each of thestates concerned. He had to confess his inadequacy to make binding arrangements.The British presently began dealing with each state separately over the head ofCongress, and they retained possession of a number of posts in the Americanterritory about the great lakes because of the inability of Congress to holdthese regions effectually. In another urgent matter Congress proved equallyfeeble. To the west of the thirteen states stretched limitless lands into whichsettlers were now pushing in ever-increasing numbers. Each of the states hadindefinable claims to expansion westward. It was evident to every clear-sightedman that the jostling of these claims must lead in the long run to war, unlessthe Central Government could take on their apportionment. The feebleness of theCentral Government, its lack of concentration, became so much of aninconvenience and so manifest a danger that there was some secret discussion ofa monarchy, and Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts, the president of Congress,caused Prince Henry of Prussia, the brother of Frederick the Great, to beapproached on the subject. Finally a constitutional convention was called in1787 at Philadelphia, and there it was that the present constitution of theUnited States was in its broad lines hammered, out. A great change of spirit hadgone on during the intervening years, a widespread realization of the need ofunity.051 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_051_r1.gif]When the Articles of Confederation were drawn up, men had thought of the peopleof Virginia, the people of Massachusetts, the people of Rhode Island, and thelike; but now there appears a new conception, “the people of the United States.”The new government, with the executive President, the senators, congressmen, andthe Supreme Court, that, was now created, was declared to be the government of“the people of the United States”; it was a synthesis and not a mere assembly.It said “we the people,” and not “we the states,” as Lee of Virginia bitterlycomplained. It was to be a “federal” and not a confederate government.State by state the new constitution was ratified, and in the spring of 1788 thefirst congress upon the new lines assembled at New York, under the presidency ofGeorge Washington, who had been the national commander-in-chief throughout theWar of Independence. The constitution then underwent considerable revision, andWashington upon the Potomac was selected as the Federal capital.§ 6In an earlier chapter we have described the Roman republic, and its mixture ofmodern features with dark superstition and primordial savagery, as theNeanderthal anticipation of the modern democratic state. A time may come whenpeople will regard the contrivances and machinery of the American constitutionas the political equivalents of the implements and contrivances of Neolithicman. They have served their purpose well, and under their protection the peopleof the States have grown into one of the greatest, most powerful, and mostcivilized communities that the world has yet seen; but there is no reason inthat for regarding the American constitution as a thing more final andinalterable than the pattern of street railway that overshadows many New Yorkthoroughfares, or the excellent and homely type of house architecture that stillprevails in Philadelphia. These things also have served a purpose well, theyhave their faults, and they can be improved. Our political contrivances, just asmuch as our domestic and mechanical contrivances, need to undergo constantrevision as knowledge and understanding grow.Since the American constitution was planned, our conception of history and ourknowledge of collective psychology has undergone very considerable development.We are beginning to see many things in the problem of government to which themen of the eighteenth century were blind; and, courageous as their constructivedisposition was in relation to whatever political creation had gone before, itfell far short of the boldness which we in these days realize to be needful ifthis great human problem of establishing a civilized community of will in theearth is to be solved. They took many things for granted that now we know needto be made the subject of the most exacting scientific study and the mostcareful adjustment. They thought it was only necessary to set up schools andcolleges, with a grant of land for maintenance, and that they might then be leftto themselves. But education is not a weed that will grow lustily in any soil,it is a necessary and delicate crop that may easily wilt and degenerate. Welearn nowadays that the under-development of universities and educationalmachinery is like some under-development of the brain and nerves, which hampersthe whole growth of the social body. By European standards, by the standard ofany state that has existed hitherto, the level of the common education ofAmerica is high; but by the standard of what it might be, America is anuneducated country. And those fathers of America thought also that they had butto leave the press free, and everyone would live in the light. They did notrealize that a free press could develop a sort of constitutional venality due toits relations with advertisers, and that large newspaper proprietors couldbecome buccaneers of opinion and insensate wreckers of good beginnings. And,finally, the makers of America had no knowledge of the complexities of votemanipulation. The whole science of elections was beyond their ken, they knewnothing of the need of the transferable vote to prevent the “working” ofelections by specialized organizations, and the crude and rigid methods theyadopted left their political system the certain prey of the great party machinesthat have robbed American democracy of half its freedom and most of itspolitical soul. Politics became a trade, and a very base trade; decent and ablemen, after the first great period, drifted out of politics and attended to“business,” and what I have called elsewhere the “sense of the state”3[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en77] declined. Private enterpriseruled in many matters of common concern, because political corruption madecollective enterprise impossible.Yet the defects of the great political system created by the Americans of therevolutionary period did not appear at once. For several generations the historyof the United States was one of rapid expansion and of an amount of freedom,homely happiness, and energetic work unparalleled in the world’s history. Andthe record of America for the whole last century and a half, in spite of manyreversions towards inequality, in spite of much rawness and much blundering, isnevertheless as bright and honourable a story as that of any other contemporarypeople.In this brief account of the creation of the United States of America we havebeen able to do little more than mention the names of some of the group of greatmen who made this new departure in human history. We have named casually or wehave not even named such men as Tom Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Patrick Henry,Thomas Jefferson, the Adam cousins, Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and GeorgeWashington. It is hard to measure the men of one period of history with those inanother. Some writers, even American writers, impressed by the artificialsplendours of the European courts and by the tawdry and destructive exploits ofa Frederick the Great or a Great Catherine, display a snobbish shame ofsomething homespun about these makers of America. They feel that BenjaminFranklin at the court of Louis XVI, with his long hair, his plain clothes, andhis pawky manner, was sadly lacking in aristocratic distinction. But stripped totheir personalities, Louis XVI was hardly gifted enough or noble-minded enoughto be Franklin’s valet. If human greatness is a matter of scale and glitter,then no doubt Alexander the Great is at the apex of human greatness. But isgreatness that? Is not a great man rather one who, in a great position or amidstgreat opportunities—and great gifts are no more than great opportunities—servesGod and his fellows with a humble heart? And quite a number of these Americansof the revolutionary time do seem to have displayed much disinterestedness anddevotion. They were limited men, fallible men; Washington was, for example, aconspicuously indolent man; but on the whole they seemed to have cared more forthe commonweal they were creating than for any personal end or personal vanity.052 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_052_r1.gif]They were all limited men. They were limited in knowledge and outlook; they werelimited by the limitations of the time. And there was no perfect man among them.They were, like all of us, men of mixed motives; good impulses arose in theirminds, great ideas swept through them, and also they could be jealous, lazy,obstinate, greedy, vicious. If one were to write a true, full, and particularhistory of the making of the United States, it would have to be written withcharity and high spirits as a splendid comedy. And in no other regard do we findthe rich tortuous humanity of the American story so finely displayed as inregard to slavery. Slavery, having regard to the general question of labour, isthe test of this new soul in the world’s history, the American soul.053 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_053_r1.gif]Slavery began very early in the European history of America, and no Europeanpeople who went to America can be held altogether innocent in the matter. At atime when the German is still the moral whipping-boy of Europe, it is well tonote that the German record is in this respect the best of all. Almost the firstoutspoken utterances against negro slavery came from German settlers inPennsylvania. But the German settler was working with free labour upon atemperate countryside, well north of the plantation zone; he was not underserious temptation in this matter. American slavery began with the enslavementof Indians for gang work in mines and upon plantations, and it is curious tonote that it was a very good and humane man indeed, Las Casas, who urged thatnegroes should be brought to America to relieve his tormented Indian protégés.The need for labour upon the plantations of the West Indies and the south wasimperative. When the supply of Indian captives proved inadequate, the plantersturned not only to the negro, but to the jails and poorhouses of Europe for asupply of toilers. The reader of Defoe’s Moll Flanders will learn how thebusiness of Virginian white slavery looked to an intelligent Englishman in theearly eighteenth century. But the negro came very early. The year (1620) thatsaw the Pilgrim Fathers landing at Plymouth in New England, saw a Dutch sloopdisembarking the first cargo of negroes at Jamestown in Virginia. Negro slaverywas as old as New England; it had been an American institution for over acentury and a half before the War of Independence. It was to struggle on for thebetter part of a century more.But the conscience of thoughtful men in the colonies was never quite easy uponthis score, and it was one of the accusations of Thomas Jefferson against thecrown and lords of Great Britain that every attempt to ameliorate or restrainthe slave trade on the part of the colonists had been checked by the greatproprietary interests in the mother country.4[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en78] With the moral andintellectual ferment of the revolution, the question of negro slavery came rightinto the foreground of the public conscience. The contrast and the challengeglared upon the mind. “All men are by nature free and equal,” said the VirginiaBill of Rights, and outside in the sunshine, under the whip of the overseer,toiled the negro slave.It witnesses to the great change in human ideas since the Roman Imperial systemdissolved under the barbarian inrush, that there could be this heart-searching.Conditions of industry, production, and land tenure had long prevented anyrecrudescence of gang slavery; but now the cycle had come round again, and therewere enormous immediate advantages to be reaped by the owning and ruling classesin the revival of that ancient institution in mines, upon plantations, and upongreat public works. It was revived—but against great opposition. From thebeginning of the revival there were protests, and they grew. The revival wascounter to the new conscience of mankind. In some respects the new gang slaverywas worse than anything in the ancient world. Peculiarly horrible was theprovocation by the trade of slave wars and man hunts in Western Africa, and thecruelties of the long transatlantic voyage. The poor creatures were packed onthe ships often with insufficient provision of food and water, without propersanitation, without medicines. Many who could tolerate slavery upon theplantations found the slave trade too much for their moral digestions. ThreeEuropean nations were chiefly concerned in this dark business, Britain, Spain,and Portugal, because they were the chief owners of the new lands in America.The comparative innocence of the other European powers is to be ascribed largelyto their lesser temptations. They were similar communities; in parallelcircumstances they would have behaved similarly.Throughout the middle part of the eighteenth century there was an activeagitation against negro slavery in Great Britain as well as in the States. Itwas estimated that in 1770 there were fifteen thousand slaves in Britain, mostlybrought over by their owners from the West Indies and Virginia. In 1771 theissue came to a conclusive test in Britain before Lord Mansfield. A negro namedJames Somersett had been brought to England from Virginia by his owner. He ranaway, was captured, and violently taken on a ship to be returned to Virginia.From the ship he was extracted by a writ of habeas corpus. Lord Mansfielddeclared that slavery was a condition unknown to English law, an “odious”condition, and Somersett walked out of the court a free man.The Massachusetts constitution of 1780 had declared that “all men are born freeand equal.” A certain negro, Quaco, put this to the test in 1783, and in thatyear the soil of Massachusetts became like the soil of Britain, intolerant ofslavery; to tread upon it was to become free. At that time no other state in theUnion followed this example. At the census of 1790, Massachusetts, alone of allthe states, returned “no slaves.”The state of opinion in Virginia is remarkable, because it brings to light thepeculiar difficulties of the southern states. The great Virginian statesmen,such as Washington and Jefferson, condemned the institution, yet because therewas no other form of domestic service, Washington owned slaves. There was inVirginia a strong party in favour of emancipating slaves. But they demanded thatthe emancipated slaves should leave the state within a year or be outlawed! Theywere naturally alarmed at the possibility that a free barbaric black community,many of its members African-born and reeking with traditions of cannibalism andsecret and dreadful religious rites, should arise beside them upon Virginiansoil. When we consider that point of view, we can understand why it was that alarge number of Virginians should be disposed to retain the mass of blacks inthe country under control as slaves, while at the same time they were bitterlyopposed to the slave trade and the importation of any fresh blood from Africa.The free blacks, one sees, might easily become a nuisance; indeed the free stateof Massachusetts presently closed its borders to their entry. . . . The questionof slavery, which in the ancient world was usually no more than a question ofstatus between individuals racially akin, merged in America with the differentand profounder question of relationship between two races at opposite extremesof the human species and of the most, contrasted types of tradition and culture.If the black man had been white, there can be little doubt that negro slavery,like white servitude, would have vanished from the United States within ageneration of the Declaration of Independence as a natural consequence of thestatements in that declaration.§ 7We have told of the War of Independence in America as the first great break awayfrom the system of European monarchies and foreign offices, as the repudiationby a new community of Machiavellian statescraft as the directive form of humanaffairs. Within a decade there came a second and much more portentous revoltagainst this strange game of Great Powers, this tangled interaction of courtsand policies, which obsessed Europe. But this time it was no breaking away atthe outskirts. In France, the nest and home of Grand Monarchy, the heart andcentre of Europe, came this second upheaval. And, unlike the American colonists,who simply repudiated a king, the French, following in the footsteps of theEnglish revolution, beheaded one.Like the British revolution and like the revolution in the United States, theFrench revolution can he traced back to the ambitious absurdities of the Frenchmonarchy. The schemes of aggrandisement, the aims and designs of the GrandMonarch, necessitated an expenditure upon war equipment throughout Europe out ofall proportion to the taxable capacity of the age. And even the splendours ofmonarchy were enormously costly, measured by the productivity of the time. InFrance, just as in Britain and in America, the first resistance was made not tothe monarch as such and to his foreign policy as such, nor with any clearrecognition of these things as the roots of the trouble, but merely to theinconveniences and charges upon the individual life caused by them. Thepractical taxable capacity of France must have been relatively much less thanthat of England because of the various exemptions of the nobility and clergy.The burthen resting directly upon the common people was heavier. That made theupper classes the confederates of the court instead of the antagonists of thecourt as they were in England, and so prolonged the period of waste further; butwhen at last the bursting-point did come, the explosion was more violent andshattering.During the years of the American War of Independence there were few signs of anyimpending explosion in France. There was much misery among the lower classes,much criticism and satire, much outspoken liberal thinking, but there was littleto indicate that the thing as a whole, with all its customs, usages, andfamiliar discords, might not go on for an indefinite time. It was consumingbeyond its powers of production, but as yet only the inarticulate classes werefeeling the pinch. Gibbon, the historian, knew France well; Paris was asfamiliar to him as London; but there is no suspicion to be detected in thepassage we have quoted that days of political and social dissolution were athand. No doubt the world abounded in absurdities and injustices, yetnevertheless, from the point of view of a scholar and a gentleman, it was fairlycomfortable, and it seemed fairly secure.There was much liberal thought, speech, and sentiment in France at this time.Parallel with and a little later than John Locke in England, Montesquieu(1689-1755) in France, in the earlier half of the eighteenth century, hadsubjected social, political, and religious institutions to the same searchingand fundamental analysis, especially in his Esprit des Lois. He had stripped themagical prestige from the absolutist monarchy in France. He shares with Lockethe credit for clearing away many of the false ideas that had hitherto preventeddeliberate and conscious attempts to reconstruct human society. It was not hisfault if at first some extremely unsound and impermanent shanties were run up onthe vacant site. The generation that followed him in the middle and laterdecades of the eighteenth century was boldly speculative upon the moral andintellectual clearings he had made. A group of brilliant writers, the“Encyclopædists,” mostly rebel spirits from the excellent schools of theJesuits, set themselves under the leadership of Diderot to scheme out, in agroup of works, a new world (1766). The glory of the Encylopædists, says Mallet,lay “in their hatred of things unjust, in their denunciation of the trade inslaves, of the inequalities of taxation, of the corruption of justice, of thewastefulness of wars, in their dreams of social progress, in their sympathy withthe rising empire of industry which was beginning to transform the world.” Theirchief error seems to have been an indiscriminate hostility to religion. Theybelieved that man was naturally just and politically competent, whereas hisimpulse to social service and self-forgetfulness is usually developed onlythrough an education essentially religious, and sustained only in an atmosphereof honest cooperation. Uncoordinated human initiatives lead to nothing butsocial chaos.Side by side with the Encyclopædists were the Economists or Physiocrats, whowere making bold and crude inquiries into the production and distribution offood and goods. Morally, the author of the Code de la Nature, denounced theinstitution of private property and proposed a communistic organization ofsociety. He was the precursor of that large and various school of collectivistthinkers in the nineteenth century who are lumped together as Socialists.Both the Encyclopædists and the various Economists and Physiocrats demanded aconsiderable amount of hard thinking in their disciples. An easier and morepopular leader to follow was Rousseau (1712-78). He displayed a curious minglingof logical rigidity and sentimental enthusiasm. He preached the alluringdoctrine that the primitive state of man was one of virtue and happiness, fromwhich he had declined through the rather inexplicable activities of priests,kings, lawyers, and the like. Rousseau’s intellectual influence was on the wholedemoralizing. It struck not only at the existing social fabric, but at anysocial organization. When he wrote of the Social Contract, he seemed rather toexcuse breaches of the covenant than to emphasize its necessity. Man is so farfrom perfect, that a writer who apparently sustained the thesis that the almostuniversal disposition, against which we all have to fortify ourselves, torepudiate debts, misbehave sexually, and evade the toil and expenses ofeducation for ourselves and others, is not after all a delinquency, but a finedisplay of Natural Virtue, was bound to have a large following in every classthat could read him. Rousseau’s tremendous vogue did much to popularize asentimental and declamatory method of dealing with social and politicalproblems.We have already remarked that hitherto no human community has begun to act upontheory. There must first be some breakdown and necessity for direction that letstheory into her own. Up to 1788 the republican and anarchist talk and writing ofFrench thinkers must have seemed as ineffective and politically unimportant asthe æsthetic socialism of William Morris at the end of the nineteenth century.There was the social and political system going on with an effect of invinciblepersistence, the king hunting and mending his clocks, the court and the world offashion pursuing their pleasures, the financiers conceiving continually moreenterprising extensions of credit, business blundering clumsily along itsancient routes, much incommoded by taxes and imposts, the peasants worrying,toiling, and suffering, full of a hopeless hatred of the nobleman’s château. Mentalked —and felt they were merely talking. Anything might be said, becausenothing would ever happen.§ 8The first jar to this sense of the secure continuity of life in France came in1787, Louis XVI (1774-92) was a dull, ill-educated monarch, and he had themisfortune to be married to a silly and extravagant woman, Marie Antoinette, thesister of the Austrian emperor. The question of her virtue is one of profoundinterest to a certain type of historical writer, but we need not discuss ithere. She lived, as Paul Wiriath5[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en79] puts it, “side by side, butnot at the side” of her husband. She was rather heavy-featured, but not so plainas to prevent her posing as a beautiful, romantic, and haughty queen. When theexchequer was exhausted by the war in America (an enterprise to weaken Englandof the highest Machiavellian quality), when the whole country was uneasy withdiscontents, she set her influence to thwart the attempts at economy of theking’s ministers, to encourage every sort of aristocratic extravagance, and torestore the church and the nobility to the position they had held in the greatdays of Louis XIV. Non-aristocratic officers were to be weeded from the army;the power of the church over private life was to be extended. She found in anupper-class official, Calonne, her ideal minister of finance. From 1783-87 thiswonderful man produced money as if by magic—and as if by magic it disappearedagain. Then in 1787 he collapsed. He had piled loan on loan, and now he declaredthat the monarchy, the Grand Monarchy that had ruled France since the days ofLouis XIV, was bankrupt. No more money could be raised. There must be agathering of the notables of the kingdom to consider the situation.To the gathering of notables, a summoned assembly of leading men, Calonnepropounded a scheme for a subsidy to be levied upon all landed property. Thisroused the aristocrats to a pitch of great indignation. They demanded thesummoning of a body roughly equivalent to the British parliament, the StatesGeneral, which had not met since 1610. Regardless of the organ of opinion theywere creating for the discontents below them, excited only by the proposal thatthey should bear part of the weight of the financial burthens of the country,the French notables insisted. And in May, 1789, the States General met.It was an assembly of the representatives of three orders, the nobles, theclergy, and the Third Estate, the commons. For the Third Estate the franchisewas very wide, nearly every taxpayer of twenty-five having a vote. (The parishpriests voted as clergy, the small noblesse as nobles.) The States General was abody without any tradition of procedure. Enquiries were sent to the antiquariansof the Academy of Inscriptions in that matter. Its opening deliberations turnedon the question whether it was to meet as one body or as three, each estatehaving an equal vote. Since the Clergy numbered 308, the Nobles 285, and theDeputies 621, the former arrangement would put the Commons in an absolutemajority, the latter gave them one vote in three. Nor had the States General anymeeting-place. Should it meet in Paris or in some provincial city? Versailleswas chosen, “because of the hunting.”It is clear that the king and queen meant to treat this fuss about the nationalfinance as a terrible bore, and to allow it to interfere with their socialroutine as little as possible. We find the meetings going on in salons that werenot wanted, in orangeries and tennis-courts, and so forth.The question whether the voting was to be by the estates or by head was clearlya vital one. It was wrangled over for six weeks. The Third Estate, taking a leaffrom the book of the English House of Commons, then declared that it alonerepresented the nation, and that no taxation must be levied henceforth withoutits consent. Whereupon the king closed the hall in which it was sitting, andintimated that the deputies had better go home. Instead, the deputies met in aconvenient tennis-court, and there took oath, the Oath of the Tennis Court, notto separate until they had established a constitution in France.The king took a high line, and attempted to disperse the Third Estate by force.The soldiers refused to act. On that the king gave in with a dangeroussuddenness, and accepted the principle that the Three Estates should alldeliberate and vote together as one National Assembly. Meanwhile, apparently atthe queen’s instigation, foreign regiments in the French service, who could betrusted to act against the people, were brought up from the provinces under theMarshal de Broglie, and the king prepared to go back upon his concessions.Whereupon Paris and France revolted. Broglie hesitated to fire on the crowds. Aprovisional city government was set up in Paris and in most of the other largecities, and a new armed force, the National Guard, a force designed primarilyand plainly to resist the forces of the crown, was brought into existence bythese municipal bodies.The revolt of July 1789 was really the effective French revolution. Thegrim-looking prison of the Bastille, very feebly defended, was stormed by thepeople of Paris, and the insurrection spread rapidly throughout France. In theeast and north-west provinces many châteaux belonging to the nobility were burntby the peasants, their title-deeds carefully destroyed, and the owners murderedor driven away. The insurrection spread throughout France. In a month theancient and decayed system of the aristocratic order had collapsed. Many of theleading princes and courtiers of the queen’s party fled abroad. The rationalAssembly found itself called upon to create a new political and social systemfor a new age.§ 9The French National Assembly was far less fortunate in the circumstances of itstask than the American Congress. The latter had half a continent to itself, withno possible antagonist but the British Government. Its religious and educationalorganizations were various, collectively not very powerful, and on the wholefriendly. King George was far away in England, and sinking slowly towards animbecile condition. Nevertheless, it took the United States several years tohammer out a working constitution. The French, on the other hand, weresurrounded by aggressive neighbours with Machiavellian ideas, they wereencumbered by a king and court resolved to make mischief, and the church was onesingle great organization inextricably bound up with the ancient order. Thequeen was in close correspondence with the Count of Artois, the Duke of Bourbon,and the other exiled princes who were trying to induce Austria and Prussia toattack the new French nation. Moreover, France was already a bankrupt country,while the United States had limitless undeveloped resources; and the revolution,by altering the conditions of land tenure and marketing, had produced aneconomic disorganization that has no parallel in the case of America.These were the unavoidable difficulties of the situation. But in addition theAssembly made difficulties for itself. There was no orderly procedure. TheEnglish House of Commons had had more than five centuries of experience in itswork, and Mirabeau, one of the great leaders of the early Revolution, tried invain to have the English rules adopted. But the feeling of the times was all infavour of outcries, dramatic interruptions, and such-like manifestations ofNatural Virtue. And the disorder did not come merely from the assembly. Therewas a great gallery, much too great a gallery, for strangers; but who wouldrestrain the free citizens from having a voice in the national control? Thisgallery swarmed with people eager for a “scene,” ready to applaud or shout downthe speakers below. The abler speakers were obliged to play to the gallery, andtake a sentimental and sensational line. It was easy at a crisis to bring in amob to kill debate.So encumbered, the Assembly set about its constructive task. On the Fourth ofAugust it achieved a great dramatic success. Led by several of the liberalnobles, it made a series of resolutions, abolishing serfdom, privileges, taxexemptions, tithes, and feudal courts. (In many parts of the country, however,these resolutions were not carried into effect until three or four years later.)Titles went with these other renunciations. Long before France was a republic itwas an offence for a nobleman to sign his name with his title. For six weeks theAssembly devoted itself, with endless opportunities for rhetoric, to theformulation of a Declaration of the Rights of Man—on the lines of the Bills ofRights that were the English preliminaries to organized change. Meanwhile thecourt plotted for reaction, and the people felt that the court was plotting. Thestory is complicated here by the scoundrelly schemes of the king’s cousin,Philip of Orleans, who hoped to use the discords of the time to replace Louis onthe French throne. His gardens at the Palais Royal were thrown open to thepublic, and became a great centre of advanced discussion. His agents did much tointensify the popular suspicion of the king. And things were exacerbated by ashortage of provisions—for which the king’s government was held guilty.Presently the loyal Flanders regiment appeared at Versailles. The royal familywas scheming to get farther away from Paris—in order to undo all that had beendone, to restore tyranny and extravagance. Such constitutional monarchists asGeneral Lafayette were seriously alarmed. And just at this time occurred anoutbreak of popular indignation at the scarcity of food, that passed by an easytransition into indignation against the threat of royalist reaction. It wasbelieved that there was an abundance of provisions at Versailles; that food wasbeing kept there away from the people. The public mind had been much disturbedby reports, possibly by exaggerated reports, of a recent banquet at Versailles,hostile to the nation. Here are some extracts from Carlyle descriptive of thatunfortunate feast.“The Hall of the Opera is granted; the Salon d’Hercule shall be drawing-room.Not only the Officers of Flandre, but of the Swiss, of the Hundred Swiss; nay ofthe Versailles National Guard, such of them as have any loyalty, shall feast; itwill be a Repast like few.“And now suppose this Repast, the solid part of it, transacted; and the firstbottle over. Suppose the customary loyal toasts drunk; the King’s health, theQueen’s with deafening vivats; that of the nation ‘omitted,’ or even ‘rejected.’Suppose champagne flowing; with pot-valorous speech, with instrumental music;empty featherheads growing ever the noisier, in their own emptiness, in eachother’s noise. Her Majesty, who looks unusually sad tonight (His Majesty sittingdulled with the day’s hunting), is told that the sight of it would cheer her.Behold! She enters there, issuing from her State-rooms, like the Moon fromclouds, this fairest unhappy Queen of Hearts; royal Husband by her side, youngDauphin in her arms! She descends from the Boxes, amid splendour and acclaim;walks queen-like round the Tables; gracefully nodding; her looks full of sorrow,yet of gratitude and daring, with the hope of France on her mother-bosom! Andnow, the band striking up, O Richard, O mon Roi, l’univers t’abandonne (OhRichard, O my king, the world is all forsaking thee), could man do other thanrise to height of pity, of loyal valour? Could feather-headed young ensigns doother than, by white Bourbon Cockades, handed them from fair fingers; by wavingof swords, drawn to pledge the Queen’s health; by trampling of NationalCockades; by scaling the Boxes, whence intrusive murmurs may come; byvociferation, sound, fury and distraction, within doors and without—testify whattempest-tost state of vacuity they are in? . . .“A natural Repast; in ordinary times, a harmless one: now fatal. . . . Poorill-advised Marie Antoinette; with a woman’s vehemence, not with a sovereign’sforesight! It was so natural, yet so unwise. Next day, in public speech ofceremony, her Majesty declares herself ‘delighted with Thursday.’”And here to set against this is Carlyle’s picture of the mood of the people.“In squalid garret, on Monday morning Maternity awakes, to hear children weepingfor bread. Maternity must forth to the streets, to the herb-makers andbakers’-queues; meets there with hunger-stricken Maternity, sympathetic,exasperative. O we unhappy women! But, instead of bakers’-queues, why not toAristocrats’ palaces, the root of the matter? Allons! Let us assemble. To theHôtel-de-Ville; to Versailles. . . .”There was much shouting and coming and going in Paris before this latter idearealized itself. One Maillard appeared with organizing power, and assumed acertain leadership. There can be little doubt that the revolutionary leaders,and particularly General Lafayette, used and organized this outbreak to securethe king, before he could slip away—as Charles I did to Oxford —to begin a civilwar. As the afternoon wore on, the procession started on its eleven mile tramp.. . .Again we quote Carlyle:“Maillard has halted his draggled Menads on the last hill-top; and nowVersailles, and the Château of Versailles, and far and wide the inheritance ofRoyalty opens to the wondering eye. From far on the right, over Marly andSaint-Germain-en-Laye; round towards Rambouillet, on the left, beautiful all;softly embosomed; as if in sadness, in the dim moist weather! And near before usis Versailles, New and Old; with that broad frondent Avenue de Versaillesbetween—stately frondent, broad, three hundred feet as men reckon, with its fourrows of elms; and then the Château de Versailles, ending in royal parks andpleasances, gleaming lakelets, arbours, labyrinths, the Ménagerie, and Great andLittle Trianon. High-towered dwellings, leafy pleasant places; where the gods ofthis lower world abide: whence, nevertheless, black care cannot be excluded;whither Menadic hunger is even now advancing, armed with pike-thyrsi!”Rain fell as the evening closed.“Behold the Esplanade, over all its spacious expanse, is covered with groups ofsqualid dripping women; of lank-haired male rascality, armed with axes, rustypikes, old muskets, iron-shod clubs (batons ferrés, which end in knives orswordblades, a kind of extempore billhook); looking nothing but hungry revolt.The rain pours; Gardes-du-Corps so caracoling through the groups ‘amid hisses’;irritating and agitating what is but dispersed here to reunite there. . . .“Innumerable squalid women beleaguer the President and Deputation; insist ongoing with him: has not his Majesty himself, looking from the window, sent outto ask, What we wanted? ‘Bread, and speech with the King,’ that was the answer.Twelve women are clamourously added to the deputation; and march with it, acrossthe Esplanade; through dissipated groups, caracoling bodyguards and the pouringrain.”“Bread and not too much talking!” Natural demands.“One learns also that the royal Carriages are getting yoked, as if for Metz.Carriages, royal or not, have verily showed themselves at the back gates. Theyeven produced, or quoted, a written order from our Versailles Municipality—whichis a monarchic not a democratic one. However, Versailles patrols drove them inagain; as the vigilant Lecointre had strictly charged them to do. . . .“So sink the shadows of night, blustering, rainy; and all paths grow dark.Strangest night ever seen in these regions; perhaps since the Bartholomew Night,when Versailles, as Bassompierre writes of it, was a chetif château.“O for the lyre of some Orpheus, to constrain, with touch of melodious strings,these mad masses into Order! For here all seems fallen asunder, in wide-yawningdislocation. The highest, as in down-rushing of a world, is come in contact withthe lowest: the rascality of France beleaguering the royalty of France;‘iron-shod batons’ lifted round the diadem, not to guard it! With denunciationsof bloodthirsty anti-national body-guards, are heard dark growlings against aqueenly name.“The Court sits tremulous, powerless: varies with the varying temper of theEsplanade, with the varying colour of the rumours from Paris. Thick-comingrumours; now of peace, now of war. Necker and all the Ministers consult; with ablank issue. The Œil-de-Bœuf is one tempest of whispers: We will fly to Metz; wewill not fly. The royal carriages again attempt egress—though for trial merely;they are again driven in by Lecointre’s patrols.”But we must send the reader to Carlyle to learn of the coming of the NationalGuard in the night under General Lafayette himself, the bargaining between theAssembly and the King, the outbreak of fighting in the morning between thebodyguard and the hungry besiegers, and how the latter stormed into the palaceand came near to a massacre of the royal family. Lafayette and his troops turnedout in time to prevent that, and timely cartloads of loaves arrive from Parisfor the crowd.At last it was decided that the king should come to Paris.“Processional marches not a few our world has seen; Roman triumphs and ovations,Cabiric cymbal-beatings, Royal progresses, Irish funerals; but this of theFrench Monarchy marching to its bed remained to be seen. Miles long, and ofbreadth losing itself in vagueness, for all the neighbouring country crowds tosee. Slow: stagnating along, like shoreless Lake, yet with a noise like Niagara,like Babel and Bedlam. A splashing and a tramping; a hurrahing, uproaring,musket- volleying; the truest segment of Chaos seen in these latter Ages! Tillslowly it disembogue itself, in the thickening dusk, into expectant Paris,through a double row of faces all the way from Passy to the Hôtel-de-Ville.“Consider this: Vanguard of National troops; with trains of artillery; ofpikemen and pikewomen, mounted on cannons, on carts, hackney-coaches, or onfoot. . . . Loaves stuck on the points of bayonets, green boughs stuck ingun-barrels. Next, as main-march, ‘fifty cart-loads of corn,’ which have beenlent, for peace, from the stores of Versailles. Behind which follow stragglersof the Garde-du-Corps; all humiliated, in Grenadier bonnets. Close on thesecomes the royal carriage; come royal carriages; for there are a hundred nationaldeputies too, among whom sits Mirabeau —his remarks not given. Then finally,pell-mell, as rear-guard, Flandre, Swiss, Hundred Swiss, other bodyguards,brigands, whosoever cannot get before. Between and among all which masses flowswithout limit Saint-Antoine and the Menadic cohort. Menadic especially about theroyal carriage. . . . Covered with tricolor; singing ‘allusive songs’; pointingwith one hand to the royal carriage, which the allusions hit, and pointing tothe provision-wagons with the other hand, and these words: ‘Courage, Friends! Weshall not want bread now; we are bringing you the Baker, the Bakeress andBaker’s boy.’ . . .“The wet day draggles the tricolor, but the joy is unextinguish able. Is not allwell now? ‘Ah Madame, notre bonne Reine,’ said some of these Strong-women somedays hence, ‘Ah, Madame, our good Queen, don’t be a traitor any more and we willall love you!’ . . .”This was October the sixth, 1789. For nearly two years the royal family dweltunmolested in the Tuileries. Had the court kept common faith with the people,the king might have died there, a king.From 1789 to 1791 the early Revolution held its own; France was a limitedmonarchy, the king kept a diminished state in the Tuileries, and the NationalAssembly ruled a country at peace. The reader who will glance back to the mapsof Poland we have given in the previous chapter will realize what occupiedRussia, Prussia, and Austria at this time. While France experimented with acrowned republic in the west, the last division of the crowned republic of theeast, was in progress. France could wait.When we consider its inexperience, the conditions under which it worked, and thecomplexities of its problems, one must concede that the Assembly did a veryremarkable amount of constructive work. Much of that work was sound and stillendures, much was experimental and has been undone. Some was disastrous. Therewas a clearing up of the penal code; torture, arbitrary imprisonment, andpersecutions for heresy were abolished. The ancient provinces of France,Normandy, Burgundy, and the like gave place to eighty departments. Promotion tothe highest ranks in the army was laid open to men of every class. An excellentand simple system of law courts was set up, but its value was much vitiated byhaving the judges appointed by popular election for short periods of time. Thismade the crowd a sort of final court of appeal, and the judges, like the membersof the Assembly, were forced to play to the gallery. And the whole vast propertyof the church was seized and administered by the state; religious establishmentsnot engaged in education or works of charity were broken up, and the salaries ofthe clergy made a charge upon the nation. This in itself was not a bad thing forthe lower clergy in France, who were often scandalously underpaid in comparisonwith the richer dignitaries. But in addition the choice of priests and bishopswas made elective, which struck, at the very root idea of the Roman church,which centred everything upon the Pope, and in which all authority is from abovedownward. Practically the National Assembly wanted at one blow to make thechurch in France Protestant, in organization if not in doctrine. Everywherethere were disputes and conflicts between the state priests created by theNational Assembly and the recalcitrant (non-juring) priests who were loyal toRome. . . .One curious thing the National Assembly did which greatly weakened its grip onaffairs. It decreed that no member of the Assembly should be an executiveminister. This was in imitation of the American constitution, where alsoministers are separated from the legislature. The British method has been tohave all ministers in the legislative body, ready to answer questions andaccount for their interpretation of the laws and their conduct of the nation’sbusiness. If the legislature represents the sovereign people, then it is surelynecessary for the ministers to be in the closest touch with their sovereign.This severance of the legislature and executive in France causedmisunderstandings and mistrust; the legislature lacked control and the executivelacked moral force. This led to such an ineffectiveness in the centralgovernment that in many districts at this time, communes and towns were to befound that were practically self-governing communities; they accepted orrejected the commands of Paris as they thought fit, declined the payment oftaxes, and divided up the church lands according to their local appetites.§ 10It is quite possible that with the loyal support of the crown and a reasonablepatriotism on the part of the nobility, the National Assembly, in spite of itsnoisy galleries, its Rousseauism, and its inexperience, might have blunderedthrough to a stable form of parliamentary government for France. In Mirabeau ithad a statesman with clear ideas of the needs of the time; he knew the strengthand the defects of the British system, and apparently he had set himself toestablish in France a parallel political organization upon a wider, more honestfranchise. He had, it is true, indulged in a sort of Ruritanian flirtation withthe queen, seen her secretly, pronounced her very solemnly the “only man” aboutthe king, and made rather a fool of himself in that matter, but his schemes weredrawn upon a much larger scale than the scale of the back stairs of theTuileries. By his death in 1791 France certainly lost one of her mostconstructive statesmen, and the National Assembly its last chance of anycooperation with the king. When there is a court there is usually a conspiracy,and royalist schemes and royalist mischief-making were the last straw in thebalance against the National Assembly. The royalists did not care for Mirabeau,they did not care for France; they wanted to be back in their lost paradise ofprivilege, haughtiness, and limitless expenditure, and it seemed to them that ifonly they could make the government of the National Assembly impossible, then bya sort of miracle the dry bones of the ancient régime would live again. They hadno sense of the other possibility, the gulf of the republican extremists, thatyawned at their feet.One June night in 1791, between eleven o’clock and midnight, the king and queenand their two children slipped out of the Tuileries disguised, threaded theirpalpitating way through Paris, circled round from the north of the city to theeast, and got at last into a travelling-carriage that was waiting upon the roadto Chalons. They were flying to the army of the east. The army of the east was“loyal,” that is to say, its general and officers at least were prepared tobetray France to the king and court. Here was adventure at last after thequeen’s heart, and one can understand the pleasurable excitement of the littleparty as the miles lengthened between themselves and Paris. Away over the hillswere reverence, deep bows, and the kissing of hands. Then back to Versailles. Alittle shooting of the mob in Paris—artillery, if need be. A few executions—butnot of the sort of people who matter. A White Terror for a few months. Then allwould be well again. Perhaps Calonne might return, too, with fresh financialexpedients. He was busy just then gathering support among the German princes.There were a lot of châteaux to rebuild, but the people who burnt them downcould hardly complain if the task of rebuilding them pressed rather heavily upontheir grimy necks....054 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_054_r1.gif]All such bright anticipations were cruelly dashed that night at Varennes. Theking had been recognized at Sainte Menehould by the landlord of the post house,and as the night fell, the eastward roads clattered with galloping messengersrousing the country, and trying to intercept the fugitives. There were freshhorses waiting in the upper village of Varennes—the young officer in charge hadgiven the king up for the night and gone to bed—while for half an hour in thelower village the poor king, disguised as a valet, disputed with hispostillions, who had expected reliefs in the lower village and refused to gofurther. Finally they consented to go on. They consented too late. The littleparty found the post-master from Sainte Menehould, who had ridden past while thepostillions wrangled, and a number of worthy republicans of Varennes whom he hadgathered together, awaiting them at the bridge between the two parts of thetown. The bridge was barricaded. Muskets were thrust into the carriage: “Yourpassports?”The king surrendered without a struggle. The little party was taken into thehouse of some village functionary. “Well,” said the king, “here you have me!”Also he remarked that he was hungry. At dinner he commended the wine, “quiteexcellent wine.” What the queen said is not recorded. There were royalist troopsat hand, but they attempted no rescue. The tocsin, began to ring, and thevillage “illuminated itself,” to guard against surprise. . . .A very crestfallen coachload of royalty returned to Paris, and was received byvast crowds—in silence. The word had gone forth that whoever insulted the kingshould be thrashed, and whoever applauded him should be killed. . . .It was only after this foolish exploit that the idea of a republic took hold ofthe French mind. Before this flight to Varennes there was no doubt much abstractrepublican sentiment, but there was scarcely any expressed disposition toabolish monarchy in France. Even in July, a month after the flight, a greatmeeting in the Champ de Mars, supporting a petition for the dethronement of theking, was dispersed by the authorities, and many people were killed. But suchdisplays of firmness could not prevent the lesson of that flight soaking intomen’s minds. Just as in England in the days of Charles I, so now in France menrealized that the king could not be trusted—he was dangerous. The Jacobins grewrapidly in strength. Their leaders, Robespierre, Danton, Marat, who had hithertobeen figured as impossible extremists, began to dominate French affairs.These Jacobins were the equivalents of the American radicals, men withuntrammelled advanced ideas. Their strength lay in the fact that they wereunencumbered and downright. They were poor men with nothing to lose. The partyof moderation, of compromise with the relics of the old order, was led by suchmen of established position as General Lafayette, the general who hadrepresented France in America, and Mirabeau, an aristocrat who was ready tomodel himself on the rich and influential aristocrats of England. ButRobespierre was a needy but clever young lawyer from Arras, whose most preciouspossession was his faith in Rousseau; Danton was a scarcely more wealthybarrister in Paris, a big, gesticulating, rhetorical figure; Marat was an olderman, a Swiss of very great scientific distinction, but equally unembarrassed bypossessions. On Marat’s scientific standing it is necessary to lay stressbecause there is a sort of fashion among English writers to misrepresent theleaders of great revolutionary movements as ignorant men. This gives a falseview of the mental processes of revolution; and it is the task of the historianto correct it. Marat, we find, was conversant with English, Spanish, German, andItalian; he had spent several years in England, he was made an honorary M.D. ofSt. Andrew’s, and had published some valuable contributions to medical sciencein English. Both Benjamin Franklin and Goethe were greatly interested in hiswork in physics. This is the man who is called by Carlyle “rabid dog,”“atrocious,” “squalid,” and “Dog-leech”—this last by way of tribute to hisscience.The revolution called Marat to politics, and his earliest contributions to thegreat discussion were fine and sane. There was a prevalent delusion in Francethat England was a land of liberty. His Tableau des vices de la constitution,d’Angleterre showed the realities of the English position. His last years weremaddened by an almost intolerable skin disease which he caught while hiding inthe sewers of Paris to escape the consequences of his denunciation of the kingas a traitor after the flight to Varennes. Only by sitting in a hot bath couldhe collect his mind to write. He had been treated hardly and suffered, and hebecame hard; nevertheless he stands out in history as a man of rare, unblemishedhonesty. His poverty seems particularly to have provoked the scorn of Carlyle.“What a road he has travelled; and sits now, about half-past seven of the clock,stewing in slipper-bath; sore afflicted; ill of Revolution Fever. . . .Excessively sick and worn, poor man: with precisely elevenpence halfpenny ofready-money, in paper; with slipper-bath; strong three-footed stool for writingon, the while: and a squalid Washerwoman for his sole household. . . . that ishis civic establishment in Medical-School Street; thither and not elsewhere hashis road led him. . . . Hark, a rap again! A musical woman’s voice, refusing tobe rejected: it is the Citoyenne who would do France a service. Marat,recognizing from within, cries, Admit her. Charlotte Corday is admitted.”The young heroine—for republican leaders are fair game, and their assassins arenecessarily heroines and their voices “musical”—offered to give him somenecessary information about the counter-revolution at Caen, and as he wasoccupied in making a note of her facts, she stabbed him with a large sheathknife (1792). . . .Such was the quality of most of the leaders of the Jacobin party. They were menof no property—untethered men. They were more dissociated and more elemental,therefore, than any other party; and they were ready to push the ideas offreedom and equality to a logical extremity. Their standards of patriotic virtuewere high and harsh. There was something inhuman even in their humanitarianzeal. They saw without humour the disposition of the moderates to ease thingsdown, to keep the common folk just a little needy and respectful, and royalty(and men of substance) just a little respected. They were blinded by the formulæof Rousseauism to the historical truth that man is by nature oppressor andoppressed, and that it is only slowly by law, education, and the spirit of lovein the world that men can be made happy and free.And while in America the formulæ of eighteenth-century democracy were on thewhole stimulating and helpful because it was already a land of open-airpractical equality so far as white men were concerned, in France these formulæmade a very heady and dangerous mixture for the town populations, becauseconsiderable parts of the towns of France were slums full of dispossessed,demoralized, degraded, and bitter-spirited people. The Parisian crowd was in aparticularly desperate and dangerous state, because the industries of Paris hadbeen largely luxury industries, and much of her employment parasitic on theweaknesses and vices of fashionable life. Now the fashionable world had goneover the frontier, travellers were restricted, business disordered, and the cityfull of unemployed and angry people.But the royalists, instead of realizing the significance of these Jacobins withtheir dangerous integrity and their dangerous grip upon the imagination of themob, had the conceit to think they could make tools of them. The time for thereplacement of the National Assembly under the new-made constitution by the“Legislative Assembly” was drawing near; and when the Jacobins, with the idea ofbreaking up the moderates, proposed to make the members of the National Assemblyineligible for the Legislative Assembly, the royalists supported them with greatglee, and carried the proposal. They perceived that the Legislative Assembly, soclipped of all experience, must certainly be a politically incompetent body.They would “extract good from the excess of evil,” and presently France wouldfall back helpless into the hands of her legitimate masters. So they thought.And the royalists did more than this. They backed the election of a Jacobin asMayor of Paris. It was about as clever as if a man brought home a hungry tigerto convince his wife of her need of him. There stood another body ready at handwith which these royalists did not reckon, far better equipped than the court tostep in and take the place of an ineffective Legislative Assembly, and that wasthe strongly Jacobin Commune of Paris installed at the Hotôl de Ville.So far France had been at peace. None of her neighbours had attacked her,because she appeared to be weakening herself by her internal dissensions. It wasPoland that suffered by the distraction of France. But there seemed no reasonwhy they should not insult and threaten her, and prepare the way for a laterpartition at their convenience. At Pillnitz, in 1791, the King of Prussia andthe Emperor of Austria met, and issued a declaration that the restoration oforder and monarchy in France was a matter of interest to all sovereigns. And anarmy of émigrés, French nobles and gentlemen, an army largely of officers, wasallowed to accumulate close to the frontier.It was France that declared war against Austria. The motives of those whosupported this step were conflicting. Many republicans wanted it because theywished to see the kindred people of Belgium liberated from the Austrian yoke.Many royalists wanted it because they saw in war a possibility of restoring theprestige of the crown. Marat opposed it bitterly in his paper L’Ami du Peuple,because he did not want to see republican enthusiasm turned into war fever. Hisinstinct warned him of Napoleon. On April 20th, 1792, the king came down to theAssembly and proposed war amidst great applause.The war began disastrously. Three French armies entered Belgium, two were badlybeaten, and the third, under Lafayette, retreated. Then Prussia declared war insupport of Austria, and the allied forces, under the Duke of Brunswick, preparedto invade France. The duke issued one of the most foolish proclamations inhistory; he was, he said, invading France to restore the royal authority. Anyfurther indignity shown the king he threatened to visit upon the Assembly andParis with “military execution.” This was surely enough to make the mostroyalist Frenchman a republican—at least for the duration of the war.The new phase of revolution, the Jacobin revolution, was the direct outcome ofthis proclamation. It made the Legislative Assembly, in which orderlyrepublicans (Girondins) and royalists prevailed, it made the government whichhad put down that republican meeting in the Champ de Mars and hunted Marat intothe sewers, impossible. The insurgents gathered at the Hôtel de Ville, and onthe tenth of August the Commune launched an attack on the palace of theTuileries.The king behaved with a clumsy stupidity, and with that disregard for otherswhich is the prerogative of kings. He had with him a Swiss guard of nearly athousand men as well as National Guards of uncertain loyalty. He held outvaguely until firing began, and then he went off to the adjacent Assembly toplace himself and his family under its protection, leaving his Swiss fighting.So doubt he hoped to antagonize Assembly and Commune, but the Assembly had noneof the fighting spirit of the Hôtel de Ville. The royal refugees were placed ina box reserved for journalists (out of which a small room opened), and therethey remained for sixteen hours while the Assembly debated their fate. Outsidethere were the sounds of a considerable battle; every now and then a windowwould break. The unfortunate Swiss were fighting with their backs to the wallbecause there was now nothing else for them to do. . . .The Assembly had no stomach to back the government’s action of July in the Champde Mars. The fierce vigour of the Commune dominated it. The king found nocomfort whatever in the Assembly. It scolded him and discussed his “suspension.”The Swiss fought until they received a message from the king to desist, andthen—the crowd being savagely angry at the needless bloodshed and out ofcontrol—they were for the most part massacred.The long and tedious attempt to “Merovingianize” Louis, to make an honestcrowned republican out of a dull and in-adaptable absolute monarch, was nowdrawing to its tragic close. The Commune of Paris was practically in control ofFrance. The Legislative Assembly—which had apparently undergone a change ofheart—decreed that the king was suspended from his office, confined him in theTemple, replaced him by an executive commission, and summoned a NationalConvention to frame a new constitution.The tension of patriotic and republican France was now becoming intolerable.Such armies as she had were rolling back helplessly towards Paris. Longwy hadfallen, the great fortress of Verdun followed, and nothing seemed likely to stopthe march of the allies upon the capital. The sense of royalist treachery roseto panic cruelty. At any rate the royalists had to be silenced and stilled andscared out of sight. The Commune set itself to hunt out every royalist thatcould be found, until the prisons of Paris were full. Marat saw the danger of amassacre. Before it was too late he tried to secure the establishment ofemergency tribunals to filter the innocent from the guilty in this miscellaneouscollection of schemers, suspects, and harmless gentlefolk. He was disregarded,and early in September the inevitable massacre occurred.055 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_055_r1.gif]Suddenly, first at one prison and then at others, bands of insurgents tookpossession. A sort of rough court was constituted, and outside gathered a wildmob armed with sabres, pikes, and axes. One by one the prisoners, men and womenalike, were led out from their cells, questioned briefly, pardoned with the cryof “Vive la Nation,” or thrust out to the mob at the gates. There the crowdjostled and fought to get a slash or thrust at a victim. The condemned werestabbed, hacked, and beaten to death, their heads hewn off, stuck on pikes, andcarried about the town, their torn bodies thrust aside. Among others, thePrincesse de Lamballe, whom the king and queen had left behind in the Tuileries,perished. Her head was carried on a pike to the Temple for the queen to see.In the queen’s cell were two National Guards. One would have had her look outand see this grisly sight. The other, in pity, would not let her do so.Even as this red tragedy was going on in Paris, the French general Dumouriez,who had rushed an army from Flanders into the forests of the Argonne, washolding up the advance of the allies beyond Verdun. On September 20th occurred abattle, mainly an artillery encounter, at Valmy. A not very resolute Prussianadvance was checked, the French infantry stood firm, their artillery was betterthan the allied artillery. For ten days after this repulse the Duke of Brunswickhesitated, and then he began to fall back towards the Rhine. This battle atValmy—it was little more than a cannonade—was one of the decisive battles in theworld’s history. The Revolution was saved.The National Convention met on September 21st, 1792, and immediately proclaimeda republic. The trial and execution of the king followed with a sort of logicalnecessity upon these things. He died rather as a symbol than as a man. There wasnothing else to be done with him; poor man, he cumbered the earth. France couldnot let him go to hearten the emigrants, could not keep him harmless at home;his existence threatened her. Marat had urged this trial relentlessly, yet withthat acid clearness of his he would not have the king charged with any offencecommitted before he signed the constitution, because before then he was a realmonarch, super-legal, and so incapable of being illegal. Nor would Marat permitattacks upon the king’s counsel. . . . Throughout Marat played a bitter and yetoften a just part; he was a great man, a fine intelligence, in a skin of fire;wrung with that organic hate in the blood that is not a product of the mind butof the body.Louis was beheaded in January, 1793. He was guillotined—for since the previousAugust the guillotine had been in use as the official instrument in Frenchexecutions.Danton, in his leonine rôle, was very fine upon this occasion. “The kings ofEurope would challenge us,” he roared. “We throw them the head of a king!”§ 11And now followed a strange phase in the history of the French people. Therearose a great flame of enthusiasm, for France and the Republic. There was to bean end to compromise at home and abroad; at home royalists and every form ofdisloyalty were to be stamped out; abroad France was to be the protector andhelper of all revolutionaries. All Europe, all the world, was to becomerepublican. The youth of France poured into the Republican armies; a new andwonderful song spread through the land, a song that still warms the blood likewine, the Marseillaise. Before that chant and the leaping columns of Frenchbayonets and their enthusiastically served guns the foreign armies rolled back;before the end of 1792 the French armies had gone far beyond the utmostachievements of Louis XIV; everywhere they stood on foreign soil. They were inBrussels, they had overrun Savoy, they had raided to Mayence; they had seizedthe Scheldt from Holland. Then the French Government did an unwise thing. It hadbeen exasperated by the expulsion of its representative from England upon theexecution of Louis, and it declared war against England. It was an unwise thingto do, because the revolution which had given France a new enthusiastic infantryand a brilliant artillery, released from its aristocratic officers and manycramping traditions, had destroyed the discipline of its navy, and the Englishwere supreme upon the sea. And this provocation united all England againstFrance, whereas there had been at first a very considerable liberal movement inGreat Britain in sympathy with the revolution.Of the fight that France made in the next few years against a European coalitionwe cannot tell in any detail. She drove the Austrians for ever out of Belgium,and made Holland a republic. The Dutch fleet, frozen in the Texel, surrenderedto a handful of cavalry without firing its guns. For some time the French thrusttowards Italy was hung up, and it was only in 1796 that a new general, NapoleonBonaparte, led the ragged and hungry republican armies in triumph acrossPiedmont to Mantua and Verona. An Outline of History cannot map out campaigns;but of the new quality that had come into war, it is bound to take note. The oldprofessional armies had fought for the fighting, as slack as workers paid by thehour; these wonderful new armies fought, hungry and thirsty, for victory. Theirenemies called them the “New French.” Says C. F. Atkinson,6[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en80] “What astonished the Alliesmost of all was the number and the velocity of the Republicans. These improvisedarmies had in fact nothing to delay them. Tents were unprocurable for want ofmoney, untransportable for want of the enormous number of wagons that would havebeen required, and also unnecessary, for the discomfort that would have causedwholesale desertion in professional armies was cheerfully borne by the men of1793-94. Supplies for armies of then unheard-of size could not be carried inconvoys, and the French soon became familiar with ‘living on the country.’ Thus1793 saw the birth of the modern system of war—rapidity of movement, fulldevelopment of national strength, bivouacs, requisitions and force as againstcautious manœuvring, small professional armies, tents and full rations, andchicane. The first represented the decision-compelling spirit, the second thespirit of risking little to gain a little. . . .”And while these ragged hosts of enthusiasts were chanting the Marseillaise andfighting for La France, manifestly never quite clear in their minds whether theywere looting or liberating the countries into which they poured, the republicanenthusiasm in Paris was spending itself in a far less glorious fashion. Marat,the one man of commanding intelligence among the Jacobins, was now frantic withan incurable disease, and presently he was murdered; Danton was a series ofpatriotic thunderstorms; the steadfast fanaticism of Robespierre dominated thesituation. This man is difficult to judge; he was a man of poor physique,naturally timid, and a prig. But he had that most necessary gift for power,faith. He believed not in a god familiar to men, but in a certain Supreme Being,and that Rousseau was his prophet. He set himself to save the republic as heconceived it, and he imagined it could be saved by no other man than he. So thatto keep in power was to save the republic. The living spirit of the republic, itseemed, had sprung from a slaughter of royalists and the execution of the king.There were insurrections: one in the west, in the district of La Vendée, wherethe people rose against the conscription and against the dispossession of theorthodox clergy, and were led by noblemen, and priests; one in the south, whereLyons and Marseilles had risen and the royalists of Toulon had admitted anEnglish and Spanish garrison. To which there seemed no more effectual reply thanto go on killing royalists.Nothing could have better pleased the fierce heart of the Paris slums. TheRevolutionary Tribunal went to work, and a steady slaughtering began.7[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en81] The invention of theguillotine was opportune to this mood. The queen was guillotined, most ofRobespierre’s antagonists were guillotined, atheists who argued that there wasno Supreme Being were guillotined, Danton was guillotined because he thoughtthere was too much guillotine; day by day, week by week, this infernal newmachine chopped off heads and more heads and more. The reign of Robespierrelived, it seemed, on blood, and needed more and more, as an opium-taker needsmore and more opium.Danton was still Danton, leonine and exemplary upon the guillotine. “Danton,” hesaid, “no weakness!”And the grotesque thing about the story is that Robespierre was indubitablyhonest. He was far more honest than any of the group of men who succeeded him.He was inspired by a consuming passion for a new order of human life. So far ashe could contrive it, the Committee of Public Safety, the emergency governmentof twelve which had now thrust aside the Convention, constructed. The scale onwhich it sought to construct was stupendous. All the intricate problems withwhich we still struggle today were met by swift and shallow solutions. Attemptswere made to equalize property. “Opulence,” said St. Just, “is infamous.” Theproperty of the rich was taxed or confiscated in order that it should be dividedamong the poor. Every man wag to have a secure house, a living, a wife andchildren. The labourer was worthy of his hire, but not entitled to an advantage.There was an attempt to abolish profit altogether, the rude incentive of mosthuman commerce since the beginning of society. Profit is the economic riddlethat still puzzles us today. There were harsh laws against “profiteering” inFrance in 1793—England in 1919 found it necessary to make quite similar laws.And the Jacobien government not only replanned—in eloquent outline—the economic,but also the social system. Divorce was made as easy as marriage; thedistinction of legitimate and illegitimate children was abolished. . . . A newcalendar was devised, with new names for the months, a week of ten days, and thelike—that has long since been swept away; but also the clumsy coinage and thetangled weights and measures of old France gave place to the simple and luciddecimal system that still endures. . . . There was a proposal from one extremistgroup to abolish God among other institutions altogether, and to substitute theworship of Reason. There was, indeed, a Feast of Reason in the cathedral ofNotre-Dame, with a pretty actress as the goddess of Reason. But against thisRobespierre set his face; he was no atheist. “Atheism,” he said, “isaristocratic. The idea of a Supreme Being who watches over oppressed innocenceand punishes triumphant crime is essentially the idea of the people.”So he guillotined Hébert, who had celebrated the feast of Reason, and all hisparty.A certain mental disorder became perceptible in Robespierre as the summer of1794 drew on. He was deeply concerned with his religion. (The arrests andexecutions of suspects were going on now as briskly as ever. Through the streetsof Paris every day rumbled the Terror with its carts full of condemned people.)He induced the Convention to decree that France believed in a Supreme Being, andin that comforting doctrine, the immortality of the soul. In June he celebrateda great festival, the festival of his Supreme Being. There was a procession tothe Champ de Mars, which he headed, brilliantly arrayed, bearing a great bunchof flowers and wheat ears. Figures of inflammatory material, representingAtheism and Vice, were solemnly burnt; then, by an ingenious mechanism, and withsome slight creakings, an incombustible statue of Wisdom rose in their place.There were discourses—Robespierre delivered the chief one—but apparently noworship. . . .Thereafter Robespierre displayed a disposition to brood aloof from affairs. Fora month he kept away from the Convention.One day in July he reappeared and delivered a strange speech that clearlyforeshadowed fresh prosecutions. “Gazing on the multitude of vices which thetorrent of Revolution has rolled down,” he cried, in his last great speech inthe Convention, “I have sometimes trembled lest I should be soiled by the impureneighbourhood of wicked men. . . . I know that it is easy for the leaguedtyrants of the world to overwhelm a single individual; but I know also what isthe duty of a man who can die in the defence of humanity.”. . . .And so on to vague utterances that seemed to threaten everyone.The Convention heard this speech in silence; then when a proposal was made toprint and circulate it, broke into a resentful uproar and refused permission.Robespierre went off in bitter resentment to the club of his supporters, andre-read his speech to them!That night was full of talk and meetings and preparations for the morrow, andthe next morning the Convention turned upon Robespierre. One Tallien threatenedhim with a dagger. When he tried to speak, he was shouted down, and thePresident jingled the bell at him. “President of Assassins,” cried Robespierre,“I demand speech!” It was refused him. His voice deserted him; he coughed andspluttered. “The blood of Danton chokes him,” cried someone.He was accused and arrested there and then with his chief supporters.Whereupon the Hôtel de Ville, still stoutly Jacobin, rose against theConvention, and Robespierre and his companions were snatched out of the hands oftheir captors. There was a night of gathering, marching, counter-marching; andat last, about three in the morning, the forces of the Convention faced theforces of the Commune outside the Hôtel de Ville. Henriot, the Jacobincommander, after a busy day was drunk upstairs; a parley ensued, and then, aftersome indecision, the soldiers of the Commune went over to the Government. Therewas a shouting of patriotic sentiments, and someone looked out from the Hôtel deVille. Robespierre and his last companions found themselves betrayed andtrapped.Two or three of these men threw themselves out of a window, and injuredthemselves frightfully on the railings below without killing themselves. Othersattempted suicide. Robespierre, it seems, was shot in the lower jaw by agendarme. He was found, his eyes staring from a pale face whose lower part wasblood.Followed seventeen hours of agony before his end. He spoke never a word duringthat time, his jaw being bound up roughly in dirty linen. He and his companions,and the broken, dying bodies of those who had jumped from the windows,twenty-two men altogether, were taken to the guillotine instead of the condemnedappointed for that day. Mostly his eyes were closed, but, says Carlyle, heopened them to see the great knife rising above him, and struggled. Also itwould seem he screamed when the executioner removed his bandages. Then the knifecame down, swift and merciful.The Terror was at an end. From first to last there had been condemned andexecuted about four thousand people.§ 12It witnesses to the immense vitality and the profound rightness of the flood ofnew ideals and intentions that the French Revolution had released into the worldof practical endeavour, that it could still flow in a creative torrent after ithad been caricatured and mocked in the grotesque personality and career ofRobespierre. He had shown its deepest thoughts, he had displayed anticipationsof its methods and conclusions; through the green and distorting lenses of hispreposterous vanity and egotism, he had smeared and blackened all its hope andpromise with blood and horror, and the power of these ideas was not destroyed.They stood the extreme tests of ridiculous and horrible presentation. After hisdownfall, the Republic still ruled unassailable. Leaderless, for his successorswere a group of crafty or commonplace men, the European republic struggled on,and presently fell and rose again, and fell and rose and still struggles,entangled but invincible.And it is well to remind the reader here of the real dimensions of this phase ofthe Terror, which strikes so vividly upon the imagination and which hastherefore been enormously exaggerated relatively to the rest of the revolution.From 1789 to late in 1791 the French Revolution was an orderly process, and fromthe summer of 1794 the Republic was an orderly and victorious state. The Terrorwas not the work of the whole country, but of the town mob which owed itsexistence and its savagery to the misrule and social injustice of the ancientrégime; and the explosion of the Terror could have happened only through thepersistent treacherous disloyalty of the royalists which, while it raised theextremists to frenzy, disinclined the mass of moderate republicans from anyintervention. The best men were busy fighting the Austrians and royalists on thefrontier. Altogether, we must remember, the total of the killed in the Terroramounted to a few thousands, and among those thousands there were certainly agreat number of active antagonists whom the Republic, by all the standards ofthat time, was entitled to kill. It included such traitors and mischief-makersas Philip, Duke of Orleans of the Palais Royal, who had voted for the death ofLouis XVI. More lives were wasted by the British generals alone on the openingday of what is known as the Somme offensive of July, 1916, than in the wholeFrench revolution from start to finish. We hear so much about the martyrs of theFrench Terror because they were notable, well-connected people, and becausethere has been a sort of propaganda of their sufferings. But let us balanceagainst them in our minds what was going on in the prisons of the worldgenerally at that time. In Britain, and America, while the Terror ruled inFrance, far more people were slaughtered for offences—very often quite trivialoffences—against property than were condemned by the Revolutionary Tribunal fortreason against the State. Of course, they were very common people indeed, butin their rough way they suffered. A girl was hanged in Massachusetts in 1789 forforcibly taking the hat, shoes, and buckles of another girl she had met in thestreet.8 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en82] Again, Howard thephilanthropist (about 1773) found a number of perfectly innocent people detainedin the English prisons who had been tried and acquitted, but were unable to paythe gaoler’s fees. And these prisons were filthy places under no effectivecontrol. Torture was still in use in the Hanoverian dominions of his Britannicmajesty King George III. It had been in use in France up to the time of theNational Assembly. These things mark the level of the age. It is not on recordthat anyone was deliberately tortured by the French revolutionaries during theTerror. Those few hundreds of French gentlefolk fell into a pit that most ofthem had been well content should exist for others. It was tragic, but not, bythe scale of universal history, a great tragedy. The common man in France wasmore free, better off, and happier during the “Terror” than he had been in 1787.The story of the Republic after the summer of 1794 becomes a tangled story ofpolitical groups aiming at everything from a radical republic to a royalistreaction, but pervaded by a general desire for some definite working arrangementeven at the price of considerable concessions. There was a series ofinsurrections of the Jacobins and of the royalists, there seems to have beenwhat we should call nowadays a hooligan class in Paris which was quite ready toturn out to fight and loot on either side; nevertheless the Convention produceda government, the Directory of five members, which held France together for fiveyears. The last, most threatening revolt of all, in October, 1795, wassuppressed with great skill and decision by a rising young general, NapoleonBonaparte.The Directory was victorious abroad, but uncreative at home; its members werefar too anxious to stick to the sweets and glories of office to prepare aconstitution that would supersede them, and far too dishonest to handle the taskof financial and economic reconstruction demanded by the condition of France. Weneed only note two of their names, Carnot, who was an honest republican, andBarras, who was conspicuously a rogue. Their reign of five years formed acurious interlude in this history of great changes. They took things as theyfound them. The propagandist zeal of the revolution carried the French armiesinto Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, south Germany, and north Italy. Everywherekings were expelled and republics set up. But such propagandist zeal as animatedthe Directorate did not prevent the looting of the treasures of the liberatedpeoples to relieve the financial embarrassment of the French Government. Theirwars became less and less the holy war of freedom, and more and more like theaggressive wars of the ancient régime. The last feature of Grand Monarchy thatFrance was disposed to discard was her tradition of foreign policy, grasping,aggressive, restless, French-centred. One discovers it still as vigorous underthe Directorate as if there had been no revolution.§ 13The ebb of this tide of Revolution in the world, this tide which had created thegreat Republic of America and threatened to submerge all European monarchies,was now at hand. It is as if something had thrust up from beneath the surface ofhuman affairs, made a gigantic effort, and for a time spent itself. It sweptmany obsolescent and evil things away, but many evil and unjust things remained.It solved many problems, and it left the desire for fellowship and order face toface with much vaster problems that it seemed only to have revealed. Privilegeof certain types had gone, many tyrannies, much religions persecution. Whenthese things of the ancient régime had vanished, it seemed as if they had nevermattered. What did matter was that for all their votes and enfranchisement, andin spite of all their passion and effort, common men were still not free and notenjoying an equal happiness; that the immense promise and air of a new worldwith which the Revolution had come, remained unfulfilled.Yet, after all, this wave of revolution had realized nearly everything that hadbeen clearly thought out before it came. It was not failing now for want ofimpetus, but for want of finished ideas. Many things that had oppressed mankindwere swept away for ever. Now that they were swept away it became apparent howunprepared men were for the creative opportunities this clearance gave them. Andperiods of revolution are periods of action; in them men reap the harvests ofideas that have grown during phases of interlude, and they leave the fieldscleared for a new season of growth, but they cannot suddenly produce ripened newideas to meet an unanticipated riddle.The sweeping away of king and lord, of priest and inquisitor, of landlord andtaxgatherer and task-master, left the mass of men face to face for the firsttime with certain very fundamental aspects of the social structure,relationships they had taken for granted, and had never realized the need ofthinking hard and continuously about before. Institutions that had seemed to bein the nature of things, and matters that had seemed to happen by the same sortof necessity that brought round the dawn and springtime, were discovered to beartificial, controllable, were they not so perplexingly intricate, and—now thatthe old routines were abolished and done away with—in urgent need of control.The New Order found itself confronted with three riddles which it was quiteunprepared to solve: Property, Currency, and International Relationship.Let us take these three problems in order, and ask what they are and how theyarose in human affairs. Every human life is deeply entangled in them, andconcerned in their solution. The rest of this history becomes more and moreclearly the development of the effort to solve these problems; that is to say,so to interpret property, so to establish currency, and so to controlinternational reactions as to render possible a world- wide, progressive, andhappy community of will. They are the three riddles of the sphinx of fate, towhich the human commonweal must find an answer or perish.The idea of property arises out of the combative instincts of the species. Longbefore men were men, the ancestral ape was a proprietor. Primitive property iswhat a beast will fight for. The dog and his bone, the tigress and her lair, theroaring stag and his herd, these are proprietorship blazing. No more nonsensicalexpression is conceivable in sociology than the term “primitive communism.” TheOld Man of the family tribe of early palæolithic times insisted upon hisproprietorship in his wives and daughters, in his tools, in his visibleuniverse. If any other man wandered into his visible universe he fought him, andif he could he slew him. The tribe grew in the course of ages, as Atkinsonshowed convincingly in his Primal Law, by the gradual toleration by the Old Manof the existence of the younger men, and of their proprietorship in the wivesthey captured from outside the tribe, and in the tools and ornaments they madeand the game they slew. Human society grew by a compromise between this one’sproperty and that. It was largely a compromise and an alliance forced upon menby the necessity of driving some other tribe out of its visible universe. If thehills and forests and streams were not your land or my land, it was because theyhad to be our land. Each of us would have preferred to have it my land, but thatwould not work. In that case the other fellows would have destroyed us. Society,therefore, is from its beginnings the mitigation of ownership. Ownership in thebeast and in the primitive savage was far more intense a thing than it is in thecivilized world today. It is rooted more strongly in our instincts than in ourreason.In the natural savage and in the untutored man today—for it is well to keep inmind that no man today is more than four hundred generations from the primordialsavage—there is no limitation to the sphere of ownership. Whatever you can fightfor, you can own; women-folk, spared captive, captured beast, forest glade,stone pit or what not. As the community grew and a sort of law came to restraininternecine fighting, men developed rough and ready methods of settlingproprietorship. Men could own what they were the first to make or capture orclaim. It seemed natural that a debtor who could not pay up should become theproperty of his creditor. Equally natural was it that, after claiming a patch ofland (“Bags I,” as the schoolboy says), a man should exact payments and tributefrom anyone else who wanted to use it. It was only slowly, as the possibilitiesof organized life dawned on men, that this unlimited property in anythingwhatever began to be recognized as a nuisance. Men found themselves born into auniverse all owned and claimed, nay! they found themselves born owned andclaimed. The social struggles of the earlier civilization are difficult to tracenow, but the history we have told of the Roman republic shows a community wakingup to the idea that they may become a public inconvenience and should then berepudiated, and that the unlimited ownership of land is also an inconvenience.We find that later Babylonia severely limited the rights of property in slaves.Finally, we find in the teaching of that great revolutionist, Jesus of Nazareth,such an attack upon property as had never been before. Easier it was, he said,for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the owner of greatpossessions to enter the kingdom of heaven. A steady, continuous criticism ofthe permissible scope of property seems to have been going on in the world forthe last twenty-five or thirty centuries. Nineteen hundred years after Jesus ofNazareth we find all the world that has come under the Christian teachingpersuaded that there could be no property in persons. There has been a turn-overin the common conscience in that matter. And also the idea that “a man may dowhat he likes with his own” was clearly very much shaken in relation to othersorts of property. But this world of the closing eighteenth century was stillonly in the interrogative stage in this matter. It had got nothing clear enough,much less settled enough, to act upon. One of its primary impulses was toprotect property against the greed and waste of kings and the exploitation ofnoble adventurers. It was to protect private property that the Revolution began.But its equalitarian formulæ carried it into a criticism of the very property ithad risen to protect. How can men be free and equal when numbers of them have noground to stand upon and nothing to eat, and the owners will neither feed norlodge them unless they toil? Excessively—the poor complained.To which riddle the Jacobin reply was to set about “dividing up.” They wanted tointensify and universalize property. Aiming at the same end by another route,there were already in the eighteenth century certain primitive socialists—or, tobe more exact, communists—who wanted to “abolish” private property altogether.The state (a democratic state was of course understood) was to own all property.It was only as the nineteenth century developed that men began to realize thatproperty was not one simple thing, but a great complex of ownerships ofdifferent values and consequences, that many things (such as human beings, theimplements of an artist, clothing, toothbrushes) are very profoundly andincurably personal property, and that there is a very great range of things,railways, machinery of various sorts, homes, cultivated gardens, pleasure-boats,for example, which need each to be considered very particularly to determine howfar and under what limitations it may come under private ownership, and how farit falls into the public domain and may be administered and let out by the statein the collective interest. On the practical side these questions pass intopolitics, and the problem of making and sustaining efficient stateadministration. They open up issues in social psychology, and interact with theenquiries of educational science. We have today the advantage of a hundred andthirty years of discussion over the first revolutionary generation, but even nowthis criticism of property is still a vast and passionate ferment rather than ascience. Under the circumstances it was impossible that eighteenth-centuryFrance should present any other spectacle than that of vague and confusedpopular movements seeking to dispossess owners, and classes of small and largeowners holding on grimly, demanding, before everything else, law, order, andsecurity, and seeking to increase their individual share of anything whateverthat could be legally possessed.Closely connected with the vagueness of men’s ideas about property was thevagueness of their ideas about currency. Both the American and the Frenchrepublics fell into serious trouble upon this score. Here, again, we deal withsomething that is not simple, a tangle of usages, conventions, laws, andprevalent mental habits, out of which arise problems which admit of no solutionin simple terms, and which yet are of vital importance to the everyday life ofthe community. The validity of the acknowledgment a man is given for a day’swork is manifestly of quite primary importance to the working of the socialmachine. The growth of confidence in the precious metals and of coins, until theassurance became practically universal that good money could be trusted to haveits purchasing power anywhere, must have been a gradual one in human history.And being fairly established, this assurance was subjected to very considerablestrains and perplexities by the action of governments in debasing currency andin substituting paper promises to pay for the actual metallic coins. Every ageproduced a number of clever people intelligent enough to realize theopportunities for smart operations afforded by the complex of faiths andfictions upon which the money system rested, and sufficiently unsound morally togive their best energies to growing rich and so getting people to work for them,through tricks and tampering with gold, coinage, and credit. So soon as seriouspolitical and social dislocation occurred, the money mechanism began to workstiffly and inaccurately. The United States and the French Republic both startedtheir careers in a phase of financial difficulty. Everywhere governments hadbeen borrowing and issuing paper promises to pay interest, more interest thanthey could conveniently raise. Both revolutions led to much desperate publicspending and borrowing, and at the same time to an interruption of cultivationand production that further diminished real taxable wealth. Both governments,being unable to pay their way in gold, resorted to the issue of paper money,promising to pay upon the security of undeveloped land (in America) or recentlyconfiscated church lands (France). In both cases the amount of issue went farbeyond the confidence of men in the new security. Gold was called in, hidden bythe cunning ones, or went abroad to pay for imports; and people found themselveswith various sorts of bills and notes in the place of coins, all of uncertainand diminishing value.However complicated the origins of currency, its practical effect and the end ithas to serve in the community may be stated roughly in simple terms. The money aman receives for his work (mental or bodily) or for relinquishing his propertyin some consumable good, must ultimately be able to purchase for him for his usea fairly equivalent amount of consumable goods. (“Consumable goods” is a phrasewe would have understood in the widest sense to represent even such things as ajourney, a lecture or theatrical entertainment, housing, medical advice, and soforth.) When everyone in a community is assured of this, and assured that themoney will not deteriorate in purchasing power, then currency—and thedistribution of goods by trade—is in a healthy and satisfactory state. Then menwill work cheerfully, and only then. The imperative need for that steadfastnessand security of currency is the fixed datum from which the scientific study andcontrol of currency must begin. But under the most stable conditions there willalways be fluctuations in currency value. The sum total of saleable consumablegoods in the world and in various countries varies from year to year and fromseason to season; autumn is probably a time of plenty in comparison with spring;with an increase in the available goods in the world, the purchasing power ofcurrency will increase, unless there is also an increase in the amount ofcurrency. On the other hand, if there is a diminution in the production ofconsumable goods or a great and unprofitable destruction of consumable goods,such as occurs in a war, the share of the total of consumable goods representedby a sum of money will diminish and prices and wages will rise. In modern warthe explosion of a single big shell, even if it hits nothing, destroys labourand material roughly equivalent to a comfortable cottage or a year’s holiday fora man. If the shell hits anything, then that further destruction has to be addedto the diminution of consumable goods. Every shell that burst in the recent wardiminished by a little fraction the purchasing value of every coin in the wholeworld. If there is also an increase of currency during a period when consumablegoods are being used up and not fully replaced—and the necessities ofrevolutionary and war-making governments almost always require this—then theenhancement of prices and the fall in the value of the currency paid in wages isstill greater. Usually also governments under these stresses borrow money; thatis to say, they issue interest-bearing paper, secured on the willingness andability of the general community to endure taxation. Such operations would bedifficult enough if they were carried out frankly by perfectly honest men, inthe full light of publicity and scientific knowledge. But hitherto this hasnever been the case; at every point the clever egotist, the bad sort of richman, is trying to deflect things a little to his own advantage. Everywhere, too,one finds the stupid egotist ready to take fright and break into panic.Consequently we presently discover the state encumbered by an excess ofcurrency, which is in effect, a non-interest-paying debt, and also with a greatburthen of interest upon loans. Both credit and currency begin to fluctuatewildly with the evaporation of public confidence. They are, we say, demoralized.The ultimate consequence of an entirely demoralized currency would be to end allwork and all trade that could not be carried on by payment in kind and barter.Men would refuse to work except for food, clothing, housing, and payment inkind. The immediate consequence of a partially demoralized currency is to driveup prices and make trading feverishly adventurous and workers suspicious andirritable. A sharp man wants under such conditions to hold money for as brief aperiod as possible; he demands the utmost for his reality, and buys a realityagain as soon as possible in order to get this perishable stuff, the currencypaper, off his hands. All who have fixed incomes and saved accumulations sufferby the rise in prices, and the wage earners find, with a gathering fury, thatthe real value of their wages is continually less. Here is a state of affairswhere the duty of every clever person is evidently to help adjust and reassure.But all the traditions of private enterprise, all the ideas of the latereighteenth century, went to justify the action of acute-minded and dexterouspeople who set themselves to accumulate claims, titles, and tangible property inthe storms and dislocations of this currency breakdown. The number ofunderstanding people in the world who were setting themselves sincerely andsimply to restore honest and workable currency and credit conditions were fewand ineffectual. Most of the financial and speculative people of the time wereplaying the part of Cornish wreckers—not apparently with any consciousdishonesty, but with the completes self-approval and the applause of theirfellow-men. The aim of every clever person was to accumulate as much as he couldof really negotiable wealth, and then, and only then, to bring about some sortof stabilizing political process that would leave him in advantageous possessionof his accumulation. Here were the factors of a bad economic atmosphere,suspicious, feverish, greedy, and speculative. . . .In the third direction in which the Revolution had been unprepared with clearideas, the problem of international relationships, developments were to occurthat interacted disastrously with this state of financial and economicadventure, this scramble and confusion, this preoccupation of men’s minds withthe perplexing slipperiness of their private property and their monetaryposition at home. The Republic at its birth found itself at war. For a time thatwar was waged by the new levies with a patriotism and a zeal unparalleled in theworld’s history. But that could not go on. The Directory found itself at thehead of a conquering country, intolerably needy and embarrassed at home, and inoccupation of rich foreign lands, full of seizable wealth and material andfinancial opportunity. We have all double natures, and the French in particularseem to be developed logically and symmetrically on both sides. Into theseconquered regions France came as a liberator, the teacher of Republicanism tomankind. Holland and Belgium became the Batavian Republic, Genoa and its Rivierathe Ligurian Republic, north Italy the Cisalpine Republic, Switzerland wasrechristened the Helvetian Republic, Mülhausen, Rome, and Naples were designatedrepublics. Grouped about France, these republics were to be a constellation offreedom leading the world. That was the ideal side. At the same time the Frenchgovernment, and French private individuals in concert with the government,proceeded to a complete and exhaustive exploitation of the resources of theseliberated lands.So within ten years of the meeting of the States General, New France begins totake on a singular likeness to the old. It is more flushed, more vigorous; itwears a cap of liberty instead of a crown; it has a new army—but a damagedfleet; it has new rich people instead of the old rich people, a new peasantryworking even harder than the old and yielding more taxes, a new foreign policycuriously like the old foreign policy disrobed, and—there is no Millennium."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IXTHE CAREER OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE§1. The Bonaparte Family in Corsica. § 2. Bonaparte as a Republican General. §3. Napoleon First Consul, 1799-1804. § 4. Napoleon I Emperor, 1804-14. § 5. TheHundred Days. § 6. The Map of Europe in 1815.§ 1AND now we come to one of the most illuminating figures in modern history, thefigure of an adventurer and a wrecker, whose story seems to display with anextraordinary vividness the universal subtle conflict of egotism, vanity, andpersonality with the weaker, wider claims of the common good. Against thisbackground of confusion and stress and hope, this strained and heaving Franceand Europe, this stormy and tremendous dawn, appears this dark little archaicpersonage, hard, compact, capable, unscrupulous, imitative, and neatly vulgar.He was born (1769) in the still half-barbaric island of Corsica, the son of arather prosaic father, a lawyer who had been first a patriotic Corsican againstthe French monarchy which was trying to subjugate Corsica, and who had then goneover to the side of the invader. His mother was of sturdier stuff, passionatelypatriotic and a strong and managing woman. (She birched her sons; on oneoccasion she birched Napoleon when he was sixteen.) There were numerous brothersand sisters, and the family pursued the French authorities with importunitiesfor rewards and jobs. Except for Napoleon it seems to have been a thoroughlycommonplace, “hungry” family. He was clever, bad-tempered, and overbearing. Fromhis mother he had acquired a romantic Corsican patriotism.Through the patronage of the French governor of Corsica he got an educationfirst at the military school of Brienne and then at the military school ofParis, from which he passed into the artillery in 1785. He was an industriousstudent both of mathematics and history, his memory was prodigiously good, andhe made copious note-books which still exist. These note-books show no veryexceptional intelligence, and they contain short pieces of originalcomposition—upon suicide and similar adolescent topics. He fell early under thespell of Rousseau; he developed sensibility and a scorn for the corruptions ofcivilization. In 1786 he wrote a pamphlet against a Swiss pastor who hadattacked Rousseau. It was a very ordinary adolescent production, rhetorical andimitative. He dreamt of an independent Corsica, freed from the French. With therevolution, he became an ardent republican and a supporter of the new Frenchrégime in Corsica. For some years, until the fall of Robespierre, he remained aJacobin.§ 2He soon gained the reputation of a useful and capable officer, and it wasthrough Robespierre’s younger brother that he got his first chance ofdistinction at Toulon. Toulon had been handed over to the British and Spanish bythe Royalists, and an allied fleet occupied its harbour. Bonaparte was given thecommand of the artillery, and under his direction the French forced the alliesto abandon the port and town.He was next appointed commander of the artillery in Italy, but he had not takenup his duties when the death of Robespierre seemed likely to involve his own; hewas put under arrest as a Jacobin, and for a time he was in danger of theguillotine. That danger passed. He was employed as artillery commander in anabortive raid upon Corsica, and then went to Paris (1795) rather down at heel.Madame Junot in her Memoirs describes his lean face and slovenly appearance atthis time, “his ill-combed, ill-powdered hair hanging down over his greyovercoat,” his gloveless hands and badly blacked boots. It was a time ofexhaustion and reaction after the severities of the Jacobite republic. “InParis,” says Holland Rose, “the star of Liberty was paling before Mercury, Mars,and Venus”—finance, uniforms, and social charm. The best of the common men werein the armies, away beyond the frontiers. We have already noted the last risingof the royalists in this year (1795). Napoleon had the luck to be in Paris, andfound his second opportunity in this affair. He saved the Republic—of theDirectory.His abilities greatly impressed Carnot, the most upright of the Directors.Moreover, he married a charming young widow, Madame Josephine de Beauharnais,who had great influence with Barras. Both these things probably helped him tosecure the command in Italy.We have no space here for the story of his brilliant campaigns in Italy(1796-97), but of the spirit in which that invasion of Italy was conducted wemust say a word or two, because it illustrates so vividly the double soul ofFrance and of Napoleon, and how revolutionary idealism was paling beforepractical urgencies. He proclaimed to the Italians that the French were comingto break their chains—and they were! He wrote to the Directory: “We will levy20,000,000 francs in exactions in this country; it is one of the richest in theworld.” To his soldiers he said, “You are famished and nearly naked. . . . Ilead you into the most fertile plain in the world. There you will find greattowns, rich provinces, honour, glory, riches. . . .”We are all such mixed stuff as this; in all of us the intimations of a new worldand a finer duty struggle to veil and control the ancient greeds and lusts ofour inherited past; but these passages, written by a young man of twenty-seven,seem to show the gilt of honourable idealism rubbed off at an unusually earlyage. These are the bribes of an adventurer who has brought whatever impulse ofdevotion to a great cause once stirred within him well under the control of hisself-love.His successes in Italy were brilliant and complete; they enormously stimulatedhis self-confidence and his contempt for the energy and ability of hisfellow-creatures. He had wanted to go into Italy because there lay the mostattractive task—he had risked his position in the army by refusing to take upthe irksome duties of a command against the rebels in La Vendée—and there areclear signs of a vast expansion of his vanity with his victories. He had been agreat reader of Plutarch’s Lives and of Roman history, and his extremely activebut totally uncreative imagination was now busy with dreams of a revival of theeastern conquests of the Roman Empire. He got the republic of Venice out of hisway by cutting it up between the French and Austria, securing the Ionian islandsand the Venetian fleet for France. This peace, the peace of Campo Formio, wasfor both sides a thoroughly scoundrelly and ultimately a disastrous bargain. Thenew republic of France assisted in the murder of an ancient republic—Napoleoncarried his point against a considerable outcry in France—and Austria gotVenetia, in which land in 1918 she was destined to bleed to death. There werealso secret clauses by which both France and Austria were later to acquire southGerman territory. And it was not only the Roman push eastward that was nowexciting Napoleon’s brain. This was the land of Cæsar—and Cæsar was a badexample for the successful general of a not very stable republic.Cæsar had come back to Rome from Gaul a hero and conqueror. His new imitatorwould come back from Egypt and India —Egypt and India were to be his Gaul. Therewas really none of the genius about which historians write so glibly in thisdecision. It was a tawdry and ill-conceived imitation. The elements of failurestared him in the face. The way to Egypt and India was by sea, and the British,in spite of two recent naval mutinies, whose importance Napoleon exaggerated,were stronger than the French at sea. Moreover, Egypt was a part of the Turkishempire, by no means a contemptible power in those days. Nevertheless hepersuaded the Directory, which was dazzled by his Italian exploits, to let himgo. An Armada started from Toulon in May, 1798, captured Malta, and had the goodluck to evade the British fleet and arrive at Alexandria. He landed his troopshurriedly, and the battle of the Pyramids made him master of Egypt.The main British fleet at that time was in the Atlantic outside Cadiz, but theadmiral had detached a force of his best ships, under Vice-Admiral Nelson—asgreat a genius in naval affairs as was Napoleon in things military—to chase andengage the French flotilla. For a time Nelson sought the French fleet in vain;finally, on the evening of the first of August, he found it at anchor in Aboukirbay. He had caught it unawares; many of the men were ashore and a council wasbeing held in the flag-ship. He had no charts, and it was a hazardous thing tosail into the shallow water in a bad light. The French admiral concluded,therefore, that his adversary would not attack before morning, and so made nohaste in recalling his men aboard until it was too late to do so. Nelson,however, struck at once—against the advice of some of his captains. One shiponly went aground. She marked the shoal for the rest of the fleet. He sailed tothe attack in a double line about sundown, putting the French between two fires.Night fell as the battle was joined; the fight thundered and crashed in thedarkness, until it was lit presently by the flames of burning French ships, andthen by the flare of the French flag-ship, the Orient, blowing up. . . . Beforemidnight the battle of the Nile was over, and Napoleon’s fleet was destroyed.Napoleon was cut off from France.Says Holland Rose, quoting Thiers, this Egyptian expedition was “the rashestattempt history records.” Napoleon was left in Egypt with the Turks gatheringagainst him and his army infected with the plague. Nevertheless, with a stupidsort of persistence, he went on for a time with this Eastern scheme. He gained avictory at Jaffa, and, being short of provisions, massacred all his prisoners.Then he tried to take Acre, where Ms own siege artillery, just captured at seaby the English, was used against him. Returning baffled to Egypt, he gained abrilliant victory over a Turkish force at Aboukir, and then, deserting the armyof Egypt—it held on until 1801, when it capitulated to a British force—made hisescape back to France (1799), narrowly missing capture by a British cruiser offSicily.Here was muddle and failure enough to discredit any general —had it been known.But the very British cruisers which came so near to catching him, helped him bypreventing any real understanding of the Egyptian situation from reaching theFrench people. He could make a great flourish over the battle of Aboukir andconceal the shame and loss of Acre. Things were not going well with France justthen. There had been military failures at several points; much of Italy had beenlost, Bonaparte’s Italy, and this turned men’s minds to him as the naturalsaviour of that situation; moreover, there had been much peculation, and some ofit was coming to light; France was in one of her phases of financial scandal,and Napoleon had not filched; the public was in that state of moral fatigue whena strong and honest man is called for, a wonderful, impossible healing man whowill do everything for everybody. People, poor lazy souls, persuaded themselvesthat this specious young man with the hard face, so providentially back fromEgypt, was the strong and honest man required—another Washington.056 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_056_r1.gif]With Julius Caæsar rather than Washington at the back of his mind, Napoleonresponded to the demand of his time. A conspiracy was carefully engineered toreplace the Directory by three “Consuls”—everybody seems to have been readingfar too much Roman history just then—of whom Napoleon was to be the chief. Theworking of that conspiracy is too intricate a story for our space; it involved aCromwell-like dispersal of the Lower House (the Council of Five Hundred), and inthis affair Napoleon lost his nerve. The deputies shouted at him and hustledhim, and he seems to have been very much frightened. He nearly fainted,stuttered, and could say nothing, but the situation was saved by his brotherLucien, who brought in the soldiers and dispersed the council. This little hitchdid not affect the final success of the scheme. The three Consuls were installedat the Luxembourg palace, with two commissioners, to reconstruct theconstitution.With all his confidence restored and sure of the support of the people, whosupposed him to be honest, patriotic, republican, and able to bring about a goodpeace, Napoleon took a high hand with his colleagues and the commissioners. Aconstitution was produced in which the chief executive officer was to be calledthe First Consul, with enormous powers. He was to be Napoleon; this was part ofthe constitution. He was to be re-elected or replaced at the end of ten years.He was to be assisted by a Council of State, appointed by himself, which was toinitiate legislation and send its proposals to two bodies, the Legislative Body(which could vote, but not discuss) and the Tribunate (which could discuss, butnot vote), which were selected by an appointed Senate from a special class, the“notabilities of France,” who were elected by the “notabilities of thedepartments,” who were elected by the “notabilities of the commune,” who wereelected by the common voters. The suffrage for the election of the notabilitiesof the commune was universal. This was the sole vestige of democracy in theastounding pyramid. This constitution was chiefly the joint production of aworthy philosopher, Sieyès, who was one of the three consuls, and Bonaparte. Butso weary was France with her troubles and efforts, and so confident were men inthe virtue and ability of this adventurer from Corsica, that when, at the birthof the nineteenth century, this constitution was submitted to the country, itwas carried by 3,011,007 votes to 1,562. France put herself absolutely inBonaparte’s hands, and prepared to be peaceful, happy, and glorious.§ 3Now surely here was opportunity such as never came to man before. Here was aposition in which a man might well bow himself in fear of himself, and searchhis heart and serve God and man to the utmost. The old order of things was deador dying; strange new forces drove through the world seeking form and direction;the promise of a world republic and an enduring world peace whispered in amultitude of startled minds. Had this man any profundity of vision, any power ofcreative imagination, had he been accessible to any disinterested ambition, hemight have done work for mankind that would have made him the very sun ofhistory. All Europe and America, stirred by the first promise of a new age, waswaiting for him. Not France alone. France was in his hand, his instrument, to dowith as he pleased, willing for peace, but tempered for war like an exquisitesword. There lacked nothing to this great occasion but a noble imagination. Andfailing that, Napoleon could do no more than strut upon the crest of this greatmountain of opportunity like a cockerel on a dunghill. The figure he makes inhistory is one of almost incredible self-conceit, of vanity, greed, and cunning,of callous contempt and disregard of all who trusted him, and of a grandioseaping of Cæsar, Alexander, and Charlemagne which would be purely comic if itwere not caked over with human blood. Until, as Victor Hugo said in histremendous way, “God was bored by him,” and he was kicked aside into a corner toend his days, explaining and explaining how very clever his worst blunders hadbeen, prowling about his dismal hot island shooting birds and squabbling meanlywith an underbred gaoler who failed to show him proper “respect.”His career as First Consul was perhaps the least dishonourable phase in hiscareer. He took the crumbling military affairs of the Directory in hand, andafter a complicated campaign in North Italy brought matters to a head in thevictory of Marengo, near Alessandria (1800). It was a victory that at somemoments came very near disaster. In the December of the same year GeneralMoreau, in the midst of snow, mud, and altogether abominable weather, inflictedan overwhelming defeat upon the Austrian army at Hohenlinden. If Napoleon hadgained this battle, it would have counted among his most characteristic andbrilliant exploits. These thing’s made the hoped-for peace possible. In 1801 thepreliminaries of peace with England and Austria were signed. Peace with England,the Treaty of Amiens, was concluded in 1802, and Napoleon was free to givehimself to the creative statecraft of which France, and Europe through France,stood in need. The war had given the country extended boundaries, the treatywith England restored the colonial empire of France and left her in a positionof security beyond the utmost dreams of Louis XIV. It was open to Napoleon towork out and consolidate the new order of things, to make a modern state thatshould become a beacon and inspiration to Europe and all the world.He attempted nothing of the sort. He did not realize that there were such thingsas modern states in the scheme of possibility. His little imitative imaginationwas full of a deep cunning dream of being Cæsar over again—as if this universewould ever tolerate anything of that sort over again! He was scheming to makehimself a real emperor, with a crown upon his head and all his rivals andschool-fellows and friends at his feet. This could give him no fresh power thathe did not already exercise, but it would be more splendid—it would astonish hismother. What response was there in a head of that sort for the splendid creativechallenge of the time? But first France must be prosperous. France hungry wouldcertainly not endure an emperor. He set himself to carry out an old scheme ofroads that Louis XV had approved; he developed canals in imitation of theEnglish canals; he reorganized the police and made the country safe; and,preparing the scene for his personal drama, he set himself to make Paris looklike Rome, with classical arches, with classical columns. Admirable schemes forbanking development were available, and he made use of them. In all these thingshe moved with the times, they would have happened—with less autocracy, with lesscentralization, if he had never been born. And he set himself to weaken therepublicans whose fundamental convictions he was planning to outrage. Herecalled the émigrés, provided they gave satisfactory assurances to respect thenew régime. Many were very willing to come back on such terms, and let Bourbonsbe bygones. And he worked out a great reconciliation, a Concordat, with Rome.Rome was to support him, and he was to restore the authority of Rome in theparishes. Prance would never be obedient and manageable, he thought; she wouldnever stand a new monarchy, without religion. “How can you have order in astate,” he said, “without religion? Society cannot exist without inequality offortunes, which cannot endure apart from religion. When one man is dying ofhunger near another who is ill of surfeit, he cannot resign himself to thisdifference, unless there is an authority which declares —‘God wills it thus:there must be poor and rich in the world: but hereafter and during all eternitythe division of things will take place differently.’” Religion—especially of thelater Roman brand—was, he thought, excellent stuff for keeping the common peoplequiet. In his early Jacobin days he had denounced it for that very reason.Another great achievement which marks his imaginative scope and his estimate ofhuman nature was the institution of the Legion of Honour, a scheme fordecorating Frenchmen with bits of ribbon which was admirably calculated todivert ambitious men from subversive proceedings.And also Napoleon interested himself in Christian propaganda. Here is theNapoleonic view of the political uses of Christ, a view that has tainted allFrench missions from that time forth. “It is my wish to re-establish theinstitution for foreign missions; for the religious missionaries may be veryuseful to me in Asia, Africa, and America, as I shall make them reconnoitre allthe lands they visit. The sanctity of their dress will not only protect them,but serve to conceal their political and commercial investigations. The head ofthe missionary establishment shall reside no longer at Rome, but in Paris.”These are the ideas of a roguish merchant rather than a statesman. His treatmentof education shows the same narrow vision, the same blindness to the realitiesof the dawn about him. Elementary education he neglected almost, completely; heleft it to the conscience of the local authorities, and he provided that theteachers should be paid out of the fees of the scholars; it is clear he did notwant the common people to be educated; he had no glimmering of any understandingwhy they should be; but he interested himself in the provision of technical andhigher schools because his state needed the services of clever, self-seeking,well-informed men. This was an astounding retrogression from the great scheme,drafted by Condorcet for the Republic in 1792, for a complete system of freeeducation for the entire nation. Slowly but steadfastly the project of Condorcetcomes true; the great nations of the world are being compelled to bring itnearer and nearer to realization, and the cheap devices of Napoleon pass out ofour interest. As for the education of the mothers and wives of our race, thiswas the quality of Napoleon’s wisdom: “I do not think that we need troubleourselves with any plan of instruction for young females, they cannot be betterbrought up than by their mothers. Public education is not suitable for them,because they are never called upon to act in public. Manners are all in all tothem, and marriage is all they look to.”The First Consul was no kinder to women in the Code Napoleon. A wife, forexample, had no control over her own property; she was in her husband’s hands.This code was the work very largely of the Council of State. Napoleon seemsrather to have hindered than helped its deliberations. He would invade thesession without notice, and favour its members with lengthy and egotisticalmonologues, frequently quite irrelevant to the matter in hand. The Councillistened with profound respect; it was all the Council could do. He would keephis councillors up to unearthly hours, and betray a simple pride in his superiorwakefulness. He recalled these discussions with peculiar satisfaction in hislater years, and remarked on one occasion that his glory consisted not in havingwon forty battles, but in having created the Code Napoleon. . . . So far as itsubstituted plain statements for inaccessible legal mysteries his Code was agood thing; it gathered together, revised, and made clear a vast disorderlyaccumulation of laws, old and new. Like all his constructive work, it made forimmediate efficiency, it defined things and relations so that men could get towork upon them without further discussion. It was of less immediate practicalimportance that it frequently defined them wrongly. There was no intellectualpower, as distinguished from intellectual energy, behind this codification. Ittook everything that existed for granted. (“Sa Majesté ne croit que ce quiest.”1 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en83]) The fundamental ideasof the civilized community and of the terms of human cooperation were in processof reconstruction all about Napoleon —and he never perceived it. He accepted aphase of change, and tried to fix it for ever. To this day France is cramped bythis early nineteenth-century strait-waistcoat into which he clapped her. Hefixed the status of women, the status of labourers, the status of the peasant;they all struggle to this day in the net of his hard definitions.So briskly and forcibly Napoleon set his mind, hard, clear, and narrow, to braceup France. That bracing up was only a part of the large egotistical schemes thatdominated him. His imagination was set upon a new Cæsarism. In 1802 he gothimself made First Consul for life with the power of appointing a successor, andhis clear intention of annexing Holland and Italy, in spite of his treatyobligations to keep them separate, made the Peace of Amiens totter crazily fromthe very beginning. Since his schemes were bound to provoke a war with England,he should, at any cost, have kept quiet until he had brought his navy to asuperiority over the British navy. He had the control of great resources forshipbuilding, the British government was a weak one, and three or four yearswould have sufficed to shift that balance. But in spite of his rough experiencesin Egypt, he had never mastered the importance of sea power, and he had not themental steadfastness for a waiting game and long preparation. In 1803 hisoccupation of Switzerland precipitated a crisis, and war broke out again withEngland. The weak Addington in England gave place to the greater Pitt. The restof Napoleon’s story turns upon that war.During the period of the Consulate, the First Consul was very active inadvancing the fortunes of his brothers and sisters. This was quite human, veryclannish and Corsican, and it helps us to understand just how he valued hisposition and the opportunities before him. Few of us can live without anaudience, and the first audience of our childhood is our family; most of us tothe end of our days are swayed by the desire to impress our parents and brothersand sisters. Few “letters home” of successful men or women display the graces ofmodesty and self-forgetfulness. Only souls uplifted, as the soul of Jesus ofNazareth was uplifted, can say of all the world, “Behold my mother and mybrethren!” A large factor in the making of Napoleon was the desire to amaze,astonish, and subdue the minds of the Bonaparte family, and their neighbours. Hepromoted his brothers ridiculously—for they were the most ordinary of men. Thehungry Bonapartes were in luck. Surely all Corsica was open-mouthed! But oneperson who knew him well was neither amazed nor subdued. This was his mother. Hesent her money to spend and astonish the neighbours; he exhorted her to make adisplay, to live as became the mother of so marvellous, so world-shaking, a son.But the good lady, who had birched the Man of Destiny at the age of sixteen forgrimacing at his grandmother, was neither dazzled nor deceived by him at the ageof thirty-two. All France might worship him, but she had no illusions. She putby the money he sent her; she continued her customary economies. “When it is allover,” she said, “you will be glad of my savings.”§ 4We will not detail the steps by which Napoleon became Emperor. His coronationwas the most extraordinary revival of stale history that it is possible toimagine. Cæsar was no longer the model; Napoleon was playing now at beingCharlemagne. He was crowned emperor, not indeed at Rome, but in the cathedral ofNotre-Dame in Paris; the Pope (Pius VII) had been brought from Rome to performthe ceremony; and at the climax Napoleon I seized the crown, waved the Popeaside, and crowned himself. The attentive reader of this Outline will know thata thousand years before this would have had considerable significance; in 1804it was just a ridiculous scene. In 1806 Napoleon revived another venerableantiquity, and, following still the footsteps of Charlemagne, crowned himselfwith the iron crown of Lombardy in the cathedral of Milan. All this mummery wasto have a wonderful effect upon the imagination of western Germany, which was toremember that it, too, had been a part, of the empire of Charlemagne.057 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_057_r1.gif]The four daughter republics of France were now to become kingdoms; in 1806 heset up brother Louis in Holland and brother Joseph in Naples. But the story ofthe subordinate kingdoms he created in Europe, helpful though this free handlingof frontiers was towards the subsequent unification of Italy and Germany, is toocomplex and evanescent for this Outline.The pact between the new Charlemagne and the new Leo did not hold good for verylong. In 1807 he began to bully the Pope, and in 1811 he made him a closeprisoner at Fontainebleau. There does not seem to have been much reason in theseproceedings. They estranged all Catholic opinion, as his coronation hadestranged all liberal opinion. He ceased to stand either for the old or the new.The new he had betrayed; the old he had failed to win. He stood at last fornothing but himself.There seems to have been as little reason in the foreign policy that now plungedEurope into a fresh cycle of wars. Having quarrelled with Great Britain toosoon, he (1804) assembled a vast army at Boulogne for the conquest of England,regardless of the naval situation. He even struck a medal and erected a columnat Boulogne to commemorate the triumph of this projected invasion. In some“Napoleonic” fashion the British fleet was to be decoyed away, this army ofBoulogne was to be smuggled across the Channel on a flotilla of rafts and boats,and London was to be captured before the fleet returned. At the same time hisaggressions in south Germany forced Austria and Russia steadily into a coalitionwith Britain against him. In 1805 two fatal blows were struck at any hope he mayhave entertained of ultimate victory, by the British Admirals Calder and Nelson.In July the former inflicted a serious reverse upon the French fleet in the Bayof Biscay; in October the latter destroyed the joint fleets of France and Spainat the battle of Trafalgar. Nelson died splendidly upon the Victory, victorious.Thereafter Napoleon was left with Britain in pitiless opposition, unattainableand unconquerable, able to strike here or there against him along all the coastsof Europe.But for awhile the mortal wound of Trafalgar was hidden from the French mindaltogether. They heard merely that “storms have caused us to lose some ships ofthe line after an imprudent fight.” After Calder’s victory he had snatched hisarmy from Boulogne, rushed it across half Europe, and defeated the Austrian andRussian armies at Ulm and Austerlitz. Under these inauspicious circumstancesPrussia came into the war against him, and was utterly defeated and broken atthe battle of Jena (1806). Although Austria and Prussia were broken, Russia wasstill a fighting power, and the next year was devoted to this unnecessaryantagonist of the French, against whom an abler and saner ruler would never havefought at all. We cannot trace in any detail the difficulties of the Polishcampaign against Russia; Napoleon was roughly handled at Pultusk—which heannounced in Paris as a brilliant victory—and again at Eylau. Then the Russianswere defeated at Friedland (1807). As yet he had never touched Russian soil, theRussians were still as unbeaten as the British; but now came an extraordinarypiece of good fortune for Napoleon. By a mixture of boasting, subtlety, andflattery he won over the young and ambitious Tsar, Alexander I—he was justthirty years old—to an alliance. The two emperors met on a raft in the middle ofthe Niemen at Tilsit, and there came to an understanding.This meeting was an occasion for sublime foolishness on the part of both theprincipal actors. Alexander had imbibed much liberalism during his education atthe court of Catherine II, and was all for freedom, education, and the new orderof the world —subject to his own pre-eminence. “He would gladly have everyonefree,” said one of his early associates, “provided that everyone was prepared todo freely exactly what he wished.” And he declared that he would have abolishedserfdom if it had cost him his head—if only civilization had been more advanced.He made war against France, he said, because Napoleon was a tyrant, to free theFrench people. After Friedland he saw Napoleon in a different light. These twomen met eleven days after that rout; Alexander no doubt in the state ofexplanatory exaltation natural to his type during a mood of change.058 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_058_r1.gif]To Napoleon the meeting must have been extremely gratifying. This was his firstmeeting with an emperor upon terms of equality. Like all men of limited vision,this man was a snob to the bone, his continual solicitude for his titles showsas much, and here was a real emperor, a born emperor, taking his three-year-olddignities as equivalent to the authentic imperialism of Moscow. Two imaginationssoared together upon the raft at Tilsit. “What is Europe?” said Alexander. “Weare Europe.” They discussed the affairs of Prussia and Austria in that spirit,they divided Turkey in anticipation, they arranged for the conquest of India,and indeed of most of Asia, and that Russia should take Finland from the Swedes;and they disregarded the disagreeable fact that the greater part of the world’ssurface is sea, and that on the seas the British fleets sailed now unchallenged.Close at hand was Poland, ready to rise up and become the passionate ally ofFrance had Napoleon but willed it so. But he was blind to Poland. It was a dayof visions without vision. Napoleon even then, it seems, concealed the daringthought that he might one day marry a Russian princess, a real princess. Butthat, he was to learn in 1810, was going a little too far.After Tilsit there was a perceptible deterioration in Napoleon’s quality; hebecame rasher, less patient of obstacles, more and more the fated master of theworld, more and more intolerable to everyone he encountered.In 1808 he committed a very serious blunder. Spain was his abject ally,completely under his control, but he saw fit to depose its Bourbon king in orderto promote his brother Joseph from the crown of the two Sicilies. Portugal hehad already conquered, and the two kingdoms of Spain and Portugal were to beunited. Thereupon the Spanish arose in a state of patriotic fury, surrounded aFrench army at Baylen, and compelled it to surrender. It was an astonishingbreak in the French career of victory.The British were not slow to seize the foothold this insurrection gave them. ABritish army under Sir Arthur Wellesley (afterwards the Duke of Wellington)landed in Portugal, defeated the French at Vimiero, and compelled them to retireinto Spain. The news of these reverses caused a very great excitement in Germanyand Austria, and the Tsar assumed a more arrogant attitude towards his ally.There was another meeting of these two potentates at Erfurt, in which the Tsarwas manifestly less amenable to the dazzling tactics of Napoleon than he hadbeen. Followed four years of unstable “ascendancy” for France, while theoutlines on the map of Europe waved about like garments on a clothesline on awindy day. Napoleon’s personal empire grew by frank annexations to includeHolland, much of western Germany, much of Italy, and much of the easternAdriatic coast. But one by one the French colonies were falling to the British,and the British armies in the Spanish peninsula, with the Spanish auxiliaries,slowly pressed the French northward. All Europe was getting very weary ofNapoleon and very indignant with him; his antagonists now were no longer merelymonarchs and ministers, but whole peoples also. The Prussians, after thedisaster of Jena in 1806, had set to work to put their house in order. Under theleadership of Freiherr von Stein they had swept aside their feudalism, abolishedprivilege and serfdom, organized popular education and popular patriotism,accomplished, in fact, without any internal struggle nearly everything thatFrance had achieved in 1789. By 1810 a new Prussia existed, the nucleus of a newGermany. And now Alexander, inspired it would seem by dreams of world ascendancyeven crazier than his rival’s, was posing again as the friend of liberty. In1810 fresh friction was created by Alexander’s objection to Napoleon’smatrimonial ambitions. For he was now divorcing his old helper Josephine,because she was childless, in order to secure the “continuity” of his “dynasty.”Napoleon, thwarted of a Russian princess, snubbed indeed by Alexander, turned toAustria, and married the arch-duchess Marie Louise. The Austrian statesmen readhim aright. They were very ready to throw him their princess. By that marriageNapoleon was captured for the dynastic system; he might have been the maker of anew world, he preferred to be the son-in-law of the old.059 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_059_r1.gif]In the next two years this adventurer’s affairs crumbled apace. Nobody believedin his pretensions any more. He was no longer the leader and complement of therevolution; no longer the embodied spirit of a world reborn; he was just a newand nastier sort of autocrat. He had estranged all free-spirited men, and be hadantagonized the church. Kings and Jacobins were at one, when it came to thequestion of his overthrow. Only base and self-seeking people supported him,because he seemed to have the secret of success. Britain was now his inveterateenemy, Spain was blazing with a spirit that surely a Corsican should haveunderstood; it needed only a breach, with Alexander I to set this empire ofbluff and stage scenery swaying toward its downfall. The quarrel came.Alexander’s feelings for Napoleon had always been of a very mixed sort; heenvied Napoleon as a rival, and despised him as an underbred upstart. Moreover,there was a kind of vague and sentimental greatness about Alexander; he wasgiven to mystical religiosity, he had the conception of a mission for Russia andhimself to bring peace to Europe and the world—by destroying Napoleon. In thatrespect he had an imaginative greatness Napoleon lacked. But bringing peace toEurope seemed to him quite compatible with the annexation of Finland, of most ofPoland, and of great portions of the Turkish empire. This man’s mind moved in aluminous fog. And particularly he wanted to resume trading with Britain, againstwhich Napoleon had set his face. For all the trade of Germany had beendislocated and the mercantile classes embittered by the Napoleonic “ContinentalSystem,” which was to ruin Britain by excluding British goods from every countryin Europe. Russia had suffered more even than Germany.The breach came in 1811, when Alexander withdrew from the “Continental System.”In 1812 a great mass of armies, amounting altogether to 600,000 men, began tomove towards Russia under the supreme command of the new emperor. About halfthis force was French; the rest was drawn from the French allies and subjectpeoples. It was a conglomerate army like the army of Darius or the army ofKavadh. The Spanish war was still going on; Napoleon made no attempt to end it.Altogether, it drained away a quarter of a million men from France. He foughthis way across Poland and Russia to Moscow before the winter—for the most partthe Russian armies declined battle—and even before the winter closed in upon himhis position became manifestly dangerous. He took Moscow, expecting that thiswould oblige Alexander to make peace. Alexander would not make peace, andNapoleon found himself in much the same position as Darius had been in 2,300years before in South Russia. The Russians, still unconquered in a decisivebattle, raided his communications, wasted his army—disease helped them; evenbefore Napoleon reached Moscow 150,000 men had been lost. But he lacked thewisdom of Darius, and would not retreat. The winter remained mild for anunusually long time—he could have escaped; but instead he remained in Moscow,making impossible plans, at a loss. He had been marvellously lucky in all hisprevious flounderings; he had escaped undeservedly from Egypt, he had been savedfrom destruction in Britain by the British naval victories; but now he was inthe net again, and this time he was not to escape. Perhaps he would havewintered in Moscow, but the Russians smoked him out; they get fire to and burntmost of the city.It was late in October, too late altogether, before he decided to return. Hemade an ineffectual attempt to break through to a fresh line of retreat to thesouth-west, and then turned the faces of the survivors of his Grand Army towardsthe country they had devastated in their advance. Immense distances separatedthem from any friendly territory. The winter was in no hurry. For a week theGrand Army struggled through mud; then came sharp frosts, and then the firstflakes of snow, and then snow and snow. . . .Slowly discipline dissolved. The hungry army spread itself out in search ofsupplies until it broke up into mere bands of marauders. The peasants, if onlyin self-defence, rose against them, waylaid them, and murdered them; a cloud oflight cavalry —Scythians still—hunted them down. That retreat is one of thegreat tragedies of history.At last Napoleon and his staff and a handful of guards and attendants reappearedin Germany, bringing no army with him, followed only by straggling anddemoralized bands. The Grand Army, retreating under Murat, reached Königsberg ina disciplined state, but only about a thousand strong out of six hundredthousand. From Königsberg Murat fell back to Posen. The Prussian contingent hadsurrendered to the Russians; the Austrians had gone homeward to the south.Everywhere scattered fugitives, ragged, lean, and frost-bitten, spread the newsof the disaster.Napoleon’s magic was nearly exhausted. He did not dare to stay with his troopsin Germany; he fled post haste to Paris. He began to order new levies and gatherfresh armies amidst the wreckage of his world empire. Austria turned against him(1813); all Europe was eager to rise against this defaulting trustee of freedom,this mere usurper. He had betrayed the new order; the old order he had saved andrevived now destroyed him. Prussia rose, and the German “War of Liberation”began. Sweden joined his enemies. Later Holland revolted. Murat had ralliedabout 14,000 Frenchmen round his disciplined nucleus in Posen, and this forceretreated through Germany, as a man might retreat who had ventured into acageful of drugged lions and found that the effects of the drug wereevaporating. Napoleon, with fresh forces, took up the chief command in thespring, won a great battle at Dresden, and then for a time he seems to have goneto pieces intellectually and morally. He became insanely irritable, with moodsof inaction. He did little or nothing to follow up the Battle of Dresden, InSeptember the “Battle of the Nations” was fought round and about Leipzig, afterwhich the Saxons, who had hitherto followed his star, went over to the allies.The end of the year saw the French beaten back into France.1814 was the closing campaign. France was invaded from the east and the south;Swedes, Germans, Austrians, Russians, crossed the Rhine; British and Spanishcame through the Pyrenees. Once more Napoleon fought brilliantly, but now hefought ineffectually. The eastern armies did not so much defeat him as push pasthim, and Paris capitulated in March. A little later at Fontainebleau the emperorabdicated.In Provence, on his way out of the country, his life was endangered by aroyalist mob.§ 5This was the natural and proper end of Napoleon’s career. So this raid of anintolerable egotist across the disordered beginnings of a new time should haveclosed. At last he was suppressed. And had there been any real wisdom in theconduct of human affairs, we should now have to tell of the concentration ofhuman science and will upon the task his treachery and vanity had interrupted,the task of building up a world system of justice and free effort in the placeof the bankrupt ancient order. But we have to tell of nothing of the sort.Science and wisdom were conspicuously absent from the great council of theAllies. Came the vague humanitarianism and dreamy vanity of the Tsar Alexander,came the shaken Habsburgs of Austria, the resentful Hohenzollerns of Prussia,the aristocratic traditions of Britain, still badly frightened by the revolutionand its conscience all awry with stolen commons and sweated factory children. Nopeoples came to the Congress, but only monarchs and foreign ministers; andthough you bray a foreign office in the bloodiest of war mortars, yet will itsdiplomatic habits not depart from it. The Congress had hardly assembled beforethe diplomatists set to work making secret bargains and treaties behind eachother’s backs. Nothing could exceed the pompous triviality of the Congress whichgathered at Vienna after a magnificent ceremonial visit of the allied sovereignsto London. The social side of the Congress was very strong, pretty ladiesabounded, there was a galaxy of stars and uniforms, endless dinners and balls, amighty flow of bright anecdotes and sparkling wit. Whether the two million deadmen upon the battlefields laughed at the jokes, admired the assemblies, andmarvelled at the diplomatists is beyond our knowledge. It is to be hoped theirpoor wraiths got something out of the display. The brightest spirit of thegathering was a certain Talleyrand, one of Napoleon’s princes, a very brilliantman indeed, who had been a pre-revolutionary cleric, who had proposed therevolutionary confiscation of the church estates, and who was now for bringingback the Bourbons.060 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_060_r1.gif]The allies, after the fashion of Peace Congresses, frittered away precious timein more and more rapacious disputes; the Bourbons returned to France. Back cameall the remainder of the émigrés with them, eager for restitution and revenge.One great egotism had been swept aside—only to reveal a crowd of meaneregotists. The new king was the brother of Louis XVI; he had taken the title ofLouis XVIII very eagerly so soon as he learnt that his little nephew (LouisXVII) was dead in the Temple. He was gouty and clumsy, not perhaps ill-disposed,but the symbol of the ancient system; all that was new in France felt the heavythreat of reaction that came with him. This was no liberation, only a newtyranny, a heavy and inglorious tyranny instead of an active and splendid one.Was there no hope for France but this? The Bourbons showed particular maliceagainst the veterans of the Grand Army, and France was now full of returnedprisoners of war, who found themselves under a cloud, Napoleon had been packedoff to a little consolation empire of his own, upon the island of Elba. He wasstill to he called Emperor and keep a certain state. The chivalry or whim ofAlexander had insisted upon this treatment of his fallen rival. The Habsburgs,who had toadied to his success, had taken away his Habsburg empress—she wentwillingly enough—to Vienna, and he never saw her again.After eleven months at Elba Napoleon judged that France had had enough of theBourbons; he contrived to evade the British ships that watched his island, andreappeared at Cannes in France for his last gamble against fate. His progress toParis was a triumphal procession; he walked on white Bourbon cockades. For ahundred days, “the Hundred Days,” he was master of France again.His return created a perplexing position for any honest Frenchman. On the onehand there was this adventurer who had betrayed the republic; on the other thedull weight of old kingship restored. The allies would not hear of any furtherexperiments in republicanism; it was the Bourbons or Napoleon. Is it any wonderthat on the whole France was with Napoleon? And he came back professing to be achanged man; there was to be no more despotism; he would respect theconstitutional régime. . . .He gathered an army, he made some attempts at peace with the allies; when hefound these efforts ineffectual, he struck swiftly at the British, Dutch, andPrussians in Belgium, hoping to defeat them before the Austrians and Russianscould come up. He did very nearly manage this. He beat the Prussians at Ligny,but not sufficiently; and then he was hopelessly defeated by the tenacity of theBritish under Wellington at Waterloo (1815), the Prussians, under Blücher,coming in on his right flank as the day wore on. Waterloo ended in a rout; it,left Napoleon without support and without hope. France fell away from him again.Everyone who had joined him was eager now to attack him, and so efface thaterror. A provisional government in Paris ordered him to leave the country; wasfor giving him twenty-four hours to do it in.He tried to get to America, but Rochefort, which he reached, was watched byBritish cruisers. France, now disillusioned and uncomfortably royalist again,was hot in pursuit of him. He went aboard a British, frigate, the Bellerophon,asking to be received as a refugee, but being treated as a prisoner. He wastaken to Plymouth, and from Plymouth straight to the lonely tropical island ofSt. Helena.There he remained until his death from cancer in 1821, devoting himself chieflyto the preparation of his memoirs, which were designed to exhibit the chiefevents of his life in a misleading and attractive light and to minimise hisworst blunders. One or two of the men with him recorded his conversations andset down their impressions of him.These works had a great vogue in France and Europe. The Holy Alliance of themonarchs of Russia, Austria, and Prussia (to which other monarchs were invitedto adhere) laboured under the delusion that in defeating Napoleon they haddefeated the Revolution, turned back the clock of fate, and restored GrandMonarchy—on a sanctified basis for evermore. The cardinal document of the schemeof the Holy Alliance is said to have been drawn up under the inspiration of theBaroness von Krüdener, who seems to have been a sort of spiritual director tothe Russian emperor. It opened, “In the name of the Most Holy and IndivisibleTrinity,” and it bound the participating monarchs “regarding themselves towardstheir subjects and armies as fathers of families,” and “considering each otheras fellow-countrymen,” to sustain each other, protect true religion, and urgetheir subjects to strengthen and exercise themselves in Christian duties.Christ, it was declared, was the real king of all Christian peoples, a veryMerovingian king, one may remark, with these reigning sovereigns as his mayorsof the palace. The British king had no power to sign this document, the pope andthe sultan were not asked; the rest of the European monarchs, including the kingof France, adhered. But the king of Poland did not sign because there was noking in Poland; Alexander, in a mood of pious abstraction, was sitting on thegreater part of Poland. The Holy Alliance never became an actual legal allianceof states; it gave place to a real league of nations, the Concert of Europe,which France joined in 1818, and from which Britain withdrew in 1822.There followed a period of peace and dull oppression in Europe over whichAlexander brooded in attitudes of orthodoxy, piety, and unquenchableself-satisfaction. Many people in those hopeless days were disposed to regardeven Napoleon with charity, and to accept his claim that in some inexplicableway he had, in asserting himself, been asserting the revolution and France. Acult of him as of something mystically heroic grew up after his death.§ 6For nearly forty years the idea of the Holy Alliance, the Concert of Europewhich arose out of it, and the series of congresses and conferences thatsucceeded the concert, kept an insecure peace in war-exhausted Europe. Two mainthings prevented that period from being a complete social and internationalpeace, and prepared the way for the cycle of wars between 1854 and 1871. Thefirst of these was the tendency of the royal courts concerned, towards therestoration of unfair privilege and interference with freedom of thought andwriting and teaching. The second was the impossible system of boundaries drawnby the diplomatists of Vienna.The obstinate disposition of monarchy to march back towards past conditions wasfirst and most particularly manifest in Spain. Here even the Inquisition wasrestored. Across the Atlantic the Spanish colonies had followed the example ofthe United States and revolted against the European Great Power system, whenNapoleon set up his brother Joseph upon the Spanish throne in 1810. TheWashington of South America was General Bolivar. Spain was unable to suppressthis revolt, it dragged on much as the United States War of Independence haddragged on, and at last the suggestion was made by Austria in accordance withthe spirit of the Holy Alliance, that the European monarchs should assist Spainin this struggle. This was opposed by Britain in Europe, but it was the promptaction of President Monroe of the United States in 1823 which conclusivelywarned off this projected monarchist restoration. He announced that the UnitedStates would regard any extension of the European system in the WesternHemisphere as a hostile act. Thus arose the Monroe Doctrine, which has kept theGreat Power system out of America for nearly a hundred years, and permitted thenew states of Spanish America to work out their destinies along their own lines.But if Spanish monarchism lost its colonies, it could at least, under theprotection of the Concert of Europe, do what it chose in Europe. A popularinsurrection in Spain was crashed by a French army in 1823, with a mandate froma European congress, and simultaneously Austria suppressed a revolution inNaples. The moving spirit in this conspiracy of governments against peoples wasthe Austrian statesman, Metternich.In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by that Count d’Artois whom we haveseen hovering as an émigré on the French frontiers in 1789; he took the title ofCharles X. Charles set himself to destroy the liberty of the press anduniversities, and to restore absolute government; the sum of a billion francswas voted to compensate the nobles for the château burnings and sequestrationsof 1789. In 1830 Paris rose against this embodiment of the ancient régime, andreplaced him by the son of that sinister Philip, Duke of Orleans, whoseexecution was one of the brightest achievements of the Terror. The othercontinental monarchies, in face of the open approval of the revolution by GreatBritain and a strong liberal ferment in Germany and Austria, did not interferein this affair. After all, France was still a monarchy. This young man, LouisPhilippe (1830-48), remained the constitutional king of France for eighteenyears. He went down in 1848, a very eventful year for Europe, of which we shalltell in the next chapter.061 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_061_r1.gif]Such were the uneasy swayings of the peace of the Congress of Vienna, which wereprovoked by the reactionary proceedings to which, sooner or later, allmonarchist courts seem by their very nature to gravitate. The stresses thatarose from the unscientific map-making of the diplomatists gathered force moredeliberately, but they were even more dangerous to the peace of mankind. It isextraordinarily inconvenient to administer together the affairs of peoplesspeaking different languages and so reading different literatures and havingdifferent general ideas, especially if those differences are exacerbated byreligious disputes. Only some strong mutual interest, such as the commondefensive needs of the Swiss mountaineers, can justify a close linking ofpeoples of dissimilar languages and faiths; and even in Switzerland there is theutmost local autonomy. Ultimately, when the Great Power tradition is certainlydead and buried, those Swiss populations may gravitate towards their naturalaffinities in Germany, France, and Italy. When, as in Macedonia, populations aremixed in a patchwork of villages and districts, the cantonal system isimperatively needed. But if the reader will look at the map of Europe as theCongress of Vienna drew it, he will see that this gathering seems almost as ifit had planned the maximum of local exasperation. It destroyed the DutchRepublic, quite needlessly, it lumped together the Protestant Dutch with theFrench-speaking Catholics of the old Spanish (Austrian) Netherlands, and set upa kingdom of the Netherlands. It handed over not merely the old republic ofVenice, but all of North Italy as far as Milan to the German-speaking Austrians.French-speaking Savoy it combined with pieces of Italy to restore the kingdom ofSardinia. Austria and Hungary, already a sufficiently explosive mixture ofdiscordant nationalities, Germans, Hungarians, Czecho-Slovaks, Jugo-Slavs,Rumanians, and now Italians, was made still more impossible by confirmingAustria’s Polish acquisitions of 1772 and 1795. The Polish people, beingcatholic and republican-spirited, were chiefly given over to the less civilizedrule of the Greek-orthodox Tsar, but important districts went to ProtestantPrussia. The Tsar was also confirmed in his acquisition of the entirely alienFinns. The very dissimilar Norwegian and Swedish peoples were bound togetherunder one king. Germany, the reader will see, was left in a particularlydangerous state of muddle. Prussia and Austria were both partly in and partlyout of a German confederation, which included a multitude of minor states. TheKing of Denmark came into the German confederation by virtue of certainGerman-speaking possessions in Holstein. Luxembourg was included in the GermanConfederation, though its ruler was also king of the Netherlands, and thoughmany of its peoples talked French. Here was a crazy tangle, an outrage on thecommon sense of mankind, a preposterous disregard of the fact that the peoplewho talk German and base their ideas on German literature, the people who talkItalian and base their ideas on Italian literature, and the people who talkPolish and base their ideas on Polish literature, will all be far better off andmost helpful and least obnoxious to the rest of mankind if they conduct theirown affairs in their own idiom within the ring-fence of their own speech. Is itany wonder that one of the most popular songs in Germany during this perioddeclared that wherever the German tongue was spoken, there was the GermanFatherland?Even today men are still reluctant to recognize that areas of government are notmatters for the bargaining and interplay of tsars and kings and foreign offices.There is a natural and necessary political map of the world which transcendsthese things. There is a best way possible of dividing any part of the worldinto administrative areas, and a best possible kind of government for everyarea, having regard to the speech and race of its inhabitants, and it is thecommon concern of all men of intelligence to secure those divisions andestablish those forms of government quite irrespective of diplomacies and flags,“claims” and melodramatic “loyalties” and the existing political map of theworld. The natural political map of the world insists upon itself. It heaves andfrets beneath the artificial political map like some misfitted giant. In 1830French-speaking Belgium, stirred up by the current revolution in France,revolted against its Dutch association in the kingdom of the Netherlands. ThePowers, terrified at the possibility of a republic and of annexation to France,hurried in to pacify this situation, and gave the Belgians a monarch from thatrich breeding-ground of monarchs, Germany, Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg Gotha. Therewere also ineffectual revolts in Italy and Germany in 1830, and a much moreserious, one in Russian Poland. A republican government held out in Warsaw for ayear against Nicholas I (who succeeded Alexander in 1825), and was then stampedout of existence with great violence and cruelty. The Polish language wasbanned, and the Greek Orthodox church was substituted for the Roman Catholic asthe State religion. . . .An outbreak of the natural political map of the world, which occurred in 1821,ultimately secured the support of England, France, and Russia. This was theinsurrection of the Greeks against the Turks. For six years they fought adesperate war, while the governments of Europe looked on. Liberal opinionprotested against this inactivity; volunteers from every European country joinedthe insurgents, and at last Britain, France, and Russia took joint action. TheTurkish fleet was destroyed by the French and English at the Battle of Navarino(1827), and the Tsar invaded Turkey. By the treaty of Adrianople (1829) Greecewas declared free, but she was not permitted to resume her ancient republicantraditions. There is a sort of historical indecency in a Greek monarchy. But aGreek republic would have been dangerous to all monarchy in a Europe thatfretted under the ideas of the Holy Alliance. A German king was found forGreece, one Prince Otto of Bavaria, slightly demented, but quite royal—he gaveway to delusions about his divine right, and was ejected in 1862—and Christiangovernors were set up in the Danubian provinces (which are now Rumania) andSerbia (a part of the Jugo-Slav region). This was a partial concession to thenatural political map, but much blood had still to run before the Turk wasaltogether expelled from these lands.A little later the natural political map was to assert itself in Italy andGermany.062 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_062_r1.gif]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XTHE REALITIES AND IMAGINATIONS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY§ 1.

TheBritish Empire in 1914.§ 1THE career and personality of Napoleon I bulks disproportionately in thenineteenth century histories. He was of little significance to the broad onwardmovement of human affairs; he was an interruption, a reminder of latent evils, athing like the bacterium of some pestilence. Even regarded as a pestilence, hewas not of supreme rank; he killed far fewer people than the influenza epidemicof 1918, and produced less political and social disruption than the plague ofJustinian. Some such interlude had to happen, and some such patched-upsettlement of Europe as the Concert of Europe, because there was no worked-outsystem of ideas upon which a new world could be constructed. And even theConcert of Europe had in it an element of progress. It did at least set asidethe individualism of Machiavellian monarchy and declare that there was a humanor at any rate a European commonweal. If it divided the world among the kings,it made respectful gestures towards human unity and the service of God and man.The permanently effective task before mankind which had to be done before anynew and enduring social and political edifice was possible, the task upon whichthe human intelligence is, with many interruptions and amidst much anger andturmoil, still engaged, was, and is, the task of working out and applying aScience of Property as a basis for freedom and social justice, a Science ofCurrency to ensure and preserve an efficient economic medium, a Science ofGovernment and Collective Operations whereby in every community men may learn topursue their common interests in harmony, a Science of World Politics, throughwhich the stark waste and cruelty of warfare between races, peoples, and nationsmay be brought to an end and the common interests of mankind brought under acommon control, and, above all, a world-wide System of Education to sustain thewill and interest of men in their common human adventure. The real makers ofhistory in the nineteenth century, the people whose consequences will bedetermining human life a century ahead, were those who advanced and contributedto this fivefold constructive effort. Compared to them, the foreign ministersand “statesmen” and politicians of this period were no more than a number oftroublesome and occasionally incendiary schoolboys—and a few metalthieves—playing about and doing transitory mischief amidst the accumulatingmaterials upon the site of a great building whose nature they did notunderstand.And while throughout the nineteenth century the mind of Western civilization,which the Renascence had released, gathered itself to the task of creativesocial and political reconstruction that still lies before it, there sweptacross the world a wave of universal change in human power and the materialconditions of life that the first scientific efforts of that liberated mind hadmade possible. The prophecies of Roger Bacon began to live in reality. Theaccumulating knowledge and confidence of the little succession of men who hadbeen carrying on the development of science, now began to bear fruit that commonmen could understand. The most obvious firstfruit was the steam-engine. Thefirst steam-engines in the eighteenth century were pumping engines used to keepwater out of the newly opened coal mines. These coal mines were being worked tosupply coke for iron smelting, for which wood-charcoal had previously beenemployed. It was James Watt, a mathematical instrument maker of Glasgow, whoimproved this steam-pumping engine and made it available for the driving ofmachinery. The first engine so employed was installed in a cotton mill inNottingham in 1785. In 1804 Trevithick adapted the Watt engine to transport, andmade the first locomotive. In 1825 the first railway, between Stockton andDarlington, was opened for traffic. The original engine (locomotive No. 1, 1825)still adorns Darlington platform. By the middle of the century a network ofrailways had spread all over Europe.Here was a sudden change in what had long been a fixed condition of human life,the maximum rate of land transport. After the Russian disaster, Napoleontravelled from near Vilna to Paris in 312 hours. This was a journey of about1,400 miles. He was travelling with every conceivable advantage, and he averagedunder five miles an hour. An ordinary traveller could not have done thisdistance in twice the time. These were about the same maximum rates of travel asheld good between Rome and Gaul in the first century A.D., or between Sardis andSusa in the fourth century B.C. Then suddenly came a tremendous change. Therailways reduced this journey for any ordinary traveller to less thanforty-eight hours. That is to say, they reduced the chief European distances toabout a tenth of what they had been. They made it possible to carry outadministrative work in areas ten times as great as any that had hitherto beenworkable under one administration. The full significance of that possibility inEurope still remains to be realized. Europe is still netted in boundaries drawnin the horse and road era. In America the effects were immediate. To the UnitedStates of America, sprawling westward, it meant the possibility of a continuousaccess to Washington, however far the frontier travelled across the continent.It meant unity, sustained on a scale that would otherwise have been impossible.The steamboat was, if anything, a little ahead of the steam-engine in itsearlier phases. There was a steamboat, the Charlotte Dundas, on the Firth ofClyde Canal in 1802, and in 1807 an American named Fulton had a paying steamer,The Clermont, with British-built engines, upon the Hudson river above New York.The first steamship to put to sea was also an American, the Phœnix, which wentfrom New York (Hoboken) to Philadelphia. So, too, was the first ship using steam(she also had sails) to cross the Atlantic, the Savannah (1819). All these werepaddle-wheel boats, and paddle-wheel boats are not adapted to work in heavyseas. The paddles smash too easily, and the boat is then disabled. The screwsteamship followed rather slowly. Many difficulties had to be surmounted beforethe screw was a practicable thing. Not until the middle of the century did thetonnage of steamships upon the sea begin to overhaul that of sailing-ships.After that the evolution in sea transport was rapid. For the first time menbegan to cross the seas and oceans with some certainty as to the date of theirarrival. The transatlantic crossing, which had been an uncertain adventure ofseveral weeks—which might stretch to months—was accelerated, until in 1910 itwas brought down, in the case of the fastest boats, to under five days, with apractically notifiable hour of arrival. All over the oceans there was the samereduction in the time and the same increase in the certainty of humancommunications.Concurrently with the development of steam transport upon land and sea a new andstriking addition to the facilities of human intercourse arose out of theinvestigations of Volta, Galvani, and Faraday into various electrical phenomena.The electric telegraph came into existence in 1835. The first underseas cablewas laid in 1851 between France and England. In a few years the telegraph systemhad spread over the civilized world, and news which had hitherto travelledslowly from point to point became practically simultaneous throughout the earth.These things, the steam railway and the electric telegraph, were to the popularimagination of the middle nineteenth century the most striking and revolutionaryof inventions, but they were only the most conspicuous and clumsy firstfruits ofa far more extensive process. Technical knowledge and skill were developing withan extraordinary rapidity, and to an extraordinary extent measured by theprogress of any previous age. Far less conspicuous at first in everyday life,but finally far more important, was the extension of man’s power over variousstructural materials. Before the middle of the eighteenth century iron wasreduced from its ores by means of wood-charcoal, was handled in small pieces,and hammered and wrought into shape. It was material for a craftsman. Qualityand treatment were enormously dependent upon the experience and sagacity of theindividual iron worker. The largest masses of iron that could be dealt withunder those conditions amounted at most (in the sixteenth century) to two orthree tons. (There was a very definite upward limit, therefore, to the size ofcannon.) The blast furnace arose in the eighteenth century, and developed withthe use of coke. Not before the eighteenth century do we find rolled sheet iron(1728) and rolled rods and bars (1783). Nasmyth’s steam hammer came as late as1838. The ancient world, because of its metallurgical inferiority, could not usesteam. The steam-engine, even the primitive pumping engine, could not developbefore sheet iron was available. The early engines seem to the modern eye verypitiful and clumsy bits or ironmongery, but they were the utmost that themetallurgical science of the time could do. As late as 1856 came the Bessemerprocess, and presently (1864) the open-hearth process, in which steel and everysort of iron could be melted, purified, and cast in a manner and upon a scalehitherto unheard of. Today in the electric furnace one may see tons ofincandescent steel swirling about like boiling milk in a saucepan. Nothing inthe previous practical advances of mankind is comparable in its consequences tothe complete mastery over enormous masses of steel and iron and over theirtexture and quality which man has now achieved. The railways and early enginesof all sorts were the mere first triumphs of the new metallurgical methods.Presently came ships of iron and steel, vast bridges, and a new way of buildingwith steel upon a gigantic scale. Men realized too late that they had plannedtheir railways with far too timid a gauge, that they could have organized theirtravelling with far more steadiness and comfort upon a much bigger scale.Before the nineteenth century there were no ships in the world much over 2,000tons burthen; now there is nothing wonderful about a 50,000-ton liner. There arepeople who sneer at this kind of progress as being a progress in “mere size,”but that sort of sneering merely marks the intellectual limitations of those whoindulge in it. The great ship or the steel-frame building is not, as theyimagine, a magnified version of the small ship or building of the past; it is athing different in kind, more lightly and strongly built, of finer and strongermaterials; instead of being a thing of precedent and rule-of-thumb, it is athing of subtle and intricate calculation. In the old house or ship, matter wasdominant—the material and its needs had to be slavishly obeyed; in the new,matter has been captured, changed, coerced. Think of the coal and iron and sanddragged out of the banks and pits, wrenched, wrought, molten, and cast, to beflung at last, a slender, glittering pinnacle of steel and glass, six hundredfeet above the crowded city!We have given these particulars of the advance in man’s knowledge of themetallurgy of steel and its results by way of illustration. A parallel storycould be told of the metallurgy of copper and tin, and of a multitude of metals,nickel and aluminium to name but two, unknown before the ninteenth centurydawned. It is in this great and growing mastery over substances, over differentsorts of glass, over rocks and plasters and the like, over colours and textures,that the main triumphs of the mechanical revolution have thus far been achieved.Yet we are still in the stage of the firstfruits in the matter. We have thepower, but we have still to learn how to use our power. Many of the firstemployments of these gifts of science have been vulgar, tawdry, stupid, orhorrible. The artist and the adaptor have still hardly begun to work with theendless variety of substances now at their disposal.Parallel with this extension of mechanical possibilities the new science ofelectricity grew up. It was only in the eighties of the nineteenth century thatthis body of inquiry began to yield results to impress the vulgar mind. Thensuddenly came electric light and electric traction, and the transmutation offorces, the possibility of sending power, that could be changed into mechanicalmotion or light or heat as one chose, along a copper wire, as water is sentalong a pipe, began to come through to the ideas of ordinary people. . . .The British and the French were at first the leading peoples in this greatproliferation of knowledge; but presently the Germans, who had learnt humilityunder Napoleon, showed such zeal and pertinacity in scientific inquiry as tooverhaul these leaders. British science was largely the creation of Englishmenand Scotchmen1 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en84] working outsidethe ordinary centres of erudition.2[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en85] We have told how in Englandthe universities after the reformation ceased to have a wide popular appeal, howthey became the educational preserve of the nobility and gentry, and thestrongholds of the established church. A pompous and unintelligent classicalpretentiousness dominated them, and they dominated the schools of the middle andupper classes. The only knowledge recognized was an uncritical textual knowledgeof a selection of Latin and Greek classics, and the test of a good style was itsabundance of quotations, allusions, and stereotyped expressions. The earlydevelopment of British science went on, therefore, in spite of the formaleducational organization, and in the teeth of the bitter hostility of theteaching and clerical professions. French education, too, was dominated by theclassical tradition of the Jesuits, and consequently it was not difficult forthe Germans to organize a body of investigators, small indeed in relation to thepossibilities of the case, but large in proportion to the little band of Britishand French inventors and experimentalists. And though this work of research andexperiment was making Britain and France the most rich and powerful countries inthe world, it was not making scientific and inventive men rich and powerful.There is a necessary unworldliness about a sincere scientific man; he is toopreoccupied with his research to plan and scheme how to make money out of it.The economic exploitation of his discoveries falls very easily and naturally,therefore, into the hands of a more acquisitive type; and so we find that thecrops of rich men which every fresh phase of scientific and technical progresshas produced in Great Britain, though they have not displayed quite the samepassionate desire to insult and kill the goose that laid the national goldeneggs as the scholastic and clerical professions, have been quite content to letthat profitable creature starve. Inventors and discoverers came by nature, theythought, for cleverer people to profit by.In this matter the Germans were a little wiser. The German “learned” did notdisplay the same vehement hatred of the new learning. They permitted itsdevelopment. The German business man and manufacturer again had not quite thesame contempt for the man of science as had his British competitor. Knowledge,these Germans believed, might be a cultivated crop, responsive to fertilizers.They did concede, therefore, a certain amount of opportunity to the scientificmind; their public expenditure on scientific work was relatively greater, andthis expenditure was abundantly rewarded. By the latter half of the nineteenthcentury the German scientific worker had made German a necessary language forevery science student who wished to keep abreast with the latest work in hisdepartment, and in certain branches, and particularly in chemistry, Germanyacquired a very great superiority over her western neighbours. The scientificeffort of the sixties and seventies in Germany began to tell after the eighties,and the Germans gained steadily upon Britain and France in technical andindustrial prosperity.In an Outline of History such as this it is impossible to trace the network ofcomplex mental processes that led to the incessant extension of knowledge andpower that is now going on; all we can do here is to call the reader’s attentionto the most salient turning-points that finally led the toboggan of humanaffairs into its present swift ice-run of progress. We have told of the firstrelease of human curiosity and of the beginnings of systematic inquiry andexperiment. We have told, too, how, when the plutocratic Roman system and itsresultant imperialism had come and gone again, this process of inquiry wasrenewed. We have told of the escape of investigation from ideas of secrecy andpersonal advantage to the idea of publication and a brotherhood of knowledge,and we have noted the foundation of the British Royal Society, the FlorentineSociety, and their like as a consequence of this socializing of thought. Thesethings were the roots of the mechanical revolution, and so long as the root ofpure scientific inquiry lives, that revolution will progress. The mechanicalrevolution itself began, we may say, with the exhaustion of the wood supply forthe ironworks of England. This led to the use of coal, the coal mine led to thesimple pumping engine, the development of the pumping engine by Watt into amachine-driving engine led on to the locomotive and the steamship. This was thefirst phase of a great expansion in the use of steam. A second phase in themechanical revolution began with the application of electrical science topractical problems and the development of electric lighting, power transmission,and traction.A third phase is to be distinguished when in the eighties a new type of enginecame into use, an engine in which the expansive force of an explosive mixturereplaced the expansive force of steam. The light, highly efficient engines thatwere thus made possible were applied to the automobile, and developed at last toreach such a pitch of lightness and efficiency as to render flight —long knownto be possible—a practical achievement. A successful flying-machine—but not amachine large enough to take up a human body—was made by Professor Langley ofthe Smithsonian Institute of Washington as early as 1897. By 1909 the aeroplanewas available for human locomotion. There had seemed to be a pause in theincrease of human speed with the perfection of railways and automobile roadtraction, but with the flying machine came fresh reductions in the effectivedistance between one point of the earth’s surface and another. In the eighteenthcentury the distance from London to Edinburgh was an eight days’ journey; in1918 the British Civil Air Transport Commission reported that the journey fromLondon to Melbourne, half-way round the earth, would probably, in a few years’time, be accomplished in that same period of eight days.Too much stress must not be laid upon these striking reductions in the timedistances of one place from another. They are merely one aspect of a muchprofounder and more momentous enlargement of human possibility. The science ofagriculture and agricultural chemistry, for instance, made quite paralleladvances during the nineteenth century. Men learnt so to fertilize the soil asto produce quadruple and quintuple the crops got from the same area in theseventeenth century. There was a still more extraordinary advance in medicalscience; the average duration of life rose, the daily efficiency increased, thewaste of life through ill-health diminished.Now here altogether we have such a change in human life as to constitute a freshphase of history. In a little more than a century this mechanical revolution hasbeen brought about. In that time man made a stride in the material conditions ofhis life vaster than he had done during the whole long interval between thepalæolithic stage and the age of cultivation, or between the days of Pepi inEgypt and those of George III. A new gigantic material framework for humanaffairs has come into existence. Clearly it demands great readjustments of oursocial, economical, and political methods. But these readjustments havenecessarily waited upon the development of the mechanical revolution, and theyare still only in their opening stage today.§ 2There is a tendency in many histories to confuse together what we have herecalled the mechanical revolution, which was an entirely new thing in humanexperience arising out of the development of organized science, a new step likethe invention of agriculture or the discovery of metals, with something else,quite different in its origins, something for which there was already anhistorical precedent, the social and financial development which is called theindustrial revolution. The two processes were going on together, they wereconstantly reacting upon each other, but they were in root and essencedifferent. There would have been an industrial revolution of sorts if there hadbeen no coal, no steam, no machinery; but in that case it would probably havefollowed far more closely upon the lines of the social and financialdevelopments of the later years of the Roman republic. It would have repeatedthe story of dispossessed free cultivators, gang labour, great estates, greatfinancial fortunes, and a socially destructive financial process. Even thefactory method came before power and machinery. Factories were the product notof machinery, but of the “division of labour.” Drilled and sweated workers weremaking such things as millinery, cardboard boxes and furniture, and colouringmaps and book illustrations, and so forth, before even water-wheels had beenused for industrial processes. There were factories in Rome in the days ofAugustus. New books, for instance, were dictated to rows of copyists in thefactories of the book-sellers. The attentive student of Defoe and of thepolitical pamphlets of Fielding will realize that the idea of herding poorpeople into establishments to work collectively for their living was alreadycurrent in Britain before the close of the seventeenth century. There areintimations of it even as early as More’s Utopia (1516). It was a social and nota mechanical development.Up to past the middle of the eighteenth century the social and economic historyof western Europe was in fact retreading the path along which the Roman Statehad gone in the three last centuries B.C. America was in many ways a new Spain,and India and China a new Egypt. But the political disunions of Europe, thepolitical convulsions against monarchy, the recalcitrance of the common folk andperhaps also the greater accessibility of the western European intelligence tomechanical ideas and inventions, turned the process into quite novel directions.Ideas of human solidarity, thanks to Christianity, were far more widely diffusedin this newer European world, political power was not so concentrated, and theman of energy anxious to get rich turned his mind, therefore, very willinglyfrom the ideas of the slave and of gang labour to the idea of mechanical powerand the machine.The mechanical revolution, the process of mechanical invention and discovery,was a new thing in human experience, and it went on regardless of the social,political, economic, and industrial consequences it might produce. Theindustrial revolution, on the other hand, like most other human affairs, was andis more and more profoundly changed and deflected by the constant variation inhuman conditions caused by the mechanical revolution. And the essentialdifference between the amassing of riches, the extinction of small farmers andsmall business men and the phase of big finance in the latter centuries of theRoman Republic on the one hand, and the very similar concentration of capital inthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries on the other, lies in the profounddifference in the character of labour that the mechanical revolution wasbringing about. The power of the old world was human power; everything dependedultimately upon the driving power of human muscle, the muscle of ignorant andsubjugated men. A little animal muscle, supplied by draft oxen, horse traction,and the like, contributed. Where a weight had to be lifted, men lifted it; wherea rock had to be quarried, men chipped it out; where a field had to be ploughed,men and oxen ploughed it; the Roman equivalent of the steamship was the galleywith its banks of sweating rowers. A vast proportion of mankind in the earlycivilizations was employed in purely mechanical drudgery. At its onset,power-driven machinery did not seem to promise any release from suchunintelligent toil. Great gangs of men were employed in excavating canals, inmaking railway cuttings and embankments, and the like. The number of minersincreased enormously. But the extension of facilities and the output ofcommodities increased much more. And as the nineteenth century went on, theplain logic of the new situation asserted itself more clearly. Human beings wereno longer wanted as a source of mere indiscriminated power. What could be donemechanically by a human being could be done faster and better by a machine. Thehuman being was needed now only where choice and intelligence had to beexercised. Human beings were wanted only as human beings. The drudge, on whomall the previous civilizations had rested, the creature of mere obedience, theman whose brains were superfluous, had become unnecessary to the welfare ofmankind.This was as true of such ancient industries as agriculture and mining as it wasof the newest metallurgical processes. For ploughing, sowing, and harvesting,swift machines came forward to do the work of scores of men.3[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en86] The Roman civilization wasbuilt upon cheap and degraded human beings; modern civilization is being rebuiltupon cheap mechanical power. For a hundred years power has been getting cheaperand labour dearer. If for a generation or so machinery has had to wait its turnin the mine, it is simply because for a time men were cheaper than machinery.4[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en87]Now here was a change-over of quite primary importance in human affairs. Thechief solicitude of the rich and of the ruler in the old civilization had beento keep up a supply of drudges. As the nineteenth century went on, it becamemore and more plain to the intelligent directive people that the common man hadnow to be something better than a drudge. He had to be educated—if only tosecure “industrial efficiency.” He had to understand what he was about. From thedays of the first Christian propaganda, popular education had been smoulderingin Europe, just as it has smouldered in Asia wherever Islam has set its foot,because of the necessity of making the believer understand a little of thebelief by which he is saved, and of enabling him to read a little in the sacredbooks by which his belief is conveyed. Christian controversies, with theircompetition for adherents, ploughed the ground for the harvest of populareducation. In England, for instance, by the thirties and forties of thenineteenth century, the disputes of the sects and the necessity of catchingadherents young had produced an abundance of night schools, Sunday schools, anda series of competing educational organizations for children, the dissentingBritish schools, the church National Schools, and even Roman Catholic elementaryschools. The earlier, less enlightened manufacturers, unable to take a broadview of their own interests, hated and opposed these schools. But here againneedy Germany led her richer neighbours. The religious teacher in Britainpresently found the profit-seeker at his side, unexpectedly eager to get thecommonalty, if not educated, at least “trained” to a higher level of economicefficiency.The second half of the nineteenth century was a period of rapid advance inpopular education throughout all the Westernized world. There was no paralleladvance in the education of the upper classes, some advance no doubt, butnothing to correspond, and so the great gulf that had divided that worldhitherto into the readers and the non-reading mass became little more than aslightly perceptible difference in educational level. At the back of thisprocess was the mechanical revolution, apparently regardless of socialconditions, but really insisting inexorably upon the complete abolition of atotally illiterate class throughout the world.The economic revolution of the Roman republic had never been clearly apprehendedby the common people of Rome. The ordinary Roman citizen never saw the changesthrough which he lived, clearly and comprehensively as we see them. But theindustrial revolution, as it went on towards the end of the nineteenth century,was more and more distinctly seen as one whole process by the common people itwas affecting, because presently they could read and discuss and communicate,and because they went about and saw things as no commonalty had ever donebefore.In this Outline of History we have been careful to indicate the gradualappearance of the ordinary people as a class with a will and ideas in common. Itis the writer’s belief that massive movements of the “ordinary people” overconsiderable areas only became possible as a result of the propagandistreligions, Christianity and Islam, and their insistence upon individualself-respect. We have cited the enthusiasm of the commonalty for the FirstCrusade as marking a new phase in social history. But before the nineteenthcentury even these massive movements were comparatively restricted. Theequalitarian insurrections of the peasantry, from the Wycliffe period onward,were confined to the peasant communities of definite localities, they spreadonly slowly into districts affected by similar forces. The town artisan riotedindeed, but only locally. The château-burning of the French revolution was notthe act of a peasantry who had overthrown a government, it was the act of apeasantry released by the overthrow of a government. The Commune of Paris wasthe first effective appearance of the town artisan as a political power, and theParisian crowd of the First Revolution was a very mixed, primitive-thinking, andsavage crowd compared with any Western European crowd after 1830.But the mechanical revolution was not only pressing education upon the wholepopulation, it was leading to a big-capitalism and to a large-scalereorganization of industry that was to produce a new and distinctive system ofideas in the common people in the place of the mere uncomfortable recalcitranceand elemental rebellions of an illiterate commonalty. We have already noted howthe industrial revolution had split the manufacturing class, which had hithertobeen a middling and various sort of class, into two sections, the employers, whobecame rich enough to mingle with the financial, merchandizing, and landowningclasses, and the employees, who drifted to a status closer and closer to that ofmere gang and agricultural labour. As the manufacturing employee sank, theagricultural labourer, by the introduction of agricultural machinery and theincrease in his individual productivity, rose. By the middle of the nineteenthcentury, Karl Marx (1818-83), a German Jew of great scholarly attainments, whodid much of his work in the British Museum library in London, was pointing outthat the organization of the working classes by the steadily concentrating groupof capitalist owners, was developing a new social classification to replace themore complex class systems of the past. Property, so far as it was power, wasbeing gathered together into relatively few hands, the hands of the big richmen, the capitalist class; while there was a great mingling of workers withlittle or no property, whom he called the “expropriated,” or “proletariat”—amisuse of this word—who were bound to develop a common “class consciousness” ofthe conflict of their interests with those of the rich men. Differences ofeducation and tradition between the various older social elements which were inprocess of being fused up into the new class of the expropriated, seemed for atime to contradict this sweeping generalization; the traditions of theprofessions, the small employers, the farmer peasant and the like were alldifferent from one another and from the various craftsman traditions of theworkers; but with the spread of education and the cheapening of literature, this“Marxian” generalization becomes now more and more acceptable. These classes,who were linked at first by nothing but a common impoverishment, were and arebeing reduced or raised to the same standard of life, forced to read the samebooks and share the same inconveniences. A sense of solidarity between all sortsof poor and propertyless men, as against the profit-amassing andwealth-concentrating class, is growing more and more evident in our world. Olddifferences fade away, the difference between craftsman and open-air worker,between black coat and overall, between poor clergyman and elementaryschoolmaster, between policeman and bus-driver. They must all buy the same cheapfurnishings and live in similar cheap houses; their sons and daughters will allmingle and marry; success at the upper levels becomes more and more hopeless forthe rank and file. Marx, who did not so much advocate the class-war, the war ofthe expropriated mass against the appropriating few, as foretell it, is beingmore and more justified by events.5[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en88]§ 3To trace any broad outlines in the fermentation of ideas that went on during themechanical and industrial revolution of the nineteenth century is a verydifficult task. But we must attempt it if we are to link what has gone before inthis history with the condition of our world today.It will be convenient to distinguish two main periods in the hundred yearsbetween 1814 and 1914. First came the period 1814-48, in which there was a veryconsiderable amount of liberal thinking and writing in limited circles, butduring which there were no great changes or development of thought in thegeneral mass of the people. Throughout this period the world’s affairs wereliving, so to speak, on their old intellectual capital, they were going on inaccordance with the leading ideas of the Revolution and the counter-revolution.The dominant liberal ideas were freedom and a certain vague equalitarianism; theconservative ideas were monarchy, organized religion, social privilege, andobedience.Until 1848 the spirit of the Holy Alliance, the spirit of Metternich, struggledto prevent a revival of the European revolution that Napoleon had betrayed andset back. In America, both North and South, on the other hand, the revolutionhad triumphed and nineteenth-century liberalism ruled unchallenged. Britain wasan uneasy country, never quite loyally reactionary nor quite loyallyprogressive, neither truly monarchist nor truly republican, the land of Cromwelland also of the Merry Monarch, Charles; anti-Austrian, anti-Bourbon, anti-papal,yet, weakly repressive. We have told of the first series of liberal storms inEurope in and about the year 1830; in Britain in 1832 a Reform Bill, greatlyextending the franchise and restoring something of its representative characterto the House of Commons, relieved the situation. Round and about 1848 came asecond and much more serious system of outbreaks, that overthrew the Orleansmonarchy and established a second Republic in France (1848-52), raised NorthItaly and Hungary against Austria, and the Poles in Posen against the Germans,and sent the Pope in flight from the republicans of Rome. A very interestingPan-Slavic conference held at Prague foreshadowed many of the territorialreadjustments of 1919. It dispersed after an insurrection at Prague had beensuppressed by Austrian troops.Ultimately all these insurrections failed; the current system staggered, butkept its feet There were no doubt serious social discontents beneath theserevolts, but as yet, except in the case of Paris, these had no very clear form;and this 1848 storm, so far as the rest of Europe was concerned, may be bestdescribed, in a phrase, as a revolt of the natural political map against theartificial arrangements of the Vienna diplomatists, and the system ofsuppressions those arrangements entailed.The history of Europe, then, from 1815 to 1848 was, generally speaking, a sequelto the history of Europe from 1789 to 1814. There were no really new motifs inthe composition. The main trouble was still the struggle, though often a blindand misdirected struggle, of the interests of ordinary men against the GreatPower system which cramped and oppressed the life of mankind.But after 1848, from 1848 to 1914, though the readjustment of the map still wenton towards a free and unified Italy and a unified Germany, there began a freshphase in the process of mental and political adaptation to the new knowledge andthe new material powers of mankind. Came a great irruption of new social,religious, and political ideas into the general European mind. In the next threesections we will consider the origin and quality of these irruptions. They laidthe foundations upon which we base our political thought today, but for a longtime they had no very great effect on contemporary politics. Contemporarypolitics continued to run on in the old lines, but with a steadily diminishingsupport in the intellectual convictions and consciences of men. We have alreadydescribed the way in which a strong intellectual process undermined the systemof Grand Monarchy in France before 1789. A similar undermining process was goingon throughout Europe during the Great Power period of 1848-1914. Profound doubtsof the system of government and of the liberties of many forms of property inthe economic system spread throughout the social body. Then came the greatestand most disorganizing war in history, so that it is still impossible toestimate the power and range of the accumulated new ideas of those sixty-sixyears. We have been through a greater catastrophe even than the Napoleoniccatastrophe, and we are in a slack-water period, corresponding to the period1815-30. Our 1830 and our 1848 are still to come and show us where we stand.§ 4We have traced throughout this history the gradual restriction of the idea ofproperty from the first unlimited claim of the strong man to possess everythingand the gradual realization of brotherhood as something transcending personalself-seeking. Men were first subjugated into more than tribal societies by thefear of monarch and deity. It is only within the last three or at most fourthousand years that we have any clear evidence that voluntary self-abandonmentto some greater end, without fee or reward, was an acceptable idea to men, orthat anyone had propounded it. Then we find spreading over the surface of humanaffairs, as patches of sunshine spread and pass over the hillsides upon a windyday in spring, the idea that there is a happiness in self-devotion greater thanany personal gratification or triumph, and a life of mankind different andgreater and more important than the sum of all the individual lives within it.We have seen that idea become vivid as a beacon, vivid as sunshine caught andreflected dazzlingly by some window in the landscape, in the teachings ofBuddha, Lao Tse, and, most clearly of all, of Jesus of Nazareth. Through all itsvariations and corruptions Christianity has never completely lost the suggestionof a devotion to God’s commonweal that makes the personal pomps of monarchs andrulers seem like the insolence of an overdressed servant and the splendours andgratifications of wealth like the waste of robbers. No man living in a communitywhich such a religion as Christianity or Islam has touched can be altogether aslave; there is an ineradicable quality in these religions that compels men tojudge their masters and to realize their own responsibility for the world.As men have felt their way towards this new state of mind from the fierceself-centred greed and instinctive combativeness of the early palæolithic familygroup, they have sought to express the drift of their thoughts and necessitiesvery variously. They have found themselves in disagreement and conflict withold-established ideas, and there has been a natural tendency to contradict theseideas flatly, to fly over to the absolute contrary. Faced by a world in whichrule and classes and order seem to do little but give opportunity for personalselfishness and unrighteous oppression, the first impatient movement was todeclare for a universal equality and a practical anarchy. Faced by a world inwhich property seemed little more than a protection for selfishness and a methodof enslavement, it was as natural to repudiate all property. Our history showsan increasing impulse to revolt against rulers and against ownership. We havetraced it in the middle ages burning the rich man’s châteaux and experimentingin theocracy and communism. In the French revolutions this double revolt isclear and plain. In France we find side by side, inspired by the same spirit andas natural parts of the same revolutionary movement, men who, with their eyes onthe ruler’s taxes, declared that property should be inviolable, and others who,with their eyes on the employer’s hard bargains, declared that property shouldbe abolished. But what they are really revolting against in each case is thatthe ruler and the employer, instead of becoming servants of the community, stillremain, like most of mankind, self-seeking, oppressive individuals.Throughout the ages we find this belief growing in men’s minds that there can besuch a rearrangement of laws and powers as to give rule and order while stillrestraining the egotism of any ruler and of any ruling class that may benecessary, and such a definition of property as will give freedom withoutoppressive power. We begin to realize nowadays that these ends are only to beattained by a complex constructive effort; they arise through the conflict ofnew human needs against ignorance and old human nature; but throughout thenineteenth century there was a persistent disposition to solve the problem bysome simple formula. (And be happy ever afterwards, regardless of the fact thatall human life, all life, is throughout the ages nothing but the continuingsolution of a continuous synthetic problem.)The earlier half of the nineteenth century saw a number of experiments in theformation of trial human societies of a new kind. Among the most importanthistorically were the experiments and ideas of Robert Owen (1771-1858), aManchester cotton-spinner. He is very generally regarded as the founder ofmodern Socialism; it was in connection with his work that the word “socialism”first arose (about 1835).He seems to have been a thoroughly competent business man; he made a number ofinnovations in the cotton-spinning industry, and acquired a fair fortune at anearly age. He was distressed by the waste of human possibilities among hisworkers, and he set himself to improve their condition and the relations ofemployer and employed. This he sought to do first at his Manchester factory andafterwards at New Lanark, where he found himself in practical control of worksemploying about two thousand people. Between 1800 and 1828 he achieved veryconsiderable things: he reduced the hours of labour, made his factory sanitaryand agreeable, abolished the employment of very young children, improved thetraining of his workers, provided unemployment pay during a period of tradedepression, established a system of schools, and made New Lanark a model ofbetter industrialism, while at the same time sustaining its commercialprosperity. He wrote vigorously to defend the mass of mankind against thecharges of intemperance and improvidence which were held to justify the economiciniquities of the time. He held that men and women are largely the product oftheir educational environment, a thesis that needs no advocacy today. And he sethimself to a propaganda of the views that New Lanark had justified. He attackedthe selfish idolence of his fellow manufacturers, and in 1819, largely under hisurgency, the first Factory Act was passed, the first attempt to restrainemployers from taking the most stupid and intolerable advantages of theirworkers’ poverty. Some of the restrictions of that Act amaze us today. It seemsincredible now that it should ever have been necessary to protect littlechildren of nine (!) from work in factories, or to limit the nominal working dayof such employees to twelve hours!People are perhaps too apt to write of the industrial revolution as though itled to the enslavement and overworking of poor children who had hitherto beenhappy and free. But this misinterprets history. From the very beginnings ofcivilization the little children of the poor had always been obliged to dowhatever work they could do. But the factory system gathered up all thisinfantile toil and made it systematic, conspicuous, and scandalous. The factorysystem challenged the quickening human conscience on that issue. The BritishFactory Act of 1819, weak and feeble though it seems to us, was the Magna Cartaof childhood; thereafter the protection of the children of the poor, first fromtoil and then from bodily starvation and ignorance, began.We cannot tell here in any detail the full story of Owen’s life and thought. Hiswork at New Lanark had been, he felt, only a trial upon a small working model.What could be done for one industrial community could be done, he held, forevery industrial community in the country; he advocated a resettlement of theindustrial population in townships on the New Lanark plan. For a time he seemedto have captured the imagination of the world. The Times and Morning Postsupported his proposals; among the visitors to New Lanark was the Grand DukeNicholas who succeeded Alexander I as Tsar; a fast friend was the Duke of Kent,son of George III and father of Queen Victoria. But all the haters of change andall—and there are always many such—who were jealous of the poor, and all theemployers who were likely to be troubled by his projects, were waiting for anexcuse to counter-attack him, and they found it in the expression of hisreligious opinions, which were hostile to official Christianity, and throughthose he was successfully discredited. But he continued to develop his projectsand experiments, of which the chief was a community at New Harmony in Indiana(U.S.A.), in which he sank most of his capital. His partners bought him out ofthe New Lanark business in 1828.Owen’s experiments and suggestions ranged very widely, and do not fall under anysingle formula. There was nothing doctrinaire about him. His New Lanarkexperiment was the first of a number of “benevolent businesses” in the world;Lord Leverhulme’s Port Sunlight, the Cadburys’ Bournville, and the Fordbusinesses in America are contemporary instances; it was not really a socialistexperiment at all; it was a “paternal” experiment. But his proposals for statesettlements were what we should call state socialism today. His Americanexperiment and his later writings point to a completer form of socialism, a muchwider departure from the existing state of affairs. It is clear that the riddleof currency exercised Owen. He understood that we can no more hope for realeconomic justice while we pay for work with money of fluctuating value than wecould hope for a punctual world if there was a continual inconstant variabilityin the length of an hour. One of his experiments was an attempt at a circulationof labour notes representing one hour, five hours, or twenty hours of work. Thecooperative societies of today, societies of poor men which combine for thecollective buying and distribution of commodities or for collective manufactureor dairying or other forms of agriculture, arose directly out of hisinitiatives, though the pioneer cooperative societies of his own time ended infailure. Their successors have spread throughout the whole world, and numbertoday some thirty or forty million of adherents.A point to note about this early socialism of Owen’s is that it was not at firstat all “democratic.” Its initiative was benevolent, its early form patriarchal;it was something up to which the workers were to be educated by liberallydisposed employers and leaders. The first socialism was not a worker’s movement;it was a master’s movement.Concurrently with this work of Owen’s, another and quite independent series ofdevelopments was going on in America and Britain which was destined to come atlast into reaction with his socialistic ideas. The English law had longprohibited combinations in restraint of trade, combinations to raise prices orwages by concerted action. There had been no great hardship in theseprohibitions before the agrarian and industrial changes of the eighteenthcentury let loose a great swarm of workers living from hand to mouth andcompeting for insufficient employment. Under these new conditions, the workersin many industries found themselves intolerably squeezed. They were played offone against another; day by day and hour by hour none knew what concession hisfellow might not have made, and what further reduction of pay or increase oftoil might not ensue. It became vitally necessary for the workers to makeagreements—illegal though they were—against such underselling. At first theseagreements had to be made and sustained by secret societies. Or clubs,established ostensibly for quite other purposes, social clubs, funeralsocieties, and the like, served to mask the wage-protecting combination. Thefact that these associations were illegal disposed them to violence; they weresavage against “blacklegs” and “rats” who would not join them, and still moresavage with traitors. In 1824 the House of Commons recognized the desirabilityof relieving tension in these matters by conceding the right of workmen to formcombinations for “collective bargaining” with the masters. This enabled TradeUnions to develop with a large measure of freedom. At first very clumsy andprimitive organizations and with very restricted freedoms, the Trade Unions haverisen gradually to be a real Fourth Estate in the country, a great system ofbodies representing the mass of industrial workers.Arising at first in Britain and America, they have, with various nationalmodifications, and under varying legal conditions, spread to France, Germany,and all the westernized communities.Organized originally to sustain wages and restrict intolerable hours, the TradeUnion movement was at first something altogether distinct from socialism. TheTrade Unionist tried to make the best for himself of the existing capitalism andthe existing conditions of employment; the socialist proposed to change thesystem. It was the imagination and generalizing power of Karl Marx which broughtthese two movements into relationship. He was a man with the sense of historyvery strong in him; he was the first to perceive that the old social classesthat had endured since the beginning of civilization were in process ofdissolution and regrouping. His racial Jewish commercialism made the antagonismof property and labour very plain to him. And his upbringing in Germany—where,as we have pointed out, the tendency of class to harden into caste was moreevident than in any other European country—made him conceive of labour aspresently becoming “class conscious” and collectively antagonistic to theproperty-concentrating classes. In the Trade Union movement which was spreadingover the world, he believed he saw this development of class-conscious labour.What, he asked, would be the outcome of the “class war” of the capitalist andproletariat? The capitalist adventurers, he alleged, because of their inherentgreed and combativeness, would gather power over capital into fewer and fewerhands, until at last they would concentrate all the means of production,transit, and the like into a form seizable by the workers, whose classconsciousness and solidarity would be developed pari passu by the process oforganizing and concentrating industry. They would seize this capital and work itfor themselves. This would be the social revolution. Then individual propertyand freedom would be restored, based upon the common ownership of the earth andthe management by the community as a whole of the great productive serviceswhich the private capitalist had organized and concentrated. This would be theend of the “capitalist” system, but not the end of the system of capitalism.State capitalism would replace private owner capitalism.This marks a great stride away from the socialism of Owen. Owen (like Plato)looked to the common sense of men of any or every class to reorganize the casualand faulty political, economic, and social structure. Marx found something morein the nature of a driving force in his class hostility based on expropriationand injustice. And he was not simply a prophetic theorist; he was also apropagandist of the revolt of labour, the revolt of the so-called “proletariat.”Labour, he perceived, had a common interest against the capitalist everywhere,though under the test of the Great Power wars of the time, and particularly ofthe liberation of Italy, he showed that he failed to grasp the fact that laboureverywhere has a common interest in the peace of the world. But with the socialrevolution in view he did succeed in inspiring the formation of an internationalleague of workers, the First International.The subsequent history of socialism is chequered between the British traditionof Owen and the German class feeling of Marx. What is called Fabian Socialism,the exposition of socialism by the London Fabian Society, makes its appeal toreasonable men of all classes. What are called “Revisionists” in GermanSocialism incline in the same direction. But on the whole, it is Marx who hascarried the day against Owen, and the general disposition of socialiststhroughout the world is to look to the organization of labour and labour only tosupply the fighting forces that will disentangle the political and economicorganization of human affairs from the hands of the more or less irresponsibleprivate owners and adventurers who now control it.These are the broad features of the project which is called Socialism. We willdiscuss its incompletenesses and inadequacies in our next section. It wasperhaps inevitable that socialism should be greatly distraught and subdivided bydoubts and disputes and sects and schools; they are growth symptoms like thespots on a youth’s face. Here we can but glance at the difference between statesocialism, which would run the economic business of the country through itspolitical government, and the newer schools of syndicalism and guild socialismwhich would entrust a large measure in the government of each industry to theworkers of every grade—including the directors and managers—engaged in thatindustry. This “guild socialism” is really a new sort of capitalism with acommittee of workers and officials in each industry taking the place of the freeprivate capitalists of that industry. The personnel becomes the collectivecapitalist. Nor can we discuss the undemocratic idea of the Russian leaderLenin, that a population cannot judge of socialism before it has experienced it,and that a group of socialists are therefore justified in seizing andsocializing, if they can, the life of a country without at first setting up anydemocratic form of general government at all, for which sort of seizure he usesthe Marxian phrase, a very incompetent phrase, the “dictatorship of theproletariat.”All Russia now is a huge experiment in that dictatorship. The “proletariat” issupposed to be dictating the government of Russia through committees of workmenand soldiers, the Soviets, but as a matter of fact these Soviets have little orno real directive power. They assemble in meetings so big as to be practicallymass meetings, and the utmost they can do is to give a general assent to theproceedings of the government. The Petersburg Soviet, which the writer visitedin September, 1920, was a mass meeting of over three thousand people, incapableof any detailed criticism or direction of the Bolshevik government.6[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en89]§ 5We are all socialists nowadays, said Sir William Harcourt years ago, and that isloosely true today. There can be few people who fail to realize the provisionalnature and the dangerous instability of our present political and economicsystem, and still fewer who believe with the doctrinaire individualists thatprofit-hunting “go as you please” will guide mankind to any haven of prosperityand happiness. Great rearrangements are necessary, and a systematic legalsubordination of personal self-seeking to the public good. So far mostreasonable men are socialists. But these are only preliminary propositions. Howfar has socialism and modern thought generally gone towards working out theconception of this new political and social order, of which our world admittedlystands in need? We are obliged to answer that there is no clear conception ofthe new state towards which we vaguely struggle, that our science of humanrelationships is still so crude and speculative as to leave us without definiteguidance upon a score of primarily important issues. In 1920 we are no more in aposition to set up a scientifically conceived political system in the world thanwere men to set up an electric power station in 1820. They could not have donethat then to save their lives.The Marxist system points us to an accumulation of revolutionary forces in themodern world. These forces will continually tend towards revolution. But Marxassumed too hastily that a revolutionary impulse would necessarily produce anordered state of a new and better kind. A revolution may stop half-way in meredestruction. No socialist sect has yet defined its projected government clearly;the Bolsheviks in their Russian experiment seem to have been guided by a phrase,the dictatorship of the proletariat, and in practice, we are told, Trotsky andLenin have proved as autocratic as the less intelligent but equally well-meaningTsar, Alexander I. We have been at some pains to show from our brief study ofthe French revolution that a revolution can establish nothing permanent that hasnot already been thought out beforehand and apprehended by the general mind. TheFrench republic, confronted with unexpected difficulties in economics, currency,and international relationships, collapsed to the egotisms of the newly richpeople of the Directory, and finally to the egotism of Napoleon. Law and a plan,steadily upheld, are more necessary in revolutionary times than in ordinaryhumdrum times, because in revolutionary times society degenerates much morereadily into a mere scramble under the ascendancy of the forcible and cunning.If in general terms we take stock of the political and social science of ourage, we shall measure something of the preliminary intellectual task still to bedone by mankind before we can hope to see any permanent constructiveachievements emerging from the mere traditionalism and adventuring that rule ourcollective affairs today. This Socialism, which professes to be a completetheory of a new social order, we discover, when we look into it, to be no morethan a partial theory—very illuminating, so far as it goes—about property. Wehave already discussed the relationship of social development to the restrictionof the idea of property. There are various schools of thought which wouldrestrict property more or less completely. Communism is the proposal to abolishproperty altogether, or, in other words, to hold all things in common. ModernSocialism, on the other hand—or, to give it a more precise name,“Collectivism”—does clearly distinguish between personal property and collectiveproperty. The gist of the socialist proposal is that land and all the naturalmeans of production, transit, and distribution should be collectively owned.Within these limits there is to be much free private ownership and unrestrictedpersonal freedom. Given efficient administration, it may be doubted whether manypeople nowadays would dispute that proposal. But socialism has never gone on toa thorough examination of that proviso for efficient administration.Again, what community is it that is to own the collective property; is it to bethe sovereign or the township or the county or the nation or mankind? Socialismmakes no clear answer. Socialists are very free with the word “nationalize,” butwe have been subjecting the ideas of “nations” and “nationalism” to somedestructive criticism in this Outline. If socialists object to a singleindividual claiming a mine or a great stretch of agricultural land as his ownindividual property, with a right to refuse or barter its use and profit toothers, why should they permit a single nation to monopolize the mines or traderoutes or natural wealth of the territories in which it lives, against the restof mankind? There seems to be great confusion in socialist theory in thismatter. And unless human life is to become a mass meeting of the race inpermanent session, how is the community to appoint its officers to carry on itscollective concerns? After all, the private owner of land or of a business orthe like is a sort of public official in so far as his ownership is sanctionedand protected by the community. Instead of being paid a salary or fees, he isallowed to make a profit. The only valid reason for dismissing him from hisownership is that the new control to be substituted will be more efficient andprofitable and satisfactory to the community. And, being dismissed, he has atleast the same claim to consideration from the community that he himself hasshown in the past to the worker thrown out of employment by a mechanicalinvention.This question of administration, the sound and adequate bar to much immediatesocialization, brings us to the still largely unsolved problem of humanassociation; how are we to secure the best direction of human affairs and themaximum of willing cooperation with that direction? This is ultimately a complexproblem in psychology, but it is absurd to pretend that it is an insoluble one.There must be a definite best, which is the right thing, in these matters. Butif it is not insoluble, it is equally unreasonable to pretend that it has beensolved. The problem in its completeness involves the working out of the bestmethods in the following departments, and their complete correlation:—(i) Education.—The preparation of the individual for an understanding andwilling cooperation in the world’s affairs.(ii) Information.—The continual truthful presentation of public affairs to theindividual for his judgment and approval. Closely connected with this need forcurrent information is the codification of the law, the problem of keeping thelaw plain, clear, and accessible to all.(iii) Representation.—The selection of representatives and agents to act in thecollective interest, in harmony with the general will based on this educationand plain information.(iv) The Executive.—The appointment of executive agents and the maintenance ofmeans for keeping them responsible to the community, without at the same timehampering intelligent initiatives.(v) Thought and Research.—The systematic criticism of affairs and laws toprovide data for popular judgments, and through those judgments to ensure thesecular improvement of the human organization.These are the five heads under which the broad problem of human society presentsitself to us. In the world around us we see makeshift devices at work in allthose branches, ill coordinated one with another and unsatisfactory inthemselves. We see an educational system meanly financed and equipped, badlyorganized and crippled by the interventions and hostilities of religious bodies;we see popular information supplied chiefly by a venal press dependant uponadvertisements and subsidies; we see farcical methods of election returningpoliticians to power as unrepresentative as any hereditary ruler or casualconqueror; everywhere the executive is more or less influenced or controlled bygroups of rich adventurers, and the pursuit of political and social science andof public criticism is still the work of devoted and eccentric individualsrather than a recognized and honoured function in the state. There is a gigantictask before right-thinking men in the cleansing and sweetening of thepolitician’s stable; and until it is done, any complete realization of socialismis impossible. While private adventurers control the political life of thestate, it is ridiculous to think of the state taking over collective economicinterests from private adventurers.Not only has the socialist movement failed thus far to produce a scientificallyreasoned scheme for the correlation of education, law, and the exercise ofpublic power, but even in the economic field, as we have already pointed out,creative forces wait for the conception of a right organization of credit and aright method of payment and interchange. It is a truism that the willingness ofthe worker depends, among other things, upon his complete confidence in thepurchasing power of the currency in which he is paid. As this confidence goes,work ceases, except in so far as it can be rewarded by payment in goods. Butthere is no sufficient science of currency and business psychology to restraingovernments from the most disturbing interferences with the public credit andwith the circulation. And such interferences lead straight to the cessation ofwork, that is, of the production of necessary things. Upon such vital practicalquestions it is scarcely too much to say that the mass of those socialists whowould recast the world have no definite ideas at all. Yet in a socialist worldquite as much as in any other sort of world, people must be paid money for theirwork rather than be paid in kind if any such thing as personal freedom is tocontinue. Here, too, there must be an ascertainable right thing to do. Untilthat is determined, history in these matters will continue to be not so much arecord of experiments as of flounderings.And in another direction the social and political thinking of the nineteenthcentury was, in the face of the vastness of the mechanical revolution, timid,limited, and insufficient, and that was in regard to international relations.The reader of socialistic literature will find the socialists constantly writingand talking of the “State,” and never betraying any realization that the “State”might be all sorts of organizations in all sorts of areas, from the republic ofSan Marino to the British Empire. It is true that Karl Marx had a conception ofa solidarity of interests between the workers in all the industrializedcountries, but there is little or no suggestion in Marxist socialism of thelogical corollary of this, the establishment of a democratic world federalgovernment (with national or provincial “state” governments) as a naturalconsequence of his projected social revolution. At most there is a vagueaspiration. But if there is any logic about the Marxist, it should be hisdeclared political end for which he should work without ceasing. Put to the testof the war of 1914, the socialists of almost all the European countries showedthat their class-conscious internationalism was veneered very thinly indeed overtheir patriotic feelings, and had to no degree replaced them. Everywhere duringthe German war socialists denounced that war as made by capitalist governments,but it produces little or no permanent effect to denounce a government or aworld system unless you have a working idea of a better government and a bettersystem to replace it.We state these things here because they are facts, and a living and necessarypart of a contemporary survey of human history. It is not our task either toadvocate or controvert socialism. But it is in our picture to note thatpolitical and social life are, and must remain, chaotic and disastrous withoutthe development of some such constructive scheme as socialism sketches, and topoint out clearly how far away the world is at present from any such scheme. Anenormous amount of intellectual toil and discussion and education and manyyears—whether decades or centuries, no man can tell—must intervene before a neworder, planned as ships and railways are planned, runs, as the cables and thepostal deliveries run, over the whole surface of our earth. And until such a neworder draws mankind together with its net, human life, as we shall presentlyshow by the story of the European wars since 1854, must become more and morecasual, dangerous, miserable, anxious, and disastrous because of the continuallymore powerful and destructive war methods the continuing mechanical revolutionproduces.§ 67 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en90]While the mechanical revolution which the growth of physical science had broughtabout was destroying the ancient social classification of the civilized statewhich had been evolved through thousands of years, and producing newpossibilities and new ideals of a righteous human community and a righteousworld order, a change at least as great and novel was going on in the field ofreligious thought. That same growth of scientific knowledge from which sprangthe mechanical revolution was the moving cause of these religious disturbances.In the opening chapters of this Outline we have given the main story of theRecord of the Rocks; we have shown life for the little beginning ofconsciousness that it is in the still waiting vastness of the void of space andtime. But before the end of the eighteenth century, this enormous prospect ofthe past which fills a modern mind with humility and illimitable hope was hiddenfrom the general consciousness of our race. It was veiled by the curtain of aSumerian legend. The heavens were no more than a stage background to a littledrama of kings. Men had been too occupied with their own private passions andpersonal affairs to heed the intimations of their own great destiny that layabout them everywhere.They learnt their true position in space long before they placed themselves intime. We have already named the earlier astronomers, and told how Galileo wasmade to recant his assertion that the earth moved round the sun. He was made todo so by the church, and the church was stirred to make him do so because anydoubt that the world was the centre of the universe seemed to strike fatally atthe authority of Christianity.Now, upon that matter the teller of modern history is obliged to be at oncecautious and bold. He has to pick his way between cowardly evasion on the onehand, and partisanship on the other. As far as possible he must confine himselfto facts and restrain his opinions. Yet it is well to remember that no opinionscan be altogether restrained. The writer has his own very strong and definitepersuasions, and the reader must bear that in mind. It is a fact in history thatthe teaching of Jesus of Nazareth had in it something profoundly new andcreative; he preached a new Kingdom of Heaven in the hearts and in the world ofmen. There was nothing in his teaching, so far as we can judge it at thisdistance of time, to clash or interfere with any discovery or expansion of thehistory of the world and mankind. But it is equally a fact in history that St.Paul and his successors added to or completed or imposed upon or substitutedanother doctrine for—as you may prefer to think—the plain and profoundlyrevolutionary teachings of Jesus by expounding a subtle and complex theory ofsalvation, a salvation which could be attained very largely by belief andformalities, without any serious disturbance of the believer’s ordinary habitsand occupations, and that this Pauline teaching did involve very definitebeliefs about the history of the world and man. It is not the business of thehistorian to controvert or explain these matters; the question of their ultimatesignificance depends upon the theologian; the historian’s concern is merely withthe fact that official Christianity throughout the world adopted St. Paul’s viewso plainly expressed in his epistles and so untraceable in the gospels, that themeaning of religion lay not in the future, but in the past, and that Jesus wasnot so much a teacher of wonderful new things, as a predestinate divine bloodsacrifice of deep mystery and sacredness made in atonement of a particularhistorical act of disobedience to the Creator committed by our first parents,Adam and Eve, in response to the temptation of a serpent in the Garden of Eden.Upon the belief in that Fall as a fact, and not upon the personality of Jesus ofNazareth, upon the theories of Paul, and not upon the injunctions of Jesus,doctrinal Christianity built itself.We have already noted that this story of the special creation of the world andof Adam and Eve and the serpent was also an ancient Babylonian story, andprobably a still more ancient Sumerian story, and that the Jewish sacred bookswere the medium by which this very ancient and primitive “heliolithic” serpentlegend entered Christianity. Wherever official Christianity has gone, it hastaken this story with it. It has tied itself up to that story. Until a centuryand less ago the whole Christianized world felt bound to believe and didbelieve, that the universe had been specially created in the course of six daysby the word of God a few thousand years before—according to Bishop Ussher, 4004B.C. (The Universal History, in forty-two volumes, published in 1779 by a groupof London booksellers, discusses whether the precise date of the first day ofCreation was March 21st or September 21st, 4004 B.C., and inclines to the viewthat the latter was the more probable season.)Upon this historical assumption rested the religious fabric of the Western andWesternized civilization, and yet the whole world was littered, the hills,mountains, deltas, and seas were bursting with evidence of its utter absurdity.The religious life of the leading nations, still a very intense and sincerereligious life, was going on in a house of history built upon sand.There is frequent recognition in classical literature of a sounder cosmogony.Aristotle was aware of the broad principles of modern geology, they shinethrough the speculations of Lucretius, and we have noted also Leonardo daVinci’s (1452-1519) lucid interpretation of fossils. A Frenchman, Descartes(1596-1650), speculated boldly upon the incandescent beginnings of our globe,and a Dane, Steno (1631-87), began the collection of fossils and the descriptionof strata. But it was only as the eighteenth century drew to its close that thesystematic study of geology assumed such proportions as to affect the generalauthority of the Bible version of that ancient Sumerian narrative.Contemporaneously with the Universal History quoted above, a great Frenchnaturalist, Buffon, was writing upon the Epochs of Nature (1778), and boldlyextending the age of the world to 70,000 or 75,000 years. He divided his storyinto six epochs to square with the six days of the Creation story. These days,it was argued, were figurative days; they were really ages. There was a generaldisposition to do this on the part of the new science of geology. By thataccommodating device, geology contrived to make a peace with orthodox religiousteaching that lasted until the middle of the nineteenth century.We cannot trace here the contributions of such men as Hutton and Playfair andSir Charles Lyell, and the Frenchmen Lamarck and Cuvier, in unfolding anddeveloping the record of the rocks. It was only slowly that the generalintelligence of the Western world was awakened to two disconcerting facts:firstly, that the succession of life in the geological record did not correspondto the acts of the six days of creation; and, secondly, that the record, inharmony with a mass of biological facts, pointed away from the Bible assertionof a separate creation of each species straight towards a genetic relationbetween all forms of life, in which even man was included! The importance ofthis last issue to the existing doctrinal system was manifest. If all theanimals and man had been evolved in this ascendant manner, then there had beenno first parents, no Eden, and no Fall. And if there had been no fall, then theentire historical fabric of Christianity, the story of the first sin and thereason for an atonement, upon which the current teaching based Christian emotionand morality, collapsed like a house of cards.It was with something like horror, therefore, that great numbers of honest andreligious-spirited men followed the work of the English naturalist, CharlesDarwin (1809-82); in 1859 he published his Origin of Species by Means of NaturalSelection, a powerful and permanently valuable exposition of that conception ofthe change and development of species which we have sketched briefly in ChapterIII; and in 1871 he completed the outline of his work with the Descent of Man,which brought man definitely into the same scheme of development with the restof life.Many men and women are still living who can remember the dismay and distressamong ordinary intelligent people in the Western communities as the invinciblecase of the biologists and geologists against the orthodox Christian cosmogonyunfolded itself. The minds of many resisted the new knowledge instinctively andirrationally. Their whole moral edifice was built upon false history; they weretoo old and set to rebuild it; they felt the practical truth of their moralconvictions, and this new truth seemed to them to be incompatible with that.They believed that to assent to it would be to prepare a moral collapse for theworld. And so they produced a moral collapse by not assenting to it. Theuniversities in England particularly, being primarily clerical in theirconstitution, resisted the new learning very bitterly. During the seventies andeighties a stormy controversy raged throughout the civilized world. The qualityof the discussions and the fatal ignorance of the church may be gauged by adescription in Hackett’s Commonplace Book of a meeting of the BritishAssociation in 1860, at which Bishop Wilberforce assailed Huxley, the greatchampion of the Darwinian views, in this fashion.Facing “Huxley with a smiling insolence, he begged to know, was it through hisgrandfather or grandmother that he claimed his descent from a monkey? Huxleyturned to his neighbour, and said, ‘The Lord hath delivered him into my hands.’Then he stood before us and spoke these tremendous words, ‘He was not ashamed tohave a monkey for his ancestor; but he would be ashamed to be connected with aman who used great gifts to obscure the truth.’” (Another version has it: “Ihave certainly said that a man has no reason to be ashamed of having an ape forhis grandfather. If there were an ancestor whom I should feel ashamed inrecalling, it would rather be a man of restless and versatile intellect whoplunges into scientific questions with which he has no real acquaintance, onlyto obscure them by an aimless rhetoric and distract the attention of hisaudience from the real point at issue by eloquent digressions and skilledappeals to prejudice.”) These words were certainly spoken with passion. Thescene was one of great excitement. A lady fainted, says Hackett. . . . Such wasthe temper of this controversy.The Darwinian movement took formal Christianity unawares, suddenly. FormalChristianity was confronted with a clearly demonstrable error in her theologicalstatements. The Christian theologians were neither wise enough nor mentallynimble enough to accept the new truth, modify their formulæ, and insist upon theliving and undiminished vitality of the religious reality those formulæ hadhitherto sufficed to express. For the discovery of man’s descent from sub-humanforms does not even remotely touch the teaching of the Kingdom of Heaven. Yetpriests and bishops raged at Darwin; foolish attempts were made to suppressDarwinian literature and to insult and discredit the exponents of the new views.There was much wild talk of the “antagonism” of religion and science. Now in allages there have been sceptics in Christendom. The Emperor Frederick II wascertainly a sceptic; in the eighteenth century Gibbon and Voltaire were openlyanti-Christian, and their writings influenced a number of scattered readers. Butthese were exceptional people. . . . Now the whole of Christendom became as awhole sceptical. This new controversy touched everybody who read a book or heardintelligent conversation. A new generation of young people grew up, and theyfound the defenders of Christianity in an evil temper, fighting their causewithout dignity or fairness. It was the orthodox theology that the newscientific advances had compromised, but the angry theologians declared that itwas religion.In the end men may discover that religion shines all the brighter for the lossof its doctrinal wrappings, but to the young it seemed as if indeed there hadbeen a conflict of science and religion, and that in that conflict science hadwon.The immediate effect of this great dispute upon the ideas and methods of peoplein the prosperous and influential classes throughout the westernized world wasvery detrimental indeed. The new biological science was bringing nothingconstructive as yet to replace the old moral stand-bys. A real demoralizationensued. The general level of social life in those classes was far higher in theearly twentieth than in the early seventeenth century, but in one respect, inrespect to disinterestedness and conscientiousness in these classes, it isprobable that the tone of the earlier age was better than the latter. In theowning and active classes of the seventeenth century, in spite of a few definite“infidels,” there was probably a much higher percentage of men and women whoprayed sincerely, who searched their souls to find if they had done evil, andwho were prepared to suffer and make great sacrifices for what they conceived tohe right, than in the opening years of the twentieth century. There was a realloss of faith after 1859. The true gold of religion was in many cases thrownaway with the worn-out purse that had contained it for so long, and it was notrecovered. Towards the close of the nineteenth century a crude misunderstandingof Darwinism had become the fundamental mindstuff of great masses of the“educated” everywhere. The seventeenth-century kings and owners and rulers andleaders had had the idea at the back of their minds that they prevailed by thewill of God; they really feared him, they got priests to put things right forthem with him; when they were wicked, they tried not to think of him. But theold faith of the kings, owners, and rulers of the opening twentieth century hadfaded under the actinic light of scientific criticism. Prevalent peoples at theclose of the nineteenth century believed that they prevailed by virtue of theStruggle for Existence, in which the strong and cunning get the better of theweak and confiding. And they believed further that they had to be strong,energetic, ruthless, “practical,” egotistical, because God was dead, and hadalways, it seemed, been dead—which was going altogether further than the newknowledge justified.They soon got beyond the first crude popular misconception of Darwinism, theidea that every man is for himself alone. But they stuck at the next level. Man,they decided, is a social animal like the Indian hunting dog. He is much morethan a dog—but this they did not see. And just as in a pack it is necessary tobully and subdue the younger and weaker for the general good, so it seemed rightto them that the big dogs of the human pack should bully and subdue. Hence a newscorn for the ideas of democracy that had ruled the earlier nineteenth century,and a revived admiration for the overbearing and the cruel. It was quitecharacteristic of the times that Mr. Kipling should lead the children of themiddle and upper-class British public back to the Jungle, to learn “the law,”and that in his book Stalky and Co. he should give an appreciative descriptionof the torture of two boys by three others, who have by a subterfuge tied uptheir victims helplessly before revealing their hostile intentions.It is worth while to give a little attention to this incident in Stalky and Co.,because it lights up the political psychology of the British Empire at the closeof the nineteenth century very vividly. The history of the last half century isnot to be understood without an understanding of the mental twist which thisstory exemplifies. The two boys who are tortured are “bullies,” that is theexcuse of their tormentors, and these latter have further been incited to theorgy by a clergyman. Nothing can restrain the gusto with which they (and Mr.Kipling) set about the job. Before resorting to torture, the teaching seems tobe, see that you pump up a little justifiable moral indignation, and all will bewell. If you have the authorities on your side, then you cannot be to blame.Such, apparently, is the simple doctrine of this typical imperialist. But everybully has to the best of his ability followed that doctrine since the humananimal developed sufficient intelligence to be consciously cruel.Another point in the story is very significant indeed. The head master and hisclerical assistant are both represented as being privy to the affair. They wantthis bullying to occur. Instead of exercising their own authority, they usethese boys, who are Mr. Kipling’s heroes, to punish the two victims. Head masterand clergyman turn a deaf ear to the complaints of an indignant mother. All thisMr. Kipling represents as a most desirable state of affairs. In this we have thekey to the ugliest, most retrogressive, and finally fatal idea of modernimperialism; the idea of a tacit conspiracy between the law and illegalviolence. Just as the Tsardom wrecked itself at last by a furtive encouragementof the ruffians of the Black Hundreds, who massacred Jews and other peoplesupposed to be inimical to the Tsar, so the good name of the British ImperialGovernment has been tainted—and is still tainted—by an illegal raid made byDoctor Jameson into the Transvaal before the Boer War, by the adventures whichwe shall presently describe, of Sir Edward Carson and Mr. F. E. Smith (now LordBirkenhead), in Ireland and by the tacit connivance of the British government inIreland with the “reprisals” undertaken by the loyalists against theperpetrators of Sinn Fein outrages. By such treasons against their subjects,empires destroy themselves. The true strength of rulers and empires lies not inarmies and navies, but in the belief of men that they are inflexibly open andtruthful and legal. So soon as a government departs from that standard, itceases to be anything more than “the gang in possession,” and its days arenumbered.§ 7We have already pointed out that there must be a natural political map of theworld which gives the best possible geographical divisions for humanadministrations. Any other political division of the world than this naturalpolitical map will necessarily be a misfit, and must produce stresses ofhostility and insurrection tending to shift boundaries in the directionindicated by the natural political map. These would seem to be self-evidentpropositions were it not that the diplomatists at Vienna evidently neitherbelieved nor understood anything of the sort, and thought themselves as free tocarve up the world as one is free to carve up such a boneless structure as acheese. Nor were these propositions evident to Mr. Gladstone. Most of theupheavals and conflicts that began in Europe as the world recovered from theexhaustion of the Napoleonic wars were quite obviously attempts of the ordinarycommon men to get rid of governments that were such misfits as to be in manycases intolerable. Generally the existing governments were misfits throughoutEurope because they were not socially representative, and so they were hamperingproduction and wasting human possibilities; but when there were added to theseuniversal annoyances differences of religion and racial culture between rulersand ruled (as in most of Ireland), differences in race and language (as inAustrian North Italy and throughout most of the Austrian Empire), or differencesin all these respects (as in Poland and the Turkish Empire in Europe), theexasperation drove towards bloodshed. Europe was a system of governing machinesabominably adjusted. From the stresses of this maladjustment the various“nationalist” movements that played so large a part in the history of thenineteenth century drew their driving force.What is a nation? What is nationality? If our story of the world hasdemonstrated anything, it has demonstrated the mingling of races and peoples,the instability of human divisions, the swirling variety of human groups andhuman ideas of association. A nation, it has been said, is an accumulation ofhuman beings who think they are one people; but we are told that Ireland is anation, and Protestant Ulster certainly does not share that idea; and Italy didnot think it was one people until long after its unity was accomplished. Whenthe writer was in Italy in 1916, people were saying: “This war will make us onenation.” Again, are the English a nation on have they merged into a “Britishnationality”? Scotchmen do not seem to believe very much in this Britishnationality. It cannot be a community of race or language that constitutes anation, because the Gaels and the Lowlanders make up the Scotch “nation”; itcannot be a common religion, for England has scores; nor a common literature, orwhy is Britain separated from the United States, and the Argentine Republic fromSpain? We may suggest that a nation is in effect any assembly, mixture, orconfusion of people which is either afflicted by or wishes to be afflicted by aforeign office of its own, in order that it should behave collectively as if italone constituted humanity. We have already traced the development of theMachiavellian monarchies into the rule of their foreign offices, playing thepart of “Powers.” The “nationality” which dominated the political thought of thenineteenth century is really no more than the romantic and emotionalexaggeration of the stresses produced by the discord of the natural politicalmap with unsuitable political arrangements.Throughout the nineteenth century, and particularly throughout its latter half,there has been a great working up of this nationalism in the world. All men areby nature partisans and patriots, but the natural tribalism of men in thenineteenth century was unnaturally exaggerated, it was fretted andover-stimulated and inflamed and forced into the nationalist mould. Nationalismwas taught in schools, emphasized by newspapers, preached and mocked and sunginto men. Men were brought to feel that they were as improper without anationality as without their clothes in a crowded assembly. Oriental peoples whohad never heard of nationality before, took to it as they took to the cigarettesand bowler hats of the west. India, a galaxy of contrasted races, religions, andcultures, Dravidian, Mongolian, and Aryan, became a “nation.” There wereperplexing cases, of course, as when a young Whitechapel Jew had to decidewhether he belonged to the British or the Jewish nation. Caricature andpolitical cartoons played a large part in this elevation of the cult of thesenewer and bigger tribal gods —for such indeed the modern, “nations” are—to theirascendancy over the imagination of the nineteenth century. If one turns over thepages of Punch, that queer contemporary record of the British soul, which haslasted now since 1841, one finds the figures of Britannia, Hibernia, France, andGermania embracing, disputing, reproving, rejoicing, grieving. It greatly helpedthe diplomatists to carry on their game of Great Powers to convey politics inthis form to the doubting general intelligence. To the common man, resentfulthat his son should be sent abroad to be shot, it was made clear that instead ofthis being merely the result of the obstinacy and greed of two foreign offices,it was really a necessary part of a righteous inevitable gigantic strugglebetween two of these dim vast divinities. France had been wronged by Germania,or Italia was showing a proper spirit to Austria. The boy’s death ceased toappear an outrage on common sense; it assumed a sort of mythological dignity.And insurrection could clothe itself in the same romantic habiliments asdiplomacy. Ireland became a Cinderella goddess, Cathleen ni Houlihan, full ofheartrending and unforgivable wrongs; young India transcended its realities inthe worship of Bande Mataram.063 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_063_r1.gif]The essential idea of nineteenth-century nationalism was the “legitimate claim”of every nation to complete sovereignty, the claim of every nation to manage allits affairs within its own territory, regardless of any other nation. The flawin this idea is that the affairs and interests of every modern community extendto the uttermost parts of the earth. The assassination of Sarajevo in 1914, forexample, which caused the great war, produced the utmost distress among theIndian tribes of Labrador because that war interrupted the marketing of the fursupon which they relied for such necessities as ammunition, without which theycould not get sufficient food. A world of independent sovereign nations means,therefore, a world of perpetual injuries, a world of states constantly preparingfor or waging war. But concurrently and discordantly with the preaching of thisnationalism there was, among the stronger nationalities, a vigorous propagationof another set of ideas, the ideas of imperialism, in which a powerful andadvanced nation was conceded the right to dominate a group of other lessadvanced nations or less politically developed nations or peoples whosenationality was still undeveloped, who were expected by the dominating nation tobe grateful for its protection and dominance. This use of the word empire wasevidently a different one from its former universal significance. The newempires did not even pretend to be a continuation of the world empire of Rome.These two ideas of nationality and, as the crown of national success, “empire,”ruled European political thought, ruled indeed the political thought of theworld, throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century, and ruled it to thepractical exclusion of any wider conception of a common human welfare. They wereplausible and dangerously unsound working ideas. They represented nothingfundamental and inalterable in human nature, and they failed to meet the newneeds of world controls and world security that the mechanical revolution wasevery day making more imperative. They were accepted because people in generalhad neither the sweeping views that a study of world history can give, nor hadthey any longer the comprehensive charity of a world religion. Their danger toall the routines of ordinary life was not realized until it was too late.§ 8After the middle of the nineteenth century, this world of new powers and oldideas, this fermenting new wine in the old bottles of diplomacy, broke outthrough the flimsy restraints of the Treaty of Vienna into a series of wars. Byan ironical accident the new system of disturbances was preceded by a peacefestival in London, the Great Exhibition of 1851.The moving spirit in this exhibition was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, thenephew of Leopold I, the German king who had been placed upon the Belgian thronein 1831, and who was also the maternal uncle of the young Queen Victoria ofEngland. She had become queen in 1837 at the age of eighteen. The two youngcousins—they were of the same age—had married in 1840 under their uncle’sauspices, and Prince Albert was known to the British as the “Prince Consort.” Hewas a young man of sound intelligence and exceptional education, and he seems tohave been greatly shocked by the mental stagnation into which England hadsunken. Oxford and Cambridge, those once starry centres, were still recoveringbut slowly from the intellectual ebb of the later eighteenth century. At neitheruniversity did the annual matriculations number more than four hundred. Theexaminations were for the most part mere viva voce ceremonies. Except for twocolleges in London (the University of London) and one in Durham, this was allthe education on a university footing that England had to offer. It was verylargely the initiative of this scandalized young German who had married theBritish queen which produced the university commission of 1850, and it was witha view to waking up England further that he promoted the first InternationalExhibition which was to afford some opportunity for a comparison of the artisticand industrial products of the various European nations.The project was bitterly opposed. In the House of Commons it was prophesied thatEngland would be overrun by foreign rogues and revolutionaries who would corruptthe morals of the people and destroy all faith and loyalty in the country.The exhibition was held in Hyde Park in a great building of glass and iron—whichafterwards was re-erected as the Crystal Palace. Financially it was a greatsuccess. It made many English people realize for the first time that theirs wasnot the only industrial country in the world, and that commercial prosperity wasnot a divinely appointed British monopoly. There was the clearest evidence of aEurope recovering steadily from the devastation of the Napoleonic wars, andrapidly overtaking the British lead in trade and manufacture. It was followeddirectly by the organization of a Science and Art Department (1853), to recover,if possible, the educational leeway that Britain had lost.The exhibition released a considerable amount of international talk andsentiment. It had already found expression in the work of such young poets asTennyson, who had glanced down the vista of the future.“Till the war-drums throb’d no longer, and the battle-flags were furl’d.In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.”There was much shallow optimism on the part of comfortable people just then.Peace seemed to be more secure than it had been for a long time. The socialgales of 1848 had blown, and, it seemed, blown themselves out. Nowhere had therevolution succeeded. In France it had been betrayed a second time by aBonaparte, a nephew of the first Napoleon, but a much more supple man. He hadposed as a revolutionary while availing himself of the glamour of his name; hehad twice attempted raids on France during the Orleans monarchy. He had writtena manual of artillery to link himself to his uncle’s prestige, and he had alsopublished an account of what he alleged to be Napoleonic views, Des IdéesNapoleoniennes in which he jumbled up socialism, socialistic reform, andpacificism with the Napoleonic legend. The republic of 1848 was soon indifficulties with crude labour experiments, and in October he was able tore-enter the country and stand for election as President. He took an oath asPresident to be faithful to the democratic republic, and to regard as enemiesall who attempted to change the form of government. In two years’ time(December, 1852) he was Emperor of the French.At first he was regarded with considerable suspicion by Queen Victoria, orrather by Baron Stockmar, the friend and servant of King Leopold of Belgium, andthe keeper of the international conscience of the British queen and her consort.All this group of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha people had a reasonable and generousenthusiasm for the unity and well-being of Germany—upon liberal lines—and theywere disposed to be alarmed at this Bonapartist revival. Lord Palmerston, theBritish foreign minister, was, on the other hand, friendly with the usurper fromthe outset; he offended the queen by sending amiable dispatches to the FrenchPresident without submitting them for her examination and so giving hersufficient time to consult Stockmar upon them, and he was obliged to resign. Butsubsequently the British Court veered round to a more cordial attitude to thenew adventurer. The opening years of his reign promised a liberal monarchyrather than a Napoleonic career; a government of “cheap bread, great publicworks, and holidays,”8 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en91] and heexpressed himself warmly in favour of the idea of nationalism, which wasnaturally a very acceptable idea to any liberal German intelligence. There hadbeen a brief all-German parliament at Frankfort in 1848, which was overthrown in1849 by the Prussian monarchy.Before 1848 all the great European courts of the Vienna settlement had been keptin a kind of alliance by the fear of a second and more universal democraticrevolution. After the revolutionary failures of 1848 this fear was lifted, andthey were free to resume the scheming and counter-scheming of the days before1789—with the vastly more powerful armies and fleets the first Napoleonic phasehad given them. The game of Great Powers was resumed with zest, after aninterval of sixty years, and it continued until it produced the catastrophe of1914.064 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_064_r1.gif]The Tsar of Russia, Nicholas I, was the first to move towards war. He resumedthe traditional thrust of Peter the Great towards Constantinople. Nicholasinvented the phrase of the “sick man of Europe” for the Sultan, and, finding anexcuse in the misgovernment of the Christian population of the Turkish empire,he occupied the Danubian principalities in 1853. European diplomatists foundthemselves with a question of quite the eighteenth-century pattern. The designsof Russia were understood to clash with the designs of France in Syria, and tothreaten the Mediterranean route to India of Great Britain, and the outcome wasan alliance of France and England to bolster up Turkey and a war, the CrimeanWar, which ended in the repulse of Russia. One might have thought that therestraint of Russia was rather the business of Austria and Germany, but thepassion of the foreign offices of France and England for burning their fingersin Russian affairs has always been very difficult to control.065 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_065_r1.gif]The next phase of interest in this revival of the Great Power drama was theexploitation by the Emperor Napoleon III and the king of the small kingdom ofSardinia in North Italy, of the inconveniences and miseries of the divided stateof Italy, and particularly of the Austrian rule in the north. The King ofSardinia, Victor Emmanuel, made an old-time bargain for Napoleon’s help inreturn for the provinces of Nice and Savoy. The war between France and Sardiniaon the one hand, and Austria on the other, broke out in 1859, and was over in afew weeks. The Austrians were badly beaten at Magenta and Solferino. Then, beingthreatened by Prussia on the Rhine, Napoleon made peace, leaving Sardinia thericher for Lombardy.The next move in the game of Victor Emmanuel, and of his chief minister Cavour,was an insurrectionary movement in Sicily led by the great Italian patriotGaribaldi. Sicily and Naples were liberated, and all Italy, except only Rome(which remained loyal to the Pope) and Venetia, which was held by the Austrians,fell to the king of Sardinia. A general Italian parliament met at Turin in 1861,and Victor Emmanuel became the first king of Italy.But now the interest in this game of European diplomacy shifted to Germany.Already the common sense of the natural political map had asserted itself. In1848 all Germany, including, of course, German Austria, was for a time unitedunder the Frankfort parliament. But that sort of union was particularlyoffensive to all the German courts and foreign offices; they did not want aGermany united by the will of its people, they wanted Germany united by legaland diplomatic action—as Italy was being united. In 1848 the German parliamenthad insisted that the largely German provinces of Schleswig-Holstein, which hadbeen in the German Bund, must belong to Germany. It had ordered the Prussianarmy to occupy them, and the king of Prussia had refused to take his orders fromthe German parliament, and so had precipitated the downfall of that body. Nowthe King of Denmark, Christian IX, for no conceivable motive except the naturalfolly of kings, embarked upon a campaign of annoyance against the Germans inthese two duchies. Prussian affairs were then very much in the hands of aminister of the seventeenth-century type, von Bismarck (count in 1865, prince in1871), and he saw brilliant opportunities in this trouble. He became thechampion of the German nationality in these duchies—it must be remembered thatthe King of Prussia had refused to undertake this rôle for democratic Germany in1848—and he persuaded Austria to side with Prussia in a military intervention.Denmark had no chance against these Great Powers; she was easily beaten andobliged to relinquish the duchies. Then Bismarck picked a quarrel with Austriafor the possession of these two small states. So he brought about a needless andfratricidal war of Germans for the greater glory of Prussia and the ascendancyof the Hohenzollern dynasty in Germany. German writers of a romantic turn ofmind represent Bismarck as a great statesman planning the unity of Germany; butindeed he was doing nothing of the kind. The unity of Germany was a reality in1848. It was and is in the nature of things. The Prussian monarchy was simplydelaying the inevitable in order to seem to achieve it in Prussian fashion. Thatis why, when at last Germany was unified, instead of bearing the likeness of amodern civilized people, it presented itself to the world with the face of thisarchaic Bismarck, with a fierce moustache, huge jack boots, a spiked helmet, anda sword.In this war between Prussia and Austria, Prussia had for an ally Italy; most ofthe smaller German states, who dreaded the schemes of Prussia, fought on theside of Austria. The reader will naturally want to know why Napoleon III did notgrasp this admirable occasion for statecraft and come into the war to his ownadvantage. All the rules of the Great Power game required that he should. ButNapoleon, unhappily for himself, had got his fingers in a trap on the other sideof the Atlantic, and was in no position to intervene.066 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_066_r1.gif]In order to understand the entanglement of this shifty gentleman, it isnecessary to explain that the discord in interests between the northern andsouthern states of the American union, due to the economic differences based onslavery, had at last led to open civil war. The federal system established in1789 had to fight the secessionist efforts of the confederated slave-holdingstates. We have traced the causes of that great struggle in Chapter VIII, § 6;its course we cannot relate here, nor tell how President Lincoln (born 1809,died 1865, president from 1861) rose to greatness, how the republic was cleansedfrom the stain of slavery, and how the federal government of the union waspreserved. The story of President Lincoln is in itself a great epic of union andorder threatened and saved, and it is with reluctance that it is treated sobriefly here. But in this Outline we must cling closely to our main story.For four long years (1861-65) this American civil war swung to and fro, throughthe rich woods and over the hills of Virginia between Washington and Richmond,until at last the secessionist left was thrust back and broken, and Sherman, theunionist general, swept across Georgia to the sea in the rear of the mainconfederate (secessionist) armies. All the elements of reaction in Europerejoiced during the four years of republican dissension; the British aristocracyopenly sided with the confederate states, and the British Government permittedseveral privateers, and particularly the Alabama, to be launched in England toattack the federal shipping. Napoleon III was even more rash in his assumptionthat after all the new world had fallen before the old. The sure shield of theMonroe Doctrine, it seemed to him, was thrust aside for good, the Great Powersmight meddle again in America, and the blessings of an adventurous monarchy berestored there. A pretext for interference was found in certain liberties takenwith the property of foreigners by the Mexican president. A joint expedition ofFrench, British, and Spanish occupied Vera Cruz, but Napoleon’s projects weretoo bold for his allies, and they withdrew when it became clear that hecontemplated nothing less than the establishment of a Mexican empire. This hedid, after much stiff fighting, making the Archduke Maximilian of AustriaEmperor of Mexico in 1864. The French forces, however, remained in effectualpossession of the country, and a crowd of French speculators poured into Mexicoto exploit its mines and resources.But in April, 1865, the civil war in the United States was brought to an endwith the surrender of the great southern commander, General Lee, at AppomattoxCourt House, and the little group of eager Europeans in possession of Mexicofound themselves faced by the victorious federal government in a thoroughly grimmood, with a large, dangerous-looking army in hand. The French imperialists werebluntly given the alternative of war with the United States or clearing out ofAmerica. In effect this was an instruction to go. This was the entanglementwhich prevented Napoleon III from interference between Prussia and Austria in1866, and this was the reason why Bismarck precipitated his struggle withAustria.While Prussia was fighting Austria, Napoleon III was trying to escape withdignity from the briars of Mexico. He invented a shabby quarrel upon financialgrounds with Maximilian and withdrew the French troops. Then, by all the rulesof kingship, Maximilian should have abdicated. But instead he made a fight forhis empire; he was defeated by his recalcitrant subjects, caught, and shot as apublic nuisance in 1867. So the peace of President Monroe was restored to thenew world. There remained only one monarchy in America, the empire of Brazil,where a branch of the Portuguese royal family continued to reign until 1889. Inthat year the emperor was quietly packed off to Paris, and Brazil came into linewith the rest of the continent.But while Napoleon was busy with his American adventure, Prussia and Italy weresnatching victory over the Austrians (1866). Italy was badly beaten at Custozzaand in the naval battle of Lissa, but the Austrian army was so crushed by thePrussian at the battle of Sadowa that Austria made an abject surrender. Italygained the province of Venetia, so making one more step towards unity—only Romeand Trieste and a few small towns on the north and north-western frontiersremained—and Prussia became the head of a North German Confederation, from whichBavaria, Württemberg, Baden, Hesse, and Austria were excluded.Four years later came the next step towards the natural political map of Europe,when Napoleon III plunged into war against Prussia. A kind of self-destroyingfoolishness urged him to do this. He came near to this war in 1867 so soon as hewas free from Mexico, by demanding Luxembourg for France; he embarked upon it in1870, when a cousin of the king of Prussia became a candidate for the vacantthrone of Spain. Napoleon had some theory in his mind that Austria, Bavaria,Württemberg, and the other states outside the North German Confederation wouldside with him against Prussia. He probably thought this would happen because hewanted it to happen. But since 1848 the Germans, so far as foreign meddling wasconcerned, had been in spirit a united people; Bismarck was merely imposing theHohenzollern monarchy, with pomp, ceremony, and bloodshed, upon accomplishedfacts. All Germany sided with Prussia.Early in August, 1870, the united German forces invaded France. After thebattles of Wörth and Gravelotte, one French army under Bazaine was forced intoMetz and surrounded there, and, on September 1st, a second, with which wasNapoleon, was defeated and obliged to capitulate at Sedan. Paris found herselfbare to the invader. For a second time the promises of Napoleonism had failedFrance disastrously. On September 4th, France declared herself a republic again,and thus regenerated, prepared to fight for existence against triumphantPrussianism. For though it was a united Germany that had overcome Frenchimperialism, it had Prussia in the saddle. The army in Metz capitulated inOctober; Paris, after a siege and bombardment, surrendered in January, 1871.With pomp and ceremony, in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, amidst a greatarray of military uniforms, the King of Prussia was declared German Emperor, andBismarck and the sword of the Hohenzollerns claimed the credit for that Germanunity which a common language and literature had long since assured.The peace of Frankfort was a Hohenzollern peace. Bismarck had availed himself ofthe national feeling of Germany to secure the aid of the South German states,but he had no grasp of the essential forces that had given victory to him and tohis royal master. The power that had driven Prussia to victory was the power ofthe natural political map of Europe insisting upon the unity of theGerman-speaking peoples. In the east, Germany was already sinning against thatnatural map by her administration of Posen and other Polish districts. Nowgreedy for territory, and particularly for iron mines, she annexed aconsiderable area of French-speaking Lorraine, including Metz, and Alsace,which, in spite of its German speech, was largely French in sympathy. Inevitablythere was a clash between German rulers and French subjects in these annexedprovinces; inevitably the wrongs and bitterness of the subjugated France ofLorraine echoed in Paris and kept alive the passionate resentment of the French.. . .The natural map had already secured political recognition in the Austrian Empireafter Sadowa (1866). Hungary, which had been subordinated to Austria, waserected into a kingdom on an equal footing with Austria, and the Empire ofAustria had become the “dual monarchy” of Austria-Hungary. But in the south-eastof this empire, and over the Turkish empire, the boundaries and subjugations ofthe conquest period still remained.A fresh upthrust of the natural map began in 1875, when the Christian races inthe Balkans, and particularly the Bulgarians, became restless and insurgent. TheTurks adopted violent repressive measures, and embarked upon massacres ofBulgarians on an enormous scale. Thereupon Russia intervened (1877), and after ayear of costly warfare obliged the Turks to sign the treaty of San Stefano,which was, on the whole, a sensible treaty, breaking up the artificial TurkishEmpire, and to a large extent establishing the natural map. But it had becomethe tradition of British policy to thwart “the designs of Russia”—heaven knowswhy!—whenever Russia appeared to have a design, and the British foreign office,under the premiership of Lord Beaconsfield, intervened with a threat of war if aconsiderable restoration of the Turks’ facilities for exaction, persecution, andmassacre was not made. For a time war seemed very probable. The Britishmusic-halls, those lamps to British foreign policy, were lit with patrioticfire, and the London errand-boy on his rounds was inspired to chant, with thesimple dignity of a great people conscious of its high destinies, a songdeclaring that:“We don’t want to fight, but, by Jingo,9[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en92] if we do,We got the ships, we got the men, we got the munn-aye too” . . .and so on to a climax:“The Russ’ns shall not ’ave Con-stan-te-no - - - ple.”In consequence of this British opposition, a conference was assembled in 1878 atBerlin to revise the treaty of San Stefano, chiefly in the interests of theTurkish and Austrian monarchies, the British acquired the island of Cyprus, towhich they had no sort of right whatever, and which has never been of theslightest use to them, and Lord Beaconsfield returned triumphantly from theBerlin Conference, to the extreme exasperation of Mr. Gladstone, with what theBritish were given to understand at the time was “Peace with Honour.”067 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_067_r1.gif]This treaty of Berlin was the second main factor, the peace of Frankfort beingthe first, in bringing about the great war of 1914-18.These thirty years after 1848 are years of very great interest to the student ofinternational political methods. Released from their terror of a world-wideinsurrection of the common people, the governments of Europe were doing theirbest to resume the game of Great Powers that had been so rudely interrupted bythe American and French revolutions. But it looked much more like the old gamethan it was in reality. The mechanical revolution was making war a far morecomplete disturbance of the general life than it had ever been before, and theproceedings of the diplomatists were ruled, in spite of their efforts todisregard the fact, by imperatives that Charles V and Louis XIV had never known.Irritation with misgovernment was capable of far better organization and farmore effective expression than it had ever been before. Statesmen dressed thisup as the work of the spirit of Nationalism, but there were times and occasionswhen that costume wore very thin. The grand monarchs of the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries had seemed to be free to do this or that, to make war or tokeep the peace, to conquer this province or cede that as they willed; but such aruler as Napoleon III went from one proceeding to another with something of theeffect of a man who feels his way among things unseen.None of these European governments in the nineteenth century was in fact a freeagent. We look today at the maps of Europe since 1814, we compare them with thenatural map, and we see that the game the Great Powers played was indeed a gameof foregone conclusions. Whatever arrangements they made that were in accordancewith the natural political map of the world, and the trend towards educationaldemocracy, held, and whatever arrangements they made contrary to these things,collapsed. We are forced, therefore, to the conclusion that all the diplomaticfussing, posturing, and scheming, all the intrigue and bloodshed of these years,all the monstrous turmoil and waste of kings and armies, all the wonderfulattitudes, deeds, and schemes of the Cavours, Bismarcks, Disraelis, Bonapartes,and the like “great men,” might very well have been avoided altogether hadEurope but had the sense to instruct a small body of ordinarily honestethnologists, geographers, and sociologists to draw out its proper boundariesand prescribe suitable forms of government in a reasonable manner. The romanticphase in history had come to an end. A new age was beginning with new andgreater imperatives, and these nineteenth-century statesmen were but pretendingto control events.068 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_068_r1.gif]§ 9We have suggested that in the political history of Europe between 1848 and 1878,the mechanical revolution was not yet producing any very revolutionary changes.The post-revolutionary Great Powers were still going on within boundaries ofpractically the same size and with much the same formalities as they had done inpre-revolutionary times. But where the increased speed and certainty oftransport and telegraphic communications were already producing veryconsiderable changes of condition and method, was in the overseas enterprises ofBritain and the other European powers, and in the reaction of Asia and Africa toEurope.The end of the eighteenth century was a period of disrupting empires anddisillusioned expansionists. The long and tedious journey between Britain andSpain and their colonies in America prevented any really free coming and goingbetween the home land and the daughter lands, and so the colonies separated intonew and distinct communities, with distinctive ideas and interests and evenmodes of speech. As they grew they strained more and more at the feeble anduncertain link of shipping that joined them. Weak trading-posts in thewilderness, like those of France in Canada, or trading establishments in greatalien communities, like those of Britain in India, might well cling for bareexistence to the nation which gave them support and a reason for theirexistence. That much and no more seemed to many thinkers in the early part ofthe nineteenth century to be the limit set to overseas rule. In 1820 the sketchygreat European “empires” outside of Europe that had figured so bravely in themaps of the middle eighteenth century, had shrunken to very small dimensions.Only the Russian sprawled as large as ever across Asia. It sprawled much largerin the imaginations of many Europeans than in reality, because of their habit ofstudying the geography of the world upon Mercator’s projection, which enormouslyexaggerated the size of Siberia.069 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_069_r1.gif]The British Empire in 1815 consisted of the thinly populated coastal river andlake regions of Canada, and a great hinterland of wilderness in which the onlysettlements as yet were the fur-trading stations of the Hudson Bay Company,about a third of the Indian peninsula, under the rule of the East India Company,the coast districts of the Cape of Good Hope inhabited by blacks andrebellious-spirited Dutch settlers; a few trading stations on the coast of WestAfrica, the rock of Gibraltar, the island of Malta, Jamaica, a few minorslave-labour possessions in the West Indies, British Guiana in South America,and, on the other side of the world, two dumps for convicts at Botany Bay inAustralia and in Tasmania. Spain retained Cuba and a few settlements in thePhilippine Islands. Portugal had in Africa some vestiges of her ancient claims.Holland had various islands and possessions in the East Indies and Dutch Guiana,and Denmark an island or so in the West Indies. France had one or two WestIndian Islands and French Guiana. This seemed to be as much as the Europeanpowers needed, or were likely to acquire of the rest of the world. Only the EastIndia Company showed any spirit of expansion.In India, as we have already told, a peculiar empire was being built up, not bythe British peoples, nor by the British Government, but by this company ofprivate adventurers with their monopoly and royal charter. The company had beenforced to become a military and political power during the years of Indiandivision and insecurity that followed the breakup of India after the death ofAurangzeb in 1707. It had learnt to trade in states and peoples during theeighteenth century. Clive founded, Warren Hastings organized, this strange newsort of empire; French rivalry was defeated, as we have already told; and by1798, Lord Mornington, afterwards the Marquis Wellesley, the elder brother ofthat General Wellesley who became the Duke of Wellington, becameGovernor-General of India, and set the policy of the company definitely upon theline of replacing the fading empire of the Great Mogul by its own rule.Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt was a direct attack upon the empire of thisBritish company. While Europe was busy with the Napoleonic wars, the East IndiaCompany, under a succession of governors-general, was playing much the same rôlein India that had been played before by Turkoman and such-like invaders from thenorth, but playing it with a greater efficiency and far less violence andcruelty. And after the peace of Vienna it went on, levying its revenues, makingwars, sending ambassadors to Asiatic powers, a quasi-independent state, a state,however, with a marked disposition to send wealth westward.In a previous chapter we have sketched the break-up of the empire of the GreatMogul and the appearance of the Mahratta states, the Rajput principalities, theMoslem kingdoms of Oudh and Bengal, and the Sikhs. We cannot tell here in anydetail how the British company made its way to supremacy sometimes as the allyof this power, sometimes as that, and finally as the conqueror of all. Its powerspread to Assam, Sind, Oudh. The map of India began to take on the outlinesfamiliar to the English schoolboy of today, a patchwork of native statesembraced and held together by the great provinces under direct British rule. . ..Now as this strange unprecedented empire of the company grew in the periodbetween 1800 and 1858, the mechanical revolution was quietly abolishing thegreat distance that had once separated India and Britain. In the old days therule of the company had interfered little in the domestic life of the Indianstates; it had given India foreign overlords, but India was used to foreignoverlords, and had hitherto assimilated them; these Englishmen came into thecountry young, lived there most of their lives, and became a part of its system.But now the mechanical revolution began to alter this state of affairs. Itbecame easier for the British officials to go home and to have holidays inEurope, easier for them to bring out wives and families; they ceased to beIndianized; they remained more conspicuously foreign and western—and there weremore of them. And they began to interfere more vigorously with Indian customs.Magical and terrible things like the telegraph and the railway arrived.Christian missions became offensively busy. If they did not make very manyconverts, at least they made sceptics among the adherents of the older faiths.The young men in the towns began to be “Europeanized” to the great dismay oftheir elders.India had endured many changes of rulers before, but never the sort of changesin her ways that these things portended. The Moslem teachers and the Brahminswere alike alarmed, and the British were blamed for the progress of mankind.Conflicts of economic interests grew more acute with the increasing nearness ofEurope; Indian industries, and particularly the ancient cotton industry,suffered from legislation that favoured the British manufacturer. A piece ofincredible folly on the part of the company precipitated an outbreak. To theBrahmin a cow is sacred; to the Moslem the pig is unclean. A new rifle, needinggreased cartridges—which the men had to bite—was served out to the company’sIndian soldiers; the troops discovered that their cartridges were greased withthe fat of cows and swine. This discovery precipitated a revolt of the company’sIndian army, the Indian Mutiny (1857). First the troops mutinied at Meerut. ThenDelhi rose to restore the empire of the Great Mogul. . . .The British public suddenly discovered India. They became aware of that littlegarrison of British people, far away in that strange land of fiery dust andweary sunshine, fighting for life against dark multitudes of assailants. Howthey got there and what right they had there, the British public did not ask.The love of one’s kin in danger overrides such questions. There were massacresand cruelties. 1857 was a year of passionate anxiety in Great Britain. With merehandfuls of troops the British leaders, and notably Lawrence and Nicholson, didamazing things. They did not sit down to be besieged while the mutineersorganized and gathered prestige; that would have lost them India for ever. Theyattacked often against overwhelming odds. “Clubs, not, spades, are trumps,” saidLawrence. The Sikhs, the Gurkhas, the Punjab troops stuck to the British. Thesouth remained tranquil. Of the massacres of Cawnpore and Lucknow in Oudh, andhow a greatly outnumbered force of British troops besieged and stormed Delhi,other histories must tell. By April, 1859, the last embers of the blaze had beenstamped out, and the British were masters of India again. In no sense had themutiny been a popular insurrection; it was a mutiny merely of the Bengal Army,due largely to the unimaginative rule of the company officials. Its storyabounds in instances of Indian help and kindness to British fugitives. But itwas a warning.The direct result of the mutiny was the annexation of the Indian Empire to theBritish Crown. By the Act entitled An Act for the Better Government of India,the Governor-General became a Viceroy representing the Sovereign, and the placeof the company was taken by a Secretary of State for India responsible to theBritish Parliament. In 1877, Lord Beaconsfield, to complete this work, causedQueen Victoria to be proclaimed Empress of India.Upon these extraordinary lines India and Britain are linked at the present time.India is still the empire of the Great Mogul, expanded, but the Great Mogul hasbeen replaced by the “crowned republic” of Great Britain. India is an autocracywithout an autocrat. Its rule combines the disadvantage of absolute monarchywith the impersonality and irresponsibility of democratic officialdom. TheIndian with a complaint to make has no visible monarch to go to; his Emperor isa golden symbol; he must circulate pamphlets in England or inspire a question inthe British House of Commons. The more occupied Parliament is with Britishaffairs, the less attention India will receive, and the more she will be at themercy of her small group of higher officials.This is manifestly impossible as a permanent state of affairs. Indian life,whatever its restraints, is moving forward with the rest of the world; India hasan increasing service of newspapers, an increasing number of educated peopleaffected by Western ideas, and an increasing sense of a common grievance againsther government. There has been little or no corresponding advance in theeducation and quality of the British official in India during the past seventyyears. His tradition is a high one; he is often a man of exceptional quality,but the system is unimaginative and inflexible. Moreover, the military powerthat stands behind these officials has developed neither in character norintelligence during the last century. No other class has been so stagnantintellectually as the British military caste. Confronted with a more educatedIndia, the British military man, uneasily aware of his educational defects andconstantly apprehensive of ridicule, has in the last few years displayed adisposition towards spasmodic violence that has had some very lamentableresults. For a time the great war altogether diverted what small amount ofBritish public attention was previously given to India, and drew away the moreintelligent military men from her service. During those years, and the feverishyears of unsettlement that followed, things occurred in India, the massacre ofan unarmed crowd at Amritzar in which nearly two thousand people were killed orwounded, floggings and humiliating outrages, a sort of official’s Terror, thatproduced a profound moral shock when at last the Hunter Commission of 1919brought them before the home public. In liberal-minded Englishmen, who have beenwont to regard their empire as an incipient league of free peoples, thisrevelation of the barbaric quality in its administrators produced a veryunderstandable dismay. . . .But the time has not yet come for writing the chapter of history that India isopening for herself. . . . We cannot discuss here in detail the still unsettledproblems of the new India that struggles into being. Already in the Governmentof India Act of 1919 we may have the opening of a new and happier era that mayculminate in a free and willing group of Indian peoples taking an equal placeamong the confederated states of the world. . . .The growth of the British Empire in directions other than that of India was byno means so rapid during the earlier half of the nineteenth century. Aconsiderable school of political thinkers in Britain was disposed to regardoverseas possessions as a source of weakness to the kingdom. The Australiansettlements developed slowly until in 1842 the discovery of valuable coppermines, and in 1851 of gold, gave them a new importance. Improvements intransport were also making Australian wool an increasingly marketable commodityin Europe. Canada, too, was not remarkably progressive until 1849; it wastroubled by dissensions between its French and British inhabitants, there wereseveral serious revolts, and it was only in 1867 that a new constitutioncreating a Federal Dominion of Canada relieved its internal strains. It was therailway that altered the Canadian outlook. It enabled Canada, just as it enabledthe United States, to expand westward, to market its corn and other produce inEurope, and in spite of its swift and extensive growth, to remain in languageand sympathy and interests one community. The railway, the steamship, and thetelegraphic cable were indeed changing all the conditions of colonialdevelopment.Before 1840, English settlements had already begun in New Zealand, and a NewZealand Land Company had been formed to exploit the possibilities of the island.In 1840 New Zealand also was added to the colonial possessions of the BritishCrown.Canada, as we have noted, was the first of the British possessions to respondrichly to the new economic possibilities the new methods of transport wereopening. Presently the republics of South America, and particularly theArgentine Republic, began to feel, in their cattle trade and coffee growing, theincreased nearness of the European market. Hitherto the chief commodities thathad attracted the European powers into unsettled and barbaric regions had beengold or other metals, spices, ivory, or slaves. But in the latter quarter of thenineteenth century the increase of the European populations was obliging theirgovernments to look abroad for staple foods; and the growth of scientificindustrialism was creating a demand for new raw materials, fats and greases ofevery kind, rubber, and other hitherto disregarded substances. It was plain thatGreat Britain and Holland and Portugal were reaping a great and growingcommercial advantage from their very considerable control of tropical andsub-tropical products. After 1871 Germany and presently France and later Italybegan to look for unannexed raw-material areas, or for Oriental countriescapable of profitable modernization.So began a fresh scramble all over the world, except in the American regionwhere the Monroe Doctrine now barred such adventures, for politicallyunprotected lands. Close to Europe was the continent of Africa, full of vaguelyknown possibilities. In 1850 it was a continent of black mystery; only Egypt andthe coast were known. A map must show the greatness of the European ignorance atthat time. It would need a book as long as this Outline to do justice to theamazing story of the explorers and adventurers who first pierced this cloud ofdarkness, and to the political agents, administrators, traders, settlers, andscientific men who followed in their track. Wonderful races of men like thepigmies, strange beasts like the okapi, marvellous fruits and flowers andinsects, terrible diseases, astounding scenery of forest and mountain, enormousinland seas and gigantic rivers and cascades were revealed; a whole new world.Even remains (at Zimbabwe) of some unrecorded and vanished civilization, thesouthward enterprise of an early people, were discovered. Into this new worldcame the Europeans, and found the rifle already there in the hands of the Arabslave-traders, and negro life in disorder. By 1900, as our second map must show,all Africa was mapped, explored, estimated, and divided between the Europeanpowers, divided with much snarling and disputation into portions that left eachpower uneasy or discontented. Little heed was given to the welfare of thenatives in this scramble. The Arab slaver was indeed curbed rather thanexpelled, but the greed for rubber, which was a wild product collected undercompulsion by the natives in the Belgian Congo, a greed exacerbated by thepitiless avarice of the King of the Belgians, and the clash of inexperiencedEuropean administrators with the native population in many other annexations,led to horrible atrocities. No European power has perfectly clean hands in thismatter.We cannot tell here in any detail how Great Britain got possession of Egypt in1883, and remained there in spite of the fact that Egypt was technically a partof the Turkish Empire, nor how nearly this scramble led to war between Franceand Great Britain in 1898, when a certain Colonel Marchand, crossing CentralAfrica from the west coast, tried at Fashoda to seize the Upper Nile. In Ugandathe French Catholic and the British Anglican missionaries disseminated a form ofChristianity so heavily charged with the spirit of Napoleon, and so finelyinsistent upon the nuances of doctrine, that a few years after its first glimpseof European civilization, Mengo, the capital of Uganda, was littered with dead“Protestants” and “Catholics” extremely difficult to distinguish from theentirely unspiritual warriors of the old régime.070 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_070_r1.gif]071 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_071_r1.gif]Nor can we tell how the British Government first let the Boers, or Dutchsettlers, of the Orange River district and the Transvaal set up independentrepublics in the inland parts of South Africa, and then repented and annexed theTransvaal Republic in 1877; nor how the Transvaal Boers fought for freedom andwon it after the Battle of Majuba Hill (1881). Majuba Hill was made to rankle inthe memory of the English people by a persistent press campaign. A war with bothrepublics broke out in 1899, a three years’ war enormously costly to the Britishpeople, which ended at last in the surrender of the two republics.Their period of subjugation was a brief one. In 1907, after the downfall of theimperialist government which had conquered them, the Liberals took the SouthAfrican problem in hand, and these former republics became free and fairlywilling associates with Cape Colony and Natal in a confederation of all thestates of South Africa as one self-governing republic under the British Crown.In a quarter of a century the partition of Africa was completed. There remainedunannexed three comparatively small countries: Liberia, a settlement ofliberated negro slaves on the west coast; Morocco, under a Moslem Sultan; andAbyssinia, a barbaric country, with an ancient and peculiar form ofChristianity, which had successfully maintained its independence against Italyat the Battle of Adowa in 1896.§ 10It is difficult to believe that any large number of people really accepted thisheadlong painting of the map of Africa in European colours as a permanent newsettlement of the world’s affairs, but it is the duty of the historian to recordthat it was so accepted. There was but a shallow historical background to theEuropean mind in the nineteenth century, hardly any sense of what constitutes anenduring political system, and no habit of penetrating criticism. The quitetemporary advantages that the onset of the mechanical revolution in the west hadgiven the European Great Powers over the rest of the old world were regarded bypeople, blankly ignorant of the great Mongol conquests of the thirteenth andfollowing centuries, as evidences of a permanent and assured leadership. Theyhad no sense of the transferability of science and its fruits. They did notrealize that Chinamen and Indians could carry on the work of research as ably asFrenchmen or Englishmen. They believed that there was some innate intellectualdrive in the west, and some innate indolence and conservatism in the east, thatassured the Europeans a world predominance for ever.The consequence of this infatuation was that the various European foreignoffices set themselves not merely to scramble with the British for the savageand undeveloped regions of the world’s surface, but also to carve up thepopulous and civilized countries of Asia as though these peoples also were nomore than raw material for European exploitation. The inwardly precarious butoutwardly splendid imperialism of the British ruling class in India, and theextensive and profitable possessions of the Dutch in the East Indies, filled theruling and mercantile classes of the rival Great Powers with dreams of similarglories in Persia, in the disintegrating Ottoman Empire, and in Further India,China, and Japan. In the closing years of the nineteenth century it was assumed,as the reader may verify by an examination of the current literature of theperiod, to be a natural and inevitable thing that all the world should fallunder European dominion. With a reluctant benevolent effort the European mindprepared itself to take up what Mr. Rudyard Kipling called “the White Man’sBurthen”—that is to say, the lordship of the earth. The Powers set themselves tothis enterprise in a mood of jostling rivalry, with half-educated or illiteratepopulations at home, with a mere handful of men, a few thousand at most, engagedin scientific research, with their internal political systems in a state oftension or convulsive change, with a creaking economic system of the mostprovisional sort, and with their religions far gone in decay. They reallybelieved that the vast populations of eastern Asia could be permanentlysubordinated to such a Europe.Even today there are many people who fail to grasp the essential facts of thissituation. They do not realize that in Asia the average brain is not one whitinferior in quality to the average European brain; that history shows Asiaticsto be as bold, as vigorous, as generous, as self-sacrificing, and as capable ofstrong collective action as Europeans, and that there are and must continue tobe a great many more Asiatics than Europeans in the world. It has always beendifficult to restrain the leakage of knowledge from one population to another,and now it becomes impossible. Under modern conditions world-wide economic andeducational equalization is in the long run inevitable. An intellectual andmoral rally of the Asiatics is going on at the present time. The slight leewayof a century or so, a few decades may recover. At the present time, for example,for one Englishman who knows Chinese thoroughly, or has any intimate knowledgeof Chinese life and thought, there are hundreds of Chinamen conversant witheverything the English know. The balance of knowledge in favour of India may beeven greater. To Britain, India sends students; to India, Britain sendsofficials, for the most part men untrained in scientific observation. There isno organization whatever for the sending of European students, as students, toexamine and inquire into Indian history, archæology, and current affairs or forbringing learned Indians into contact with British students in Britain.Since the year 1898, the year of the seizure of Kiau-Chau by Germany and ofWei-hai-wei by Britain, and the year after the Russian taking of Port Arthur,events in China have moved more rapidly than in any other country except Japan.A great hatred of Europeans swept like a flame over China, and a politicalsociety for the expulsion of Europeans, the Boxers, grew up and broke out intoviolence in 1900. This was an outbreak of rage and mischief on quiteold-fashioned lines. In 1900 the Boxers murdered 250 Europeans and, it is said,nearly 30,000 Christians. China, not for the first time in history, was underthe sway of a dowager empress. She was an ignorant woman, but of great force ofcharacter and in close sympathy with the Boxers. She supported them, andprotected those who perpetrated outrages on the Europeans. All that again iswhat might have happened in 500 B.C. or thereabouts against the Huns.Things came to a crisis in 1900. The Boxers became more and more threatening tothe Europeans in China. Attempts were made to send up additional European guardsto the Peking legations, but this only precipitated matters. The German ministerwas shot down in the streets of Peking by a soldier of the imperial guard. Therest of the foreign representatives gathered together and made a fortificationof the more favourably situated legations and stood a siege of two months. Acombined allied force of 20,000 under a German general then marched up to Pekingand relieved the legations, and the old Empress fled to Sian-fu, the old capitalof Tai-tsung. Some of the European troops committed grave atrocities upon theChinese civil population.10 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en93]That brings one up to about the level of 1850, let us say.There followed the practical annexation of Manchuria by Russia, a squabble amongthe powers, and in 1904 a British invasion of Tibet, hitherto a forbiddencountry. But what did not appear on the surface of these events, and what madeall these events fundamentally different, was that China now contained aconsiderable number of able people who had a European education and Europeanknowledge. The Boxer Insurrection subsided, and then the influence of this newfactor began to appear in talk of a constitution (1906), in the suppression ofopium-smoking, and in educational reforms. A constitution of the Japanese typecame into existence in 1909, making China a limited monarchy. But China is notto be moulded to the Japanese pattern, and the revolutionary stir continued.Japan, in her own reorganization, and in accordance with her temperament, hadturned her eyes to the monarchist west, but China was looking across thePacific. In 1911 the essential Chinese revolution began. In 1912 the emperorabdicated, and the greatest community in the world became a republic. Theoverthrow of the emperor was also the overthrow of the Manchus, and theMongolian pigtail, which had been worn by the Chinese since 1644, ceased to becompulsory. It continues, however, to be worn by a large proportion of thepopulation.At the present time it is probable that there is more good brain matter and moredevoted men working out the modernization and the reorganization of the Chinesecivilization than we should find directed to the welfare of any single Europeanpeople. China will presently have a modernized practicable script, a press, newand vigorous modern universities, a reorganized industrial system, and a growingbody of scientific and economic inquiry. The natural industry and ingenuity ofher vast population will be released to cooperate upon terms of equality withthe Western world. She may have great internal difficulties ahead of her yet; ofthat no man can judge. Nevertheless, the time may not be very distant when theFederated States of China may be at one with the United States of America and apacified and reconciled Europe in upholding the organized peace of the world.§ 11The pioneer country, however, in the recovery of the Asiatic peoples was notChina, but Japan. We have outrun our story in telling of China. Hitherto Japanhas played but a small part in this history; her secluded civilization has notcontributed very largely to the general shaping of human destinies; she hasreceived much, but she has given little. The original inhabitants of theJapanese Islands were probably a northern people with remote Nordic affinities,the Hairy Ainu. But the Japanese proper are of the Mongolian race. Physicallythey resemble the Amerindians, and there are many curious resemblances betweenthe prehistoric pottery and so forth of Japan and similar Peruvian products. Itis not impossible that they are a back-flow from the trans-Pacific drift of theearly heliolithic culture, but they may also have absorbed from the south aMalay and even a Negrito element.Whatever the origin of the Japanese, there can be no doubt that theircivilization, their writing, and their literary and artistic traditions arederived from the Chinese. They were emerging from barbarism in the second andthird century of the Christian Era, and one of their earliest acts as a peopleoutside their own country was an invasion of Korea under a queen Jingo, whoseems to have played a large part in establishing their civilization. Theirhistory is an interesting and romantic one; they developed a feudal system and atradition of chivalry; their attacks upon Korea and China are an Easternequivalent of the English wars in France. Japan was first brought into contactwith Europe in the sixteenth century; in 1542 some Portuguese reached it in aChinese junk, and in 1549 a Jesuit missionary, Francis Xavier, began histeaching there. The Jesuit accounts describe a country greatly devastated byperpetual feudal war. For a time Japan welcomed European intercourse, and theChristian missionaries made a great number of converts. A certain William Adams,of Gillingham, in Kent, became the most trusted European adviser of theJapanese, and showed them how to build big ships. There were voyages inJapanese-built ships to India and Peru. Then arose complicated quarrels betweenthe Spanish Dominicans, the Portuguese Jesuits, and the English and DutchProtestants, each warning the Japanese against the evil political designs of theothers. The Jesuits, in a phase of ascendancy, persecuted and insulted theBuddhists with great acrimony. These troubles interwove with the feudalconflicts of the time. In the end the Japanese came to the conclusion that theEuropeans and their Christianity were an intolerable nuisance, and that CatholicChristianity in particular was a mere cloak for the political dreams of the Popeand the Spanish monarchy—already in possession of the Philippine Islands; therewas a great and conclusive persecution of the Christians, and in 1638 Japan withthe exception of one wretched Dutch factory on the minute island of Deshima inthe harbour of Nagasaki was absolutely closed to Europeans, and remained closedfor over 200 years. The Dutch on Deshima were exposed to almost unendurableindignities. They had no intercourse with any Japanese except the specialofficials appointed to deal with them. During those two centuries the Japaneseremained as completely cut off from the rest of the world as though they livedupon another planet. It was forbidden to build any ship larger than a merecoasting boat. No Japanese could go abroad, and no European enter the country.For two centuries Japan remained outside the main current of history. She livedon in a state of picturesque feudalism enlivened by blood feuds, in which aboutfive per cent. of the population, the samurai, or fighting men, and the noblesand their families, tyrannized without restraint over the rest of thepopulation. All common men knelt when a noble passed; to betray the slightestdisrespect was to risk being slashed to death by his samurai. The elect classeslived lives of romantic adventure without one redeeming gleam of novelty; theyloved, murdered, and pursued fine points of honour—which probably bored theintelligent ones extremely. We can imagine the wretchedness of a curious mind,tormented by the craving for travel and knowledge, cooped up in these islands ofempty romance.Meanwhile the great world outside went on to wider visions and new powers.Strange shipping became more frequent, passing the Japanese headlands; sometimesships were wrecked and sailors brought ashore. Through the Dutch settlement atDeshima, their one link with the outer universe, came warnings that Japan wasnot keeping pace with the power of the Western world. In 1837 a ship sailed intoYedo Bay flying a strange flag of stripes and stars, and carrying some Japanesesailors she had picked up far adrift in the Pacific. She was driven off by acannon shot. This flag presently reappeared on other ships. One in 1849 came todemand the liberation of eighteen shipwrecked American sailors. Then in 1853came four American warships under Commodore Perry, and refused to be drivenaway. He lay at anchor in forbidden waters, and sent messages to the two rulerswho at that time shared the control of Japan. In 1854 he returned with tenships, amazing ships propelled by steam, and equipped with big guns, and he madeproposals for trade and intercourse that the Japanese had no power to resist. Helanded with a guard of 500 men to sign the treaty. Incredulous crowds watchedthis visitation from the outer world, marching through the streets.Russia, Holland, and Britain followed in the wake of America. Foreigners enteredthe country, and conflicts between them and Japanese gentlemen of spirit ensued.A British subject was killed in a street brawl, and a Japanese town wasbombarded by the British (1863). A great nobleman whose estates commanded theStraits of Shimonoseki saw fit to fire on foreign vessels, and a secondbombardment by a fleet of British, French, Dutch, and American warshipsdestroyed his batteries and scattered his swordsmen. Finally an allied squadron(1865), at anchor off Kioto, imposed a ratification of the treaties which openedJapan to the world.The humiliation of the Japanese by these events was intense, and it would seemthat the salvation of peoples lies largely in such humiliations. Withastonishing energy and intelligence they set themselves to bring their cultureand organization up to the level of the European powers. Never in all thehistory of mankind did a nation make such a stride as Japan then did. In 1866she was a mediæval people, a fantastic caricature of the extremist romanticfeudalism; in 1899 hers was a completely Westernized people, on a level with themost advanced European powers, and well in advance of Russia. She completelydispelled the persuasion that Asia was in some irrevocable way hopelessly behindEurope. She made all European progress seem sluggish and tentative bycomparison.We cannot tell here in any detail of Japan’s war with China in 1894-95. Itdemonstrated the extent of her Westernization. She had an efficient Westernizedarmy and a small but sound fleet. But the significance of her renascence, thoughit was appreciated by Britain and the United States, who were already treatingher as if she were a European state, was not understood by the other GreatPowers engaged in the pursuit of new Indias in Asia. Russia was pushing downthrough Manchuria to Korea, France was already established far to the south inTonkin and Annam, Germany was prowling hungrily on the look-out for somesettlement. The three powers combined to prevent Japan reaping any fruits fromthe Chinese war, and particularly from establishing herself on the mainland atthe points commanding the Japan Sea. She was exhausted by her war with China,and they threatened her with war.072 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_072_r1.gif]In 1898 Germany descended upon China, and, making the murder of two missionariesher excuse, annexed a portion of the province of Shang-tung. Thereupon Russiaseized the Liao-tung peninsula, and extorted the consent of China to anextension of her trans-Siberian railway to Port Arthur; and in 1900 she occupiedManchuria. Britain was unable to resist the imitative impulse, and seized theport of Wei-hai-wei (1898). How alarming these movements must have been to everyintelligent Japanese a glance at the map will show. They led to a war withRussia which marks an epoch in the history of Asia, the close of the period ofEuropean arrogance. The Russian people were, of course, innocent and ignorant ofthis trouble that was being made for them half-way round the world, and thewiser Russian statesmen were against these foolish thrusts; but a gang offinancial adventurers surrounded the Tsar, including the Grand Dukes, hiscousins. They had gambled deeply in the prospective looting of Manchuria andChina, and they would suffer no withdrawal. So there began a transportation ofgreat armies of Japanese soldiers across the sea to Port Arthur and Korea, andthe sending of endless train-loads of Russian peasants along the Siberianrailway to die in those distant battlefields.The Russians, badly led and dishonestly provided, were beaten on sea and landalike. The Russian Baltic Fleet sailed round Africa to be utterly destroyed inthe Straits of Tshu-shima. A revolutionary movement among the common people ofRussia, infuriated by this remote and reasonless slaughter, obliged the Tsar toend the war (1905); he returned the southern half of Saghalien, which had beenseized by Russia in 1875, evacuated Manchuria, resigned Korea to Japan. TheWhite Man was beginning to drop his load in eastern Asia. For some years,however, Germany remained in uneasy possession of Kiau-Chau.§ 12We have already noted how the enterprise of Italy in Abyssinia had been checkedat the terrible battle of Adowa (1896), in which over 3,000 Italians were killedand more than 4,000 taken prisoner. The phase of imperial expansion at theexpense of organized non-European states was manifestly drawing to a close. Ithad entangled the quite sufficiently difficult political and social problems ofGreat Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Russia with the affairs ofconsiderable alien, unassimilable, and resentful populations; Great Britain hadEgypt (not formally annexed as yet), India, Burmah, and a variety of such minorproblems as Malta and Shanghai; France had cumbered herself with Tonkin andAnnam in addition to Algiers and Tunis; Spain was newly entangled in Morocco;Italy had found trouble for herself in Tripoli; and German overseas imperialism,though its “place in the sun” seemed a poor one, derived what satisfaction itcould from the thought of a prospective war with Japan over Kiau-Chau. All these“subject” lands had populations at a level of intelligence and education verylittle lower than those of the possessing country; the development of a nativepress, of a collective self-consciousness, and of demands for self-governmentwas in each case inevitable, and the statesmen of Europe had been far too busyachieving these empires to have any clear ideas of what they would do with themwhen they got them.The Western democracies, as they woke up to freedom, discovered themselves“imperial,” and were considerably embarrassed by the discovery. The East came tothe Western capitals with perplexing demands. In London the common Englishman,much preoccupied by strikes, by economic riddles, by questions ofnationalization, municipalization, and the like, found that his path was crossedand his public meetings at tended by a large and increasing number of swarthygentlemen in turbans, fezes, and other strange headgear, all saying in effect:“You have got us. The people who represent your government have destroyed ourown government, and prevent us from making a new one. What are you going to dowith us?”§ 13We may note here briefly the very various nature of the constituents of theBritish Empire in 1914. It was and is a quite unique political combination;nothing of the sort has ever existed before.First and central to the whole system was the “crowned republic” of the UnitedBritish Kingdoms, including (against the will of a considerable part of theIrish people) Ireland. The majority of the British Parliament, made up of thethree united parliaments of England, Scotland, and Ireland, determines theheadship, the quality and policy of the ministry, and determines it largely onconsiderations arising out of British domestic politics. It is this ministrywhich is the effective supreme government, with powers of peace and war, overall the rest of the empire.Next in order of political importance to the British States were the “crownedrepublics” of Australia, Canada, Newfoundland (the oldest British possession,1583), New Zealand, and South Africa, all practically independent andself-governing states in alliance with Great Britain, but each with arepresentative of the Crown appointed by the Government in office;Next the Indian Empire, an extension of the empire of the Great Mogul, with itsdependent and “protected” states reaching now from Baluchistan to Burmah, andincluding Aden, in all of which empire the British Crown and the Indian Office(under Parliamentary control) played the rôle of the original Turkoman dynasty;Then the ambiguous possession of Egypt, still nominally a part of the TurkishEmpire and still retaining its own monarch, the Khedive, but under almostdespotic British official rule;Then the still more ambiguous “Anglo-Egyptian” Sudan province, occupied andadministered jointly by the British and by the (British controlled) EgyptianGovernment;Then a number of partially self-governing communities, some British in originand some not, with elected legislatures and an appointed executive, such asMalta,11 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en94] Jamaica, the Bahamas,and Bermuda;Then the Crown colonies, in which the rule of the British Home Government(through the Colonial Office) verged on autocracy, as in Ceylon, Trinidad, andFiji (where there was an appointed council), and Gibraltar and St. Helena (wherethere was a governor);Then great areas of (chiefly) tropical lands, raw-product areas, withpolitically weak and under-civilized native communities, which were nominallyprotectorates, and administered either by a High Commissioner set over nativechiefs (as in Basutoland) or over a chartered company (as in Rhodesia). In somecases the Foreign Office, in some cases the Colonial Office, and in some casesthe India Office had been concerned in acquiring the possessions that fell intothis last and least definite class of all, but for the most part the ColonialOffice was now responsible for them.It will be manifest, therefore, that no single office and no single brain hadever comprehended the British Empire as a whole. It was a mixture of growths andaccumulations entirely different from anything that has ever been called anempire before. It guaranteed a wide peace and security; that is why it wasendured and sustained by many men of the “subject” races—in spite of officialtyrannies and insufficiencies, and of much negligence on the part of the “home”public. Like the “Athenian empire,” it was an overseas empire; its ways were seaways, and its common link was the British Navy. Like all empires, its cohesionwas dependent physically upon a method of communication; the development ofseamanship, shipbuilding, and steamships between the sixteenth and nineteenthcenturies had made it a possible and convenient Pax—the “Pax Britannica,” andfresh developments of air or swift land transport or of undersea warfare mightat any time make it inconvenient or helplessly insecure.073 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_073_r1.gif]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XITHE INTERNATIONAL CATASTROPHE OF 1914§ 1.

A Forecast of the Next War.§ 1FOR thirty-six years after the Treaty of San Stefano and the Berlin Conference,Europe maintained an uneasy peace within its borders; there was no war betweenany of the leading states during this period. They jostled, browbeat, andthreatened one another, but they did not come to actual hostilities. There was ageneral realization after 1871 that modern war was a much more serious thingthan the professional warfare of the eighteenth century, an effort of peoples asa whole that might strain the social fabric very severely, an adventure not tobe rashly embarked upon. The mechanical revolution was giving constantly morepowerful (and expensive) weapons by land and sea, and more rapid methods oftransport; and making it more and more impossible to carry on warfare without acomplete dislocation of the economic life of the community. Even the foreignoffices felt the fear of war.But though war was dreaded as it had never been dreaded in the world before,nothing was done in the way of setting up a federal control to prevent humanaffairs drifting towards war. In 1898, it is true, the young Tsar Nicholas II(1894-1917) issued a rescript inviting the other Great Powers to a conference ofstates “seeking to make the great idea of universal peace triumph over theelements of trouble and discord.” His rescript recalls the declaration of hispredecessor, Alexander I, which gave its tone to the Holy Alliance, and it isvitiated by the same assumption that peace can be established between sovereigngovernments rather than by a broad appeal to the needs and rights of the onepeople of mankind. The lesson of the United States of America, which showed thatthere could be neither unity of action nor peace until the thought of the“people of Virginia” and the “people of Massachusetts” had been swept aside bythe thought of the “people of the United States,” went entirely disregarded inthe European attempts at pacification. Two conferences were held at The Hague inHolland, one in 1899 and another in 1907, and at the second nearly all thesovereign states of the world were represented. They were representeddiplomatically, there was no direction of the general intelligence of the worldto their deliberations, the ordinary common man did not even know that theseconferences were sitting, and for the most part the assembled representativeshaggled cunningly upon points of international law affecting war, leaving asidethe abolition of war as a chimæra. These Hague Conferences did nothing to dispelthe idea that international life is necessarily competitive. They accepted thatidea. They did nothing to develop the consciousness of a world commonwealoverriding sovereigns and foreign offices. The international lawyers andstatesmen who attended these gatherings were as little disposed to hasten on aworld commonweal on such a basis as were the Prussian statesmen of 1848 towelcome an all-German parliament overriding the rights and “policy” of the Kingof Prussia.In America a series of three Pan-American conferences in 1889, 1901, and 1906went some way towards the development of a scheme of international arbitrationfor the whole American continent.The character and good faith of Nicholas II, who initiated these Haguegatherings, we will not discuss at any length here. He may have thought thattime was on the side of Russia. But of the general unwillingness of the GreatPowers to face the prospect of a merger of sovereign powers, without whichpermanent peace projects are absurd, there can be no sort of doubt whatever. Itwas no cessation of international competition with its acute phase of war thatthey desired, but rather a cheapening of war, which was becoming too costly.Each wanted to economize the wastage of minor disputes and conflicts, and toestablish international laws that would embarrass its more formidable opponentsin war-time without incommoding itself. These were the practical ends theysought at the Hague Conference. It was a gathering they attended to pleaseNicholas II, just as the monarchs of Europe had subscribed to the evangelicalpropositions of the Holy Alliance to please Alexander I; and as they hadattended it, they tried to make what they conceived to be some use of it.§ 2The peace of Frankfort had left Germany Prussianized and united, the mostformidable of all the Great Powers of Europe. France was humiliated andcrippled. Her lapse into republicanism seemed likely to leave her withoutfriends in any European court. Italy was as yet a mere stripling. Austria sanknow rapidly to the position of a confederate in German policy. Russia was vast,but undeveloped; and the British Empire was mighty only on the sea. BeyondEurope the one power to be reckoned with by Germany was the United States ofAmerica, growing now into a great industrial nation, but with no army nor navyworth considering by European standards.The new Germany which was embodied in the empire that had been created atVersailles was a complex and astonishing mixture of the fresh intellectual andmaterial forces of the world, with the narrowest political traditions of theEuropean system. She was vigorously educational; she was by far the mosteducational state in the world; she made the educational pace for all herneighbours and rivals. In this time of reckoning for Germany, it may help theBritish reader to a balanced attitude to recall the educational stimulation forwhich his country has to thank first the German Prince Consort and then Germancompetition. That mean jealousy of the educated common man on the part of theBritish ruling class, which no patriotic pride or generous impulse had eversufficed to overcome, went down before a growing fear of German efficiency. AndGermany took up the organization of scientific research and of the applicationof scientific method to industrial and social development with such a faith andenergy as no other community had ever shown before. Throughout all this periodof the armed peace she was reaping and sowing afresh and reaping again theharvests, the unfailing harvests, of freely disseminated knowledge. She grewswiftly to become a great manufacturing and trading power; her steel outputoutran the British; in a hundred new fields of production and commerce, whereintelligence and system was of more account than mere trader’s cunning, in themanufacture of optical glass, of dyes and of a multitude of chemical productsand in endless novel processes, she led the world.To the British manufacturer who was accustomed to see inventions come into hisworks, he knew not whence nor why, begging to be adopted, this new German methodof keeping and paying scientific men seemed abominably unfair. It was compellingfortune, he felt. It was packing the cards. It was encouraging a nasty class ofintellectuals to interfere in the affairs of sound business men. Science wentabroad from its first home like an unloved child. The splendid chemical industryof Germany was built on the work of the Englishman Sir William Perkin, who couldfind no “practical” English business man to back him. And Germany also led theway in many forms of social legislation. Germany realized that labour is anational asset, that it deteriorates through unemployment, and that, for thecommon good, it has to be taken care of outside the works. The British employerwas still under the delusion that labour had no business to exist outside theworks, and that the worse such exterior existence was, the better somehow forhim. Moreover, because of his general illiteracy, he was an intenseindividualist: his was the insenate rivalry of the vulgar mind; he hated hisfellow manufacturers about as much as he hated his labour and his customers.German producers, on the other hand, were persuaded of the great advantages ofcombination and civility; their enterprises tended to flow together and assumemore and more the character of national undertakings.This educating, scientific, and organizing Germany was the natural developmentof the liberal Germany of 1848; it had its roots far back in the recuperativeeffort that drew its impulse from the shame of the Napoleonic conquest. All thatwas good, all that was great in this modern Germany, she owed indeed to herschoolmasters. But this scientific organizing spirit was only one of the twofactors that made up the new German Empire. The other factor was theHohenzollern monarchy which had survived Jena, which had tricked and bested therevolution of 1848, and which, under the guidance of Bismarck, had now clamberedto the legal headship of all Germany outside Austria. Except the Tsardom, noother European state had so preserved the tradition of the Grand Monarchy of theeighteenth century as the Prussian. Through the tradition of Frederick theGreat, Machiavelli now reigned in Germany. In the head of this fine new modernstate, therefore, there sat no fine modern brain to guide it to a worldpredominance in world service, but an old spider lusting for power. PrussianizedGermany was at once the newest and the most antiquated thing in Western Europe.She was the best and the wickedest state of her time.The psychology of nations is still but a rudimentary science. Psychologists havescarcely begun to study the citizen side of the individual man. But it is of theutmost importance to our subject that the student of universal history shouldgive some thought to the mental growth of the generations of Germans educatedsince the victories of 1871. They were naturally inflated by their sweepingunqualified successes in war, and by their rapid progress from comparativepoverty to wealth. It would have been more than human in them if they had notgiven way to some excesses of patriotic vanity. But this reaction wasdeliberately seized upon and fostered and developed by a systematic exploitationand control of school and college, literature and press, in the interests of theHohenzollern dynasty. A teacher, a professor, who did not teach and preach, inand out of season, the racial, moral, intellectual, and physical superiority ofthe Germans to all other peoples, their extraordinary devotion to war and theirdynasty, and their inevitable destiny under that dynasty to lead the world, wasa marked man, doomed to failure and obscurity. German historical teaching becamean immense systematic falsification of the human past, with a view to theHohenzollern future. All other nations were represented as incompetent anddecadent; the Prussians were the leaders and regenerators of mankind. The youngGerman read this in his school-books, heard it in church, found it in hisliterature, had it poured into him with passionate conviction by his professor.It was poured into him by all his professors; lecturers in biology ormathematics would break off from their proper subject to indulge in longpassages of patriotic rant. Only minds of extraordinary toughness andoriginality could resist such a torrent of suggestion. Insensibly there wasbuilt up in the German mind a conception of Germany and its emperor as ofsomething splendid and predominant as nothing else had ever been before, agodlike nation in “shining armour” brandishing the “good German sword” in aworld of inferior—and very badly disposed —peoples. We have told our story ofEurope; the reader may judge whether the glitter of the German sword isexceptionally blinding. Germania was deliberately intoxicated, she wassystematically kept drunk, with this sort of patriotic rhetoric. It is thegreatest of the Hohenzollern crimes that the Crown constantly and persistentlytampered with education, and particularly with historical teaching. No othermodern state has so sinned against education. The oligarchy of the crownedrepublic of Great Britain may have crippled and starved education, but theHohenzollern monarchy corrupted and prostituted it.It cannot be too clearly stated, it is the most important fact in the history ofthe last half century, that the German people was methodically indoctrinatedwith the idea of a German world-predominance based on might, and with the theorythat war was a necessary thing in life. The key to German historical teaching isto be found in Count Moltke’s dictum: “Perpetual peace is a dream, and it is noteven a beautiful dream. War is an element in the order of the world ordained byGod.” “Without war the world would stagnate and lose itself in materialism.” Andthe anti-Christian German philosopher, Nietzsche, found himself quite at onewith the pious field-marshal. “It is mere illusion and pretty sentiment,” heobserves, “to expect much (even anything at all) from mankind if it forgets howto make war. As yet no means are known which call so much into action as a greatwar that rough energy born of the camp, that deep impersonality born of hatred,that conscience born of murder and cold- bloodedness, that fervour born ofeffort in the annihilation of the enemy, that proud indifference to loss, toone’s own existence, to that of one’s fellows, that earthquake-like soul-shakingwhich a people needs when it is losing its vitality.”1[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en95]This sort of teaching, which pervaded the German Empire from end to end, wasbound to be noted abroad, bound to alarm every other power and people in theworld, bound to provoke an anti-German confederation and it was accompanied by aparade of military, and presently of naval, preparation that threatened France,Russia, and Britain alike. It affected the thoughts, the manners, and morals ofthe entire German people. After 1871, the German abroad thrust out his chest andraised his voice. He threw a sort of trampling quality even into the operationsof commerce. His machinery came on the markets of the world, his shipping tookthe seas with a splash of patriotic challenge. His very merits he used as ameans of offence. (And probably most other peoples, if they had had the sameexperiences and undergone the same training, would have behaved in a similarmanner.)By one of those accidents in history that personify and precipitatecatastrophes, the ruler of Germany, the emperor William II, embodied the neweducation of his people and the Hohenzollern tradition in the completest form.He came to the throne in 1888 at the age of twenty-nine; his father, FrederickIII, had succeeded his grandfather, William I, in the March, to die in the Juneof that year. William II was the grandson of Queen Victoria on his mother’sside, but his temperament showed no traces of the liberal German tradition thatdistinguished the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha family. His head was full of the frothystuff of the new imperialism. He signalized his accession by an address to hisarmy and navy; his address to his people followed three days later. A high noteof contempt for democracy was sounded: “The soldier and the army, notparliamentary majorities, have welded together the German Empire. My trust isplaced in the army.” So the patient work of the German schoolmasters wasdisowned, and the Hohenzollern declared himself triumphant.074 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_074_r1.gif]The next exploit of the young monarch was to quarrel with the old chancellor,Bismarck, who had made the new German Empire, and to dismiss him (1890). Therewere no profound differences of opinion between them, but, as Bismarck said, theEmperor intended to be his own chancellor.These were the opening acts of an active and aggressive career. This William IImeant to make a noise in the world, a louder noise than any other monarch hadever made. The whole of Europe was soon familiar with the figure of the newmonarch, invariably in military uniform of the most glittering sort, staringvaliantly, fiercely moustached, and with a withered left arm ingeniouslyminimised. He affected silver shining breastplates and long white cloaks. Agreat restlessness was manifest. It was clear he conceived himself destined forgreat things, but for a time it was not manifest what particular great thingsthese were. There was no oracle at Delphi now to tell him that he was destinedto destroy a great empire.The note of theatricality about him and the dismissal of Bismarck alarmed manyof his subjects, but they were presently reassured by the idea that he was usinghis influence in the cause of peace and to consolidate Germany. He travelledmuch, to London, Vienna, Rome—where he had private conversations with thePope—to Athens, where his sister married the king in 1889, and toConstantinople. He was the first Christian sovereign to be a Sultan’s guest. Healso went to Palestine. A special gate was knocked through the ancient wall ofJerusalem so that he could ride into that place; it was beneath his dignity towalk in. He induced the Sultan to commence the reorganization of the TurkishArmy upon German lines and under German officers. In 1895 he announced thatGermany was a “world power,” and that “the future of Germany lay upon thewater”—regardless of the fact that the British considered that they were therealready—and he began to interest himself more and more in the building up of agreat navy. He also took German art and literature under his care; he used hisinfluence to retain the distinctive and blinding German blackletter against theRoman type used by the rest of western Europe, and he supported the Pan-Germanmovement, which claimed the Dutch, the Scandinavians, the Flemish Belgians, andthe German Swiss as members of a great German brotherhood—as in fact goodassimilable stuff for a hungry young empire which meant to grow. All othermonarchs in Europe paled before him.He used the general hostility against Britain aroused throughout Europe by thewar against the Boer Republics to press forward his schemes for a great navy,and this, together with the rapid and challenging extension of the Germancolonial empire in Africa and the Pacific Ocean, alarmed and irritated theBritish extremely. British liberal opinion in particular found itself under theexasperating necessity of supporting an ever-increasing British Navy. “I willnot rest,” he said, “until I have brought my navy to the same height at which myarmy stands.” The most peace-loving of the islanders could not ignore thatthreat.In 1890 he had acquired the small island of Heligoland from Britain. This hemade into a great naval fortress.As his navy grew, his enterprise increased. He proclaimed the Germans “the saltof the earth.” They must not “weary in the work of civilization; Germany, likethe spirit of Imperial Rome, must expand and impose itself.” This he said onPolish soil, in support of the steady efforts the Germans were making tosuppress the Polish language and culture, and to Germanize their share ofPoland. God he described as his “Divine Ally.” In the old absolutisms themonarch was either God himself or the adopted agent of God; the Kaiser took Godfor his trusty henchman. “Our old God,” he said affectionately. When the Germansseized Kiau-Chau, he spoke of the German “mailed fist.” When he backed Austriaagainst Russia, he talked of Germany in her “shining armour.”The disasters of Russia in Manchuria in 1905 released the spirit of Germanimperialism to bolder aggressions. The fear of a joint attack from France andRussia seemed lifting. The emperor made a kind of regal progress through theHoly Land, landed at Tangier to assure the Sultan of Morocco of his supportagainst the French, and inflicted upon France the crowning indignity ofcompelling her by a threat of war to dismiss Delcassé, her foreign minister. Hedrew tighter the links between Austria and Germany, and in 1908, Austria, withhis support, defied the rest of Europe by annexing from the Turk the Yugo-Slavprovinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. So by his naval challenge to Britain andthese aggressions upon France and the Slavs he forced Britain, France, andRussia into a defensive understanding against him. The Bosnian annexation hadthe further effect of estranging Italy, which had hitherto been his ally.Such was the personality that the evil fate of Germany set over her tostimulate, organize, and render intolerable to the rest of the world the naturalpride and self-assertion of a great people who had at last, after long centuriesof division and weakness, escaped from a jungle of princes to unity and theworld’s respect. It was natural that the commercial and industrial leaders ofthis new Germany who were now getting rich, the financiers intent upon overseasexploits, the officials and the vulgar, should find this leader very much totheir taste. Many Germans who thought him rash or tawdry in their secret hearts,supported him publicly because he had so taking an air of success. Hoch derKaiser!Yet Germany did not yield itself without a struggle to the strong-flowing tideof imperialism. Important elements in German life struggled against thisswaggering new autocracy. The old German nations, and particularly theBavarians, refused to be swallowed up in Prussianism. And with the spread ofeducation and the rapid industrialization of Germany, organized labour developedits ideas and a steady antagonism to the military and patriotic clattering ofits ruler. A new political party was growing up in the state, the SocialDemocrats, professing the doctrines of Marx. In the teeth of the utmostopposition from the official and clerical organizations, and of violentlyrepressive laws against its propaganda and against combinations, this partygrew. The Kaiser denounced it again and again; its leaders were sent to prisonor driven abroad. Still it grew. When he came to the throne it polled not half amillion votes; in 1907 it polled over three million. He attempted to concedemany things, old age and sickness insurance, for example, as a condescendinggift, things which it claimed for the workers as their right. His conversion tosocialism was noted, but it gained no converts to imperialism. His navalambitions were ably and bitterly denounced; the colonial adventures of the newGerman capitalists were incessantly attacked by this party of the common senseof the common man. But to the army, the Social Democrats accorded a moderatesupport, because, much as they detested their home-grown autocrat, they hatedand dreaded the barbaric and retrogressive autocracy of Russia on their easternfrontier more.The danger plainly before Germany was that this swaggering imperialism wouldcompel Britain, Russia, and France into a combined attack upon her, anoffensive-defensive. The Kaiser wavered between a stiff attitude towards Britainand clumsy attempts to propitiate her, while his fleet grew and while heprepared for a preliminary struggle with Russia and France. When in 1913 theBritish government proposed a cessation on either hand of naval construction fora year, it was refused. The Kaiser was afflicted with a son and heir moreHohenzollern, more imperialistic, more Pan-Germanic than his father. He had beennurtured upon imperialist propaganda. His toys had been soldiers and guns. Hesnatched at a premature popularity by outdoing his father’s patriotic andaggressive attitudes. His father, it was felt, was growing middle-aged andover-careful. The Crown Prince renewed him. Germany had never been so strong,never so ready for a new great adventure and another harvest of victories. TheRussians, he was instructed, were decayed, the French degenerate, the British onthe verge of civil war. This young Crown Prince was but a sample of theabounding upper-class youth of Germany in the spring of 1914. They had alldrunken from the same cup. Their professors and teachers, their speakers andleaders, their mothers and sweethearts, had been preparing them for the greatoccasion that was now very nearly at hand. They were full of the tremulous senseof imminent conflict, of a trumpet call to stupendous achievements, of victoryover mankind abroad, triumph over the recalcitrant workers at home. The countrywas taut and excited like an athletic competitor at the end of his training.§ 3Throughout the period of the armed peace Germany was making the pace and settingthe tone for the rest of Europe. The influence of her new doctrines ofaggressive imperialism was particularly strong upon the British mind, which wasill-equipped to resist a strong intellectual thrust from abroad. The educationalimpulse the Prince Consort had given had died away after his death; theuniversities of Oxford and Cambridge were hindered in their task of effectiverevision of upper-class education by the fears and prejudices the so-called“conflict of science and religion” had roused in the clergy who dominated themthrough Convocation; popular education was crippled by religious squabbling, bythe extreme parsimony of the public authorities, by the desire of employers forchild labour, and by individualistic objection to “educating other people’schildren.” The old tradition of the English, the tradition of plain statement,legality, fair play, and a certain measure of republican freedom had fadedconsiderably during the stresses of the Napoleonic wars; romanticism, of whichSir Walter Scott, the great novelist, was the chief promoter, had infected thenational imagination with a craving for the florid and picturesque. “Mr.Briggs,” the comic Englishman of Punch in the fifties and sixties, gettinghimself into highland costume and stalking deer, was fairly representative ofthe spirit of the new movement. It presently dawned upon Mr. Briggs as a richlycoloured and credible fact he had hitherto not observed, that the sun never seton his dominions. The country which had once put Clive and Warren Hastings ontrial for their unrighteous treatment of Indians, was now persuaded to regardthem as entirely chivalrous and devoted figures. They were “empire builders.”Under the spell of Disraeli’s Oriental imagination, which had made QueenVictoria “empress,” the Englishman turned readily enough towards the vagueexaltations of modern imperialism.The perverted ethnology and distorted history which was persuading the mixedSlavic, Keltic, and Teutonic Germans that they were a wonderful race apart, wasimitated by English writers who began to exalt a new ethnological invention, the“Anglo-Saxon.” This remarkable compound was presented as the culmination ofhumanity, the crown and reward of the accumulated effort of Greek and Roman,Egyptian, Assyrian, Jew, Mongol, and such-like lowly precursors of its whitesplendour. The senseless legend of German superiority did much to exacerbate theirritations of the Poles in Posen and the French in Lorraine. The even moreridiculous legend of the superior Anglo-Saxon did not merely increase theirritations of English rule in Ireland, but it lowered the tone of Britishdealings with “subject” peoples throughout the entire world. For the cessationof respect and the cultivation of “superior” ideas are the cessation of civilityand justice.The imitation of German patriotic misconceptions did not end with this“Anglo-Saxon” fabrication. The clever young men at the British universities inthe eighties and nineties, bored by the flatness and insincerities of domesticpolitics, were moved to imitation and rivalry by this new teaching of anarrogant, subtle, and forceful nationalist imperialism, this combination ofMachiavelli and Attila, which was being imposed upon the thought and activitiesof young Germany. Britain, too, they thought, must have her shining armour andwave her good sword. The new British imperialism found its poet in Mr. Kiplingand its practical support in a number of financial and business interests whoseway to monopolies and exploitations was lighted by its glow. These PrussianizingEnglishmen carried their imitation of Germany to the most extraordinary lengths.Central Europe is one continuous economic system, best worked as one; and thenew Germany had achieved a great customs union, a Zollverein of all itsconstituents. It became naturally one compact system, like a clenched fist. TheBritish Empire sprawled like an open hand throughout the world, its membersdifferent in nature, need, and relationship, with no common interest except thecommon guarantee of safety. But the new Imperialists were blind to thatdifference. If new Germany had a Zollverein, then the British Empire must be inthe fashion; and the natural development of its various elements must behampered everywhere by “imperial preferences” and the like. . . .Yet the imperialist movement in Great Britain never had the authority nor theunanimity it had in Germany. It was not a natural product of any of the threeunited but diverse British peoples. It was not congenial to them. Queen Victoriaand her successors, Edward VII and George V, were indisposed, either bytemperament or tradition, to wear “shining armour,” shake “mailed fists,” andflourish “good swords” in the Hohenzollern fashion. They had the wisdom torefrain from any overt meddling with public ideas. And this “British”imperialist movement had from the first aroused the hostility of the largenumber of English, Welsh, Irish, and Scotch writers who refused to recognizethis new “British” nationality or to accept the theory that they were these“Anglo-Saxon” supermen. And many great interests in Britain, and notably theshipping interest, had been built up upon free trade, and regarded the fiscalproposals of the new imperialists, and the new financial and mercantileadventurers with whom they were associated, with a justifiable suspicion. On theother hand, these ideas ran like wildfire through the military class, throughIndian officialdom and the like. Hitherto there had always been somethingapologetic about the army man in England. He was not native to that soil. Herewas a movement that promised to make him as splendidly important as his Prussianbrother in arms. And the imperialist idea also found support in the cheappopular press that was now coming into existence to cater for the new stratum ofreaders created by elementary education. This press wanted plain, bright, simpleideas adapted to the needs of readers who had scarcely begun to think.In spite of such support, and its strong appeal to national vanity, Britishimperialism never saturated the mass of the British peoples. The English are nota mentally docile people, and the noisy and rather forced enthusiasm forimperialism and higher tariffs of the old Tory Party, the army class, thecountry clergy, the music-halls, the assimilated alien, the vulgar rich and thenew large employers, inclined the commoner sort, and particularly organizedlabour, to a suspicious attitude. If the continually irritated sore of theMajuba defeat permitted the country to be rushed into the needless, toilsome,and costly conquest of the Boer republics in South Africa, the strain of thatadventure produced a sufficient reaction towards decency and justice toreinstate the Liberal Party in power, and to undo the worst of that mischief bythe creation of a South African confederation. Considerable advances continuedto be made in popular education, and in the recovery of public interests and thegeneral wealth from the possession of the few. And in these years of the armedpeace, the three British peoples came very near to a settlement, on fairly justand reasonable lines, of their long-standing misunderstanding with Ireland. Thegreat war, unluckily for them, overtook them in the very crisis of this effort.Like Japan, Ireland has figured but little in this Outline of History, and forthe same reason, because she is an extreme island country, receiving much, buthitherto giving but little back into the general drama. Her population is a verymixed one, its basis, and probably its main substance, being of the dark“Mediterranean” strain, pre-Nordic and pre-Aryan, like the Basques and thepeople of Portugal and south Italy. Over this original basis there flowed, aboutthe sixth century B.C.—we do not know to what degree of submergence—a wave ofKeltic peoples, in at least sufficient strength to establish a Keltic language,the Irish Gaelic. There were comings and goings, invasions and counter-invasionsof this and that Keltic or Kelticized people between Ireland, Scotland, Wales,and England. The island was Christianized in the fifth century. Later on theeast coast was raided and settled by Northmen, but we do not know to what extentthey altered the racial quality. The Norman-English came in 1169, in the time ofHenry II and onward. The Teutonic strain may be as strong or stronger than theKeltic in modern Ireland. Hitherto Ireland had been a tribal and barbariccountry, with a few centres of security wherein the artistic tendencies of themore ancient race found scope in metal-work and the illumination of holy books.Now, in the twelfth century, there was an imperfect conquest by the EnglishCrown, and scattered settlements by Normans and English in various parts of thecountry. From the outset profound temperamental differences between the Irishand English were manifest, differences exacerbated by a difference of language,and these became much more evident after the Protestant Reformation. The Englishbecame Protestant; the Irish by a natural reaction rallied about the persecutedCatholic church.The English rule in Ireland had been from the first an intermittent civil wardue to the class of languages and the different laws of land tenure andinheritance of the two peoples. The rebellions, massacres, and subjugations ofthe unhappy island during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I we cannot tell ofhere; but under James came a new discord with the confiscation of large areas ofUlster and their settlement with Presbyterian Scotch colonists. They formed aProtestant community in necessary permanent conflict with the Catholic remainderof Ireland.In the political conflicts during the reign of Charles I and the Commonweal, andof James II and William and Mary, the two sides in English affairs foundsympathizers and allies in the Irish parties. There is a saying in Ireland thatEngland’s misfortune is Ireland’s opportunity, and the English civil troublethat led to the execution of Strafford was the occasion also of a massacre ofthe English in Ireland (1641). Later on Cromwell was to avenge that massacre bygiving no quarter to any men found under arms, a severity remembered by theIrish Catholics with extreme bitterness. Between 1689 and 1691 Ireland was againtorn by civil war. James II sought the support of the Irish Catholics againstWilliam III, and his adherents were badly beaten at the battles of the Boyne(1690) and Aughrim (1691).There was a settlement, the Treaty of Limerick, a disputed settlement in whichthe English Government promised much in the way of tolerance for Catholics andthe like, and failed to keep its promises. Limerick is still a cardinal memoryin the long story of Irish embitterment. Comparatively few English people haveeven heard of this Treaty of Limerick; in Ireland it rankles to this day.The eighteenth century was a century of accumulating grievance. Englishcommercial jealousy put heavy restraints upon Irish trade, and the developmentof a wool industry was destroyed in the south and west. The Ulster Protestantswere treated little better than the Catholics in these matters, and they werethe chief of the rebels. There was more agrarian revolt in the north than in thesouth in the eighteenth century.Let us state as clearly as our space permits the parallelisms and contrasts ofthe British and Irish situation at this time. There was a parliament in Ireland,but it was a Protestant parliament, even more limited and corrupt than thecontemporary British Parliament; there was a considerable civilization in andabout Dublin, and much literary and scientific activity, conducted in Englishand centring upon the Protestant university of Trinity College. This was theIreland of Swift, Goldsmith, Burke, Berkeley, and Boyle. It was essentially apart of the English culture. It had nothing distinctively Irish about it. TheCatholic religion and the Irish language were outcast and persecuted things inthe darkness at this time.It was from this Ireland of the darkness that the recalcitrant Ireland of thetwentieth century arose. The Irish Parliament, its fine literature, its science,all its culture, gravitated naturally enough to London, because they wereinseparably a part of that world. The more prosperous landlords went to Englandto live, and had their children educated there. This meant a steady drain ofwealth from Ireland to England in the form of rent, spent or invested out of thecountry. The increasing facilities of communication steadily enhanced thistendency, depleted Dublin and bled Ireland white. The Act of Union (January 1st,1801) was the natural coalescence of two entirely kindred systems, of theAnglo-Irish Parliament with the British Parliament, both oligarchic, bothpolitically corrupt in the same fashion. There was a vigorous opposition to theUnion on the part not so much of the outer Irish as of Protestants settled inIreland, and a futile insurrection under Robert Emmet in 1803. Dublin, which hadbeen a fine Anglo-Irish city in the middle eighteenth century, was graduallydeserted by its intellectual and political life, and invaded by the outer Irishof Ireland. Its fashionable life became more and more official, centering uponthe Lord Lieutenant in Dublin Castle; its intellectual life flickered and for atime nearly died.075 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_075_r1.gif]But while the Ireland of Swift and Goldsmith was part and lot with the Englandof Pope, Dr. Johnson, and Sir Joshua Reynolds, while there has never been and isnot now any real definable difference except one of geography between the“governing class” in Ireland and in Britain, the Irish underworld and theEnglish underworld were essentially dissimilar. The upward struggle of theEnglish “democracy” to education, to political recognition, was different inmany respects from the struggle of the Irish underworld. Britain was producing agreat industrial population, Protestant or sceptical; she had agriculturallabourers indeed, but no peasants. Ireland, with no coal, with a poorer soil andlandlords who lived in England, had become a land of rent-paying peasants. Theircultivation was allowed to degenerate more and more into a growing of potatoesand a feeding of pigs. The people married and bred; except for the consumptionof whisky when it could be got, and a little fighting, family life was theironly amusement. Here are the appalling consequences. The population of Irelandat which date the weary potato gave way under its ever-growing burthen and therewas a frightful famine. Many died, many emigrated, especially to the UnitedStates; an outflow of emigration began that made Ireland for a time a land ofold people and empty nests.in 1785 was 2,845,932,in 1803 was 5,536,594,in 1845 was 8,295,061,Now because of the Union of the Parliaments, the enfranchisement of the Englishand Irish populations went on simultaneously. Catholic enfranchisement inEngland meant Catholic enfranchisement in Ireland. The British got votes becausethey wanted them; the Irish commonalty got votes because the English did.Ireland was over-represented in the Union Parliament, because originally Irishseats had been easier for the governing class to manipulate than English; and soit came about that this Irish and Catholic Ireland, which had never before hadany political instrument at all, and which had never sought a politicalinstrument, suddenly found itself with the power to thrust a solid body ofmembers into the legislature of Great Britain. After the general election of1874, the old type of venal Irish member was swept aside, and the newlyenfranchised “democracy” of Britain found itself confronted by a strange andperplexing Irish “democracy,” different in its religion, its traditions, and itsneeds, telling a tale of wrongs of which the common English had never heard,clamouring passionately for a separation which they could not understand andwhich impressed them chiefly as being needlessly unfriendly.The national egotism of the Irish is intense; their circumstances have made itintense; they were incapable of considering the state of affairs in England; thenew Irish party came into the British Parliament to obstruct and disorderEnglish business until Ireland became free, and to make themselves a nuisance tothe English. This spirit was only too welcome to the oligarchy which still ruledthe British Empire; they allied themselves with the “loyal” Protestants in thenorth of Ireland—loyal that is to the Imperial Government because of their dreadof a Catholic predominance in Ireland—and they watched and assisted the gradualexasperation of the British common people by this indiscriminate hostility ofthe common people of Ireland.The story of the relation of Ireland to Britain for the last half-century is onethat reflects the utmost discredit upon the governing class of the BritishEmpire, but it is not one of which the English commons need be ashamed. Againand again they have given evidences of goodwill. British legislation in relationto Ireland for nearly half a century shows a series of clumsy attempts on thepart of liberal England, made in the face of a strenuous opposition from theConservative Party and the Ulster Irish, to satisfy Irish complaints and get toa footing of fellowship. The name of Parnell, an Irish Protestant, stands out asthat of the chief leader of the Home Rule movement. In 1886 Gladstone, theliberal British prime minister, brought political disaster upon himself byintroducing the first Irish Home Rule Bill, a genuine attempt to give over Irishaffairs for the first time in history to the Irish people. The bill broke theLiberal Party asunder; and a coalition government, the Unionist Government,replaced that of Mr. Gladstone.This digression into the history of Ireland now comes up to the time ofinfectious imperialism in Europe. The Unionist Government, which ousted Mr.Gladstone, had a predominantly Tory element, and was in spirit “imperialist” asno previous British Government had been. The British political history of thesubsequent years is largely a history of the conflict of the new imperialism,through which an arrogant “British” nationalism sought to override the rest ofthe empire against the temperamental liberalism and reasonableness of theEnglish, which tended to develop the empire into a confederation of free andwilling allies. Naturally the “British” imperialists wanted a subjugated Irish;naturally the English Liberals wanted a free, participating Irish. In 1892Gladstone struggled back to power with a small Home Rule majority; and in 1893his second Home Rule Bill passed the Commons, and was rejected by the Lords. Itwas not, however, until 1895 that an imperialist government took office. Theparty which sustained it was called not Imperialist, but “Unionist”—an odd namewhen we consider how steadily and strenuously it has worked to destroy anypossibility of an Empire commonweal. These Imperialists remained in power forten years. We have already noted their conquest of South Africa. They weredefeated in 1905 in an attempt to establish a tariff wall on the Teutonic model.The ensuing Liberal Government then turned the conquered South African Dutchinto contented fellow-subjects by creating the self-governing Dominion of SouthAfrica. After which it embarked upon a long-impending struggle with thepersistently imperialist House of Lords.This was a very fundamental struggle in British affairs. On the one hand werethe Liberal majority of the people of Great Britain honestly and wisely anxiousto put this Irish affair upon a new and more hopeful footing, and, if possible,to change the animosity of the Irish into friendship; on the other were all thefactors of this new British Imperialism resolved at any cost and in spite ofevery electoral verdict, legally, if possible, but if not, illegally, tomaintain their ascendancy over the affairs of the English, Scotch, and Irish andall the rest of the empire alike. It was, under new names, the age-long internalstruggle of the English community; that same conflict of a free andliberal-spirited commonalty against powerful “big men” and big adventurers andauthoritative persons which we have already dealt with in our account of theliberation of America. Ireland was merely a battleground as America had been. InIndia, in Ireland, in England, the governing class and their associatedadventurers were all of one mind; but the Irish people, thanks to theirreligious difference, had little sense of solidarity with the English. Yet suchIrish statesmen as Redmond, the leader of the Irish party in the House ofCommons, transcended this national narrowness for a time, and gave a generousresponse to English good intentions. Slowly yet steadily the barrier of theHouse of Lords was broken down, and a third Irish Home Rule Bill was brought inby Mr. Asquith, the Prime Minister, in 1912. Throughout 1913 and the early partof 1914 this bill was fought and re-fought through Parliament. At first it gaveHome Rule to all Ireland; but an Amending Act, excluding Ulster on certainconditions, was promised. Thus struggle lasted right up to the outbreak of theGreat War. The royal assent was given to this bill after the actual outbreak ofwar, and also to a bill suspending the coming into force of Irish Home Ruleuntil after the end of the war. These bills were put upon the Statute Book.But from the introduction of the third Home Rule Bill onward, the opposition toit had assumed a violent and extravagant form. Sir Edward Carson, a Dublinlawyer who had become a member of the English Bar, and who had held a legalposition in the ministry of Mr. Gladstone (before the Home Rule split) and inthe subsequent imperialist government, was the organizer and leader of thisresistance to a reconciliation of the two peoples. In spite of his Dublinorigin, he set up to be a leader of the Ulster Protestants; and he brought tothe conflict that contempt for law which is all too common a characteristic ofthe successful barrister, and those gifts of persistent, unqualified, anduncompromising hostility which distinguish a certain type of Irishman. He wasthe most “un-English” of men, dark, romantic, and violent; and from the openingof the struggle he talked with gusto of armed resistance to this freer reunionof the English and Irish which the third Home Rule Bill contemplated. A body ofvolunteers had been organized in Ulster in 1911, arms were now smuggled into thecountry, and Sir Edward Carson and a rising lawyer named F. E. Smith, trapped upin semi-military style, toured Ulster, inspecting these volunteers and inflaminglocal passion. The arms of these prospective rebels were obtained from Germany,and various utterances of Sir Edward Carson’s associates hinted at support from“a great Protestant monarch.” Contrasted with Ulster, the rest of Ireland was atthat time a land of order and decency, relying upon its great leader Redmond andthe good faith of the three British peoples.Now these threats of civil war from Ireland were not in themselves anything veryexceptional in the record of that unhappy island; what makes them significant inthe world’s history at this time is the vehement support they found among theEnglish military and governing classes, and the immunity from punishment andrestraint of Sir Edward Carson and his friends. The virus of reaction which camefrom the success and splendour of German imperialism had spread widely, as wehave explained, throughout the prevalent and prosperous classes in GreatBritain. A generation had grown up forgetful of the mighty traditions of theirforefathers, and ready to exchange the greatness of English fairness and freedomfor the tawdriest of imperialisms. A fund of a million pounds was raised,chiefly in England, to support the Ulster Rebellion, an Ulster ProvisionalGovernment was formed, prominent English people mingled in the fray and careeredabout Ulster in automobiles, assisting in the gun-running, and there is evidencethat a number of British officers and generals were prepared for apronunciamento upon South American lines rather than obedience to the law. Thenatural result of all this upper-class disorderliness was to alarm the main partof Ireland, never a ready friend to England. That Ireland also began in its turnto organize “National Volunteers” and to smuggle arms. The military authoritiesshowed themselves much keener in the suppression of the Nationalist than of theUlster gun importation, and in July, 1914, an attempt to run guns at Howth, nearDublin, led to fighting and bloodshed in the Dublin streets. The British Isleswere on the verge of civil war.Such in outline is the story of the imperialist revolutionary movement in GreatBritain up to the eve of the Great War. For revolutionary this movement of SirEdward Carson and his associates was. It was plainly an attempt to set asideparliamentary government and the slow-grown, imperfect liberties of the Britishpeoples, and, with the assistance of the army, to substitute a more Prussianizedtype of rule, using the Irish conflict as the point of departure. It was thereactionary effort of a few score thousand people to arrest the world movementtowards democratic law and social justice, strictly parallel to and closelysympathetic with the new imperialism of the German junkers and rich men. But inone very important respect British and German imperialism differed. In Germanyit centred upon the crown; its noisiest, most conspicuous advocate was theheir-apparent. In Great Britain the king stood aloof. By no single public actdid King George V betray the slightest approval of the new movement, and thebehaviour of the Prince of Wales, his son and heir, has been equally correct.In August, 1914, the storm of the Great War burst upon the world. In September,Sir Edward Carson was denouncing the placing of the Home Rule Bill upon theStatute Book. On the same day, Mr. John Redmond, the leader of the Irishmajority, the proper representative of Ireland, was calling upon the Irishpeople to take their equal part in the burthen and effort of the war. For a timeIreland played her part in the war side by side with England faithfully andwell, until in 1915 the Liberal Government was replaced by a coalition, inwhich, through the moral feebleness of Mr. Asquith, the prime minister, this SirEdward Carson figured as Attorney-General (with a salary of £7,000 and fees), tobe replaced presently by his associate in the Ulster sedition, Sir F. E. Smith.Grosser insult was never offered to a friendly people. The work ofreconciliation, begun by Gladstone in 1886, and brought so near to completion,in 1914, was completely and finally wrecked.In the spring of 1916 Dublin revolted unsuccessfully against this newgovernment. The ringleaders of this insurrection, many of them mere boys, wereshot with a deliberate and clumsy sternness that, in view of the treatment ofthe Ulster rebel leaders, impressed all Ireland as atrociously unjust. Atraitor, Sir Roger Casement, who had been knighted for previous services to theempire, was tried and executed, no doubt deservedly, but his prosecutor was SirF. E. Smith of the Ulster insurrection, a shocking conjunction. The Dublinrevolt had had little support in Ireland generally, but thereafter the movementfor an independent republic grew rapidly to great proportions. Against thisstrong emotional drive there struggled the more moderate ideas of such Irishstatesmen as Sir Horace Plunkett, who wished to see Ireland become a Dominion, a“crowned republic” that is, within the empire, on an equal footing with Canadaand Australia.When in December, 1919, Mr. Lloyd George introduced his Home Rule Bill into theImperial Parliament there were no Irish members, except Sir Edward Carson andhis followers, to receive it. The rest of Ireland was away. It refused to beginagain that old dreary round of hope and disappointment. Let the British andtheir pet Ulstermen do as they would, said the Irish. . . .§ 4Our studies of modern imperialism in Germany and Britain bring out certainforces common to the two countries, and we shall find these same forces at workin variable degrees and with various modifications in the case of the othergreat modern communities at which we shall now glance. This modern imperialismis not a synthetic world uniting movement like the older imperialism; it isessentially a megalomaniac nationalism, a nationalism made aggressive byprosperity; and always it finds its strongest support in the military andofficial castes, and in the enterprising and acquisitive strata of society, innew money, that is, and big business; its chief critics in the educated poor,and its chief opponents in the peasantry and the labour masses. It acceptsmonarchy where it finds it, but it is not necessarily a monarchist movement. Itdoes, however, need a foreign office of the traditional type for its fulldevelopment. Its origin, which we have traced very carefully in this book of ourhistory, makes this clear. Modern imperialism is the natural development of theGreat Power system which arose with the foreign office method of policy, out ofthe Machiavellian monarchies after the break-up of Christendom. It will onlycome to an end when the intercourse of nations and peoples through embassies andforeign offices is replaced by an assembly of elected representatives in directtouch with their peoples.076 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_076_r1.gif]French imperialism during the period of the Armed Peace in Europe was naturallyof a less confident type than the German. It called itself “nationalism” ratherthan imperialism, and it set itself, by appeals to patriotic pride, to thwartthe efforts of those socialists and rationalists who sought to get into touchwith liberal elements in German life. It brooded upon the Revanche, the returnmatch with Prussia. But in spite of that preoccupation, it set itself to theadventure of annexation and exploitation in the Far East and in Africa, narrowlyescaping a war with Britain upon the Fashoda clash (1898), and it neverrelinquished a dream of acquisitions in Syria. Italy, too, caught theimperialist fever; the blood-letting of Adowa cooled her for a time, and thenshe resumed in 1911 with a war upon Turkey and the annexation of Tripoli. TheItalian imperialists exhorted their countrymen to forget Mazzini and rememberJulius Cæsar; for were they not the heirs of the Roman Empire? Imperialismtouched the Balkans; little countries not a hundred years from slavery began tobetray exalted intentions; King Ferdinand of Bulgaria assumed the title of Tsar,the latest of the pseudo-Cæsars, and in the shop-windows of Athens the curiousstudent could study maps showing the dream of a vast Greek empire in Europe andAsia.In 1913 the three states of Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece fell upon Turkey,already weakened by her war with Italy, and swept her out of all her Europeanpossessions except the country between Adrianople and Constantinople; later inthat year they quarrelled among themselves over the division of the spoils.Rumania joined in the game and helped to crush Bulgaria. Turkey recoveredAdrianople. The greater imperialisms of Austria, Russia, and Italy watched thatconflict and one another. . . .§ 5While all the world to the west of her was changing rapidly, Russia throughoutthe nineteenth century changed very slowly indeed. At the end of the nineteenthcentury, as at its beginning, she was still a Grand Monarchy of the laterseventeenth-century type standing on a basis of barbarism, she was still at astage where court intrigues and imperial favourites could control herinternational relations. She had driven a great railway across Siberia to findthe disasters of the Japanese war at the end of it; she was using modern methodsand modern weapons so far as her undeveloped industrialism and her small supplyof sufficiently educated people permitted; such writers as Dostoievski haddevised a sort of mystical imperialism based on the idea of Holy Russia and hermission, coloured by racial illusions and anti-Semitic passion; but, as eventswere to show, this had not sunken very deeply into the imagination of theRussian masses. A vague, very simple Christianity pervaded the illiteratepeasant life, mixed with much superstition. It was like the pre-reformationpeasant life of France or Germany. The Russian moujik was supposed to worshipand revere his Tsar and to love to serve a gentleman; in 1913 reactionaryEnglish writers were still praising his simple and unquestioning loyalty. But,as in the case of the western European peasant of the days of the peasantrevolts, this reverence for the monarchy was mixed up with the idea that themonarch and the nobleman had to be good and beneficial, and this simple loyaltycould, under sufficient provocation, be turned into the same pitilessintolerance of social injustice that burnt the châteaux in the Jacquerie (seeChapter VI, § 3) and set up the theocracy in Münster (Chapter VI, § 3). Once thecommons were moved to anger, there were no links of understanding in a generallydiffused education in Russia to mitigate the fury of the outbreak. The upperclasses were as much beyond the sympathy of the lower as a different species ofanimal. These Russian masses were three centuries away from such nationalistimperialism as Germany displayed.And in another respect Russia differed from modern Western Europe and paralleledits mediæval phase, and that was in the fact that her universities were theresort of many very poor students quite out of touch and out of sympathy withthe bureaucratic autocracy. Before 1917 the significance of the proximity ofthese two factors of revolution, the fuel of discontent and the match of freeideas, was not recognized in European thought, and few people realized that inRussia more than in any other country lay the possibilities of a fundamentalrevolution.§ 6When we turn from these European Great Powers, with their inheritance of foreignoffices and national policies, to the United States of America, which broke awaycompletely from the Great Power System in 1776, we find a most interestingcontrast in the operation of the forces which produced the expansive imperialismof Europe. For America as for Europe the mechanical revolution had brought allthe world within the range of a few days’ journey. The United States, like theGreat Powers, had world-wide financial and mercantile interests; a greatindustrialism had grown up and was in need of overseas markets; the same crisesof belief that had shaken the moral solidarity of Europe had occurred in theAmerican world. Her people were as patriotic and spirited as any. Why then didnot the United States develop armaments and an aggressive policy? Why was notthe stars and stripes waving over Mexico, and why was there not a new Indiansystem growing up in China under that flag? It was the American who had openedup Japan. After doing so, he had let that power Europeanize itself and becomeformidable without a protest. That alone was enough to make Machiavelli, thefather of modern foreign policy, turn in his grave. If a Europeanized GreatPower had been in the place of the United States, Great Britain would have hadto fortify the Canadian frontier from end to end—it is now absolutelyunarmed—and to maintain a great arsenal in the St. Lawrence. All the dividedstates of Central and South America would long since have been subjugated andplaced under the disciplinary control of United States officials of the“governing class.” There would have been a perpetual campaign to AmericanizeAustralia and New Zealand, and yet another claimant for a share in tropicalAfrica.And by an odd accident America had produced in President Roosevelt (President1901-1908) a man of an energy as restless as the German Kaiser’s, as eager forlarge achievements, as florid and eloquent, an adventurous man with a turn forworld politics and an instinct for armaments, the very man, we might imagine, tohave involved his country in the scramble for overseas possession.There does not appear to be any other explanation of this general restraint andabstinence on the part of the United States except in their fundamentallydifferent institutions and traditions. In the first place the United StatesGovernment has no foreign office and no diplomatic corps of the European type,no body of “experts” to maintain the tradition of an aggressive policy. Thepresident has great powers, but they are subject to the control of the senate,which again is responsible to the state legislatures and the people. The foreignrelations of the country are thus under open and public control. Secret treatiesare impossible under such a system, and foreign powers complain of thedifficulty and uncertainty of “understandings” with the United States, a veryexcellent state of affairs. The United States is2[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en96] constitutionallyincapacitated, therefore, from the kind of foreign policy that has kept Europefor so long constantly on the verge of war.And, secondly, there has hitherto existed in the States no organization for andno tradition of what one may call non-assimilable possessions. Where there is nocrown there cannot be crown colonies. In spreading across the Americancontinent, the United States had developed a quite distinctive method of dealingwith new territories, admirably adapted for unsettled lands, but veryinconvenient if applied too freely to areas already containing an alienpopulation. This method was based on the idea that there cannot be in the UnitedStates system a permanently subject people. The first stage of the ordinaryprocess of assimilation had been the creation of a “territory” under the federalgovernment, having a considerable measure of self-government, sending a delegate(who could not vote) to congress, and destined, in the natural course of things,as the country became settled and population increased, to flower at last intofull statehood. This had been the process of development of all the latterstates of the Union; the latest territories to become states being Arizona andNew Mexico in 1910. The frozen wilderness of Alaska, bought from Russia,remained politically undeveloped simply because it had an insufficientpopulation for state organization. As the annexations of Germany and GreatBritain in the Pacific threatened to deprive the United States navy of coalingstations in that ocean, a part of the Samoan Islands (1889) and the SandwichIslands (Hawaii) were annexed (1898). Here for the first time the United Stateshad real subject populations to deal with. But in the absence of any classcomparable to the Anglo-Indian officials who sway British opinion, the Americanprocedure followed the territorial method. Every effort was made to bring theeducational standards of Hawaii up to the American level, and a domesticlegislature on the territorial pattern was organized so that these duskyislanders seem destined ultimately to obtain full United States citizenship.(The small Samoan Islands are taken care of by a United States navaladministrator.)In 1895 occurred a quarrel between the United States and Britain upon thesubject of Venezuela, and the Monroe Doctrine was upheld stoutly by PresidentCleveland. Then Mr. Olney made this remarkable declaration: “Today the UnitedStates is practically sovereign on this continent, and its fiat is law upon thesubjects to which it confines its interposition.” This, together with thevarious Pan-American congresses that have been held, point to a real open“foreign policy” of alliance and mutual help throughout America. Treaties ofarbitration hold good over all that continent, and the future seems to point toa gradual development of inter-state organization, a Pax Americana, of theEnglish-speaking and Spanish-speaking peoples, the former in the rôle of elderbrother. Here is something we cannot even call an empire, something going farbeyond the great alliance of the British Empire in the open equality of itsconstituent parts.Consistently with this idea of a common American welfare, the United States in1898 intervened in the affairs of Cuba, which had been in a state of chronicinsurrection against Spain for many years. A brief war ended in the acquisitionof Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippine Islands. Cuba is now an independentself-governing republic. Porto Rico and the Philippines have, however, a specialsort of government, with a popularly elected lower house and an upper bodycontaining members appointed by the United States senate. It is improbable thateither Porto Rico or the Philippines will become states in the Union. They aremuch more likely to become free states in some comprehensive alliance with bothEnglish-speaking and Latin America.Both Cuba and Porto Rico welcomed the American intervention in their affairs,but in the Philippine Islands there was a demand for complete and immediatefreedom after the Spanish war, and a considerable resistance to the Americanmilitary administration. There it was that the United States came nearest toimperialism of the Great Power type, and that her record is most questionable.There was much sympathy with the insurgents in the states. Here is the point ofview of ex-President Roosevelt as he wrote it in his Autobiography (1913):“As regards the Philippines, my belief was that we should train them forself-government as rapidly as possible, and then leave them free to decide theirown fate. I did not believe in setting the time-limit within which we would givethem independence, because I did not believe it wise to try to forecast how soonthey would be fit for self-government; and once having made the promise, I wouldhave felt that it was imperative to keep it. Within a few months of my assumingoffice we had stamped out the last armed resistance in the Philippines that wasnot of merely sporadic character; and as soon as peace was secured, we turnedour energies to developing the islands in the interests of the natives. Weestablished schools everywhere; we built roads; we administered an even-bandedjustice; we did everything possible to encourage agriculture and industry; andin constantly increasing measure we employed natives to do their own governing,and finally provided a legislative chamber. . . . We are governing, and havebeen governing, the islands in the interests of the Filipinos themselves. Ifafter due time the Filipinos themselves decide that they do not wish to be thusgoverned, then I trust that we will leave; but when we do leave, it must bedistinctly understood that we retain no protectorate—and above all that we takepart in no joint protectorate—over the islands, and give them no guarantee, ofneutrality or otherwise; that in short, we are absolutely quit of responsibilityfor them, of every kind and description.”This is an entirely different outlook from that of a British or French foreignoffice or colonial office official. But it is not very widely different from thespirit that created the Dominions of Canada, South Africa, and Australia, andbrought forward the three Home Rule Bills for Ireland. It is in the older andmore characteristic English tradition from which the Declaration of Independencederives. It sets aside, without discussion, the detestable idea of “subjectpeoples.”Here we will not enter into political complications attendant upon the making ofthe Panama Canal, for they introduce no fresh light upon this interestingquestion of the American method in world politics. The history of Panama isAmerican history purely. But manifestly just as the internal political structureof the Union was a new thing in the world, so, too, were its relations with theworld beyond its borders.§ 7We have been at some pains to examine the state of mind of Europe and of Americain regard to international relations in the years that led up to the worldtragedy of 1914 because, as more and more people are coming to recognize, thatgreat war or some such war was a necessary consequence of the mentality of theperiod. All the things that men and nations do are the outcome of instinctivemotives reacting upon the ideas which talk and books and newspapers andschoolmasters and so forth have put into people’s heads. Physical necessities,pestilences, changes of climate, and the like outer things may deflect anddistort the growth of human history, but its living root is thought.All human history is fundamentally a history of ideas. Between the man of todayand the Cro-Magnard the physical and mental differences are very slight; theiressential difference lies in the extent and content of the mental backgroundwhich we have acquired in the five or six hundred generations that intervene.We are too close to the events of the Great War to pretend that this Outline canrecord the verdict of history thereupon, but we may hazard the guess that whenthe passions of the conflict have faded, it will be Germany that will be mostblamed for bringing it about, and she will be blamed not because she was morallyand intellectually very different from her neighbours, but because she had thecommon disease of imperialism in its most complete and energetic form. Noself-respecting historian, however superficial and popular his aims may be, cancountenance the legend, produced by the stresses of the war, that the German isa sort of human being more cruel and abominable than any other variety of men.All the great states of Europe before 1914 were in a condition of aggressivenationalism and drifting towards war; the government of Germany did but lead thegeneral movement. She fell into the pit first, and she floun dered deepest. Shebecame the dreadful example at which all her fellow sinners could cry out.For long, Germany and Austria had been plotting an extension of German influenceeastward through Asia Minor to the East. The German idea was crystallized in thephrase “Berlin to Bagdad.” Antagonized to the German dreams were those ofRussia, which was scheming for an extension of the Slav ascendancy toConstantinople and through Serbia to the Adriatic. These lines of ambition layacross one another and were mutually incompatible. The feverish state of affairsin the Balkans was largely the outcome of the intrigues and propagandassustained by the German and Slav schemes. Turkey turned for support to Germany,Serbia to Russia. Rumania and Italy, both Latin in tradition, both nominallyallies of Germany, pursued remoter and deeper schemes in common. Ferdinand, theTsar of Bulgaria, was following still darker ends; and the squalid mysteries ofthe Greek court, whose king was the German Kaiser’s brother-in-law, are beyondour present powers of inquiry.But the tangle did not end with Germany on the one hand and Russia on the other.The greed of Germany in 1871 had made France her inveterate enemy. The Frenchpeople, aware of their inability to recover their lost provinces by their ownstrength, had conceived exaggerated ideas of the power and helpfulness ofRussia. The French people had subscribed enormously to Russian loans. France wasthe ally of Russia. If the German powers made war upon Russia, France wouldcertainly attack them.Now the short eastern French frontier was very strongly defended. There waslittle prospect of Germany repeating the successes of 1870-71 against thatbarrier. But the Belgian frontier of France was longer and less stronglydefended. An attack in overwhelming force on France through Belgium might repeat1870 on a larger scale. The French left might be swung back south-eastwardly onVerdun as a pivot, and crowded back upon its right, as one shuts an open razor.This scheme the German strategists had worked out with great care andelaboration. Its execution involved an outrage upon the law of nations becausePrussia had undertaken to guarantee the neutrality of Belgium and had no quarrelwith her, and it involved the risk of bringing in Great Britain (which power wasalso pledged to protect Belgium) against Germany. Yet the Germans believed thattheir fleet had grown strong enough to make Great Britain hesitate to interfere,and with a view to possibilities they had constructed a great system ofstrategic railways to the Belgian frontier, and made every preparation for theexecution of this scheme. So they might hope to strike down France at one blow,and deal at their leisure with Russia.In 1914 all things seemed moving together in favour of the two Central Powers.Russia, it is true, had been recovering since 1906, but only very slowly; Francewas distracted by financial scandals. The astounding murder of M. Calmette, theeditor of the Figaro, by the wife of M. Caillaux, the minister of finance,brought these to a climax in March; Britain, all Germany was assured, was on theverge of a civil war in Ireland. Repeated efforts were made both by foreign andEnglish people to get some definite statement of what Britain would do ifGermany and Austria assailed France and Russia; but the British ForeignSecretary maintained a front of heavy ambiguity up to the very day of theBritish entry into the war. As a consequence, there was a feeling on thecontinent that Britain would either not fight or delay fighting, and this mayhave encouraged Germany to go on threatening France. Events were precipitated onJune 28th by the assassination, of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, the heir tothe Austrian Empire, when on a state visit to Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia.Here was a timely excuse to set the armies marching. “It is now or never,” saidthe German Emperor. Serbia was accused of instigating the murderers, andnotwithstanding the fact that Austrian commissioners reported that there was noevidence to implicate the Serbian government, the Austro-Hungarian governmentcontrived to press this grievance towards war. On July 23rd Austria dischargedan ultimatum at Serbia, and, in spite of a practical submission on the part ofSerbia, and of the efforts of Sir Edward Grey, the British Foreign Secretary, tocall a conference of the powers, declared war against Serbia on July 28th.Russia mobilized her army on July 30th, and on August 1st Germany declared warupon her. German troops crossed into French territory next day, and,simultaneously with the delivery of an ultimatum to the unfortunate Belgians,the big flanking movement through Luxembourg and Belgium began. Westward rodethe scouts and advance guards. Westward rushed a multitude of automobiles packedwith soldiers. Enormous columns of grey-clad infantry followed; round-eyed, fairyoung Germans they were for the most part—law-abiding, educated youngsters whohad never yet seen a shot fired in anger. “This was war,” they were told. Theyhad to be bold and ruthless. Some of them did their best to carry out thesemilitarist instructions at the expense of the ill-fated Belgians.A disproportionate fuss has been made over the detailed atrocities in Belgium,disproportionate, that is, in relation to the fundamental atrocity of August,1914, which was the invasion of Belgium. Given that, the casual shootings andlootings, the wanton destruction of property, the plundering of inns and of foodand drink shops by hungry and weary men, and the consequent rapes andincendiarism follow naturally enough. Only very simple people believe that anarmy in the field can maintain as high a level of honesty, decency, and justiceas a settled community at home. And the tradition of the Thirty Years’ War stillinfluenced the Prussian army. It has been customary in the countries alliedagainst Germany to treat all this vileness and bloodshed of the Belgian monthsas though nothing of the sort had ever happened before, and as if it were due tosome distinctively evil strain in the German character. They were nicknamed“Huns.” But nothing could be less like the systematic destructions of thesenomads (who once proposed to exterminate the entire Chinese population in orderto restore China to pasture) than the German crimes in Belgium. Much of thatcrime was the drunken brutality of men who for the first time in their liveswere free to use lethal weapons, much of it was the hysterical violence of menshocked at their own proceedings and in deadly fear of the revenge of the peoplewhose country they had outraged, and much of it was done under duress because ofthe theory that men should be terrible in warfare and that populations are bestsubdued by fear. The German common people were bundled from an orderly obedienceinto this war in such a manner that atrocities were bound to ensue. Theycertainly did horrible and disgusting things. But any people who had been workedup for war and led into war as the Germans were, would have behaved in a similarmanner.On the night of August 2nd, while most of Europe, still under the tranquilinertias of half a century of peace, still in the habitual enjoyment of such awidely diffused plenty and cheapness and freedom as no man living will ever seeagain, was thinking about its summer holidays, the little Belgian village ofVisé was ablaze, and stupefied rustics were being led out and shot because itwas alleged someone had fired on the invaders. The officers who ordered theseacts, the men who obeyed, must surely have felt scared at the strangeness of thethings they did. Most of them had never yet seen a violent death. And they hadset light not to a village, but a world. It was the beginning of the end of anage of comfort, confidence, and gentle and seemly behaviour in Europe.077 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_077_r1.gif]So soon as it was clear that Belgium was to be invaded, Great Britain ceased tohesitate, and (at eleven at night on August 4th) declared war upon Germany. Thefollowing day a German mine-laying vessel was caught off the Thames mouth by thecruiser Amphion and sunk,—the first time that the British and Germans had evermet in conflict under their own national flags upon land or water. . . .All Europe still remembers the strange atmosphere of those eventful sunny Augustdays, the end of the Armed Peace. For nearly half a century the Western worldhad been tranquil and had seemed safe. Only a few middle-aged and ageing peoplein France had had any practical experience of warfare. The newspapers spoke of aworld catastrophe, but that conveyed very little meaning to those for whom theworld had always seemed secure, who were indeed almost incapable of thinking ofit as otherwise than secure. In Britain particularly for some weeks thepeace-time routine continued in a slightly dazed fashion. It was like a manstill walking about the world unaware that he has contracted a fatal diseasewhich will alter every routine and habit in his life. People went on with theirsummer holidays; shops reassured their customers with the announcement “businessas usual.” There was much talk and excitement when the newspapers came, but itwas the talk and excitement of spectators who have no vivid sense ofparticipation in the catastrophe that was presently to involve them all.§ 8We will now review very briefly the main phases of the world struggle which hadthus commenced. Planned by Germany, it began with a swift attack designed to“knock out” France while Russia was still getting her forces together in theEast. For a time all went well. Military science is never up to date undermodern conditions, because military men are as a class unimaginative, there arealways at any date undeveloped inventions capable of disturbing current tacticaland strategic practice which the military intelligence has declined. The Germanplan had been made for some years; it was a stale plan; it could probably havebeen foiled at the outset by a proper use of entrenchments and barbed wire andmachine guns, but the French were by no means as advanced in their militaryscience as the Germans, and they trusted to methods of open warfare that were atleast fourteen years behind the times. They had a proper equipment neither ofbarbed wire nor machine guns, and there was a ridiculous tradition that theFrenchman did not fight well behind earthworks. The Belgian frontier wasdefended by the fortress of Liège, ten or twelve years out of date, with fortswhose armament had been furnished and fitted in many cases by Germancontractors; and the French north-eastern frontier was very badly equipped.Naturally the German armament firm of Krupp had provided nutcrackers for thesenuts in the form of exceptionally heavy guns firing high explosive shell. Thesedefences proved therefore to be mere traps for their garrisons. The Frenchattacked and failed in the southern Ardennes. The German hosts swung round theFrench left with an effect of being irresistible; Liège fell on August 9th,Brussels was reached on August 20th, and the small British army of about 70,000,which had arrived in Belgium, was struck at Mons (August 22nd) in overwhelmingforce, and driven backward in spite of the very deadly rifle tactics it hadlearnt during the South African War. The little British force was pushed asidewestward, and the German right swept down so as to leave Paris to the west andcrumple the entire French army back upon itself.So confident was the German higher command at this stage of having won the war,that by the end of August German troops were already being withdrawn for theEastern front, where the Russians were playing havoc in East and West Prussia.And then came the French counter-attack, strategically a very swift andbrilliant counter-attack. The French struck back on their centre, they producedan unexpected army on their left, and the small British army, shaken butreinforced, was still fit to play a worthy part in the counter-stroke. TheGerman right overran itself, lost its cohesion, and was driven back from theMarne to the Aisne (Battle of the Marne, September 6th to 10th). It would havebeen driven back farther had it not had the art of entrenchment in reserve. Uponthe Aisne it stood and dug itself in. The heavy guns, the high explosive shell,the tanks, needed by the allies to smash, up these entrenchments, did not yetexist.The Battle of the Marne shattered the original German plan. For a time Francewas saved. But the German was not defeated; he had still a great offensivesuperiority in men and equipment. His fear of the Russian in the east had beenrelieved by a tremendous victory at Tannenberg. His next phase was a headlong,less elaborately planned campaign to outflank the left of the allied armies andto seize the Channel ports and cut off supplies coming from Britain to France.Both armies extended to the west in a sort of race to the coast. Then theGermans, with a great superiority of guns and equipment, struck at the Britishround and about Ypres. They came very near to a break through, but the Britishheld them.The war on the Western front settled down to trench warfare. Neither side hadthe science and equipment needed to solve the problem of breaking through modernentrenchments and entanglements, and both sides were now compelled to resort toscientific men, inventors, and such-like unmilitary persons for counsel and helpin their difficulty. At that time the essential problem of trench warfare hadalready been solved; there existed in England, for instance, the model of atank, which would have given the allies a swift and easy victory before 1916;but the professional military mind is by necessity an inferior and unimaginativemind; no man of high intellectual quality would willingly imprison his gifts insuch a calling; nearly all supremely great soldiers have been eitherinexperienced fresh-minded young men like Alexander, Napoleon, and Hoche,politicians turned soldiers like Julius Cæsar, nomads like the Hun and Mongolcaptains, or amateurs like Cromwell and Washington; whereas this war after fiftyyears of militarism was a hopelessly professional war; from first to last it wasimpossible to get it out of the hands of the regular generals, and neither theGerman nor allied headquarters was disposed to regard an invention withtoleration that would destroy their traditional methods. The tank was not onlydisagreeably strange to these military gentlemen, but it gave an unprofessionalprotection to the common soldiers within it. The Germans, however, did make someinnovations. In February (28) they produced a rather futile novelty, the flameprojector, the user of which was in constant danger of being burnt alive, and inApril, in the midst of a second great offensive upon the British (second Battleof Ypres, April 17th to May 17th), they employed a cloud of poison gas. Thishorrible device was used against Algerian and Canadian troops; it shook them bythe physical torture it inflicted, and by the anguish of those who died, but itfailed to break through them. For some weeks chemists were of more importancethan soldiers on the allied front, and within six weeks the defensive troopswere already in possession of protective methods and devices.078 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_078_r1.gif]For a year and a half, until July, 1916, the Western front remained in a stateof indecisive tension. There were heavy attacks on either side that ended inbloody repulses. The French made costly but glorious thrusts at Arras and inChampagne in 1915, the British at Loos. From Switzerland to the North Sea thereran two continuous lines of entrenchment, sometimes at a distance of a mile ormore, sometimes at a distance of a few feet (at Arras e.g.), and in and behindthese lines of trenches millions of men toiled, raided their enemies, andprepared for sanguinary and foredoomed offensives. In any preceding age thesestagnant masses of men would have engendered a pestilence inevitably, but hereagain modern science had altered the conditions of warfare. Certain noveldiseases appeared, trench feet for instance, caused by prolonged standing incold water, new forms of dysentery, and the like, but none developed to anextent to disable either combatant force. Behind this front the whole life ofthe belligerent nations was being turned more and more to the task ofmaintaining supplies of food, munitions, and, above all, men to supply theplaces of those who day by day were killed or mangled. The Germans had had theluck to possess a considerable number of big siege guns intended for thefrontier fortresses; these were now available for trench smashing with highexplosive, a use no one had foreseen for them. The Allies throughout the firstyears were markedly inferior in their supply of big guns and ammunition, andtheir losses were steadily greater than the German. Mr. Asquith, the BritishPrime Minister, though a very fine practitioner in all the arts of Parliament,was wanting in creative ability; and it is probably due to the push and hustleof Mr. Lloyd George (who presently ousted him in December, 1916) and the clamourof the British press that this inferiority of supplies was eventually rectified.There was a tremendous German onslaught upon the French throughout the firsthalf of 1916 round and about Verdun. The Germans suffered enormous losses andwere held, after pushing in the French lines for some miles. The French losseswere as great or greater. “Ils ne passeront pas,” said and sang the Frenchinfantry—and kept their word.The Eastern German front was more extended and less systematically entrenchedthan the Western. For a time the Russian armies continued to press westward inspite of the Tannenberg disaster. They conquered nearly the whole of Galiciafrom the Austrians, took Lemberg on September 2nd, 1914, and the great fortressof Przemysl on March 22nd, 1915. But after the Germans had failed to break theWestern front of the Allies, and after an ineffective Allied offensive madewithout proper material, they turned to Russia, and a series of heavy blows,with a novel use of massed artillery, were struck first in the south and then atthe north of the Russian front. On June 22nd, Przemysl was retaken, and thewhole Russian line was driven back until Vilna (September 2nd) was in Germanhands.In May, 1915 (23rd), Italy joined the allies, and declared war upon Austria.(Not until a year later did she declare war on Germany.) She pushed over hereastern boundary towards Goritzia (which fell in the summer of 1916), but herintervention was of little use at that time to either Russia or the two Westernpowers. She merely established another line of trench warfare among the highmountains of her picturesque north-eastern frontier.While the main fronts of the chief combatants were in this state of exhaustivedeadlock, both sides were attempting to strike round behind the front of theiradversaries. The Germans made a series of Zeppelin, and later of aeroplane raidsupon Paris and the east of England. Ostensibly these aimed at depôts, munitionworks, and the like targets of military importance, but practically they bombedpromiscuously at inhabited places. At first these raiders dropped not veryeffective bombs, but later the size and quality of these missiles increased,considerable numbers of people were killed and injured, and very much damage wasdone. The English people were roused to a pitch of extreme indignation by theseoutrages. Although the Germans had possessed Zeppelins for some years, no one inauthority in Great Britain had thought out the proper methods of dealing withthem, and it was not until late in 1916 that an adequate supply of anti-aircraftguns was brought into play and that these raiders were systematically attackedby aeroplanes. Then came a series of Zeppelin disasters, and after the spring of1917 they ceased to be used for any purpose but sea scouting, and their place asraiders was taken by large aeroplanes (the Gothas). The visits of these lattermachines to London and the east of England became systematic after the summer of1917. All through the winter of 1917-18, London on every moonlight night becamefamiliar with the banging of warning maroons, the shrill whistles of the policealarm, the hasty clearance of the streets, the distant rumbling of scores andhundreds of anti-aircraft guns growing steadily to a wild uproar of thuds andcrashes, the swish of flying shrapnel, and at last, if any of the raiders gotthrough the barrage, with the dull heavy bang of the bursting bombs. Thenpresently, amidst the diminuendo of the gunfire would come the inimitablerushing sound of the fire brigade engines and the hurry of the ambulances. . . .War was brought home to every Londoner by these experiences.While the Germans were thus assailing the nerve of their enemy home populationthrough the air, they were also attacking the overseas trade of the British byevery means in their power. At the outset of the war they had various tradedestroyers scattered over the world, and a squadron of powerful modern cruisersin the Pacific, namely, the Scharnhorst, the Gneisenau, the Leipzig, theNürnberg, and the Dresden. Some of the detached cruisers, and particularly theEmden, did a considerable amount of commerce destroying before they were hunteddown, and the main squadron caught an inferior British force off the coast ofChile and sank the Good Hope and the Monmouth on November 1st, 1914. A monthlater these German ships were themselves pounced upon by a British force, andall (except the Dresden) sunk by Admiral Sturdee in the Battle of the FalklandIsles. After this conflict the allies remained in undisputed possession of thesurface of the sea, a supremacy which the great naval Battle of Jutland (May1st, 1916) did nothing to shake. The Germans concentrated their attention moreand more upon submarine warfare. From the beginning of the war they had hadconsiderable submarine successes. On one day, September 22nd, 1914, they sankthree powerful cruisers, the Aboukir, the Hogue, and the Cressy, with 1,473 men.They continued to levy a toll upon British shipping throughout the war; at firstthey hailed and examined passenger and mercantile shipping, but this practicethey discontinued for fear of traps, and in the spring of 1915 they began tosink ships without notice. In May, 1915, they sank the great passenger liner,the Lusitania, without any warning, drowning a number of American citizens. Thisembittered American feeling against them, but the possibility of injuring andperhaps reducing Britain by a submarine blockade was so great, that theypersisted in a more and more intensified submarine campaign, regardless of thedanger of dragging the United States into the circle of their enemies.Meanwhile, Turkish forces, very ill-equipped, were making threatening gesturesat Egypt across the desert of Sinai.And while the Germans were thus striking at Britain, their least accessible andmost formidable antagonist, through the air and under the sea, the French andBritish were also embarking upon a disastrous flank attack in the east upon theCentral Powers through Turkey. The Gallipoli campaign was finely imagined, butdisgrace-fully executed. Had it succeeded, the Allies would have capturedConstantinople in 1915. But the Turks were given two months’ notice of theproject by a premature bombardment of the Dardanelles in February, the schemewas also probably betrayed through the Greek Court, and when at last British andFrench forces were landed upon the Gallipoli peninsula in April, they found theTurks well entrenched and better equipped for trench warfare than themselves.The Allies trusted for heavy artillery to the great guns of the ships, whichwere comparatively useless for battering down entrenchments, and among everyother sort of thing that they had failed to foresee, they had not foreseenhostile submarines. Several great battleships were lost; they went down in thesame clear waters over which the ships of Xerxes had once sailed to their fateat Salamis. The story of the Gallipoli campaign from the side of the Allies isat once heroic and pitiful, a story of courage and incompetence, and of life,material, and prestige wasted, culminating in a withdrawal in January, 1916.Linked up closely with the vacillation of Greece was the entry of Bulgaria intothe war (October 12th, 1915). The king of Bulgaria had hesitated for more than ayear to make any decision between the two sides. Now the manifest failure of theBritish at Gallipoli, coupled with a strong Austro-German attack in Serbia,swung him over to the Central Powers. While the Serbs were hotly engaged withthe Austro-German invaders upon the Danube he attacked Serbia in the rear, andin a few weeks the country had been completely overrun. The Serbian army made aterrible retreat through the mountains of Albania to the coast, where itsremains were rescued by an Allied fleet.An Allied force landed at Salonika in Greece, and pushed inland towardsMonastir, but was unable to render any effectual assistance to the Serbians. Itwas the Salonika plan which sealed the fate of the Gallipoli expedition.To the east, in Mesopotamia, the British, using Indian troops chiefly, made astill remoter flank attack upon the Central Powers. An army, very ill providedfor the campaign, was landed at Basra in the November of 1914, and pushed uptowards Bagdad in the following year. It gained a victory at Ctesiphon, theancient Arsacid and Sassanid capital within twenty-five miles of Bagdad, but theTurks were heavily reinforced, there was a retreat to Kut, and there the Britisharmy, under General Townshend, was surrounded and starved into surrender onApril 29th, 1916.All these campaigns in the air, under the seas, in Russia, Turkey, and Asia,were subsidiary to the main front, the front of decision, between Switzerlandand the sea; and there the main millions lay entrenched, slowly learning thenecessary methods of modern scientific warfare. There was a rapid progress inthe use of the aeroplane. At the outset of the war this had been used chieflyfor scouting, and by the Germans for the dropping of marks for the artillery.Such a thing as aerial fighting was unheard of. In 1916 the aeroplanes carriedmachine guns and fought in the air; their bombing work was increasinglyimportant, they had developed a wonderful art of aerial photography, and all theaerial side of artillery work, both with aeroplanes and observation balloons,had been enormously developed. But the military mind was still resisting the useof the tank, the obvious weapon for decision in trench warfare.Many intelligent people outside military circles understood this quite clearly.The use of the tank against trenches was an altogether obvious expedient.Leonardo da Vinci invented an early tank, but what military “expert” has everhad the wits to study Leonardo? Soon after the South African War, in 1903, therewere stories in magazines describing imaginary battles in which tanks figured,and a complete working model of a tank made by Mr. J. A. Corry of Leeds, wasshown to the British military authorities —who of course rejected it—in 1911.Tanks had been invented and re-invented before the war began. But had the matterrested entirely in the hands of the military, there would never have been anyuse of tanks. It was Mr. Winston Churchill, who was at the British Admiralty in1915-16, who insisted upon the manufacture of the first tanks, and it was in theteeth of the grimmest opposition that they were sent to France. To the Britishnavy, and not to the army, military science owes the use of these devices. TheGerman military authorities were equally set against them. In July, 1916, SirDouglas Haig, the British commander-in-chief, began a great offensive whichfailed to break through the German line. In some places he advanced a few miles;in others he was completely defeated. There was a huge slaughter of the newBritish armies. And he did not use tanks.In September, when the season was growing too late for a sustained offensive,tanks first appeared in warfare. A few were put into action by the British in anot very intelligent fashion. Their effect upon the German was profound, theyproduced something like a panic, and there can be little doubt that had theybeen used in July in sufficient numbers and handled by a general of imaginationand energy, they would have ended the war there and then. At that time theAllies were in greater strength than the Germans upon the Western front. Theodds were roughly seven to four. Russia, though fast approaching exhaustion, wasstill fighting, Italy was pressing the Austrians hard, and Rumania was justentering the war on the side of the Allies. But the waste of men in thisdisastrous July offensive, and the incompetence of the British military command,brought the Allied cause to the very brink of disaster.Directly the British failure of July had reassured the Germans, they turned onthe Rumanians, and the winter of 1916 saw the same fate overtake Rumania thathad fallen upon Serbia in 1915. The year that had begun with the retreat fromGallipoli and the surrender of Kut, ended with the crushing of Rumania and withvolleys fired at a landing party of French and British marines by a royalistcrowd in the port of Athens. It looked as though King Constantine of Greecemeant to lead his people in the footsteps of King Ferdinand of Bulgaria. But thecoast-line of Greece is one much exposed to naval action. Greece was blockaded,and a French force from Salonika joined hands with an Italian force from Valonato cut the king of Greece off from his Central European friends.(In July, 1917, Constantine was forced to abdicate by the Allies, and his sonAlexander was made king in his place.)On the whole, things looked much less dangerous for the Hohenzollern imperialismat the end of 1916 than they had done after the failure of the first great rushat the Marne. The Allies had wasted two years of opportunity. Belgium, Serbia,and Rumania, and large areas of France and Russia, were occupied byAustro-German troops. Counterstroke after counterstroke had failed, and Russiawas now tottering towards a collapse. Had Germany been ruled with any wisdom,she might have made a reasonable peace at this time. But the touch of successhad intoxicated her imperialists. They wanted not safety, but triumph, not worldwelfare, but world empire. “World power or downfall” was their formula; it gavetheir antagonists no alternative but a fight to a conclusive end.§ 9Early in 1917 Russia collapsed.By this time the enormous strain of the war was telling hardly upon all theEuropean populations. There had been a great disorganization of transporteverywhere, a discontinuance of the normal repairs and replacements of shipping,railways, and the like, a using-up of material of all sorts, a dwindling of foodproduction, a withdrawal of greater and greater masses of men from industry, acessation of educational work, and a steady diminution of the ordinarysecurities and honesties of life. Nowhere was the available directive abilitycapable of keeping a grip upon affairs in the face of the rupture of habitualbonds and the replacement of the subtle disciplines of peace by the clumsybrutalities of military “order.” More and more of the European population wasbeing transferred from surroundings and conditions to which it was accustomed,to novel circumstances which distressed, stimulated, and demoralized it. ButRussia suffered first and most from this universal pulling up of civilizationfrom its roots. The Russian autocracy was dishonest and incompetent. The Tsar,like several of his ancestors, had now given way to a crazy pietism, and thecourt was dominated by a religious impostor, Rasputin, whose cult was one ofunspeakable foulness, a reeking scandal in the face of the world. Beneath therule of this dirty mysticism, indolence and scoundrelism mismanaged the war. TheRussian common soldiers were sent into battle without guns to support them,without even rifle ammunition; they were wasted by their officers and generalsin a delirium of militarist enthusiasm. For a time they seemed to be sufferingmutely as the beasts suffer; but there is a limit to the endurance even of themost ignorant. A profound disgust for the Tsardom was creeping through thesearmies of betrayed and wasted men. From the close of 1915 onwards Russia was asource of deepening anxiety to her Western allies. Throughout 1916 she remainedlargely on the defensive, and there were rumours of a separate peace withGermany. She gave little help to Rumania.On December 29th, 1916, the monk Rasputin was murdered at a dinner-party inPetrograd, and a belated attempt was made to put the Tsardom in order. By Marchthings were moving rapidly; food riots in Petrograd developed into arevolutionary insurrection; there was an attempted suppression of the Duma, therepresentative body, attempted arrests of liberal leaders, the formation of aprovisional government under Prince Lvoff, and an abdication (March 15th) by theTsar. For a time it seemed that a moderate and controlled revolution might bepossible—perhaps under a new Tsar. Then it became evident that the destructionof confidence in Russia had gone too far for any such adjustments. The Russianpeople were sick to death of the old order of things in Europe, of Tsars and ofwars and great powers; it wanted relief, and that speedily, from unendurablemiseries. The Allies had no understanding of Russian realities; theirdiplomatists were ignorant of Russian, genteel persons, with their attentiondirected to the Russian Court rather than Russia, they blundered steadily withthe new situation. There was little goodwill among the diplomatists forrepublicanism, and a manifest disposition to embarrass the new government asmuch as possible. At the head of the Russian republican government was aneloquent and picturesque leader, Kerensky, who found himself assailed by thedeep forces of a profounder revolutionary movement, the “social revolution,” athome and cold-shouldered by the Allied governments abroad. His allies wouldneither let him give the Russian people land nor peace beyond their frontiers.The French and the British press pestered their exhausted ally for a freshoffensive, but when presently the Germans made a strong attack by sea and landupon Riga, the British Admiralty quailed before the prospect of a Balticexpedition in relief. The new Russian republic had to fight unsupported. Inspite of their great naval predominance and the bitter protests of the greatEnglish admiral, Lord Fisher (1841-1920), it is to be noted that the Allies,except for some submarine attacks, left the Germans the complete mastery of theBaltic throughout the war.The Russian masses were resolute to end the war. There had come into existencein Petrograd a body representing the workers and common soldiers, the Soviet,and this body clamoured for an international conference of socialists atStockholm. Food riots were occurring in Berlin at this time, war weariness inAustria and Germany was profound, and there can be little doubt, in the light ofsubsequent events, that such a conference would have precipitated a reasonablepeace on democratic lines in 1917 and a German revolution. Kerensky implored hisWestern allies to allow this conference to take place, but, fearful of aworld-wide outbreak of socialism and republicanism, they refused, in spite ofthe favourable response of a small majority of the British Labour Party. Withouteither moral or physical help from the Allies, the “moderate” Russian republicstill fought on and made a last desperate offensive effort in July. It failedafter some preliminary successes and another great slaughtering of Russians.The limit of Russian endurance was reached. Mutinies broke out in the Russianarmies, and particularly upon the northern front, and upon November 7th, 1917,Kerensky’s government was overthrown and power was seized by the SovietGovernment, dominated by the Bolshevik socialists under Lenin, and pledged tomake peace regardless of the Western powers. Russia passed definitely “out ofthe war.”In the spring of 1917 there had been a costly and ineffective French attack uponthe Champagne front which had failed to break through and sustained enormouslosses. Here, then, by the end of 1917, was a phase of events altogetherfavourable to Germany, had her government been fighting for security andwell-being rather than for pride and victory. But to the very end, to the pitchof final exhaustion, the people of the Central Powers were held to the effort torealize an impossible world imperialism.To that end it was necessary that Britain should be not merely resisted, butsubjugated, and in order to do that Germany had already dragged America into thecircle of her enemies. Throughout 1916 the submarine campaign had been growingin intensity, but hitherto it had respected neutral shipping. In January, 1917,a completer “blockade” of Great Britain and France was proclaimed, and allneutral powers were warned to withdraw their shipping from the British seas. Anindiscriminate sinking of the world’s shipping began which compelled the UnitedStates to enter the war in April (6th) 1917. Throughout 1917, while Russia wasbreaking up and becoming impotent, the American people were changing swiftly andsteadily into a great military nation. And the unrestricted submarine campaignfor which the German imperialists had accepted the risk of this freshantagonist, was far less successful than had been hoped. The British navy proveditself much more inventive and resourceful than the British army; there was arapid development of anti-submarine devices under water, upon the surface, andin the air; and after a month or so of serious destruction, the tale ofsubmarine sinkings declined. The British found it necessary to put themselvesupon food rations; but the regulations were well framed and ably administered,the public showed an excellent spirit and intelligence, and the danger of famineand social disorder was kept at arm’s length.Yet the German imperial government persisted in its course. If the submarine wasnot doing all that had been expected, and if the armies of America gathered likea thunder-cloud, yet Russia was definitely down; and in October the same sort ofautumn offensive that had overthrown Serbia in 1915 and Rumania in 1916 was nowturned with crushing effect against Italy. The Italian front collapsed after theBattle of Caporetto, and the Austro-German armies poured down into Venetia andcame almost within gunfire of Venice. Germany felt justified, therefore, intaking a high line with the Russian peace proposals, and the peace of BrestLitovsk (March 2nd, 1918) gave the Western allies some intimation of what aGerman victory would mean to them. It was a crushing and exorbitant peace,dictated with the utmost arrogance of confident victors.All through the winter German troops had been shifting from the Eastern to theWestern front, and now, in the spring of 1918, the jaded enthusiasm of hungry,weary, and bleeding Germany was lashed up for the one supreme effort that wasreally and truly to end the war. For some months American troops had been inFrance, but the bulk of the American army was still across the Atlantic. It washigh time for the final conclusive blow upon the Western front, if such a blowwas ever to be delivered. The first attack was upon the British in the Sommeregion. The not very brilliant cavalry generals who were still in command of afront upon which cavalry was a useless encumbrance were caught napping; and onMarch 21st, in “Gough’s Disaster,” the fifth British army was driven back indisorder. The jealousies of the British and French generals had prevented anyunified command of the Allied armies in France, and there was no general reservewhatever behind Gough. Thousands of guns were lost, and scores of thousands ofprisoners. Many of these losses were due to the utter incompetence of the highercommand. No less than a hundred tanks were abandoned because they ran out ofpetrol! The British were driven back almost to Amiens. Throughout April and Maythe Germans rained offensives on the Allied front. They came near to a breakthrough in the north, and they made a great drive back to the Marne, which theyreached again on May 30th, 1918.This was the climax of the German effort. Behind it was nothing but an exhaustedhomeland. The Allied politicians intervened in the quarrels of theirprofessional soldiers, and Marshal Foch was put in supreme command of all theAllied armies. Fresh troops were hurrying from Britain across the Channel, andAmerica was now pouring men into France by the hundred thousand. In June theweary Austrians made a last effort in Italy, and collapsed before an Italiancounter-attack. Early in June Foch began to develop a counter-attack in theMarne angle. By July the tide was turning, and the Germans were reeling back.The Battle of Château Thierry (July 18th) proved the quality of the new Americanarmies. In August the British opened a great and successful thrust into Belgium,and the bulge of the German lines towards Amiens wilted and collapsed. Germanyhad finished. The fighting spirit passed out of her army, and October was astory of defeat and retreat along the entire Western front. Early in NovemberBritish troops were in Valenciennes and Americans in Sedan. In Italy also theAustrian armies were in a state of disorderly retreat. But everywhere now theHohenzollern and Habsburg forces were collapsing. The smash at the end wasamazingly swift. Frenchmen and Englishmen could not believe their newspapers asday after day they announced the capture of more hundreds of guns and morethousands of prisoners.In September a great allied offensive against Bulgaria had produced a revolutionin that country and peace proposals. Turkey had followed with a capitulation atthe end of October, and Austro-Hungary on November 4th. There was an attempt tobring out the German Fleet for a last fight, but the sailors mutinied (November7th).The Kaiser and the Crown Prince bolted hastily, and without a scrap of dignity,into Holland. On November 11th an armistice was signed and the war was at anend. . . .For four years and a quarter the war had lasted, and gradually it had drawnnearly everyone in the Western world, at least, into its vortex. Upwards of tenmillions of people had been actually killed through the fighting, another twentyor twenty-five million had died through the hardships and disorders entailed.Scores of millions were suffering and enfeebled by under-nourishment and misery.A vast proportion of the living were now engaged in war work, in drilling andarmament, in making munitions, in hospitals, in working as substitutes for menwho had gone into the armies and the like. Business men had been adaptingthemselves to the more hectic methods necessary for profit in a world in a stateof crisis. The war had become, indeed, an atmosphere, a habit of life, a newsocial order. Then suddenly it ended.079 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_079_r1.gif]In London the armistice was proclaimed about midday on November 11th. Itproduced a strange cessation of every ordinary routine. Clerks poured out oftheir offices and would not return, assistants deserted their shops, omnibusdrivers and the drivers of military lorries set out upon journeys of their owndevising with picked-up loads of astounded and cheering passengers going nowherein particular and careless whither they went. Vast vacant crowds presentlychoked the streets, and every house and shop that possessed such adornments hungout flags. When night came, many of the main streets, which had been kept indarkness for many months because of the air raids, were brightly lit. It wasvery strange to see thronging multitudes assembled in an artificial light again.Everyone felt aimless, with a kind of strained and aching relief. It was over atlast. There would be no more killing in France, no more air raids—and thingswould get better. People wanted to laugh, and weep—and could do neither. Youthsof spirit and young soldiers on leave formed thin noisy processions that shovedtheir way through the general drift, and did their best to make a jollification.A captured German gun was hauled from the Mall, where a vast array of suchtrophies had been set out, into Trafalgar Square, and its carriage burnt. Squibsand crackers were thrown about. But there was little concerted rejoicing. Nearlyeveryone had lost too much and suffered too much to rejoice with any fervour.080 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_080_r1.gif]§ 10The world in the year after the great war was like a man who has had some vitalsurgical operation very roughly performed, and who is not yet sure whether hecan now go on living or whether he has not been so profoundly shocked andinjured that he will presently fall down and die. It was a world dazed andstunned. German militarist imperialism had been defeated, but at an overwhelmingcost. It had come very near to victory. Everything went on, now that the strainof the conflict had ceased, rather laxly, rather weakly, and with a gusty anduncertain temper. There was a universal hunger for peace, a universal desire forthe lost safety and liberty and prosperity of pre-war times, without any powerof will to achieve and secure these things.Just as with the Roman Republic under the long strain of the Punic War, so nowthere had been a great release of violence and cruelty, and a profounddeterioration in financial and economic morality. Generous spirits hadsacrificed themselves freely to the urgent demands of the war, but the sly andbase of the worlds of business and money had watched the convulsiveopportunities of the time and secured a firm grip upon the resources andpolitical power of their countries. Everywhere men who would have been regardedas shady adventurers before 1914 had acquired power and influence while bettermen toiled unprofitably. Such men as Lord Rhondda, the British food controller,killed themselves with hard work, while the war profiteer waxed rich and securedhis grip upon press and party organization.In the course of the war there had been extraordinary experiments in collectivemanagement in nearly all the belligerent countries. It was realized that thecommon expedients of peace-time commerce, the higgling of the market, theholding out for a favourable bargain, were incompatible with the swift needs ofwarfare. Transport, fuel, food supply, and the distribution of the raw materialsnot only of clothing, housing, and the like, but of everything needed for warmunitions, had been brought under public control. No longer had farmers beenallowed to under-farm; cattle had been put upon deer-parks and grasslandsploughed up, with or without the owner’s approval. Luxury building andspeculative company promotion had been restrained. In effect, a sort ofemergency socialist state had been established throughout belligerent Europe. Itwas rough-and-ready and wasteful, but it was more effective than the tangledincessant profit-seeking, the cornering and forestalling and incoherentproductiveness of “private enterprise.”In the earlier years of the war there was a very widespread feeling ofbrotherhood and the common interest in all the belligerent states. The commonmen were everywhere sacrificing life and health for what they believed to be thecommon good of the state. In return, it was promised, there would be less socialinjustice after the war, a more universal devotion to the common welfare. InGreat Britain, for instance, Mr. Lloyd George was particularly insistent uponhis intention to make the after-war Britain “a land fit for heroes.” Heforeshadowed the continuation of this new war communism into the peace period indiscourses of great fire and beauty. In Great Britain, there was created aMinistry of Reconstruction, which was understood to be planning a new and moregenerous social order, better labour conditions, better housing, extendededucation, a complete and scientific revision of the economic system. Similarhopes of a better world sustained the common soldiers of France and Germany andItaly. It was premature disillusionment that caused the Russian collapse. Sothat two mutually dangerous streams of anticipation were running through theminds of men in Western Europe towards the end of the war. The rich andadventurous men, and particularly the new war profiteers, were making theirplans to prevent such developments as that air transport should become a stateproperty, and to snatch back manufactures, shipping, land transport, the publicservices generally, and the trade in staples from the hands of the commonwealinto the grip of private profit; they were securing possession of newspapers andbusying themselves with party caucuses and the like to that end; while themasses of common men were looking forward naïvely to a new state of societyplanned almost entirely in their interest and according to generous generalideas. The history of 1919 is largely the clash of these two streams ofanticipation. There was a hasty selling off, by the “business” government incontrol, of every remunerative public enterprise to private speculators. . . .By the middle of 1919 the labour masses throughout the world were manifestlydisappointed and in a thoroughly bad temper. The British “Minister ofReconstruction” and its foreign equivalents were exposed as a soothing sham. Thecommon man felt he had been cheated. There was to be no reconstruction, but onlya restoration of the old order—in the harsher form necessitated by the povertyof the new time.For four years the drama of the war had obscured the social question which hadbeen developing in the Western civilizations throughout the nineteenth century.Now that the war was over, this question reappeared gaunt and bare, as it hadnever been seen before.And the irritations and hardships and the general insecurity of the new timewere exacerbated by a profound disturbance of currency and credit. Money, acomplicated growth of conventions rather than a system of values, had beendeprived within the belligerent countries of the support of a gold standard.Gold had been retained only for international trade, and every government hadproduced excessive quantities of paper money for domestic use. With the breakingdown of the war-time barriers the international exchange became a wildlyfluctuating confusion, a source of distress to everyone except a few gamblersand wily speculators. Prices rose and rose—with an infuriating effect upon thewage-earner. On the one hand was the employer resisting his demands for morepay; on the other hand, food, house-room, and clothing were being steadilycornered against him. And, which was the essential danger of the situation, hehad lost any confidence he had ever possessed that any patience or industrialwillingness he displayed would really alleviate the shortages and inconveniencesby which he suffered.In the speeches of politicians towards the close of 1919 and the spring of 1920,there was manifest an increasing recognition of the fact that what is called thecapitalist system—the private ownership system that is, in which private profitis the working incentive—was on its trial. It had to produce general prosperity,they admitted, or it had to be revised. It is interesting to note such a speechas that of Mr. Lloyd George, the British premier, delivered on Saturday,December 6th, 1919. Mr. Lloyd George had had the education and training of aWelsh solicitor; he entered politics early, and in the course of a brilliantparliamentary career he had had few later opportunities for reading and thought.But being a man of great natural shrewdness, he was expressing here veryaccurately the ideas of the more intelligent of the business men and wealthy menand ordinary citizens who supported him.“There is a new challenge to civilization,” he said. “What is it? It isfundamental. It affects the whole fabric of society as we know it; its commerce,its trade, its industry, its finance, its social order—all are involved in it.There are those who maintain that the prosperity and strength of the countryhave been built up by the stimulating and invigorating appeal to individualimpulse, to individual action. That is one view. The State must educate; theState must assist where necessary; the State must control where necessary; theState must shield the weak against the arrogance of the strong; but the lifesprings from individual impulse and energy. (Cheers.) That is one view. What isthe other? That private enterprise is a failure, tried, and found wanting—acomplete failure, a cruel failure. It must be rooted out, and the community musttake charge as a community, to produce, to distribute, as well as to control.“Those are great challenges for us to decide. We say that the ills of privateenterprise can be averted. They say, ‘No, they cannot. No ameliorative, nopalliative, no restrictive, no remedial measure will avail. These evils areinherent in the system. They are the fruit of the tree, and you must cut itdown.’ That is the challenge we hear ringing through the civilized world today,from ocean to ocean, through valley and plain. You hear it in the whining andmaniacal shrieking of the Bolshevists. You hear it in the loud, clear, but morerestrained tones of Congresses and Conferences. The Bolshevists would blow upthe fabric with high explosive, with horror. Others would pull down with thecrowbars and with cranks—especially cranks. (Laughter.)“Unemployment, with its injustice for the man who seeks and thirsts foremployment, who begs for labour and cannot get it, and who is punished forfailure he is not responsible for by the starvation of his children—that tortureis something that private enterprise ought to remedy for its own sake. (Cheers.)Sweating, slums, the sense of semi-slavery in labour, must go. We must cultivatea sense of manhood by treating men as men. If I—and I say this deliberately—if Ihad to choose between this fabric I believe in, and allowing millions of men andwomen and children to rot in its cellars, I would not hesitate one hour. That isnot the choice. Thank God it is not the choice. Private enterprise can producemore, so that all men get a fair share of it. . . .”3[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en97]Here, put into quasi-eloquent phrasing, and with a jest adapted to the mentalhabits of the audience, we have the common-sense view of the ordinary prosperousman not only of Great Britain, but of America or France or Italy or Germany. Inquality and tone it is a fair sample of British political thought in 1919. Theprevailing economic system has made us what we are, is the underlying idea; andwe do not want any process of social destruction to precede a renascence ofsociety, we do not want to experiment with the fundamentals of our social order.Let us accept that. Adaptation, Mr. Lloyd George admitted, there had to be. Nowthis occasion of his speaking was a year and a month after the Armistice, andfor all that period private enterprise had been failing to do all that Mr. LloydGeorge was so cheerfully promising it would do. The community was in urgent needof houses. Throughout the war there had been a cessation not only of building,but of repairs. The shortage of houses in the last months of 1919 amounted toscores of thousands in Britain alone.4[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en98] Multitudes of people wereliving in a state of exasperating congestion, and the most shamelessprofiteering in apartments and houses was going on. It was a difficult, but notan impossible situation. Given the same enthusiasm and energy and self-sacrificethat had tided over the monstrous crisis of 1916, the far easier task ofproviding a million houses could have been performed in a year or so. But therehad been corners in building materials, transport was in a disordered state, andit did not pay private enterprise to build houses at any rents within the meansof the people who needed them. Private enterprise, therefore, so far frombothering about the public need of housing, did nothing but corner and speculatein rents and sub-letting. It now demanded grants in aid from the State—in orderto build at a profit. And there was a great crowding and dislocation of goods atthe depôts because there was insufficient road transport. There was an urgentwant of cheap automobiles to move about goods and workers. But privateenterprise in the automobile industry found it far more profitable to producesplendid and costly cars for those whom the war had made rich. The munitionfactories built with public money could have been converted very readily intofactories for the mass production of cheap automobiles, but private enterprisehad insisted upon these factories being sold by the State, and would neithermeet the public need itself nor let the State do so. So, too, with the world inthe direst discomfort for need of shipping, private enterprise insisted upon theshutting down of the newly constructed State shipyards. Currency was dislocatedeverywhere, but private enterprise was busy buying and selling francs or marksand intensifying the trouble. While Mr. George was making the verycharacteristic speech we have quoted, the discontent of the common man wasgathering everywhere, and little or nothing was being done to satisfy his needs.It was becoming very evident that unless there was to be some profound change inthe spirit of business, under an unrestrained private enterprise system therewas little or no hope, in Europe at any rate, of decent housing, clothing, oreducation for the workers for two or three generations.These are facts that the historian of mankind is obliged to note with as littlecomment as possible. Private enterprise in Europe in 1919 and 1920 displayedneither will nor capacity for meeting the crying needs of the time. So soon asit was released from control, it ran naturally into speculation, cornering, andluxury production. It followed the line of maximum profit. It displayed no senseof its own dangers; and it resisted any attempt to restrain and moderate itsprofits and make itself serviceable, even in its own interest. And this went onin the face of the most striking manifestations of the extreme recalcitrance onthe part of the European masses to the prolonged continuance of the privationsand inconveniences they suffered. In 1913 these masses were living as they hadlived since birth; they were habituated to the life they led. The masses of1919, on the other hand, had been uprooted everywhere, to go into the armies, togo into munition factories, and so on. They had lost their habits ofacquiescence, and they were hardier and more capable of desperate action. Greatmultitudes of men had gone through such brutalizing training as, for instancebayonet drill; they had learnt to be ferocious, and to think less either ofkilling or being killed. Social unrest had become, therefore, much moredangerous. Everything seemed to point to a refusal to tolerate the current stateof affairs for many years. Unless the educated and prosperous and comfortablepeople of Europe could speedily get their private enterprise under sufficientrestraint to make it work well and rapidly for the common good, unless theycould develop the idea of business as primarily a form of public service and notprimarily a method of profit-making, unless they could in their own interestachieve a security of peace that would admit of a cessation not only of warpreparation, but of international commercial warfare, strike and insurrectionpromised to follow strike and insurrection up to a complete social and politicalcollapse. It was not that the masses had or imagined that they had the plan of anew social, political, and economic system. They had not, and they did notbelieve they had. The defects we have pointed out in the socialist scheme(Chapter X, § 5) were no secret from them. It was a much more dangerous state ofaffairs than that. It was that they were becoming so disgusted with the currentsystem, with its silly luxury, its universal waste, and its general misery, thatthey did not care what happened afterward so long as they could destroy it. Itwas a return to a state of mind comparable to that which had rendered possiblethe debacle of the Roman Empire.Already in 1919 the world had seen one great community go that way, the Russianpeople. The Russians overturned the old order and submitted to the autocraticrule of a small group of doctrinaire Bolshevik socialists, because these menseemed to have something new to try. They wrecked the old system, and at anycost they would not have it back. The information available from Russia at thetime of writing this summary is still too conflicting and too obviously taintedby propagandist aims for us to form any judgment upon the proceedings andmethods of the Soviet Government, but it is very plain that from November, 1917,Russia has not only endured that government and its mainly socialistic methods,but has fought for it successfully against anything that seemed to threaten areturn to the old régime.We have already (§ 5) pointed out the very broad differences between the Russianand the Western communities, and the strong reasons there are for doubting thatthey will move upon parallel lines and act in similar ways. The Russian peasantswere cut off by want of education and sympathy from the small civilizedcommunity of prosperous and educated people which lived upon them. These latterwere a little separate nation. The peasants below, under the really quite alienincitement of the Bolshevik socialists, have thrown that separate nation off anddestroyed it. In the towns, and in the towns alone, communism rules (1920); therest of Russia is now no more than a wilderness of barbaric peasantry. But thereis much more unity of thought and feeling between class and class in the Westthan in Russia, and particularly in the Atlantic communities. Even if theywrangle, classes can talk together and understand each other. There is nounbroken stratum of illiterates. The groups of rich and speculative men, the“bad men” in business and affairs, whose freedoms are making the very name of“private enterprise” stink in the nostrils of the ordinary man, are only themore active section of very much larger classes, guilty perhaps of indolence andself-indulgence, but capable of being roused to a sense not merely of thewickedness but of the danger of systematic self-seeking in a strained,impoverished, and sorely tried world.In one way or another it seems inevitable now that the new standard ofwell-being which the mechanical revolution of the last century has renderedpossible, should become the general standard of life. Revolution is conditionalupon public discomfort. Social peace is impossible without a rapid ameliorationof the needless discomforts of the present time. A rapid resort to willingservice and social reconstruction on the part of those who own and rule, or elsea world-wide social revolution leading towards an equalization of conditions andan attempt to secure comfort on new and untried lines, seem now to be the onlyalternatives before mankind. The choice which route shall be taken lies, webelieve, in western Europe, and still more so in America, with the educated,possessing, and influential classes. The former route demands much sacrifice,for prosperous people in particular, a voluntary assumption of public duties anda voluntary acceptance of class discipline and self-denial; the latter may takean indefinite time to traverse, it will certainly be a very destructive andbloody process, and whether it will lead to a new and better state of affairs atlast is questionable. A social revolution, if ultimately the Western EuropeanStates blunder into it, may prove to be a process extending over centuries; itmay involve a social breakdown as complete as that of the Roman Empire, and itmay necessitate as slow a recuperation.§ 11We have dealt with the social and economic disorder of the European communities,and the rapid return of the “class-war” to the foreground of attention, beforegiving any account of the work of world settlement that centred on the PeaceConference at Paris, because the worried and preoccupied state of everyoneconcerned with private problems of income, prices, employment, and the like goesfar to explain the jaded atmosphere in which that Conference addressed itself tothe vast task before it.The story of the Conference turns very largely upon the adventure of oneparticular man, one of those men whom accident or personal quality picks out asa type to lighten the task of the historian. We have in the course of thishistory found it very helpful at times to focus our attention upon someindividual, Buddha, Alexander the Great, Yuan Chwang, the Emperor Frederick IIand Charles V and Napoleon I for example, and to let him by reflectionilluminate the period in which he lived. The conclusion of the Great War can beseen most easily as the rise of the American President, President Wilson, topredominant importance in the world’s hopes and attention, and his failure tojustify that predominance.President Wilson (born 1856) had previously been a prominent student and teacherof history, constitutional law, and the political sciences generally. He hadheld various professorial chairs, and had been President of Princeton University(New Jersey). There is a long list of books to his credit, and they show a mindrather exclusively directed to American history and American politics. He wasmentally the new thing in history, negligent of and rather ignorant of the olderthings out of which his new world had arisen. He retired from academic life, andwas elected Democratic Governor of New Jersey in 1910. In 1913 he became theDemocratic presidential candidate, and as a consequence of a violent quarrelbetween ex-President Roosevelt and President Taft, which split the dominantRepublican party, he became President of the United States.The events of August, 1914, seem to have taken President Wilson, like the restof his fellow-countrymen, by surprise. We find him cabling an offer of hisservices as a mediator on August 3rd. Then, for a time, he and America watchedthe conflict. At first neither the American people nor their President seem tohave had a very clear or profound understanding of that long-gatheredcatastrophe. Their tradition for a century had been to disregard the problems ofthe Old World, and it was not to be lightly changed. The imperialistic arroganceof the German Court and the stupid inclination of the German militaryauthorities towards melodramatic “frightfulness,” their invasion of Belgium,their cruelties there, their use of poison gas, and the nuisance of theirsubmarine campaign, created a deepening hostility to Germany in the UnitedStates as the war proceeded; but the tradition of political abstinence and thedeep-rooted persuasion that America possessed a political morality altogethersuperior to European conflicts, restrained the President from activeintervention. He adopted a lofty tone. He professed to be unable to judge thecauses and justice of the Great War. It was largely his high pacific attitudethat secured his re-election as President for a second term. But the world isnot to be mended by merely regarding evil-doers with an expression of ratherundiscriminating disapproval. By the end of 1916 the Germans had been encouragedto believe that under no circumstances whatever would the United States fight,and in 1917 they began their unrestricted submarine warfare and the sinking ofAmerican ships without notice. President Wilson and the American people weredragged into the war by this supreme folly. And also they were dragged into areluctant attempt to define their relations to Old World politics in some otherterms than those of mere aloofness. Their thoughts and temper changed veryrapidly. They came into the war side by side with the Allies, but not in anypact with the Allies. They came into the war, in the name of their own moderncivilization, to punish and end an intolerable political and military situation.Slow and belated judgments are sometimes the best judgments. In a series of“notes,” too long and various for detailed treatment in this Outline, thinkingaloud, as it were, in the hearing of all mankind, President Wilson sought tostate the essential differences of the American State from the Great Powers ofthe Old World. We have been at some pains in this history to make plain thedevelopment of these differences. He unfolded a conception of internationalrelationships that came like a gospel, like the hope of a better world, to thewhole eastern hemisphere. Secret agreements were to cease, “nations” were todetermine their own destinies, militarist aggression was to cease, the seawayswere to be free to all mankind. These commonplaces of American thought, thesesecret desires of every sane man, came like a great light upon the darkness ofanger and conflict in Europe. At last, men felt, the ranks of diplomacy werebroken, the veils of Great Power “policy” were rent in twain. Here withauthority, with the strength of a powerful new nation behind it, was the desireof the common man throughout the world, plainly said.Manifestly there was needed some over-riding instrument of government toestablish world law and maintain these broad and liberal generalizations uponhuman intercourse. A number of schemes had floated in men’s minds for theattainment of that end. In particular there was a movement for some sort ofworld league, a “League of Nations.” The American President adopted this phraseand sought to realize it. An essential condition of the peace he sought throughthe overthrow of German imperialism was, he declared, to be this federal organ.This League of Nations was to be the final court of appeal in internationalaffairs. It was to be the substantial realization of the peace. Here again heawakened a tremendous echo.President Wilson was the spokesman of a new age. Throughout the war, and forsome little time after it had ended, he held, so far as the Old World wasconcerned, that exalted position. But in America, where they knew him better,there were doubts. And writing as we do now with the wisdom of subsequentevents, we can understand these doubts. America, throughout a century and moreof detachment and security, had developed new ideals and formulæ of politicalthought, without realizing with any intensity that, under conditions of stressand danger, these ideals and formulæ might have to be passionately sustained. Toher community many things were platitudes that had to the Old World communities,entangled still in ancient political complications, the quality of a savinggospel. President Wilson was responding to the thought and conditions of his ownpeople and his own country, based on a liberal tradition that had first foundits full expression in English speech; but to Europe and Asia he seemed to bethinking and saying, for the first time in history, things hitherto undevelopedand altogether secret. And that misconception he may have shared.We are dealing here with an able and successful professor of political science,who did not fully realize what he owed to his contemporaries and the literaryand political atmosphere he had breathed throughout his life; and who passedvery rapidly, after his re-election as President, from the mental attitudes of apolitical leader to those of a Messiah. His “notes” are a series of explorationsof the elements of the world situation. When at last, in his address to Congressof January 8th, 1918, he produced his Fourteen Points as a definite statement ofthe American peace intentions, they were, as a statement, far better in theirspirit than in their arrangement and matter. This document demanded openagreements between nations and an end to secret diplomacy, free navigation ofthe high seas, free commerce, disarmament, and a number of politicalreadjustments upon the lines of national independence. Finally in the FourteenthPoint it required “a general association of nations” to guarantee the peace ofthe world.These Fourteen Points had an immense reception throughout the world. Here atlast seemed a peace for reasonable men everywhere, as good and acceptable tohonest and decent Germans and Russians, as to honest and decent Frenchmen andEnglishmen and Belgians; and for some months the whole world was lit by faith inWilson. Could they have been made the basis of a world settlement in 1919, theywould forthwith have opened a new and more hopeful era in human affairs.But, as we must tell, they did not do that. There was about President Wilson acertain egotism; there was in the generation of people in the United States towhom this great occasion came, a generation born in security, reared in plentyand, so far as history goes, in ignorance, a generation remote from the tragicissues that had made Europe grave, a certain superficiality and lightness ofmind. It was not that the American people were superficial by nature andnecessity, but that they had never been deeply stirred by the idea of a humancommunity larger than their own. It was an intellectual but not a moralconviction, with them. One had on the one hand these new people of the newworld, with their new ideas, their finer and better ideas, of peace and worldrighteousness, and on the other the old, bitter, deeply entangled peoples of theGreat Power system; and the former were crude and rather childish in theirimmense inexperience, and the latter were seasoned and bitter and intricate. Thetheme of this clash of the raw idealist youthfulness of a new age with theexperienced ripeness of the old, was treated years ago by that great novelist,Henry James, in a very typical story called Daisy Miller. It is the patheticstory of a frank, trustful, high-minded, but rather simple-minded American girl,with a real disposition towards righteousness and a great desire for a “goodtime,” and how she came to Europe and was swiftly entangled and put in thewrong, and at last driven to welcome death by the complex tortuousness andobstinate limitations of the older world. There have been a thousand variants ofthat theme in real life, a thousand such transAtlantic tragedies, and the storyof President Wilson is one of them. But it is not to be supposed, because thenew thing succumbs to the old infections, that is the final condemnation of thenew thing.081 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_081_r1.gif]Probably no fallible human being manifestly trying to do his best amidstoverwhelming circumstances has been subjected to such minute, searching, andpitiless criticism as President Wilson. He is blamed, and it would seem that heis rightly blamed, for conducting the war and the ensuing peace negotiations onstrictly party lines. He remained the President representing the AmericanDemocratic Party, when circumstances conspired to make him the representative ofthe general interests of mankind. He made no attempt to forget party issues fora time, and to incorporate with himself such great American leaders asex-President Roosevelt, ex-President Taft, and the like. He did not draw fullyupon the moral and intellectual resources of the States; he made the whole issuetoo personal, and he surrounded himself with merely personal adherents. And astill graver error was his decision to come to the Peace Conference himself.Nearly every experienced critic seems to be of opinion that he should haveremained in America, in the rôle of America, speaking occasionally as if anation spoke. Throughout the concluding years of the war he had by that methodachieved an unexampled position in the world.Says. Dr. Dillon:5 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en99] “Europe,when the President touched its shores, was as clay ready for the creativepotter. Never before were the nations so eager to follow a Moses who would takethem to the long-promised land where wars are prohibited and blockades unknown.And to their thinking he was that great leader. In France men bowed down beforehim with awe and affection. Labour leaders in Paris told me that they shed tearsof joy in his presence, and that their comrades would go through fire and waterto help him to realize his noble schemes. To the working classes in Italy hisname was a heavenly clarion at the sound of which the earth would be renewed.The Germans regarded him and his humane doctrine as their sheet-anchor ofsafety. The fearless Herr Muehlon said: ‘If President Wilson were to address theGermans, and pronounce a severe sentence upon them, they would accept it withresignation and without a murmur and set to work at once.’ In German-Austria hisfame was that of a saviour, and the mere mention of his name brought balm to thesuffering and surcease of sorrow to the afflicted. . . .”082 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_082_r1.gif]Such was the overpowering expectation of the audience to which President Wilsonprepared to show himself. He reached France on board the George Washington inDecember, 1918.He brought his wife with him. That seemed no doubt a perfectly natural andproper thing to an American mind. Quite a number of the American representativesbrought their wives. Unhappily a social quality, nay, almost a tourist quality,was introduced into the world settlement by these ladies. Transport facilitieswere limited, and most of them arrived in Europe with a radiant air ofprivilege. They came as if they came to a treat. They were, it was intimated,seeing Europe under exceptionally interesting circumstances. They would visitChester, or Warwick, or Windsor en route—for they might not have a chance ofseeing these celebrated places again. Important interviews would be broken offto get in a visit to some “old historical mansion.” This may seem a trivialmatter to note in a History of Mankind, but it was such small human things asthis that threw a miasma of futility over the Peace Conference of 1919. In alittle while one discovered that Wilson, the Hope of Mankind, had vanished, andthat all the illustrated fashion papers contained pictures of a delightedtourist and his wife, grouped smilingly with crowned heads and such-likeenviable company. . . . It is so easy to be wise after the event, and toperceive that he should not have come over.The men he had chiefly to deal with, for example M. Clemenceau (France), Mr.Lloyd George and Mr. Balfour (Britain), Baron Sonnino and Signor Orlando(Italy), were men of widely dissimilar historical traditions. But in one respectthey resembled him and appealed to his sympathies. They, too, were partypoliticians, who had led their country through the war. Like himself they hadfailed to grasp the necessity of entrusting the work of settlement to morespecially qualified men. “They were the merest novices in international affairs.Geography, ethnology, psychology, and political history were sealed books tothem. Like the Rector of Louvain University, who told Oliver Goldsmith that, ashe had become the head of that institution without knowing Greek, he failed tosee why it should be taught there, the chiefs of State, having obtained thehighest position in their respective countries without more than an inkling ofinternational affairs, were unable to realize the importance of mastering themor the impossibility of repairing the omission as they went along. . . .”6[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en100] “What they lacked, however,might in some perceptible degree have been supplied by enlisting as theirhelpers men more happily endowed than themselves. But they deliberately chosemediocrities. It is a mark of genial spirits that they are well served, but theplenipotentiaries of the Conference were not characterized by it. Away in thebackground some of them had familiars or casual prompters to whose counsels theywere wont to listen, but many of the adjoints who moved in the limelight of theworld-stage were gritless and pithless.083 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_083_r1.gif]“As the heads of the principal Governments implicitly claimed to be theauthorized spokesmen of the human race, and endowed with unlimited powers, it isworth noting that this claim was boldly challenged by the people’s organs in thePress. Nearly all the journals read by the masses objected from the first to thedictatorship of the group of Premiers, Mr. Wilson being excepted. . . .”7[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en101]The restriction upon our space in this Outline will not allow us to tell herehow the Peace Conference shrank from a Council of Ten to a Council of Four(Wilson, Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and Orlando), and how it became a conferenceless and less like a frank and open discussion of the future of mankind, andmore and more like some old-fashioned diplomatic conspiracy. Great and wonderfulhad been the hopes that had gathered to Paris. “The Paris of the Conference,”says Dr. Dillon, “ceased to be the capital of France. It became a vastcosmopolitan caravanserai teeming with unwonted aspects of life and turmoil,filled with curious samples of the races, tribes, and tongues of four continentswho came to watch and wait for the mysterious tomorrow.“An Arabian Nights’ touch was imparted to the dissolving panorama by strangevisitants from Tartary and Kurdistan, Korea and Aderbeijan, Armenia, Persia, andthe Hedjaz—men with patriarchal beards and scimitar-shaped noses, and othersfrom desert and oasis, from Samarkand and Bokhara. Turbans and fezes, sugar-loafhats and head-gear resembling episcopal mitres, old military uniforms devisedfor the embryonic armies of new states on the eve of perpetual peace,snowy-white burnouses, flowing mantles, and graceful garments like the Romantoga, contributed to create an atmosphere of dreamy unreality in the city wherethe grimmest of realities were being faced and coped with.“Then came the men of wealth, of intellect, of industrial enterprise, and theseed-bearers of the ethical new ordering, members of economic committees fromthe United States, Britain, Italy, Poland, Russia, India, and Japan,representatives of naphtha industries and far-off coal mines, pilgrims, fanaticsand charlatans from all climes, priests of all religions, preachers of everydoctrine, who mingled with princes, field-marshals, statesmen, anarchists,builders-up and pullers-down. All of them burned with desire to be near to thecrucible in which the political and social systems of the world were to bemelted and recast. Every day, in my walks, in my apartment, or at restaurants, Imet emis saries from lands and peoples whose very names had seldom been heard ofbefore in the West. A delegation from the Pont-Euxine Greeks called on me, anddiscoursed of their ancient cities of Trebizond, Samsoun, Tripoli, Kerassund, inwhich I resided many years ago, and informed me that they, too, desired tobecome welded into an independent Greek Republic, and had come to have theirclaims allowed. The Albanians were represented by my old friend Turkhan Pasha,on the one hand, and by my friend Essad Pasha on the other—the former desirousof Italy’s protection, the latter demanding complete independence. Chinamen,Japanese, Koreans, Hindus, Kirghizes, Lesghiens, Circassians, Mingrelians,Buryats, Malays, and Negroes and Negroids from Africa and America were among thetribes and tongues foregathered in Paris to watch the rebuilding of thepolitical world system and to see where they ‘came in.’ . . .”To this thronging, amazing Paris, agape for a new world, came President Wilson,and found its gathering forces dominated by a personality narrower, in every waymore limited and beyond comparison more forcible than himself: the FrenchPremier, M. Clemenceau. At the instance of President Wilson, M. Clemenceau waselected President of the Conference. “It was,” said President Wilson, “a specialtribute to the sufferings and sacrifices of France.” And that, unhappily,sounded the keynote of the Conference, whose sole business should have been withthe future of mankind.Georges Benjamin Clemenceau was an old journalist politician, a great denouncerof abuses, a great upsetter of governments, a doctor who had, while a municipalcouncillor, kept a free clinic, and a fierce, experienced duellist. None of hisduels ended fatally, but he faced them with great intrepidity. He had passedfrom the medical school to republican journalism in the days of the Empire. Inthose days he was an extremist of the left. He was for a time a teacher inAmerica, and he married and divorced an American wife. He was thirty in theeventful year 1871. He returned to France after Sedan, and flung himself intothe stormy politics of the defeated nation with great fire and vigour.Thereafter France was his world, the France of vigorous journalism,high-spirited personal quarrels, challenges, confrontations, scenes, dramaticeffects, and witticisms at any cost. He was what people call “fierce stuff,” hewas nicknamed the “Tiger,” and he seems to have been rather proud of hisnickname. Professional patriot rather than statesman and thinker, this was theman whom the war had flung up to misrepresent the fine mind and the generousspirit of France. His limitations had a profound effect upon the conference,which was further coloured by the dramatic resort for the purpose of signatureto the very Hall of Mirrors at Versailles in which Germany had triumphed andproclaimed her unity. There the Germans were to sign. To M. Clemenceau and toFrance, in that atmosphere, the war ceased to seem a world war; it was merelythe sequel of the previous conflict of the Terrible Year, the downfall andpunishment of offending Germany. “The world had to be made safe for democracy,”said President Wilson. That from M. Clemenceau’s expressed point of view was“talking like Jesus Christ.” The world had to be made safe for Paris. “Talkinglike Jesus Christ” seemed a very ridiculous thing to many of those brilliantrather than sound diplomatists and politicians who made the year 1919 supreme inthe history of human insufficiency.(Another flash of the “Tiger’s” wit, it may be noted, was that President Wilsonwith his fourteen points was “worse” than God Almighty. “Le bon Dieu” only hadten. . . .)M. Clemenceau sat with Signor Orlando in the more central chairs of a semicircleof four in front of the fire, says Keynes. He wore a black frock-coat and greysuede gloves, which he never removed during these sessions. He was, it is to benoted, the only one of these four reconstructors of the world who couldunderstand and speak both French and English.The aims of M. Clemenceau were simple and in a manner attainable. He wanted allthe settlement of 1871 undone. He wanted Germany punished as though she was auniquely sinful nation and France a sinless martyr land. He wanted Germany socrippled and devastated as never more to be able to stand up to France. Hewanted to hurt and humiliate Germany more than France had been hurt andhumiliated in 1871. He did not care if in breaking Germany Europe was broken;his mind did not go far enough beyond the Rhine to understand that possibility.He accepted President Wilson’s League of Nations as an excellent proposal if itwould guarantee the security of France whatever she did, but he preferred abinding alliance of the United States and England to maintain, uphold, andglorify France under practically any circumstances. He wanted wideropportunities for the exploitation of Syria, North Africa, and so forth byParisian financial groups. He wanted indemnities to recuperate France, loans,gifts, and tributes to France, glory and homage to France. France had suffered,and France had to be rewarded. Belgium, Russia, Serbia, Poland, Armenia,Britain, Germany, and Austria had all suffered too, all mankind had suffered,but what would you? That was not his affair. These were the supers of a drama inwhich France was for him the star. . . . In much the same spirit Signor Orlandoseems to have sought the welfare of Italy.Mr. Lloyd George brought to the Council of Four the subtlety of a Welshman, theintricacy of a European, and an urgent necessity for respecting the nationalistegotism of the British imperialists and capitalists who had returned him topower. Into the secrecy of that council went President Wilson with the verynoblest aims for his newly discovered American world policy, his rather hastilycompiled Fourteen Points, and a project rather than a scheme for a League ofNations.“There can seldom have been a statesman of the first rank more incompetent thanthe President in the agilities of the Council Chamber.” From the whisperingdarknesses and fireside disputes of that council, and after various comings andgoings we cannot here describe, he emerged at last with his Fourteen Pointspitifully torn and dishevelled, but with a little puling infant of a League ofNations, which might die or which might live and grow —no one could tell. Thishistory cannot tell. We are at the end of our term. But that much, at least, hehad saved. . . .§ 12This homunculus in a bottle which it was hoped might become at last Man rulingthe Earth, this League of Nations as it was embodied in the Covenant of April28th, 1919, was not a league of peoples at all; it was the world discovered, aleague of “states, dominions, or colonies.” It was stipulated that these shouldbe “fully self-governing,” but there was no definition whatever of this phrase.There was no bar to a limited franchise and no provision for any direct controlby the people of any state. India figured—presumably as a “fully self-governingstate!” An autocracy would no doubt have been admissible as a “fullyself-governing” democracy with a franchise limited to one person. The League ofthe Covenant of 1919 was, in fact, a league of “representatives” of foreignoffices, and it did not even abolish the nonsense of embassies at every capital.The British Empire appeared once as a whole, and then India (!) and the fourdominions of Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand appeared asseparate sovereign states. The Indian representative was, of course, sure to bemerely a British nominee; the other four would be colonial politicians. But ifthe British Empire was to be thus dissected, a representative of Great Britainshould have been substituted for the Imperial representative, and Ireland andEgypt should also have been given representation. Moreover, either New YorkState or Virginia was historically and legally almost as much a sovereign stateas New Zealand or Canada. The inclusion of India raised logical claims forFrench Africa and French Asia. One French representative did propose a separatevote for the little principality of Monaco.There was to be an assembly of the League in which every member state was to berepresented and to have an equal voice, but the working directorate of theLeague was to vest in a Council, which was to consist of the representatives ofthe United States, Britain, France, Italy, and Japan, with four other memberselected by the Assembly. The Council was to meet once a year; the gatherings ofthe Assembly were to be at “stated intervals,” not stated.Except in certain specified instances the league of this Covenant could makeonly unanimous decisions. One dissentient on the council could bar anyproposal—on the lines of the old Polish liberum veto (Chapter VII, § 7). Thiswas a quite disastrous provision. To many minds it made the Covenant Leaguerather less desirable than no league at all. It was a complete recognition ofthe unalienable sovereignty of states, and a repudiation of the idea of anoverriding commonweal of mankind. This provision practically barred the way toall amendments to the league constitution in future except by the clumsyexpedient of a simultaneous withdrawal of the majority of member states desiringa change, to form the league again on new lines. The covenant made inevitablesuch a final winding-up of the league it created, and that was perhaps the bestthing about it.The following powers, it was proposed, should be excluded from the originalleague: Germany, Austria, Russia, and whatever remains there were of the TurkishEmpire. But any of these might subsequently be included with the assent oftwo-thirds of the Assembly. The original membership of the league as specifiedin the projected Covenant was: the United States of America, Belgium, Bolivia,Brazil, the British Empire (Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, andIndia), China, Cuba, Ecuador, France, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, the Hedjaz,Honduras, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal,Rumania, the Serb-Croat-Slovene State, Siam, Czecho-Slovakia, and Uruguay. Towhich were to be added by invitation the following powers which had been neutralin the war: the Argentine Republic, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Holland, Norway,Paraguay, Persia, Salvador, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Venezuela.084 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_084_r1.gif]Such being the constitution of the league, it is scarcely to be wondered at thatits powers were special and limited. It was given a seat at Geneva and asecretariat. It had no powers even to inspect the military preparations of itsconstituent states, or to instruct a military and naval staff to plan out thearmed cooperation needed to keep the peace of the world. The Frenchrepresentative in the League of Nations Commission, M. Leon Bourgeois, insistedlucidly and repeatedly on the logical necessity of such powers. As a speaker hewas rather copious and lacking in “spice” of the Clemenceau quality. The finalscene in the plenary session of April 28th, before the adoption of the Covenant,is described compactly by Mr. Wilson Harris, the crowded Banqueting Hall at theQuai d’Orsay, with its “E” of tables for the delegates, with secretaries andofficials lining the walls and a solid mass of journalists at the lower end ofthe room. “At the head of the room the ‘Big Three’ diverted themselves inundertones at the expense of the worthy M. Bourgeois, now launched, with thehelp of what must have been an entirely superfluous sheaf of notes, on the fifthrendering of his speech in support of his famous amendments.”They were so often “diverting themselves in undertones,” those three men whomGod had mocked with the most tremendous opportunity in history. Keynes (op.cit.) gives other instances of the levities, vulgarities, disregards,inattentions, and inadequacies of these meetings.This poor covenant arrived at in this fashion returned with President Wilson toAmerica, and there it was subjected to an amount of opposition, criticism, andrevision which showed, among other things, how relatively unimpaired was themental energy of the United States. The Senate refused to ratify the covenant,and the first meeting of the League Council was held therefore without Americanrepresentatives. The close of 1919 and the opening months of 1920 saw a verycurious change come over American feeling after the pro-French and pro-Britishenthusiasms of the war period. The peace negotiations reminded the Americans, ina confused and very irritating way, of their profound differences ininternational outlook from any European power that the war had for a time helpedthem to forget. They felt they had been “rushed” into many things without dueconsideration. They experienced a violent revulsion towards that policy ofisolation that had broken down in 1917. The close of 1919 saw a phase, a veryunderstandable phase, of passionate and even violent “Americanism,” in whichEuropean imperialism and European socialism were equally anathema. There mayhave been a sordid element in the American disposition to “cut” the moralresponsibilities the United States had incurred in the affairs of the Old World,and to realize the enormous financial and political advantages the war had giventhe new world; but the broad instinct of the American people seems to have beensound in its distrust of the proposed settlement.§ 13The main terms of the Treaties of 1919-20 with which the Conference of Parisconcluded its labours can be stated much more vividly by a few maps than by awritten abstract. We need scarcely point out how much those treaties leftunsettled, but we may perhaps enumerate some of the more salient breaches of theTwelve that survived out of the Fourteen Points at the opening of theConference.One initial cause of nearly all those breaches lay, we believe, in the completeunpreparedness and unwillingness of that pre-existing league of nations,subjected states and exploited areas, the British Empire, to submit to anydissection and adaptation of its system or to any control of its naval andaerial armament. A kindred contributory cause was the equal unpreparedness ofthe American mind for any interference with the ascendancy of the United Statesin the New World (compare Secretary Olney’s declaration in this chapter, § 6).Neither of those Great Powers, who were necessarily dominant and leading powersat Paris, had properly thought out the implications of a League of Nations inrelation to these older arrangements, and so their support of that project hadto most European observers a curiously hypocritical air; it was as if theywished to retain and ensure their own vast predominance and security while atthe same time restraining any other power from such expansions, annexations, andalliances as might create a rival and competitive imperialism. Their failure toset an example of international confidence destroyed all possibility ofinternational confidence in the other nations represented at Paris.085 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_085_r1.gif]Even more unfortunate was the refusal of the Americans to assent to the Japanesedemand for a recognition of racial equality.Moreover, the foreign offices of the British, the French, and the Italians werehaunted by traditional schemes of aggression entirely incompatible with the newideas. A League of Nations that is to be of any appreciable value to mankindmust supersede imperialisms; it is either a super-imperialism, a liberalworld-empire of united states, participant or in tutelage, or it is nothing; butfew of the people at the Paris Conference had the mental vigour even to assertthis obvious consequence of the League proposal. They wanted to be at the sametime bound and free, to ensure peace for ever, but to keep their weapons intheir hands. Accordingly the old annexation projects of the Great Power periodwere hastily and thinly camouflaged as proposed acts of this poor little birthof April 28th. The newly born and barely animate League was represented to bedistributing, with all the reckless munificence of a captive pope, “mandates” tothe old imperialisms that, had it been the young Hercules we desired, it wouldcertainly have strangled in its cradle. Britain was to have extensive “mandates”in Mesopotamia and East Africa; France was to have the same in Syria; Italy wasto have all her holdings to the west and south-east of Egypt consolidated asmandatory territory. Clearly, if the weak thing that was being nursed by itsSecretary in its cradle at Geneva into some semblance of life, did presentlysuccumb to the infantile weakness of all institutions born without passion, allthese “mandates” would become frank annexations. Moreover, all the Powers foughttooth and nail at the Conference for “strategic” frontiers—the ugliest symptomof all. Why should a state want a strategic frontier unless it contemplates war?If on that plea Italy insisted upon a subject population of Germans in thesouthern Tyrol and a subject population of Yugo-Slavs in Dalmatia, and if littleGreece began landing troops in Asia Minor, neither France nor Britain was in aposition to rebuke these outbreaks of pre-millennial method.086 [../Images/bano_9781411429321_oeb_086_r1.gif]We will not enter here into any detailed account of how President Wilson gaveway to the Japanese and consented to their replacing the Germans at Kiau Chau,which is Chinese property, how the almost purely German city of Danzig waspractically, if not legally, annexed to Poland, and how the Powers disputed overthe claim of the Italian imperialists, a claim strengthened by these instances,to seize the Yugo-slav port of Fiume and deprive the Yugo-Slavs of a goodAdriatic outlet. Nor will we do more than note the complex arrangements andjustifications that put the French in possession of the Saar valley, which isGerman territory, or the entirely iniquitous breach of the right of“self-determination” which practically forbade German Austria to unite—as it isnatural and proper that she should unite—with the rest of Germany. These burningquestions of 1919-20 which occupied the newspapers and the minds of statesmenand politicians, and filled all our wastepaper baskets with propagandaliterature, may seem presently very incidental things in the larger movement ofthese times. All these disputes, like the suspicions and tetchy injustices of aweary and irritated man, may lose their importance as the tone of the worldimproves, and the still inadequately apprehended lessons of the Great War andthe Petty Peace that followed it, begin to be digested by the generalintelligence of mankind.It is worth while for the reader to compare the treaty maps we give with what wehave called the natural political map of Europe. The new arrangements doapproach this latter more closely than any previous system of boundaries. It maybe a necessary preliminary to any satisfactory league of peoples, that eachpeople should first he in something like complete possession of its ownhousehold.§ 14A FORECAST OF THE NEXT WARThe failure to produce a more satisfactory world settlement in 1919-20 was, wehave suggested, a symptom of an almost universal intellectual and morallassitude resulting from the overstrain of the Great War. A lack of freshinitiative is characteristic of a fatigue phase; everyone, for sheer inabilityto change, drifts on for a time along the lines of mental habit and precedent.Nothing could be more illustrative of this fatigue inertia than the expressedideas of military men at this time. It will round off this chapter in anentirely significant way, and complete our picture of the immense worldinterrogation on which our history must end, if we give here the briefestsummary of a lecture that was delivered to a gathering of field-marshals,generals, major-generals, and the like by Major-General Sir Louis Jackson at theRoyal United Service Institution in London one day in December, 1919. Lord Peel,the British Under-Secretary for War, presided, and the reader must picture tohimself the not too large and quite dignified room of assembly in that building,and all these fine, grave, soldierly figures quietly intent upon the lecturer’swords. He is describing, with a certain subdued enthusiasm, the probabletechnical developments of military method in the “next war.”Outside, through the evening twilight of Whitehall, flows the London traffic,not quite so abundant as in 1914, but still fairly abundant; the omnibuses allovercrowded because there are now not nearly enough of them, and the clothing ofpeople generally shabbier. Some little way down Whitehall is a temporaryerection, the Cenotaph, with its base smothered with a vast, pathetic heap ofdecaying wreaths, bunches of flowers, and the like, a cenotaph to commemoratethe eight hundred thousand young men of the Empire who have been killed in therecent struggle. A few people are putting fresh flowers and wreaths there. Oneor two are crying.The prospect stretches out beyond this gathering into the grey vastness ofLondon, where people are now crowded as they have never been crowded before,whose food is dear and employment more uncertain than it has ever been. But letnot the spectacle be one of unrelieved gloom; Regent Street, Oxford Street, andBond Street are bright with shoppers and congested with new automobiles, becausewe must remember that everybody does not lose by a war. Beyond London thecountry sinks into night, and across the narrow sea are North France and Belgiumdevastated, Germany with scores of thousands of her infants dwindling and dyingfor want of milk, all Austria starving. Half the population of Vienna, it isbelieved unless American relief comes quickly, is doomed to die of hardshipbefore the spring. Beyond that bleak twilight stretches the darkness of Russia.There, at least, no rich people are buying anything, and no military men arereading essays on the next war. But in icy Petrograd is little food, littlewood, and no coal. All the towns of Russia southward as far as the snow reachesare in a similar plight, and in the Ukraine and to the south a ragged and dingywar drags to its end. Europe is bankrupt, and people’s pockets rustle with papermoney whose purchasing power dwindles as they walk about with it.But now we will return to Sir Louis in the well-lit room at the United ServiceInstitution.He was of opinion—we follow the report in next morning’s Times8[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en102]—that we were merely on theeve of the most extensive modifications of the art of war known to history. Itbehoved us, therefore—us being, of course, the British and not the whole ofmankind—to get on with our armaments and to keep ahead; a fine openinggeneralization. “It was necessary to develop new arms. . . . The nation whichbest did so would have a great advantage in the next war. There were people whowere crying aloud for a reduction of armaments ---”(But there the Director of Trench Warfare and Supplies was wrong. They were justcrying at the cenotaph, poor, soft, and stupid souls, because a son or a brotheror a father was dead.)Sir Louis believed that one of the greatest developments in the art of warfarewould be brought about in mechanical transport. The tank he treated withingratitude. These military gentlemen are ungrateful to an invention whichshoved and butted them into victory almost in spite of themselves. The tank,said Sir Louis, was “a freak. . . . The outstanding feature” of the tank, hesaid, was that it made mechanical transport independent of the roads. Hithertoarmies on the march had only been able to spoil the roads; now their transporton caterpillar wheels would advance in open order on a broad front carryingguns, munitions, supplies, bridging equipment, rafts, and men—and incidentallyploughing up and destroying hedges, ditches, fields, and cultivation generally.Armies would wallow across the country, leaving nothing behind but dust and mud.So our imaginations are led up to the actual hostilities.Sir Louis was in favour of gas. For punitive expeditions particularly, gas wasto be recommended. And here he startled and disconcerted his hearers by a gleamof something approaching sentimentality. “It might be possible,” he said, “tocome to some agreement that no gas should be used which caused unnecessarysuffering.” But there his heart spoke rather than his head; it should have beenclear to him that if law can so far override warfare as to prohibit any sort ofevil device whatever, it can override warfare to the extent of prohibiting italtogether. And where would Sir Louis Jackson and his audience be then? War iswar; its only law is the law that the maximum destruction of the forces of theenemy is necessary. To that law in warfare all considerations of humanity andjustice are subordinate.From gas Sir Louis passed to the air. Here he predicted “most importantadvances. . . . We need not trouble ourselves yet with flying destroyers orflying concrete forts, but in twenty years’ time the Air Force Estimates mightbe the most important part of our preparations for war.” He discussed theconversion of commercial flying machines to bombing and reconnaissance uses, andthe need for special types of fighting machine in considerable numbers andalways ready. He gave reasons for supposing that the bombers in the next warwould not have the same targets near the front of the armies, and would securebetter results by going further afield and bombing the centres “where stores arebeing manufactured and troops trained.” As everyone who stayed in London or theeast of England in 1917-18 knows, this means the promiscuous bombing of any andevery centre of population. But, of course, the bombing of those ’prentice dayswould be child’s play to the bombing of the “next war.” There would be countlessmore aeroplanes, bigger and much nastier bombs. . . .Sir Louis, proceeding with the sketch, mentioned the “destruction of the greaterpart of London” as a possible incident in the coming struggle. And so on to theculminating moral, that the highest pay, the utmost importance, the freestexpenditure, must be allowed to military gentlemen. “The expense entailed is inthe nature of an absolutely necessary insurance.” With which his particularaudience warmly agreed. And a certain Major-General Stone, a little forgetful ofthe source of his phrases,9 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en103]said he hoped that this lecture “may be the beginning not of trusting in theLeague of Nations, but in our own right hand and our stretched-out arm!”But we will not go on with the details of this dream. For indeed no Utopia wasever so impossible as this forecast of a world in which scarcely anything butvery carefully sandbagged and camouflaged G.H.Q. would be reasonably safe, inwhich countless bombers would bomb the belligerent lands incessantly. and greatarmies with lines of caterpillar transport roll to and fro, churning the fieldsof the earth into blood-streaked mud. There is not energy enough and no willwhatever left in the world for such things. Generals who cannot foresee tankscannot be expected to foresee or understand world bankruptcy; still less arethey likely to understand the limits imposed upon military operations by thefluctuating temper of the common man. Apparently these military authorities ofthe United Service Institution did not even know that warfare aims at theproduction of states of mind in the enemy, and is sustained by states of mind.The chief neglected factor in the calculations of Sir Louis is the fact that nopeople whatever will stand such warfare as he contemplates, not even the peopleon the winning side. For as northern France, south-eastern Britain, and northItaly now understand, the victor in the “next war” may be bombed and starvedalmost as badly as the loser. A phase is possible in which a war-tormentedpopulation may cease to discriminate between military gentlemen on this side orthat, and may be moved to destroy them as the common enemies of the race. TheGreat War of 1914-18 was the culmination of the military energy of the Westernpopulations, and they fought and fought well because they believed they werefighting “the war to end war.” They were. German imperialism, with its organizedgrip upon education and its close alliance with an aggressive commercialism, wasbeaten and finished. The militarism and imperialism of Britain and France andItaly are by comparison feeble, disorganized, and disorganizing survivals. Theyare things “left over” by the Great War. They have no persuasive power. They goon—for sheer want of wits to leave off. No European Government will ever get thesame proportion of its people into the ranks and into its munition works againas the governments of 1914-18 did. Our world is very weak and feeble still(1920), but its war fever is over. Its temperature is, if anything, subnormal.It is doubtful if it will take the fever again for a long time. The alterationsin the conditions of warfare are already much profounder than such authoritiesas Sir Louis Jackson suspect.10[../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en104]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIITHE NEXT STAGE OF HISTORY§ 1. The Possible Unification of Men’s Wills in Political Matters. § 2. How aFederal World Government may Come About. § 3. Some Fundamental Characteristicsof a Modern World State. § 4. What this World Might be were it under one Law andJustice.§ 1WE have brought this Outline of History up to the threshold of our own times,but we have brought it to no conclusion. It breaks off at a dramatic phase ofexpectation. Nobody believes that the system of settlements grouped about theTreaty of Versailles is a permanent arrangement of the world’s affairs. TheseTreaties were the end of the war and not the establishment of a new order in theworld. That new order has now to be established. In social and economic as ininternational affairs we are in the dawn of a great constructive effort. Thestory of life which began inestimable millions of years ago, the adventure ofmankind which was already afoot half a million years ago, rises to a crisis inthe immense interrogation of today. The drama becomes ourselves. It is you, itis I, it is all that is happening to us and all that we are doing which willsupply the next chapter of this continually expanding adventure of mankind.Our history has traced a steady growth of the social and political units intowhich men have combined. In the brief period of ten thousand years these unitshave grown from the small family tribe of the early neolithic culture to thevast united realms—vast yet still too small and partial—of the present time. Andthis change in size of the state—a change manifestly incomplete—has beenaccompanied by profound changes in its nature. Compulsion and servitude havegiven way to ideas of associated freedom, and the sovereignty that was onceconcentrated in an autocratic king and god, has been widely diffused throughoutthe community. Until the Roman republic extended itself to all Italy, there hadbeen no free community larger than a city state; all great communities werecommunities of obedience under a monarch. The great united republic of theUnited States would have been impossible before the printing press and therailway. The telegraph and telephone, the aeroplane, the continual progress ofland and sea transit, are now insisting upon a still larger politicalorganization.If our Outline has been faithfully drawn, and if these brief conclusions aresound, it follows that we are engaged upon an immense task of adjustment tothese great lines upon which our affairs are moving. Our wars, our socialconflict, our enormous economic stresses, are all aspects of that adjustment.The loyalties and allegiances today are at best provisional loyalties andallegiances. Our true State, this state that is already beginning, this state towhich every man owes his utmost political effort, must be now this nascentFederal World State to which human necessities point. Our true God now is theGod of all men. Nationalism as a God must follow the tribal gods to limbo. Ourtrue nationality is mankind.How far will modern men lay hold upon and identify themselves with thisnecessity and set themselves to revise their ideas, remake their institutions,and educate the coming generations to this final extension of citizenship? Howfar will they remain dark, obdurate, habitual, and traditional, resisting theconvergent forces that offer them either unity or misery? Sooner or later thatunity must come or else plainly men must perish by their own inventions. We,because we believe in the power of reason and in the increasing good will inmen, find ourselves compelled to reject the latter possibility. But the way tothe former may be very long and tedious, very tragic and wearisome, a martydomof many generations, or it may be travelled over almost swiftly in the course ofa generation or so. That depends upon forces whose nature we understand to someextent now, but not their power. There has to be a great process of education,by precept and by information and by experience, but there are as yet noquantitative measures of education to tell us how much has to be learnt or howsoon that learning can be done. Our estimates vary with our moods; the time maybe much longer than our hopes and much shorter than our fears.The terrible experiences of the Great War have made very many men who once tookpolitical things lightly take them now very gravely. To a certain small numberof men and women the attainment of a world peace has become the supreme work inlife, has become a religious self-devotion. To a much greater number it hasbecome at least a ruling motive. Many such people now are seeking ways ofworking for this great end, or they are already working for this great end, bypen and persuasion, in schools and colleges and books, and in the highways andbyways of public life. Perhaps now most human beings in the world arewell-disposed towards such efforts, but rather confusedly disposed; they arewithout any clear sense of what must be done and what ought to be prevented,that human solidarity may be advanced. The worldwide outbreak of faith and hopein President Wilson, before he began to wilt and fail us, was a very significantthing indeed for the future of mankind. Set against these motives of unityindeed are other motives entirely antagonistic, the fear and hatred of strangethings and peoples, love of and trust in the old traditional thing, patriotisms,race prejudices, suspicions, distrusts—and the elements of spite, scoundrelism,and utter selfishness that are so strong still in every human soul.The overriding powers that hitherto in the individual soul and in the communityhave struggled and prevailed against the ferocious, base, and individualimpulses that divide us from one another, have been the powers of religion andeducation. Religion and education, those closely interwoven influences, havemade possible the greater human societies whose growth we have traced in thisOutline; they have been the chief synthetic forces throughout this great storyof enlarging human cooperations that we have traced from its beginnings. We havefound in the intellectual and theological conflicts of the nineteenth centurythe explanation of that curious exceptional disentanglement of religiousteaching from formal education which is a distinctive feature of our age, and wehave traced the consequences of this phase of religious disputation andconfusion in the reversion of international politics towards a brutalnationalism and in the backward drift of industrial and business life towardsharsh, selfish, and uncreative profit-seeking. There has been a slipping off ofancient restraints; a real decivilization of men’s minds. We would lay stresshere on the suggestion that this divorce of religious teaching from organizededucation is necessarily a temporary one, a transitory dislocation, and thatpresently education must become again in intention and spirit religious, andthat the impulse to devotion, to universal service and to a complete escape fromself, which has been the common underlying force in all the great religions ofthe last five and twenty centuries, an impulse which ebbed so perceptibly duringthe prosperity, laxity, disillusionment, and scepticism of the past seventy oreighty years, will reappear again, stripped and plain, as the recognizedfundamental structural impulse in human society.Education is the preparation of the individual for the community, and hisreligious training is the core of that preparation. With the great intellectualrestatements and expansions of the nineteenth century, an educational break-up,a confusion and loss of aim in education, was inevitable. We can no longerprepare the individual for a community when our ideas of a community areshattered and undergoing reconstruction. The old loyalties, the old too limitedand narrow political and social assumptions, the old too elaborate religiousformulæ, have lost their power of conviction, and the greater ideas of a worldstate and of an economic commonweal have been winning their way only very slowlyto recognition. So far they have swayed only a minority of exceptional people.But out of the trouble and tragedy of this present time there may emerge a moraland intellectual revival, a religious revival, of a simplicity and scope to drawtogether men of alien races and now discrete traditions into one common andsustained way of living for the world’s service. We cannot foretell the scopeand power of such a revival; we cannot even produce evidence of its onset. Thebeginnings of such things are never conspicuous. Great movements of the racialsoul come at first “like a thief in the night,” and then suddenly are discoveredto be powerful and world- wide. Religious emotion—stripped of corruptions andfreed from its last priestly entanglements—may presently blow through life againlike a great wind, bursting the doors and flinging open the shutters of theindividual life, and making many things possible and easy that in these presentdays of exhaustion seem almost too difficult to desire.If we suppose a sufficient righteousness and intelligence in men to producepresently, from the tremendous lessons of history, an effective will for a worldpeace—that is to say, an effective will for a world law under a worldgovernment—for in no other fashion is a secure world peace conceivable—in whatmanner may we expect things to move towards this end? That movement willcertainly not go on equally in every country, nor is it likely to take at firstone uniform mode of expression. Here it will find a congenial and stimulatingatmosphere, here it will find itself antagonistic to deep tradition or racialidiosyncrasy or well-organized base oppositions. In some cases those to whom thecall of the new order has come will be living in a state almost ready to servethe ends of the greater political synthesis, in others they will have to fightlike conspirators against the rule of evil laws. There is little in thepolitical constitution of such countries as the United States or Switzerlandthat would impede their coalescence upon terms of frank give and take with otherequally civilized confederations; political systems involving dependent areasand “subject peoples” such as the Turkish Empire was before the Great War, seemto require something in the nature of a breaking up before they can be adaptedto a federal world system. Any state obsessed by traditions of an aggressiveforeign policy will be difficult to assimilate into a world combination. Butthough here the government may be helpful, and here dark and hostile, theessential task of men of goodwill in all states and countries remains the same,it is an educational task, and its very essence is to bring to the minds of allmen everywhere, as a necessary basis for world cooperation, a new telling andinterpretation, a common interpretation, of history.Does this League of Nations which has been created by the covenant of 1919contain within it the germ of any permanent federation of human effort? Will itgrow into something for which, as Stallybrass says, men will be ready to “workwholeheart edly and, if necessary, fight”—as hitherto they have been willing tofight for their country and their own people? There are few intimations of anysuch enthusiasm for the League at the present time. The League does not evenseem to know how to talk to common men. It has gone into official buildings, andcomparatively few people in the world understand or care what it is doing there.It may be that the League is no more than a first project of union, exemplaryonly in its insufficiencies and dangers, destined to be superseded by somethingcloser and completer as were the United States Articles of Confederation by theFederal Constitution. The League is at present a mere partial league ofgovernments and states. It emphasizes nationality; it defers to sovereignty.What the world needs is no such league of nations as this nor even a mere leagueof peoples, but a world league of men. The world perishes unless sovereignty ismerged and nationality subordinated. And for that the minds of men must first beprepared by experience and knowledge and thought. The supreme task before men atthe present time is political education.It may be that several partial leagues may precede any world league. The commonmisfortunes and urgent common needs of Europe and Asia may be more efficaciousin bringing the European and Asiatic states to reason and a sort of unity, thanthe mere intellectual and sentimental ties of the United States and GreatBritain and France. A United States of the Old World is a possibility to setagainst the possibility of an Atlantic union. Moreover, there is much to be saidfor an American experiment, a Pan-American league, in which the New WorldEuropean colonies would play an in-and-out part as Luxembourg did for a time inthe German confederation.We will not attempt to weigh here what share may be taken in the recasting andconsolidation of human affairs by the teachings and propaganda of labourinternationalism, by the studies and needs of international finance, or by suchboundary-destroying powers as science and art and historical teaching. All thesethings may exert a combined pressure, in which it may never be possible toapportion the exact shares. Opposition may dissolve, antagonistic cults flattenout to a common culture, almost imperceptibly. The bold idealism of today mayseem mere common sense tomorrow. And the problem of a forecast is complicated bythe possibilities of interludes and backwaters. History has never gone simplyforward. More particularly are the years after a great war apt to be years ofapparent retrocession; men are too weary to see what has been done, what hasbeen cleared away, and what has been made possible.Among the things that seem to move commandingly towards an adequate worldcontrol at the present time are these:—1. The increasing destructiveness and intolerableness of war waged with the newpowers of science.2. The inevitable fusion of the world’s economic affairs into one system,leading necessarily, it would seem, to some common control of currency, anddemanding safe and uninterrupted communications, and a free movement of goodsand people by sea and land throughout the whole world. The satisfaction of theseneeds will require a world control of very considerable authority and powers ofenforcement.3. The need, because of the increasing mobility of peoples, of effectualcontrols of health everywhere.4. The urgent need of some equalization of labour conditions, and of the minimumstandard of life throughout the world. This seems to carry with it, as anecessary corollary, the establishment of some minimum standard of education foreveryone.5. The impossibility of developing the enormous benefits of flying without aworld control of the air-ways.The necessity and logic of such diverse considerations as these push the mindirresistibly, in spite of the clashes of race and tradition and the hugedifficulties created by differences in language, towards the belief that aconscious struggle to establish or prevent a political world community will bethe next stage in human history. The things that require that world communityare permanent needs, one or other of these needs appeals to nearly everyone, andagainst their continuing persistence are only mortal difficulties, great nodoubt, but mortal; prejudices, passions, animosities, delusions about race andcountry, egotisms, and such-like fluctuating and evanescent things, set up inmen’s minds by education and suggestion; none of them things that make now forthe welfare and survival of the individuals who are under their sway nor of thestates and towns and associations in which they prevail.§ 3The attainment of the world state may be impeded and may be opposed today bymany apparently vast forces; but it has, urging it on, a much more powerfulforce, that of the free and growing common intelligence of mankind. Today thereis in the world a small but increasing number of men, historians, archæologists,ethnologists, economists, sociologists, psychologists, educationists, and thelike, who are doing for human institutions that same task of creative analysiswhich the scientific men of the seventeenth and eighteenth century did for thematerials and mechanism of human life; and just as these latter, almost unawareof what they were doing, made telegraphy, swift transit on sea and land, flyingand a thousand hitherto impossible things possible, so the former may be doingmore than the world suspects, or than they themselves suspect, to clear up andmake plain the thing to do and the way to do it, in the greater and more urgenthuman affairs.Let us ape Roger Bacon in his prophetic mood, and set down what we believe willbe the broad fundamentals of the coming world state.(i) It will be based upon a common world religion, very much simplified anduniversalized and better understood. This will not be Christianity nor Islam norBuddhism nor any such specialized form of religion, but religion itself pure andundefiled; the Eightfold Way, the Kingdom of Heaven, brotherhood, creativeservice, and self-forgetfulness. Throughout the world men’s thoughts and motiveswill be turned by education, example, and the circle of ideas about them, fromthe obsession of self to the cheerful service of human knowledge, human power,and human unity.(ii) And this world state will be sustained by a universal education, organizedupon a scale and of a penetration and quality beyond all present experience. Thewhole race, and not simply classes and peoples, will be educated. Most parentswill have a technical knowledge of teaching. Quite apart from the duties ofparentage, perhaps ten per cent. or more of the adult population will, at sometime or other in their lives, be workers in the world’s educationalorganization. And education, as the new age will conceive it, will go onthroughout life; it will not, cease at any particular age. Men and women willsimply become self-educators and individual students and student teachers asthey grow older.(iii) There will be no armies, no navies, and no classes of unemployed peopleeither wealthy or poor.(iv) The world state’s organization of scientific research and record comparedwith that of today will be like an ocean liner beside the dug-out canoe of someearly heliolithic wanderer.(v) There will be a vast free literature of criticism and discussion.(vi) The world’s political organization will be democratic, that is to say, thegovernment and direction of affairs will be in immediate touch with andresponsive to the general thought of the educated whole population.(vii) Its economic organization will be an exploitation of all natural wealthand every fresh possibility science reveals, by the agents and servants of thecommon government for the common good. Private enterprise will be the servant—auseful, valued, and well-rewarded servant—and no longer the robber master of thecommonweal.(viii) And this implies two achievements that seem very difficult to us today.They are matters of mechanism, but they are as essential to the world’swell-being as it is to a soldier’s, no matter how brave he may be, that hismachine gun should not jam, and to an aeronaut’s that his steering-gear shouldnot fail him in mid-air. Political well-being demands that electoral methodsshall be used, and economic well-being requires that a currency shall be used,safeguarded or proof against the contrivances and manipulations of clever,dishonest men.1 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_nts_r1.html#en105]§ 4There can be little question that the attainment of a federation of allhumanity, together with a sufficient measure of social justice, to ensurehealth, education, and a rough equality of opportunity to most of the childrenborn into the world, would mean such a release and increase of human energy asto open a new phase in human history. The enormous waste caused by militarypreparation and the mutual annoyance of competing great powers, and the stillmore enormous waste due to the under-productiveness of great masses of people,either because they are too wealthy for stimulus or too poor for efficiency,would cease. There would be a vast increase in the supply of human necessities,a rise in the standard of life and in what is considered a necessity, adevelopment of transport and every kind of convenience; and a multitude ofpeople would be transferred from low-grade production to such higher work as artof all kinds, teaching, scientific research, and the like. All over the worldthere would be a setting free of human capacity, such as has occurred hithertoonly in small places and through precious limited phases of prosperity andsecurity. Unless we are to suppose that spontaneous outbreaks of supermen haveoccurred in the past, it is reasonable to conclude that the Athens of Pericles,the Florence of the Medici, Elizabethan England, the great deeds of Asoka, theTang and Ming periods in art, are but samples of what a whole world of sustainedsecurity would yield continuously and cumulatively. Without supposing any changein human quality, but merely its release from the present system of inordinatewaste, history Justifies this expectation.We have seen how, since the liberation of human thought in the fifteenth andsixteenth centuries, a comparatively few curious and intelligent men, chiefly inwestern Europe, have produced a vision of the world and a body of science thatis now, on the material side, revolutionizing life. Mostly these men have workedagainst great discouragement, with insufficient funds and small help or supportfrom the mass of mankind. It is impossible to believe that these men were themaximum intellectual harvest of their generation. England alone in the lastthree centuries must have produced scores of Newtons who never learnt to read,hundreds of Daltons, Darwins, Bacons, and Huxleys who died stunted in hovels, ornever got a chance of proving their quality. All the world over, there must havebeen myriads of potential first-class investigators, splendid artists, creativeminds, who never caught a gleam of inspiration or opportunity, for every one ofthat kind who has left his mark upon the world. In the trenches of the Westernfront alone during the late war thousands of potential great men diedunfulfilled. But a world with something like a secure international peace andsomething like social justice, will fish for capacity with the fine net ofuniversal education, and may expect a yield beyond comparison greater than anyyield of able and brilliant men that the world has known hitherto.It is such considerations as this indeed which justify the concentration ofeffort in the near future upon the making of a new world state of righteousnessout of our present confusions. War is a horrible thing, and constantly morehorrible and dreadful, so that unless it is ended it will certainly end humansociety; social injustice, and the sight of the limited and cramped human beingsit produces, torment the soul; but the strongest incentive to constructivepolitical and social work for an imaginative spirit lies not so much in the merehope of escaping evils as in the opportunity for great adventures that theirsuppression will open to our race. We want to get rid of the militarist notsimply because he hurts and kills, but because he is an intolerable thick-voicedblockhead who stands hectoring and blustering in our way to achievement. We wantto abolish many extravagances of private ownership just as we should want toabolish some idiot guardian who refused us admission to a studio in which therewere fine things to do.There are people who seem to imagine that a world order and one universal law ofjustice would end human adventure. It would but begin it. But instead of theadventure of the past, the “romance” of the cinematograph world, the perpetualreiterated harping upon the trite reactions of sex and combat and the hunt forgold, it would he an unending exploration upon the edge of experience. Hithertoman has been living in a slum, amidst quarrels, revenges, vanities, shames andtaints, hot desires and urgent appetites. He has scarcely tasted sweet air yetand the great freedoms of the world that science has enlarged for him.To picture to ourselves something of the wider life that world unity would opento men is a very attractive speculation. Life will certainly go with a strongerpulse, it will breathe a deeper breath, because it will have dispelled andconquered a hundred infections of body and mind that now reduce it to invalidismand squalor. We have already laid stress on the vast elimination of drudgeryfrom human life through the creation of a new race of slaves, the machines.This—and the disappearance of war and the smoothing out of endless restraintsand contentions by juster social and economic arrangements—will lift the burthenof toilsome work and routine work, that has been the price of human securitysince the dawn of the first civilizations, from the shoulders of our children.Which does not mean that they will cease to work, but that they will cease to doirksome work under pressure, and will work freely, planning, making, creating,according to their gifts and instincts. They will fight nature no longer as dullconscripts of the pick and plough, but for a splendid conquest. Only thespiritlessness of our present depression blinds us to the clear intimations ofour reason that in the course of a few generations every little country towncould become an Athens, every human being could be gentle in breeding andhealthy in body and mind, the whole solid earth man’s mine and its uttermostregions his playground.In this Outline we have sought to show two great systems of developmentinteracting in the story of human society. We have seen, growing out of thatlater special neolithic culture, the heliolithic culture in the warmer alluvialparts of the world, the great primordial civilizations, fecund systems ofsubjugation and obedience, vast multiplications of industrious and subservientmen. We have shown the necessary relationship of these early civilizations tothe early temples and to king-gods and god-kings. At the same time we havetraced the development from a simpler neolithic level of the wanderer peoples,who became the nomadic peoples, in those great groups the Aryans and theHun-Mongol peoples of the north-west and the north-east and (from a heliolithicphase) the Semites of the Arabian deserts. Our history has told of a repeatedoverrunning and refreshment of the originally brunet civilizations by thesehardier, bolder, free-spirited peoples of the steppes and desert. We havepointed out how these constantly recurring nomadic injections have steadilyaltered the primordial civilizations both in blood and in spirit; and how theworld religions of today, and what we now call democracy, the boldness of modernscientific inquiry and a universal restlessness, are due to this “nomadization”of civilization. The old civilizations created tradition, and lived bytradition. Today the power of tradition is destroyed. The body of our state iscivilization still, but its spirit is the spirit of the nomadic world. It is thespirit of the great plains and the high seas.So that it is difficult to resist the persuasion that so soon as one law runs inthe earth and the fierceness of frontiers ceases to distress us, that urgency inour nature that stirs us in spring and autumn to be up and travelling, will haveits way with us. We shall obey the call of the summer pastures and the winterpastures in our blood, the call of the mountains, the desert, and the sea. Forsome of us also, who may be of a different lineage, there is the call of theforest, and there are those who would hunt in the summer and return to thefields for the harvest and the plough. But this does not mean that men will havebecome homeless and all adrift. The normal nomadic life is not a homeless one,but a movement between homes. The Kalmucks today, like the swallows, go yearly athousand miles from one home to another. The beautiful and convenient cities ofthe coming age, we conclude, will have their seasons when they will be full oflife, and seasons when they will seem asleep. Life will ebb and flow to and fromevery region seasonally as the interest of that region rises or declines.There will be little drudgery in this better-ordered world. Natural powerharnessed in machines will be the general drudge. What drudgery is inevitablewill be done as a service and duty for a few years or months out of each life;it will not consume nor degrade the whole life of anyone. And not only drudges,but many other sorts of men and ways of living which loom large in the currentsocial scheme will necessarily have dwindled in importance or passed awayaltogether. There will be few professional fighting men or none at all, nocustomhouse officers; the increased multitude of teachers will have abolishedlarge police forces and large jail staffs, mad-houses will be rare ornon-existent; a world- wide sanitation will have diminished the proportion ofhospitals, nurses, sick-room attendants, and the like; a world-wide economicjustice, the floating population of cheats, sharpers, gamblers, forestallers,parasites, and speculators generally. But there will be no diminution ofadventure or romance in this world of the days to come. Sea fisheries and theincessant insurrection of the sea, for example, will call for their own stalwarttypes of men; the high air will clamour for manhood, the deep and dangeroussecret places of nature. Men will turn again with renewed interest to the animalworld. In these disordered days a stupid, uncontrollable massacre of animalspecies goes on—from certain angles of vision it is a thing almost more tragicthan human miseries; in the nineteenth century dozens of animal species, andsome of them very interesting species, were exterminated; but one of the firstfruits of an effective world state would be the better protection of what arenow wild beasts. It is a strange thing in human history to note how little hasbeen done since the Bronze Age in taming, using, befriending, and appreciatingthe animal life about us. But that mere witless killing which is called sporttoday would inevitably give place in a better educated world community to amodification of the primitive instincts that find expression in this way,changing them into an interest not in the deaths, but in the lives of beasts,and leading to fresh and perhaps very strange and beautiful attempts to befriendthese pathetic, kindred lower creatures we no longer fear as enemies, hate asrivals, or need as slaves. And a world state and universal justice does not meanthe imprisonment of our race in any bleak institutional orderliness. There willstill be mountains and the sea, there will be jungles and great forests, caredfor indeed and treasured and protected; the great plains will still spreadbefore us and the wild winds blow. But men will not hate so much, fear so much,nor cheat so desperately—and they will keep their minds and bodies cleaner.There are unhopeful prophets who see in the gathering together of men into onecommunity the possibility of violent race conflicts, conflicts for “ascendancy,”but that is to suppose that civilization is incapable of adjustments by whichmen of different qualities and temperaments and appearances will live side byside, following different rôles and contributing diverse gifts. The weaving ofmankind into one community does not imply the creation of a homogeneouscommunity, but rather the reverse; the welcome and the adequate utilization ofdistinctive quality in an atmosphere of understanding. It is the almostuniversal bad manners of the present age which make race intolerable to race.The community to which we may be moving will be more mixed—which does notnecessarily mean more interbred—more various and more interesting than anyexisting community. Communities all to one pattern, like boxes of toy soldiers,are things of the past rather than the future.But one of the hardest, most impossible tasks a writer can set himself, is topicture the life of people better educated, happier in their circumstances, morefree and more healthy than he is himself. We know enough today to know thatthere is infinite room for betterment in every human concern. Nothing is neededbut collective effort. Our poverty, our restraints, our infections andindigestions, our quarrels and misunderstandings, are all things controllableand removable by concerted human action, but we know as little how life wouldfeel without them as some poor dirty ill-treated, fierce-souled creature bornand bred amidst the cruel and dingy surroundings of a European back street canknow what it is to bathe every day, always to be clad beautifully, to climbmountains for pleasure, to fly, to meet none but agreeable, well-manneredpeople, to conduct researches or make delightful things. Yet a time when allsuch good things will be for all men may be coming more nearly than we think.Each one who believes that brings the good time nearer; each heart that failsdelays it.One cannot foretell the surprises or disappointments the future has in store.Before this chapter of the World State can begin fairly in our histories, otherchapters as yet unsuspected may still need to be written, as long and as full ofconflict as our account of the growth and rivalries of the Great Powers. Theremay be tragic economic struggles, grim grapplings of race with race and classwith class. It may be that “private enterprise” will refuse to learn the lessonof service without some quite catastrophic revolution, and that a phase ofconfiscation and amateurish socialistic government lies before us. We do notknow; we cannot tell. These are unnecessary disasters, but they may beunavoidable disasters. Human history becomes more and more a race betweeneducation and catastrophe. Against the unifying effort of Christendom andagainst the unifying influence of the mechanical revolution, catastrophe won—atleast to the extent of achieving the Great War. We cannot tell yet how much ofthe winnings of catastrophe still remain to be gathered in. New falsities mayarise and hold men in some unrighteous and fated scheme of order for a time,before they collapse amidst the misery and slaughter of generations.Yet, clumsily or smoothly, the world, it seems, progresses and will progress. Inthis Outline, in our account of palæolithic men, we have borrowed a descriptionfrom Mr. Worthington Smith of the very highest life in the world some fiftythousand years ago. It was a bestial life. We have sketched, too, the gatheringfor a human sacrifice, some fifteen thousand years ago. That scene again isalmost incredibly cruel to a modern civilized reader.Yet it is not more than five hundred years since the great empire of the Aztecsstill believed that it could live only by the shedding of blood. Every year inMexico hundreds of human victims died in this fashion: the body was bent like abow over the curved stone of sacrifice, the breast was slashed open with a knifeof obsidian, and the priest tore out the beating heart of the still livingvictim. The day may be close at hand when we shall no longer tear out the heartsof men, even for the sake of our national gods. Let the reader but refer to theearlier time charts we have given in this history, and he will see the truemeasure and transitoriness of all the conflicts, deprivations, and miseries ofthis present period of painful and yet hopeful change."},{"pageContent":"CHRONOLOGICAL TABLETO conclude this Outline, we give here a Table of Leading Events from the year800 B.C. to 1920 A.D. Following that we give five time diagrams covering theperiod from 1000 B.C. onward, which present the trend of events in a graphicform.It is well that the reader should keep in mind an idea of the true proportionsof historical to geological time. The scale of the five diagrams at the end issuch that by it the time diagram on page 142 would be about 8½ times as long,that is to say about 4 feet; that on page 47 showing the interval since theEoliths, 555 feet, and that on page 11 representing the whole of geological timewould be somewhere between 12 and, at the longest and most probable estimate,260 miles! Let the reader therefore take one of these chronological tables wegive, and imagine it extended upon a long strip of paper to a distance of 55feet. He would have to get up and walk about that distance to note the date ofthe painting of the Altamira caves, and he would have to go ten times thatdistance by the side of the same narrow strip to reach the earlierNeanderthalers. A mile or so from home, but probably much further away, thestrip might be recording the last of the dinosaurs. And this on a scale whichrepresents the time from Columbus to ourselves by three inches of space!Chronology only begins to be precise enough to specify the exact year of anyevent after the establishment of the eras of the First Olympiad and the buildingof Rome.About the year 1000 B.C. the Aryan peoples were establishing themselves in thepeninsulas of Spain, Italy, and the Balkans, and they were established in NorthIndia.

We are told that the essential contribution of Rome to the inheritanceof mankind is the idea of society founded on law, and that this exploit ofJustinian was the crown of the gift. The writer is ill-equipped to estimate thepeculiar value of Roman legalism to mankind. Existing law seems to him to bebased upon a confused foundation of conventions, arbitrary assumptions, andworking fictions about human relationship, and to be a very impracticable andantiquated system indeed; he is persuaded that a time will come when the wholetheory and practice of law will be recast in the light of a well-developedscience of social psychology in accordance with a scientific conception of humansociety as one developing organization and in definite relationship to a systemof moral and intellectual education. He contemplates the law and lawyers oftoday with a temperamental lack of appreciation. This may have made himnegligent of Justinian and unjust to Rome as a whole.2 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en14] The Decline and Fall ofthe Roman Empire, chap. xxiii.3 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en15] Turanians from Turkestanor Avars from the Caucasus.4 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en16] There were girl slaveswho did domestic work and women who were bought and sold.—J.

Hirth, Ancient History of China,, comesto the conclusion, after a careful examination of all data, that, although it isprobable something like the compass was known in high antiquity, the knowledgeof it was lost for a long time afterwards, until, in the Middle Ages, itreappears as an instrument in the hands of geomancers (people who selectedfavourable sites for graves, etc.). The earliest unmistakable mention of its useas a guide to mariners occurs in a work of the 12th century and refers to itsuse on foreign ships trading between China and Sumatra. Hirth is rather inclinedto assume that Arab travellers may have seen it in the hands of Chinesegeomancers and applied its use to navigation, so that it was afterwards broughtback by them to China as the “mariner’s compass.”—J.

In fact, the Franks where they were not Latinized became Flemings and“Dutchmen” of South Holland (North Holland is still Friesisch—i.e. Anglo-Saxon).The “French” which the Latinized Franks and Burgundians spoke in the seventh tothe tenth centuries was remarkably like the Rumansch language of Switzerland,judging from the vestiges that remain in old documents.—H.

A European catastrophe had reducedproduction and consequently increased the earnings of workers and traders. Ruralwages had risen by 48 per cent. in England, when an unwise executive endeavouredto enforce in the Ordinance and Statute of Labourers (1350-51) a return to thepre-plague wages and prices of 1346, and aimed a blow in the Statute of 1378against labour combinations. The villeins were driven to desperation by the lossof their recent increase of comfort, and the outbreak came, as Froissart saw itfrom the angle of the Court, “all through the too great comfort of thecommonalty.” Other ingredients which entered into the outbreak were theresentment felt by the new working class at the restrictions imposed on itsright to combine, the objection of the lower clergy to papal taxes, and a frankdislike of foreigners and landlords. There was no touch of Wycliffe’s influencein the rising. It was at its feeblest in Leicestershire, and it murdered one ofthe only other Liberal churchmen in England.—P.

These savings are technically “capital”and their owners “capitalists” to that extent, and this is supposed tocontradict the statement of Marx that property concentrates into few and fewerhands. Marx used many of his terms carelessly and chose them ill, and his ideaswere better than his words. When he wrote property he meant “property so far asit is power.” The small investor has remarkably little power over his investedcapital.6 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en89] Wells, Russia in theShadows.7 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en90] For a closely parallelview of religion to that given here, see Outspoken Essays, by Dean Inge, EssaysVIII and IX on St. Paul and on Institutionalism and Mysticism.8 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en91] Albert Thomas in theEncyclopœdia Britannica.9 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en92] Hence “Jingo” for anyrabid patriot.10 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en93] See Putnam Weale’sIndiscreet Letters from Pekin, a partly fictitious book, but true and vivid inits effects.11 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en94] A new and much moreliberal Maltese constitution was promulgated in June, 1920, practically puttingMalta on the footing of a self-governing colony.CHAPTER XI1 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_c11_r1.html#Ref-en95] These quotations arefrom Sir Thomas Barclay’s article “Peace” in the Encyclopœdia Britannica.2 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_c11_r1.html#Ref-en96] “Is,” not “are.” Sincethe Civil War the U.

It isfrom Fuller’s recently published Tanks in the Great War. Colonel Fuller does notshare that hostility to tanks characteristic of the older type of soldier. Inthe next war, he tells us: “Fast-moving tanks, equipped with tons of liquid gas. . . will cross the frontier and obliterate every living thing in the fieldsand farms, the villages, and cities of the enemy’s country. Whilst life is beingswept away around the frontier, fleets, of aeroplanes will attack the enemy’sgreat industrial and governing centres. All these attacks will be made, atfirst, not against the enemy’s army . . . but against the civil population, inorder to compel it to accept the will of the attacker.”For a good, well-balanced account of what modern war really means see PhilipGibbs, Realities of War.CHAPTER XII1 [../Text/bano_9781411429321_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-en105] See Wells, TheSalvaging of Civilization."},{"pageContent":"INDEXAAAR VALLEYAbbasidsAbd ManifAbdal MalikAbelard, P.AboukirAboukir, cruiserAbraham the PatriarchAbsolutismAbu BekrAbul AbbasAbul FazlAbyssiniaAbyssinian Christians; languageAcadémie des SciencesAcademy of InscriptionsAcreAct of UnionActium battle ofActs of the ApostlesAdam and EveAdams, Prof. G.
