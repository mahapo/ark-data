WELLS, the third son of a small shopkeeper, was born in Bromley in 1866.After two years’ apprenticeship in a draper’s shop, he became a pupil-teacher atMidhurst Grammar School and won a scholarship to study under T. H. Huxley at theNormal School of Science, South Kensington. He taught biology before becoming aprofessional writer and journalist. He wrote more than a hundred books,including novels, essays, histories and programmes for world regeneration.Wells, who rose from obscurity to world fame, had an emotionally andintellectually turbulent life. His prophetic imagination was first displayed inpioneering works of science fiction such as The Time Machine (1895), The Islandof Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897) and The War of the Worlds(1898). Later he became an apostle of socialism, science and progress, whoseanticipations of a future world state include The Shape of Things to Come(1933). His controversial views on sexual equality and women’s rights wereexpressed in the novels Ann Veronica (1909) and The New Machiavelli (1911). Hewas, in Bertrand Russell’s words, ‘an important liberator of thought andaction’.Wells drew on his own early struggles in many of his best novels, including Loveand Mr Lewisham (1900), Kipps (1905), Tono-Bungay (1909) and The History of MrPolly (1910). His educational works, some written in collaboration, include TheOutline of History (1920) and The Science of Life (1930). His Experiment inAutobiography (2, 1934) reviews his world. He died in London in 1946.PATRICK PARRINDER took his MA and Ph.D. at Cambridge University, where he held aFellowship at King’s College and published his first two books on Wells, H. G.Wells (1970) and H. G. Wells: The Critical Heritage (1972). He has been Chairmanof the H. G. Wells Society and editor of the Wellsian, and has also written onJames Joyce, science fiction, literary criticism and the history of the Englishnovel. His book Shadows of the Future (1995) brings together his interests inWells, science fiction and literary prophecy. Since 1986 he has been Professorof English at the University of Reading.MARGARET ATWOOD was born in 1939 in Ottawa and grew up in northern Ontario andQuebec, and Toronto.

Hisfather, formerly a professional gardener and a county cricketer renowned for hisfast bowling, owned a small business in Bromley High Street selling china goodsand cricket bats. The house was grandly known as Atlas House, but the centre offamily life was a cramped basement kitchen underneath the shop. Soon JosephWells’s cricketing days were cut short by a broken leg, and the family fortuneslooked bleak.Young ‘Bertie’ Wells had already shown great academic promise, but when he wasthirteen, his family broke up and he was forced to earn his own living. Hisfather was bankrupt, and his mother left home to become resident housekeeper atUppark, the great Sussex country house where she had worked as a lady’s maidbefore her marriage. Wells was taken out of school to follow his two elderbrothers into the drapery trade. After serving briefly as a pupil-teacher and apharmacist’s assistant, in 1881 he was apprenticed to a department store inSouthsea, working a thirteen-hour day and sleeping in a dormitory with hisfellow-apprentices. This was the unhappiest period of his life, though he wouldlater revisit it in comic romances such as Kipps (1905) and The History of MrPolly (1910). Kipps and Polly both manage to escape from their servitude asdrapers, and in 1883, helped by his long-suffering mother, Wells cancelled hisindentures and obtained a post as teaching assistant at Midhurst Grammar Schoolnear Uppark. His intellectual development, long held back, now progressedastonishingly. He passed a series of examinations in science subjects and, inSeptember 1884, entered the Normal School of Science, South Kensington (later tobecome part of Imperial College of Science and Technology) on a governmentscholarship.Wells was a born teacher, as many of his books would show, and at first he wasan enthusiastic student. He had the good fortune to be taught biology andzoology by one of the most influential scientific thinkers of the Victorian age,Darwin’s friend and supporter T. H. Huxley. Wells never forgot Huxley’steaching, but the other professors were more humdrum, and his interest in theircourses rapidly waned. He scraped through second-year physics, but failed histhird-year geology exam and left South Kensington in 1887 without taking adegree. He was thrilled by the theoretical framework and imaginative horizons ofnatural science, but impatient of practical detail and the grinding, routinetasks of laboratory work. He cut his classes and spent his time readingliterature and history, satisfying the curiosity he had earlier felt whileexploring the long-neglected library at Uppark. He started a college magazine,the Science Schools Journal, and argued for socialism in student debates.In the summer of 1887 Wells became science master at a small private school inNorth Wales, but a few weeks later he was knocked down and injured by one of hispupils on the football field. Sickly and undernourished as a result of threeyears of student poverty, he suffered severe kidney and lung damage. Aftermonths of convalescence at Uppark he was able to return to science teaching atHenley House School, Kilburn. In 1890 he passed his University of London B.Sc.(Hons.) with a first class in zoology and obtained a post as a biology tutor forthe University Correspondence College. In 1891 he married his cousin IsabelWells, but they had little in common and soon Wells fell in love with one of hisstudents, Amy Catherine Robbins (usually known as ‘Jane’). They started livingtogether in 1893, and married two years later when his divorce came through.During his years as a biology tutor Wells slowly began making his way as awriter and journalist. He wrote for the Educational Times, edited the UniversityCorrespondent, and in 1891 published a philosophical essay, ‘The Rediscovery ofthe Unique’, in the prestigious Fortnightly Review. His first book was aTextbook of Biology (1893). But no sooner was it published than his health againcollapsed, forcing him to give up teaching and rely entirely on his literaryearnings. His future seemed highly precarious, yet soon he was in regular demandas a writer of short stories and humorous essays for the burgeoning newspapersand magazines of the period. He became a fiction reviewer and, for a shortperiod in 1895, a theatre critic.Ever since his student days Wells had worked intermittently on a story abouttime-travelling and the possible future of the human race. An early version waspublished in the Science Schools Journal as ‘The Chronic Argonauts’, but now,after numerous redrafts and much encouragement from the poet and editor W. E.Henley, it finally took shape as The Time Machine (1895). Its success wasinstantaneous, and while it was running as a magazine serial Wells was alreadybeing spoken of as a ‘man of genius’. He was celebrated as the inventor of the‘scientific romance’, a combination of adventure novel and philosophical tale inwhich the hero becomes involved in a life-and-death struggle resulting from someunforeseen scientific development. There was now a ready market for his fiction,and The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), The War of theWorlds (1898), When the Sleeper Wakes (1899; later revised as The SleeperAwakes, 1910), The First Men in the Moon (1901) and several other volumesfollowed quickly from his pen.By the turn of the twentieth century Wells was established as a popular authorin England and America, and his books were rapidly being translated into French,German, Spanish, Russian and other European languages. Already his fame hadbegun to eclipse that of his predecessor in scientific romance, the Frenchauthor Jules Verne, who had dominated the field since the 1860s. But Wells, anincreasingly self-conscious artist, had larger ambitions than to go down inhistory as a boys’ adventure novelist like Jules Verne. Love and Mr Lewisham(1900) was his first attempt at realistic fiction, comic in spirit andmanifestly reflecting his own experiences as a student and teacher. By the endof the Edwardian decade, when he wrote his ‘Condition of England’ novelsTono-Bungay (1909) and The New Machiavelli (1911), Wells had become one of theleading novelists of his day, the friend and rival of such literary figures asArnold Bennett, Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford and Henry James.But Wells was never a devotee of art for art’s sake; he was a prophetic writerwith a social and political message. His first major non-fictional work wasAnticipations (1902), a book of futurological essays setting out the possibleeffects of scientific and technological progress in the twentieth century.Anticipations brought him into contact with the Fabian Society and launched hiscareer as a political journalist and an influential voice of the British left.During his Fabian period Wells wrote A Modern Utopia (1905), but failed in hisattempt to challenge the bureaucratic, reformist outlook of the Society’sleaders such as Bernard Shaw (a lifelong friend and rival) and Beatrice Webb.Well’s Edwardian scientific romances such as The Food of the Gods (1904) and TheWar in the Air (1908), though full of humorous touches, are propagandist inintent. In other ‘future war’ stories of this period he predicted the tank andthe atomic bomb.Success as an author brought about great changes in his personal life.Ill-health had forced him to leave London for the Kent coast in 1898, but in thelong run the only legacy of his footballing injury was the diabetes thataffected him in old age. He commissioned a house, Spade House, overlooking theEnglish Channel at Sandgate, from the architect C. F. A. Voysey, and here hisand Jane’s two sons were born – George Philip or ‘Gip’, who became a zoologyprofessor and collaborated with his father and Julian Huxley on the biologyencyclopedia The Science of Life (1930), and Frank, who worked in the filmindustry. Wells gave generous support to his parents and to his eldest brother,who was a fellow-fugitive from the drapery trade. Increasingly, however, helooked for emotional fulfilment outside the family, and his sexual affairsbecame notorious. He had a daughter in 1909 with Amber Reeves, a leading youngFabian economist, and in 1914 the novelist and critic Rebecca West gave birth tohis son Anthony West, whose troubled childhood would later be reflected in hisown novel Heritage (1955) and in his biography of his father.As Wells’s personal life became the gossip of literary London, his roles asimaginative writer and political journalist or prophet came increasingly intoconflict. Ann Veronica (1909) was an example of topical, controversial fiction,dramatizing and commenting on such issues as women’s rights, sexual equality andcontemporary morals. It was the first of Wells’s ‘discussion novels’ in whichhis personal relationships were often very thinly disguised. His later fictiontakes a great variety of forms, but it all belongs to the broad category of thenovel of ideas. At one extreme is the realistic reporting of Mr Britling Sees ItThrough (1916) – still valuable and unique as a portrayal of the English ‘homefront’ in the First World War – while at the other extreme are brief fables suchas The Undying Fire (1919) and The Croquet Player (1936), political allegoriesabout world events each cast in the form of a prophetic dialogue.Wells was by no means an experimental novelist like his younger contemporariesJames Joyce and Virginia Woolf, but he was often technically innovative, and insome of his books the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction begin to breakdown. Sometimes he would take a classic from an earlier, premodern epoch as hisliterary model: A Modern Utopia (1905), for example, refers back to Sir ThomasMore’s Utopia and Plato’s Republic. His bestselling historical works The Outlineof History (1920) and A Short History of the World (1922) break with historicalconventions by looking forward to the next stage in history. These works werewritten in order to draw the lessons of the First World War and to ensure that,if possible, its carnage would never be repeated; Wells saw history as a ‘racebetween education and catastrophe’. The same concerns led to his future-historynovel The Shape of Things to Come (1933), later rewritten for the cinema asThings to Come, an epic science-fiction film produced in 1936 by AlexanderKorda. Both novel and film contain dire warnings about the inevitable outbreakand disastrous consequences of the Second World War.By the 1920s, Wells was not only a famous author but a public figure whose namewas rarely out of the newspapers. He briefly worked for the Ministry ofPropaganda in 1918, producing a memorandum on war aims which anticipated thesetting-up of the League of Nations. In 1922 and 1923 he stood for Parliament asa Labour candidate. He sought to influence world leaders, including two USPresidents, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt. His meeting with Leninin the Kremlin in 1920 and his interview in 1934 with Lenin’s successor JosefStalin were publicized all over the world. His high-pitched, piping voice wasoften heard on BBC radio. In 1933 he was elected president of International PEN,the writers’ organization campaigning for intellectual freedom. In the same yearhis books were publicly burnt by the Nazis in Berlin, and he was banned fromvisiting Fascist Italy. His ideas strongly influenced the Pan-European Union,the pressure group advocating European unity between the wars.But Wells became convinced that nothing less than global unity was needed ifhumanity was not to destroy itself. In The Open Conspiracy (1928) and otherbooks he outlined his theories of world citizenship and world government. As theSecond World War drew nearer he felt that his mission had been a failure and hiswarnings had gone unheeded. His last great campaign, for which he tried toobtain international support, was for human rights. The proposal set out in hisPenguin Special The Rights of Man (1940) helped to bring about the UnitedNations declaration of 1948. He spent the war years at his house in HanoverTerrace, Regent’s Park, and was awarded a D.Litt. by London University in 1943.His last book, Mind at the End of Its Tether (1945), was a despairing,pessimistic work, even bleaker in its prospects for mankind than The TimeMachine fifty years earlier. He died at Hanover Terrace on 13 August 1946. Hewas restless and tireless to the end, a prophet eternally dissatisfied withhimself and with humanity. ‘Some day’, he had written in a whimsical‘Auto-Obituary’ three years earlier, ‘I shall write a book, a real book.’ He hadpublished over fifty works of fiction and, in total, some 150 and pamphlets.Patrick ParrinderINTRODUCTION(New readers are advised that this Introduction makes the details of the plotexplicit.)H. G. Wells’s The Island of Doctor Moreau is one of those books that, once read,is rarely forgotten. Jorge Luis Borges called it an ‘atrocious miracle’ and madelarge claims for it. Speaking of Wells’s early tales – The Island of DoctorMoreau among them – he said, ‘I think they will be incorporated, like the fablesof Theseus or Ahasuerus, into the general memory of the species and eventranscend the fame of their creator or the extinction of the language in whichthey were written’ (Other Inquisitions 1932–1952, 1968).This has proved true, if film may be considered a language unto itself. TheIsland of Doctor Moreau has inspired three films – two of them quite bad – anddoubtless few who saw them remembered that it was Wells who authored the book.The story has taken on a life of its own, and, like the offspring of MaryShelley’s Frankenstein, has acquired attributes and meanings not present in theoriginal. Moreau himself, in his filmic incarnations, has drifted towards thetype of the Mad Scientist, or the Peculiar Genetic Engineer, or theTyrant-in-training, bent on taking over the world; whereas Wells’s Moreau iscertainly not mad, and is a mere vivisectionist, and has no ambitions to takeover anything whatsoever.Borges’s use of the word ‘fable’ is suggestive, for – despite the realisticallyrendered details of its surface – the book is certainly not a novel, if by thatwe mean a prose narrative dealing with observable social life. ‘Fable’ points toa certain folkloric quality that lurks in the pattern of this curious work, asanimal faces may lurk in the fronds and flowers of an Aubrey Beardsley design.The term may also indicate a lie – something fabulous or invented, as opposed tothat which demonstrably exists – and employed this way it is quite apt, as noman ever did or ever will turn animals into human beings by cutting them up andsewing them together again. In its commonest sense, a fable is a tale – likethose of Aesop – meant to convey some useful lesson. But what is that usefullesson? It is certainly not spelled out by Wells.‘Work that endures is always capable of an infinite and plastic ambiguity; it isall things for all men,’ says Borges, ‘… and it must be ambiguous in anevanescent and modest way, almost in spite of the author; he must appear to beignorant of all symbolism. Wells displayed that lucid innocence in his firstfantastic exercises, which are to me the most admirable part of his admirablework’. Borges carefully did not say that Wells employed no symbolism: only thathe appeared to be ignorant of doing so.Here follows what I hope will be an equally modest attempt to probe beneath theappearance, to examine the infinite and plastic ambiguity, to touch on thesymbolism that Wells may or may not have employed deliberately, and to try todiscover what the useful lesson – if there is one – might be.TEN WAYS OF LOOKING AT THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU1. ELOIS AND MORLOCKSThe Island of Doctor Moreau was published in 1896, when H. G. Wells was onlythirty years old. It followed The Time Machine, which had appeared the yearbefore, and was to be followed two years later by The War of the Worlds, thisbeing the book that established Wells as a force to be reckoned with at a merethirty-two years of age.To some of literature’s more gentlemanly practitioners – those, for instance,who had inherited money, and didn’t have to make it by scribbling – Wells musthave seemed like a puffed-up little counter-jumper, and a challenging one atthat, because he was bright. He’d come up the hard way. In the stratifiedEnglish social world of the time, he was neither working class nor top crust.His father was an unsuccessful tradesman; he himself apprenticed with a draperfor two years before wending his way, via school-teaching and a scholarship, tothe Normal School of Science. Here he studied under Darwin’s famous apologist,Thomas Henry Huxley. He graduated with a first-class degree, but he’d beenseriously injured by one of the students while teaching, an event that put himoff school-mastering. It was after this that he turned to writing.The Time Traveller in The Time Machine – written just before The Island ofDoctor Moreau – finds that human beings in the future have split into twodistinct races. The Eloi are pretty as butterflies, but useless; the grim andugly Morlocks live underground, make everything, and come out at night to devourthe Eloi, whose needs they also supply. The upper classes, in other words, havebecome a bevy of upper-class twitterers and have lost the ability to fend forthemselves, and the working classes have become vicious and cannibalistic.Wells was neither an Eloi nor a Morlock. He must have felt he represented athird way, a rational being who had climbed up the ladder through ability alone,without partaking of the foolishness and impracticality of the social strataabove his nor of the brutish crudeness of those below.But what about Prendick, the narrator of The Island of Doctor Moreau ? He’s beenpootling idly about the world, for his own diversion we assume, when he’sshipwrecked. The ship is called the Lady Vain, surely a comment on the snootyaristocracy. Prendick himself is a ‘private gentleman’ who doesn’t have to workfor a living, and, though he – like Wells – has studied with Huxley, he has doneso not out of necessity but out of dilettantish boredom – ‘as a relief from thedullness of [his] comfortable independence’. Prendick, though not quite ashelpless as a full-fledged Eloi, is well on the path to becoming one. Thus hishysteria, his lassitude, his moping, his ineffectual attempts at fair play, andhis lack of common sense – he can’t figure out how to make a raft because he’snever done ‘any carpentry or suchlike work’ in his life, and when he does manageto patch something together, he’s situated it too far from the sea and it fallsapart when he’s dragging it. Although Prendick is not a complete waste of time –if he were, he wouldn’t be able to hold our attention while he tells his story-he’s nonetheless in the same general league as the weak-chinned curate in thelater War of the Worlds, that helpless and drivelling ‘spoiled child of life’.His name – Prendick – is suggestive of ‘thick’ coupled with ‘prig’, this last athing he is explicitly called. To those versed in legal lore, it could suggest‘prender’, a term for something you are empowered to take without it having beenoffered. But it more nearly suggests ‘prentice’, a word that would have beenfloating close to the top of Wells’s semi-consciousness, due to his own stint asan apprentice. Now it’s the upper-class’s turn at apprenticeship! Time for oneof them to undergo a little degradation and learn a thing or two. But what?2. SIGNS OF THE TIMESThe Island of Doctor Moreau not only comes midway in Wells’s most fertile periodof fantastic inventiveness, it also comes during such a period in Englishliterary history. Adventure romance had taken off with Robert Louis Stevenson’sTreasure Island in 1882, and Rider Haggard had done him one better with She in1887. This latter coupled straight adventure – shipwreck, tramps throughdangerous swamps and nasty shrubbery, encounters with bloody-minded savages, funin steep ravines and dim grottos – with a big dollop of weirdness carried overfrom earlier Gothic traditions, done up this time in a package labelled ‘NotSupernatural’. The excessive powers of ‘She’ are ascribed, not to a closeencounter with a vampire or god, but to a dip in a revolving pillar of fire, nomore supernatural than lightning. ‘She’ gets her powers from Nature.It’s from this blend – the grotesque and the ‘natural’ – that Wells took hiscue. An adventure story that would once have featured battles with fantasticmonsters – dragons, gorgons, hydras – keeps the exotic scenery, but the monstershave been produced by the very agency that was seen by many in late VictorianEngland as the bright, new, shiny salvation of mankind: Science.The other blend that proved so irresistible to readers was one that wasdeveloped much earlier, and to singular advantage, by Jonathan Swift: a plain,forthright style in the service of incredible events. Poe, that master of theuncanny, piles on the adjectives to create ‘atmosphere’; Wells, on the otherhand, follows R. L. Stevenson and anticipates Hemingway in his terse, almostjournalistic approach, usually the hallmark of the ultra-realists. The War ofthe Worlds shows Wells employing this combination to best effect – we thinkwe’re reading a series of news reports and eyewitness accounts – but he’salready honing it in The Island of Doctor Moreau. A tale told somatter-of-factly and with such an eye to solid detail surely cannot be – we feel– either an invention or an hallucination.3. SCIENTIFICWells is acknowledged to be one of the foremost creators in the genre we nowknow as ‘science fiction’. As Robert Silverberg has said, ‘Every time-traveltale written since The Time Machine is fundamentally indebted to Wells… In thistheme, as in most of science fiction’s great themes, Wells was there first’(Voyagers in Time: Twelve Great Science Fiction Stories, 1970).‘Science fiction’ as a term was unknown to Wells. It did not make its appearanceuntil the late 1920s, in America, then coming to prominence in the 1930s, duringthe golden age of bug-eyed monsters and girls in brass brassières.1 Wellshimself referred to his science-oriented fictions as ‘scientific romances’ – aterm that did not originate with him, but with the lesser-known writer CharlesHoward Hinton.There are several interpretations of the term ‘science’. If it implies the knownand the possible, then Wells’s scientific romances are by no means scientific:he paid little attention to such boundaries. As Jules Verne remarked withdispleasure, ‘Il invente!’ (‘He makes it up!’). The ‘science’ part of thesetales is embedded instead in a world-view that derived from Wells’s study ofDarwinian principles under Huxley, and has to do with the grand concern thatengrossed him throughout his career: the nature of man. This too may account forhis veering between extreme Utopianism (if man is the result of evolution, notof Divine creation, surely he can evolve yet further?) and the deepest pessimism(if man derived from the animals and is akin to them, rather than to the angels,surely he might slide back the way he came?). The Island of Doctor Moreaubelongs to the debit side of the Wellsian account book.Darwin’s The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man were a profound shock tothe Victorian system. Gone was the God who spoke the world into being in sevendays and made man out of clay; in his place stood millions of years ofevolutionary change and a family tree that included primates. Gone too was thekindly Wordsworthian version of Mother Nature that had presided over the firstyears of the century; in her stead was Tennyson’s ‘Nature, red in tooth andclaw/ With ravin’ (‘In Memoriam’). The devouring femme fatale that became soiconic in the 1880s and 1890s owes a lot to Darwin. So does the imagery andcosmogony of The Island of Doctor Moreau.4. ROMANCESo much for the ‘scientific’ in ‘scientific romance’. What about the ‘romance’?In both ‘scientific romance’ and ‘science fiction’, the scientific element ismerely an adjective; the nouns are ‘romance’ and ‘fiction’. In respect to Wells,‘romance’ is more helpful than ‘fiction’.‘Romance’, in today’s general usage, is what happens on Valentine’s Day. As aliterary term it has slipped in rank somewhat – being now applied to such thingsas Harlequin Romances – but it was otherwise understood in the nineteenthcentury, when it was used in opposition to the term ‘novel’. The novel dealtwith known social life, but a romance could deal with the long ago and the faraway. It was also allowed much more latitude in terms of plot. In a romance,event follows exciting event at breakneck pace. As a rule, this has caused theromance to be viewed by the high literati – those bent more on instruction thanon delight – as escapist and vulgar, a judgement that goes back at least 2,000years.In The Secular Scripture (1976), Northrop Frye provides an exhaustive analysisof the structure and elements of the romance as a form. Typically a romancebegins with a break in ordinary consciousness, traditionally signalled by ashipwreck, frequently linked with a kidnapping by pirates. Exotic climes are afeature, especially exotic desert islands; so are strange creatures.In the sinister portions of a romance, the protagonist is often imprisoned ortrapped, or lost in a labyrinth or maze, or in a forest that serves the samepurpose. Boundaries between the normal levels of life dissolve: vegetablebecomes animal, animal becomes quasi-human, human reverts to animal. If the leadcharacter is female, an attempt will be made on her virtue, which she managesmiraculously to preserve. A rescue, however improbable, restores the protagonistto his or her previous life and reunites him or her with loved ones. Pericles,Prince of Tyre is a romance. It’s got everything but talking dogs.The Island of Doctor Moreau is also a romance, though a dark one. Consider theshipwreck. Consider the break in the protagonist’s consciousness – the multiplebreaks, in fact. Consider the pirates, here supplied by the vile captain andcrew of the Ipecacuanha. Consider the name Ipecacuanha, signifying an emetic andpurgative: the break in consciousness is going to have a nasty physical side toit, of a possibly medicinal kind. Consider the fluid boundaries between animaland human. Consider the island.5. THE ENCHANTED ISLANDThe name given to the island by Wells is Noble’s Island, a patent irony as wellas another poke at the class system. Say it quickly and slur a little, and it’sno blessed island.This island has many literary antecedents, and several descendants. Foremostamong the latter is William Golding’s island in Lord of the Flies – a book thatowes something to The Island of Doctor Moreau, as well as to those adventurebooks Coral Island and The Swiss Family Robinson, and of course to the greatoriginal shipwreck-on-an-island classic, Robinson Crusoe. Moreau could bethought of as one in a long line of island-castaway books.All those just mentioned, however, keep within the boundaries set by thepossible. The Island of Doctor Moreau is, on the contrary, a work of fantasy,and its more immediate grandparents are to be found elsewhere. The Tempestsprings immediately to mind: here is a beautiful island, belonging at first to awitch, then taken over by a magician who lays down the law, particularly to themalignant, animal-like Caliban, who will obey only when pain is inflicted onhim. Doctor Moreau could be seen as a sinister version of Prospero, surroundedby a hundred or so Calibans of his own creation.But Wells himself points us towards another enchanted island. When Prendickmistakenly believes that the Beast Men he’s seen were once men, he says:‘[Moreau] had merely intended… to fall upon me with a fate more horrible thandeath, with torture, and after torture the most hideous degradation it waspossible to conceive – to send me off, a lost soul, a beast, to the rest of[the] Comus rout’.Comus, in the masque of that name by Milton, is a powerful sorcerer who rules alabyrinthine forest. He’s the son of the enchantress Circe, who in Greek mythwas the daughter of the Sun and lived on the island of Aeaea. Odysseus landedthere during his wanderings, and Circe transformed his crew into pigs. She has awhole menagerie of other kinds of animals – wolves, lions – that also were oncemen. Her island is an island of transformation: man to beast (and then to managain, once Odysseus gets the upper hand).As for Comus, he leads a band of creatures, once men, who have drunk from hisenchanted cup and have turned into hybrid monsters – they retain their humanbodies, but their heads are those of beasts of all kinds. Thus changed, theyindulge in sensual revels. Christina Rossetti’s ‘Goblin Market’, with itsanimal-form goblins who tempt chastity and use luscious edibles as bait, issurely a late offshoot of Comus.As befits an enchanted island, Moreau’s island is both semi-alive and female,but not in a pleasant way. It’s volcanic, and emits from time to time asulphurous reek. It comes equipped with flowers, and also with clefts andravines, fronded on either side. Moreau’s Beast Men live in one of these, andsince they do not have very good table manners it has rotting food in it and itsmells bad. When the Beast Men start to lose their humanity and revert to theirbeast-natures, this locale becomes the site of a moral breakdown that isspecifically sexual.What is it that leads us to believe that Prendick will never have a girlfriend?6. THE UNHOLY TRINITYNor will Doctor Moreau. There is no Mrs Moreau on the island. There are nofemale human beings at all.Similarly, the God of the Old Testament has no wife. Wells called The Island ofDoctor Moreau ‘a youthful piece of blasphemy’, and it’s obvious that he intendedMoreau – that strong, solitary gentlemen with the white hair and beard – toresemble traditional paintings of God. He surrounds Moreau with semi-biblicallanguage, as well: Moreau is the lawgiver of the island; those of his creatureswho go against his will are punished and tortured; he is a god of whim and pain.But he isn’t a real God, because he cannot create; he can only imitate, and hisimitations are poor.What drives him on? His sin is the sin of pride, combined with a cold‘intellectual passion’. He wants to know everything. He wishes to discover thesecrets of life. His ambition is to be as God the Creator. As such, he followsin the wake of several other aspirants, including Doctor Frankenstein andNathaniel Hawthorne’s various alchemists. Doctor Faustus hovers in thebackground, but he wanted youth and wealth and sex in return for his soul andMoreau has no interest in such things: he despises what he calls ‘materialism’,which includes pleasure and pain. He dabbles in bodies, but wishes to detachhimself from his own. (He has some literary brothers: Sherlock Holmes wouldunderstand his bloodless intellectual passion. So would Oscar Wilde’s Lord HenryWotton, of that earlier fin de siècle transformation novel The Picture of DorianGray.)But in Christianity, God is a Trinity, and on Moreau’s island there are threebeings whose names begin with M. Moreau as a name combines the syllable ‘mor’ –from mors, mortis, no doubt – with the French for ‘water’, suitable in one whoaims at exploring the limits of plasticity. The whole word means ‘Moor’ inFrench. So the very white Moreau is also the Black Man of witchcraft tales, asort of anti-God.Montgomery, his alcoholic assistant, has the face of a sheep. He acts as theintercessor between the Beast Folk and Moreau, and in this function stands infor Christ the Son. He’s first seen offering Prendick a red drink that tasteslike blood and some boiled mutton. Is there a hint of an ironic CommunionService here – blood drink, flesh of the Lamb? The communion Prendick entersinto by drinking the red drink is the communion of carnivores, that humancommunion forbidden to the Beast Folk. But it’s a communion he was part ofanyway.The third person of the Trinity is the Holy Spirit, usually portrayed as a dove– God in living but non-human form. The third M-creature on the island isM’Ling, the beast-creature who serves as Montgomery’s attendant. He too entersinto the communion of blood: he licks his fingers while preparing a rabbit forthe human beings to eat. The Holy Spirit as a deformed and idiotic man-animal?As a piece of youthful blasphemy, The Island of Doctor Moreau was even moreblasphemous than most commentators have realized.Just so we don’t miss it, Wells puts a serpent-beast into his dubious garden: acreature that was completely evil and very strong, and that bent a gun-barrelinto the letter S. Can Satan, too, be created by man? If so, blasphemous indeed.7. THE NEW WOMAN AS CATWOMANThere are no female human beings on Moreau’s island, but Moreau is busily makingone. The experiment on which he’s engaged for most of the book concerns hisattempt to turn a female puma into the semblance of a woman.Wells was more than interested in members of the cat family, as Brian Aldisspointed out in his introduction to the 1993 Everyman edition of the novel.During his affair with Rebecca West, she was ‘Panther’, he was ‘Jaguar’. But‘cat’ has another connotation: in slang, it meant ‘prostitute’. This isMontgomery’s allusion when he says – while the puma is yelling under the knife –‘I’m damned… if this place is not as bad as Gower Steet – with its cats’.Prendick himself makes the connection explicit on his return to London when heshies away from the ‘prowling women (who) would mew after me’.‘I have worked hard at her head and brain,’ says Moreau of the puma, ‘… I willmake a rational creature of my own’. But the puma resists. She’s almost a woman– she weeps like one – but when Moreau begins torturing her again, she utters a‘shriek almost exactly like that of an angry virago’. Then she tears her fetterout of the wall and runs away, a great bleeding scarred suffering femalemonster. It is she who kills Moreau.Like many men of his time, Wells was obsessed with the New Woman. On the surfaceof it he was all in favour of sexual emancipation, including free love, but thefreeing of Woman evidently had its frightening aspects. Rider Haggard’s She canbe seen as a reaction to the feminist movement of his day – if women are grantedpower, men are doomed – and so can Wells’s deformed puma. Once the powerfulmonstrous sexual cat tears her fetter out of the wall and gets loose, minus theimproved brain she ought to have courtesy of Man the Scientist, look out.8. THE WHITENESS OF MOREAU, THE BLACKNESS OF M’LINGWells was not the only nineteenth-century English writer who used furrycreatures to act out English socio-dramas. Lewis Carroll had done it in awhimsical way in the Alice books, Kipling in a more militaristic fashion in TheJungle Books.Kipling made the Law sound kind of noble, in The Jungle Books. Not so Wells. TheLaw mumbled by the animal-men in Moreau is a horrible parody of Christian andJewish liturgy; it vanishes completely when the language of the beastsdissolves, indicating that it was a product of language, not some eternalGod-given creed.Wells was writing at a time when the British Empire still held sway but thecracks were already beginning to show. Moreau’s island is a little colonialenclave of the most hellish sort. It’s no accident that most (although not all)of the Beast Folk are black or brown, that they are at first thought by Prendickto be ‘savages’ or ‘natives’, and that they speak in a kind of mangled English.They are employed as servants and slaves, a regime that’s kept in place withwhip and gun; they secretly hate the real ‘men’ as much as they fear them, andthey disobey the Law as much as possible and kick over the traces as soon asthey can. They kill Moreau and they kill Montgomery and they kill M’Ling, and,unless Prendick can get away, they will kill him too, although at first he ‘goesnative’ and lives among them, and does things that fill him with disgust, andthat he would rather not mention.White man’s burden, indeed.9. THE MODERN ANCIENT MARINERThe way in which Prendick escapes from the island is noteworthy. He sees a smallboat with a sail and lights a fire to hail it. It approaches, though strangelyit doesn’t sail with the wind, but yaws and veers. There are two figures in it,one with red hair. As the boat enters the bay, ‘Suddenly a great white bird flewup out of the boat, and neither of the men stirred. It circled round, and thencame sweeping overhead with its strong wings outspread’. This bird cannot be agull: it’s too big and solitary. The only white seabird usually described as‘great’ is the albatross.The two figures in the boat are dead. But it is this death-boat, thislife-in-death coffin-boat, that proves the salvation of Prendick.In what other work of English literature do we find a lone man reduced to apitiable state, a boat that sails without a wind, two death-figures, one withunusual hair, and a great white bird? The work is of course ‘The Rime of theAncient Mariner’, which revolves around man’s proper relation to Nature, andconcludes that this proper relation is one of love. It is when he manages tobless the sea-serpents that the Mariner is freed from the curse he has broughtupon himself by shooting the albatross.The Island of Doctor Moreau also revolves around man’s proper relation toNature, but its conclusions are quite different, because Nature itself is seendifferently. It is no longer the Nature eulogized by Wordsworth, that benevolentmotherly entity who never did betray that heart that loved her, for betweenColeridge and Wells came Darwin.The lesson learned by the albatross-shooting Mariner is summed up by him at theend of the poem:He prayeth well, who loveth wellBoth man and bird and beast.He prayeth best, who loveth bestAll things both great and small;For the dear God who loveth us,He made and loveth all.In the Ancient-Mariner-like pattern at the end of The Island of Doctor Moreau,the ‘albatross’ is still alive. It has suffered no harm at the hands ofPrendick. But he lives in the shadow of a curse anyway. His curse is that hecan’t love or bless anything living: not bird, not beast, and most certainly notman. He is weighed down by another curse, too: the Ancient Mariner is doomed totell his tale, and those who hear it are convinced by it. But Prendick choosesnot to tell, because, when he tries, no one will believe him.10. FEAR AND TREMBLINGWhat then is the lesson learned by the unfortunate Prendick? It can perhaps bestbe understood in reference to The Ancient Mariner. The God of Moreau’s islandcan scarcely be described as a dear God who makes and loves all creatures. IfMoreau is seen to stand for a version of God the Creator who ‘makes’ livingthings, he has done – in Prendick’s final view – a very bad job. Similarly, ifGod can be considered as a sort of Moreau, and if the equation ‘Moreau is to hisanimals as God is to man’ may stand, then God himself is accused of cruelty andindifference – making man for fun and to satisfy his own curiosity and pride,laying laws on him he cannot understand or obey, then abandoning him to a lifeof torment.Prendick cannot love the distorted and violent furry folk on the island, andit’s just as hard for him to love the human beings he encounters on his returnto ‘civilization’. Like Swift’s Gulliver, he can barely stand the sight of hisfellow-men. He lives in a state of queasy fear, inspired by his continuedexperience of dissolving boundaries: as the beasts on the island have at timesappeared human, the human beings he encounters in England appear bestial. Hedisplays his modernity by going to a ‘mental specialist’, but this provides onlya partial remedy. He feels himself to be ‘an animal tormented… sent to wanderalone…’.Prendick forsakes his earlier dabblings in biology, and turns instead tochemistry and astronomy. He finds ‘hope’ – ‘a sense of infinite peace andprotection in the glittering hosts of heaven’. As if to squash even this fainthope, Wells almost immediately wrote The War of the Worlds, in which not peaceand protection, but malice and destruction, come down from the heavens in theform of the monstrous but superior Martians.The War of the Worlds can be read as a further gloss on Darwin. Is this whereevolution will lead – to the abandonment of the body, to giant sexlessbloodsucking heads with huge brains and tentacle-like fingers? But it can alsobe read as a thoroughly chilling coda to The Island of Doctor Moreau.Margaret AtwoodNOTE1.

A ‘postscript’ containing the previouslysuppressed narrative of his sexual liaisons was published as H. G. Wells inLove, edited by his son G. P. Wells (London: Faber & Faber, 1984). His morerecent biographers draw on this material, as well as on the large body ofletters and personal papers archived at the University of Illinois andelsewhere. The fullest and most scholarly biographies are The Time Traveller byNorman and Jeanne Mackenzie (2nd edn, London: Hogarth Press, 1987) and H. G.Wells: Desperately Mortal by David C. Smith (New Haven and London: YaleUniversity Press, 1986). Smith has also edited a generous selection of Wells’sCorrespondence (4 vols., London: Pickering & Chatto, 1998). Another highlyreadable, if controversial and idiosyncratic, biography is H. G. Wells: Aspectsof a Life (London: Hutchinson, 1984) by Wells’s son Anthony West. Michael Foot’sH. G.: The History of Mr Wells (London and New York: Doubleday, 1995) isenlivened by its author’s personal knowledge of Wells and his circle.Two illuminating general interpretations of Wells and his writings are MichaelDraper’s H. G. Wells (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1987) and Brian Murray’s H. G.Wells (New York: Continuum, 1990). Both are introductory in scope, but Draper’sapproach is critical and philosophical, while Murray packs a remarkable amountof biographical and historical detail into a short space. John Hammond’s An H.G. Wells Companion (London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1979) and H. G. Wells(Harlow and London: Longman, 2001) combine criticism with useful contextualmaterial. H. G. Wells: The Critical Heritage, edited by Patrick Parrinder(London: Routledge, 1972), is a collection of reviews and essays of Wellspublished during his lifetime. A number of specialized critical and scholarlystudies of Wells concentrate on his scientific romances. These include BernardBergonzi’s pioneering study of The Early H. G. Wells (Manchester: ManchesterUniversity Press, 1961); John Huntington, The Logic of Fantasy: H. G. Wells andScience Fiction (New York: Columbia University Press, 1982); and PatrickParrinder, Shadows of the Future: H. G. Wells, Science Fiction and Prophecy(Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1995). Peter Kemp’s H. G. Wells and theCulminating Ape (London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1982) offers a lively and,attimes, lurid tracing of Wells’s ‘biological themes and imaginativeobsessions’, while Roslynn D. Haynes’s H. G. Wells: Discoverer of the Future(London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1980) surveys his use of scientific ideas.W. Warren Wagar, H. G. Wells and the World State (New Haven: Yale UniversityPress, 1961) and John S. Partington, Building Cosmopolis (Aldershot: Ashgate,2003) are studies of his political thought and his schemes for world government.John S. Partington has also edited The Wellsian (The Netherlands: Equilibris,2003), a selection of essays from the H. G. Wells Society’s annual criticaljournal of the same name. The American branch of the Wells Society maintains ahighly informative website at http://hgwellsusa.50megs.comP.P.NOTE ON THE TEXTH. G. Wells began writing The Island of Doctor Moreau in January 1895,immediately after finishing The Time Machine. By April of that year he hadplaced an early version of the story in the hands of his agent, A. P. Watt. Thebook was completed in June, but negotiations over its publication wereprotracted and, unusually for Wells, no magazine serialization was forthcoming.The first London edition was published by William Heinemann in April 1896, whilethe New York edition, subtitled ‘A Possibility’, appeared from Stone and Kimballin August. In a ‘Note’ at the end of both texts Wells draws attention to aSaturday Review article (‘the Limits of Individual Plasticity’, 19 January 1895)where he had set out the substance of Dr Moreau’s explanation in Chapter 14. The‘Note’ adds that:Strange as it may seem to the unscientific reader, there can be no denying that,whatever amount of credibility attaches to the detail of this story, themanufacture of monsters – and perhaps even of quasi-human monsters – is withinthe possibilities of vivisection.Wells made extensive stylistic revisions to The Island of Doctor Moreau for thebenefit of its French translator, Henry-D. Davray, whose version appeared inthree instalments in the Mercure de France (December 1900–February 1901). Some,though by no means all, of these revisions were incorporated into a revisededition published by Heinemann in 1913, which Wells later used as the basis forthe text included in Volume II of the Atlantic Edition of the Works of H. G.Wells (London: T. Fisher Unwin, and New York: Scribner’s, 1924). The Atlantictext was intended to be definitive, but the 1913 Heinemann edition on which itwas based is, unfortunately, unreliable at a number of points. In addition,Wells continued to allow earlier versions of the text to be reprinted during hislifetime. The latest of these reprints was the 1946 Penguin edition, whichcontains two crucial corrections not found in any earlier version. It followsthat a composite text of The Island of Doctor Moreau will best serve the needsof twenty-first-century readers.The present edition therefore follows the Atlantic text, modified as set outbelow. The most difficult decision for an editor of The Island of Doctor Moreauconcerns the Introduction (with a consequent footnote in Chapter 15[chapter15.html]), supposedly by Edward Prendick’s nephew. The Introduction wasincluded in the London and New York first editions but omitted from the 1913Heinemann and the Atlantic. It then reappeared in the 1946 Penguin edition,which was prepared during Wells’s lifetime though actually published a few weeksafter his death. The 1946 version corrects a blatant error in the 1896 editions,changing the longitude of ‘105º E’ to ‘105º W’ and thus placing EdwardPrendick’s disappearance in the Pacific Ocean (and close to the GalapagosIslands). All recent editions of The Island of Doctor Moreau have included theIntroduction, sometimes printing it as an Appendix. In the present edition Ihave followed the precedent of previous Penguin editions by restoring it to themain text and retaining the footnote. The textual source for the Introduction isthe 1946 Penguin.In the Introduction (6:5), Stone and Kimball 1896 and Penguin 1946 read‘Africa’, which is apparently a misreading of Heinemann 1896’s ‘Arica’ (a portin Chile). Apart from the restoration of the Introduction and the footnote inChapter 15 [chapter15.html], the substantive emendations to the Atlantic text inthe present edition are listed below. In addition, the hyphens have been removedfrom about a dozen words, including blood-stained, gun-boat, half-way, to-morrowand to-night, in accordance with modern practice. ‘Any one’ has been changed to‘anyone’, ‘every one’ to ‘everyone’, ‘some one’ to ‘someone’ and ‘leaped’ to‘leapt’ where appropriate. Half a dozen commas found in Heinemann 1913 have beenrestored for the sake of clarity, and two new paragraphs made (27:10, 78:14).The following spellings have been modernized: ‘dinghy’ for ‘dingey’, ‘coconut’for ‘cocoanut’, ‘faggots’ for ‘fagots’, ‘hyena’ for ‘hyæna’.Housestyling of punctuation and spelling has also been implemented to make thetext more accessible to the reader: single quotation marks (for doubles) withdoubles inside singles as needed; end punctuation placed outside end quotationmarks when appropriate; spaced N-dashes (for the heavier, longer M-dash) andM-dashes (for double-length 2M-dash); ‘iz’ spellings (e.g. recognize, notrecognise), and acknowledgements and judgement, not acknowledgments andjudgment; no full stop after personal titles (Dr, Mr, Mrs) or chapter titles,which may not follow the capitalization of the copy-text.SOURCES OF SUBSTANTIVE EMENDATIONSThe list specifies the earliest text containing each reading, using thefollowing abbreviations: A = Atlantic, H 1 = Heinemann 1896, H 2 = Heinemann1913, P = Penguin, S = Stone and Kimball.Page/lineReading adoptedAtlantic reading rejected7:23breaker (H 1)breaker (H 2)42:13raising (H 1)rising (H 2)44:17level place (H 1)level (H 2)59:6or (H 2)of (A)60:32grey (H 1)great (H 2)61:2or (S)nor (H 1)71:9–10modifications (H 1)modification (A)78:19out at (H 1)at (H 2)79:30he had (H 1)he (H 2)81:37[footnote] (H 1)[no footnote] (H 2)94:7others (P)other (H 1)95:36to (H 1)of (H 2)102:9tropical (H 1)hot tropical (H 2)111:32burnt (H 1)burned (A)116:18in the (H 1)in an (H 2)116:20huts (H 1)hut (H 2)117:21–2specked and…propped some(S)fruit, and then, after I hadpropped some speckedand half-decayed (H 1)125:10is as (H 2)is (A)127:3upon these (H 1)upon (A)129:12that had (S)that (H 1)131:34[ends] EDWARDPRENDICK(H 1)[ends] (A)Volume II of the Atlantic Edition contains a brief preface, mainly devoted toThe Sleeper Awakes, but Wells’s remarks on The Island of Doctor Moreau are asfollows. (The ‘scandalous trial’ is evidently that of Oscar Wilde.)The Island of Doctor Moreau was written in 1895, and it was begun while TheWonderful Visit was still in hand. It is a theological grotesque, and theinfluence of Swift is very apparent in it. There was a scandalous trial aboutthat time, the graceless and pitiful downfall of a man of genius, and this storywas the response of an imaginative mind to the reminder that humanity is butanimal rough-hewn to a reasonable shape and in perpetual internal conflictbetween instinct and injunction. This story embodies this ideal, but apart fromthis embodiment it has no allegorical quality. It is written just to give theutmost possible vividness to that conception of men as hewn and confused andtormented beasts. When the reader comes to read the writings upon history inthis collection [in volume XXVII], he will find the same idea of man as areshaped animal no longer in flaming caricature, but as a weighed and settledconviction.The genesis of The Island of Doctor Moreau from the earliest manuscripts to theAtlantic text has been meticulously traced by Bernard Loing in H. G. Wells àl’oeuvre: Les débuts d’un écrivain (1894 – 1900) (Paris: Didier, 1984) and byRobert M. Philmus in his ‘Variorum Text’ edition of The Island of Doctor Moreau(Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1993), to both of which I am greatlyindebted. Four different draft versions of Wells’s novel are in the WellsCollection at the Rare Book and Special Collections Library, University ofIllinois at Urbana-Champaign.P.P."},{"pageContent":"THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAUCONTENTSIntroduction [part.html#int01]I In the Dinghy of the ‘Lady Vain’ [chapter01.html#ch01]II The Man Who Was Going Nowhere [chapter02.html#ch02]III The Strange Face [chapter03.html#ch03]IV At the Schooner’s Rail [chapter04.html#ch04]V The Landing on the Island [chapter05.html#ch05]VI The Evil-Looking Boatmen [chapter06.html#ch06]VII The Locked Door [chapter07.html#ch07]VIII The Crying of the Puma [chapter08.html#ch08]IX The Thing in the Forest [chapter09.html#ch09]X The Crying of the Man [chapter10.html#ch10]XI The Hunting of the Man [chapter11.html#ch11]XII The Sayers of the Law [chapter12.html#ch12]XIII A Parley [chapter13.html#ch13]XIV Doctor Moreau Explains [chapter14.html#ch14]XV Concerning the Beast Folk [chapter15.html#ch15]XVI How the Beast Folk Tasted Blood [chapter16.html#ch16]XVII A Catastrophe [chapter17.html#ch17]XVIII The Finding of Moreau [chapter18.html#ch18]XIX Montgomery’s ‘Bank Holiday’ [chapter19.html#ch19]XX Alone with the Beast Folk [chapter20.html#ch20]XXI The Reversion of the Beast Folk [chapter21.html#ch21]XXII The Man Alone [chapter22.html#ch22]INTRODUCTIONOn February the 1st, 1887, the Lady Vainwas lost by collision with a derelictwhen about the latitude 1º S. and longitude 107ºW.On January the 5th, 1888 – that is, eleven months and four days after – myuncle, Edward Prendick, a private gentleman, who certainly went aboard the LadyVainat Callao,1 [note.html#ifm01en01] and who had been considered drowned, waspicked up in latitude 5º 3’S. and longitude 101ºW. in a small open boat, ofwhich the name was illegible, but which is supposed to have belonged to themissing schooner2 [note.html#ifm01en02] Ipecacuanha. He gave such a strangeaccount of himself that he was supposed demented. Subsequently, he alleged thathis mind was a blank from the moment of his escape from the Lady Vain. His casewas discussed among psychologists at the time as a curious instance of the lapseof memory consequent upon physical and mental stress. The following narrativewas found among his papers by the undersigned, his nephew and heir, butunaccompanied by any definite request for publication.The only island known to exist in the region in which my uncle was picked up isNoble’s Isle, a small volcanic islet, and uninhabited. It was visited in 1891 byH. M. S. Scorpion. A party of sailors then landed, but found nothing livingthereon except certain curious white moths, some hogs and rabbits, and somerather peculiar rats. No specimen was secured of these. So that this narrativeis without confirmation in its most essential particular. With that understood,there seems no harm in putting this strange story before the public, inaccordance, as I believe, with my uncle’s intentions. There is at least thismuch in its behalf: my uncle passed out of human knowledge about latitude 5ºS.and longitude 105ºW., and reappeared in the same part of the ocean after a spaceof eleven months. In some way he must have lived during the interval. And itseems that a schooner called the Ipecacuanha, with a drunken captain, JohnDavis, did start from Arica3 [note.html#ifm01en03] with a puma and certain otheranimals aboard in January 1887, that the vessel was well-known at several portsin the South Pacific, and that it finally disappeared from those seas (with aconsiderable amount of copra aboard), sailing to its unknown fate from Banya inDecember 1887, a date that tallies entirely with my uncle’s story.CHARLES EDWARD PRENDICK"},{"pageContent":"IIN THE DINGHY OF THE ‘LADY VAIN’I do not propose to add anything to what has already been written concerning theloss of the Lady Vain. As everyone knows, she collided with a derelict when tendays out from Callao. The long-boat with seven of the crew was picked upeighteen days after by H. M. gunboat Myrtle, and the story of their privationshas become almost as well known as the far more terrible Medusa case.1[note.html#ich01en01] I have now, however, to add to the published story of theLady Vain another as horrible, and certainly far stranger. It has hitherto beensupposed that the four men who were in the dinghy2 [note.html#ich01en02]perished, but this is incorrect. I have the best of evidence for this assertion– I am one of the four men.But, in the first place, I must state that there never were four men in thedinghy; the number was three. Constans, who was ‘seen by the captain to jumpinto the gig’3 [note.html#ich01en03] (Daily News, March 17, 1887), luckily forus, and unluckily for himself, did not reach us. He came down out of the tangleof ropes under the stays of the smashed bowsprit;4 [note.html#ich01en04] somesmall rope caught his heel as he let go, and he hung for a moment head downward,and then fell and struck a block or spar floating in the water. We pulledtowards him, but he never came up.I say luckily for us he did not reach us, and I might also add luckily forhimself, for there were only a small breaker of water5 [note.html#ich01en05] andsome soddened ship’s biscuits with us – so sudden had been the alarm, sounprepared the ship for any disaster. We thought the people on the launch wouldbe better provisioned (though it seems they were not), and we tried to hailthem. They could not have heard us, and the next morning when the drizzlecleared – which was not until past midday – we could see nothing of them. Wecould not stand up to look about us because of the pitching of the boat. The searan in great rollers, and we had much ado to keep the boat’s head to them. Thetwo other men who had escaped so far with me were a man named Helmar, apassenger like myself, and a seaman whose name I don’t know, a short sturdy manwith a stammer.We drifted famishing, and, after our water had come to an end, tormented by anintolerable thirst, for eight days altogether. After the second day the seasubsided slowly to a glassy calm. It is quite impossible for the ordinary readerto imagine those eight days. He has not – luckily for himself – anything in hismemory to imagine with. After the first day we said little to one another, andlay in our places in the boat and stared at the horizon, or watched, with eyesthat grew larger and more haggard every day, the misery and weakness gainingupon our companions. The sun became pitiless. The water ended on the fourth day,and we were already thinking strange things and saying them with our eyes; butit was, I think, the sixth before Helmar gave voice to the thing we all had inmind.6 [note.html#ich01en06] I remember our voices dry and thin, so that we benttowards one another and spared our words. I stood out against it with all mymight, was rather for scuttling the boat and perishing together among the sharksthat followed us; but when Helmar said that if his proposal was accepted weshould have drink, the sailor came round to him.I would not draw lots, however, and in the night the sailor whispered to Helmaragain and again, and I sat in the bows with my clasp–knife in my hand – though Idoubt if I had the stuff in me to fight. And in the morning I agreed to Helmar’sproposal, and we handed halfpence to find the odd man.The lot fell upon the sailor, but he was the strongest of us and would not abideby it, and attacked Helmar with his hands. They grappled together and almoststood up. I crawled along the boat to them, intending to help Helmar by graspingthe sailor’s leg, but the sailor stumbled with the swaying of the boat, and thetwo fell upon the gunwale and rolled overboard together. They sank like stones.I remember laughing at that and wondering why I laughed. The laugh caught mesuddenly like a thing from without.I lay across one of the thwarts7 [note.html#ich01en07] for I know not how long,thinking that if I had the strength I would drink sea water and madden myself todie quickly. And even as I lay there I saw, with no more interest than if it hadbeen a picture, a sail come up towards me over the skyline. My mind must havebeen wandering, and yet I remember all that happened quite distinctly. Iremember how my head swayed with the seas, and the horizon with the sail aboveit danced up and down. But I also remember as distinctly that I had a persuasionthat I was dead, and that I thought what a jest it was they should come too lateby such a little to catch me in my body.For an endless period, as it seemed to me, I lay with my head on the thwartwatching the dancing schooner – she was a little ship, schooner–rigged fore andaft – come up out of the sea. She kept tacking to and fro in a widening compass,for she was sailing dead into the wind. It never entered my head to attempt toattract attention, and I do not remember anything distinctly after the sight ofher side, until I found myself in a little cabin aft. There is a dim half–memoryof being lifted up to the gangway and of a big round countenance, covered withfreckles and surrounded with red hair, staring at me over the bulwarks. I alsohad a disconnected impression of a dark face with extraordinary eyes close tomine, but that I thought was a nightmare until I met it again. I fancy Irecollect some stuff being poured in between my teeth. And that is all."},{"pageContent":"IITHE MAN WHO WAS GOING NOWHEREThe cabin in which I found myself was small and rather untidy. A youngish manwith flaxen hair, a bristly straw–coloured moustache, and a dropping nether lipwas sitting and holding my wrist. For a minute we stared at one another withoutspeaking. He had watery grey expressionless eyes.Then just overhead came a sound like an iron bedstead being knocked about andthe low angry growling of some large animal. At the same time the man spokeagain.He repeated his question: ‘How do you feel now?’I think I said I felt all right. I could not recollect how I had got there. Hemust have seen the question in my face, for my voice was inaccessible to me.‘You were picked up in a boat – starving. The name on the boat was the LadyVain, and there were queer marks on the gunwale.’1 [note.html#ich02en01] At thesame time my eye caught my hand, so thin that it looked like a dirty skin pursefull of loose bones, and all the business of the boat came back to me.‘Have some of this,’ said he, and gave me a dose of some scarlet stuff, iced.It tasted like blood, and made me feel stronger.‘You were in luck,’ said he, ‘to get picked up by a ship with a medical manaboard.’ He spoke with a slobbering articulation, with the ghost of a lisp.‘What ship is this?’ I said slowly, hoarse from my long silence.‘It’s a little trader from Arica and Callao. I never asked where she came fromin the beginning. Out of the land of born fools, I guess. I’m a passenger myselffrom Arica. The silly ass who owns her – he’s captain too, named Davis – he’slost his certificate or something. You know the kind of man – calls the thingthe Ipecacuanha – of all silly infernal names, though when there’s much of a seawithout any wind she certainly acts according.’2 [note.html#ich02en02]Then the noise overhead began again, a snarling growl and the voice of a humanbeing together. Then another voice telling some ‘Heaven–forsaken idiot’ todesist.‘You were nearly dead,’ said my interlocutor. ‘It was a very near thing indeed.But I’ve put some stuff into you now. Notice your arm’s sore? Injections. You’vebeen insensible for nearly thirty hours.’I thought slowly. I was distracted now by the yelping of a number of dogs. ‘MayI have solid food?’ I asked.‘Thanks to me,’ he said. ‘Even now the mutton is boiling.’‘Yes,’ I said, with assurance; ‘I could eat some mutton.’‘But,’ said he, with a momentary hesitation, ‘you know I’m dying to hear how youcame to be alone in the boat.’ I thought I detected a certain suspicion in hiseyes.‘Damn that howling!’He suddenly left the cabin, and I heard him in violent controversy with someonewho seemed to me to talk gibberish in response to him. The matter sounded asthough it ended in blows, but in that I thought my ears were mistaken. Then heshouted at the dogs and returned to the cabin.‘Well?’ said he, in the doorway. ‘You were just beginning to tell me.’I told him my name, Edward Prendick, and how I had taken to natural history as arelief from the dulness of my comfortable independence. He seemed interested inthis. ‘I’ve done some science myself –1 did my Biology at University College, –getting out the ovary of the earthworm and the radula of the snail3[note.html#ich02en03] and all that. Lord! it’s ten years ago. But go on, go on –tell me about the boat.’He was evidently satisfied with the frankness of my story, which I told inconcise sentences enough, – for I felt horribly weak, – and when it was finishedhe reverted presently to the topic of natural history and his own biologicalstudies. He began to question me closely about Tottenham Court Road and GowerStreet. ‘Is Caplatzi still flourishing? What a shop that was!’4[note.html#ich02en04] He had evidently been a very ordinary medical student, anddrifted incontinently to the topic of the music–halls. He told me someanecdotes. ‘Left it all,’ he said, ‘ten years ago. How jolly it used to be! ButI made a young ass of myself…. Played myself out before I was twenty–one. I daresay it’s all different now…. But I must look up that ass of a cook and see whathe’s doing to your mutton.’The growling overhead was renewed, so suddenly and with so much savage angerthat it startled me. ‘What’s that?’ I called after him, but the door had closed.He came back again with the boiled mutton, and I was so excited by theappetizing smell of it, that I forgot the noise of the beast forthwith.After a day of alternate sleep and feeding I was so far recovered as to be ableto get from my bunk to the scuttle5 [note.html#ich02en05] and see the green seastrying to keep pace with us. I judged the schooner was running before the wind.Montgomery – that was the name of the flaxen–haired man – came in again as Istood there, and I asked him for some clothes. He lent me some duck things6[note.html#ich02en06] of his own, for those I had worn in the boat, he said, hadbeen thrown overboard. They were rather loose for me, for he was large and longin his limbs.He told me casually that the captain was three parts drunk in his own cabin. AsI assumed the clothes I began asking him some questions about the destination ofthe ship. He said the ship was bound to Hawaii, but that it had to land himfirst.‘Where?’ said I.‘It’s an island…. Where I live. So far as I know, it hasn’t got a name.’He stared at me with his nether lip dropping, and looked so wilfully stupid of asudden that it came into my head that he desired to avoid my questions. ‘I’mready,’ I said. He led the way out of the cabin."},{"pageContent":"IIITHE STRANGE FACEAt the companion1 [note.html#ich03en01] was a man obstructing our way. He wasstanding on the ladder with his back to us, peering over the combing of thehatchway.2 [note.html#ich03en02] He was, I could see, a misshapen man, short,broad, and clumsy, with a crooked back, a hairy neck, and a head sunk betweenhis shoulders. He was dressed in dark blue serge, and had peculiarly thickcoarse black hair. I heard the unseen dogs growl furiously, and forthwith heducked back, coming into contact with the hand I put out to fend him off frommyself. He turned with animal swiftness.The black face thus flashed upon me startled me profoundly. The facial partprojected, forming something dimly suggestive of a muzzle, and the hugehalf-open mouth showed as big white teeth as I had ever seen in a human mouth.His eyes were bloodshot at the edges, with scarcely a rim of white round thehazel pupils. There was a curious glow of excitement in his face.‘Confound you!’ said Montgomery. ‘Why the devil don’t you get out of the way?’The black-faced man started aside without a word.I went on up the companion, still staring at him almost against my will as I didso. Montgomery stayed at the foot for a moment. ‘You have no business here, youknow,’ he said in a deliberate tone. ‘Your place is forward.’The black-faced man cowered. ‘They… won’t have me forward.’ He spoke slowly,with a hoarse quality in his voice.‘Won’t have you forward!’ said Montgomery in a menacing voice. ‘But I tell youto go.’ He was on the brink of saying something further, then looked up at mesuddenly and followed me up the ladder. I had paused halfway through thehatchway, looking back, still astonished beyond measure at the grotesqueugliness of this black-faced creature. I had never beheld such a repulsive andextraordinary face before, and yet – if the contradiction is credible – Iexperienced at the same time an odd feeling that in some way I had alreadyencountered exactly the features and gestures that now amazed me. Afterwards itoccurred to me that probably I had seen him as I was lifted aboard, and yet thatscarcely satisfied my suspicion of a previous acquaintance. Yet how one couldhave set eyes on so singular a face and have forgotten the precise occasionpassed my imagination.Montgomery’s movement to follow me released my attention, and I turned andlooked about me at the flush deck of the little schooner. I was already halfprepared by the sounds I had heard for what I saw. Certainly I never beheld adeck so dirty. It was littered with scraps of carrot, shreds of green stuff, andindescribable filth. Fastened by chains to the mainmast were a number of grislystaghounds, who now began leaping and barking at me, and by the mizzen3[note.html#ich03en03] a huge puma was cramped in a little iron cage, far toosmall even to give it turning-room. Further under the starboard bulwark weresome big hutches containing a number of rabbits, and a solitary llama wassqueezed in a mere box of a cage forward. The dogs were muzzled by leatherstraps. The only human being on deck was a gaunt and silent sailor at the wheel.The patched and dirty spankers4 [note.html#ich03en04] were tense before thewind, and up aloft the little ship seemed carrying every sail she had. The skywas clear, the sun midway down the western sky; long waves, capped by the breezewith froth, were running with us. We went past the steersman to the taffrail5[note.html#ich03en05] and stared side by side for a space at the water foamingunder the stern and the bubbles dancing and vanishing in her wake. I turned andsurveyed the unsavoury length of the ship.‘Is this an ocean menagerie?’ said I.‘Looks like it,’ said Montgomery.‘What are these beasts for? Merchandise, curios? Does the captain think he isgoing to sell them somewhere in the South Seas?’‘It looks like it, doesn’t it?’ said Montgomery, and turned towards the wakeagain.Suddenly we heard a yelp and a volley of furious blasphemy coming from thecompanion hatchway, and the deformed man with the black face clambered uphurriedly. He was immediately followed by a heavy red-haired man in a white cap.At the sight of the former the staghounds, who had all tired of barking at me bythis time, became furiously excited, howling and leaping against their chains.The black hesitated before them, and this gave the red-haired man time to comeup with him and deliver a tremendous blow between the shoulder-blades with hisfist. The poor devil went down like a felled ox, and rolled in the dirt amongthe furiously excited dogs. It was lucky for him they were muzzled. Thered-haired man gave a yawp of exultation and stood staggering and, as it seemedto me, in serious danger of either going backward down the companion hatchway,or forward upon his victim.So soon as the second man had appeared, Montgomery had started violently.‘Steady on there!’ he cried, in a tone of remonstrance. A couple of sailorsappeared on the forecastle.The black-faced man, howling in a singular voice, rolled about under the feet ofthe dogs. No one attempted to help him. The brutes did their best to worry him,butting their muzzles at him. There was a quick dance of their lithe grey bodiesover the clumsy prostrate figure. The sailors forward shouted to them as thoughit was admirable sport. Montgomery gave an angry exclamation, and went stridingdown the deck. I followed him.In another second the black-faced man had scrambled up and was staggeringforward. He stumbled up against the bulwark by the main shrouds,6[note.html#ich03en06] where he remained panting and glaring over his shoulder atthe dogs. The red-haired man laughed a satisfied laugh.‘Look here, captain,’ said Montgomery, with his lisp a little accentuated,gripping the elbows of the red-haired man; ‘this won’t do.’I stood behind Montgomery. The captain came half round and regarded him with thedull and solemn eyes of a drunken man. ‘Wha’ won’t do?’ he said; and added,after looking sleepily into Montgomery’s face for a minute, ‘Blasted Sawbones!’With a sudden movement he shook his arms free, and after two ineffectualattempts stuck his freckled fists into his side-pockets.‘That man’s a passenger,’ said Montgomery. ‘I’d advise you to keep your handsoff him.’‘Go to hell!’ said the captain loudly. He suddenly turned and staggered towardsthe side. ‘Do what I like on my own ship,’ he said.I think Montgomery might have left him then – seeing the brute was drunk. But heonly turned a shade paler, and followed the captain to the bulwarks.‘Look here, captain,’ he said. ‘That man of mine is not to be ill-treated. Hehas been hazed7 [note.html#ich03en07] ever since he came aboard.’For a minute alcoholic fumes kept the captain speechless. ‘Blasted Sawbones!’was all he considered necessary.I could see that Montgomery had an ugly temper, and I saw too that this quarrelhad been some time growing. ‘The man’s drunk,’ said I, perhaps officiously;‘you’ll do no good.’Montgomery gave an ugly twist to his dropping lip. ‘He’s always drunk. Do youthink that excuses his assaulting his passengers?’‘My ship,’ began the captain, waving his hand unsteadily towards the cages, ‘wasa clean ship. Look at it now.’ It was certainly anything but clean. ‘Crew,’continued the captain, ‘clean respectable crew.’‘You agreed to take the beasts.’‘I wish I’d never set eyes on your infernal island. What the devil… want beastsfor on an island like that? Then that man of yours… Understood he was a man.He’s a lunatic. And he hadn’t no business aft. Do you think the whole damnedship belongs to you?’‘Your sailors began to haze the poor devil as soon as he came aboard.’‘That’s just what he is – he’s a devil, an ugly devil. My men can’t stand him. Ican’t stand him. None of us can’t stand him. Nor you either.’Montgomery turned away. ‘You leave that man alone, anyhow,’ he said, nodding hishead as he spoke.But the captain meant to quarrel now. He raised his voice: ‘If he comes this endof the ship again I’ll cut his insides out, I tell you. Cut out his blastedinsides! Who are you to tell me what I’m to do. I tell you I’m captain of theship – Captain and Owner. I’m the law here, I tell you – the law and theprophets.8 [note.html#ich03en08] I bargained to take a man and his attendant toand from Arica and bring back some animals. I never bargained to carry a maddevil and a silly Sawbones, a—’Well, never mind what he called Montgomery. I saw the latter take a stepforward, and interposed. ‘He’s drunk,’ said I. The captain began some abuse evenfouler than the last. ‘Shut up,’ I said, turning on him sharply, for I had seendanger in Montgomery’s white face. With that I brought the downpour on myself.However, I was glad to avert what was uncommonly near a scuffle, even at theprice of the captain’s drunken ill-will. I do not think I have ever heard quiteso much vile language come in a continuous stream from any man’s lips before,though I have frequented eccentric company enough. I found some of it hard toendure – though I am a mild-tempered man. But certainly when I told the captainto shut up I had forgotten I was merely a bit of human flotsam, cut off from myresources and with my fare unpaid, a mere casual dependant on the bounty -orspeculative enterprise – of the ship. He reminded me of it with considerablevigour. But at any rate I prevented a fight."},{"pageContent":"IVAT THE SCHOONER’S RAILThat night land was sighted after sundown, and the schooner hove to. Montgomeryintimated that was his destination. It was too far to see any details; it seemedto me then simply a low-lying patch of dim blue in the uncertain blue-grey sea.An almost vertical streak of smoke went up from it into the sky.The captain was not on deck when it was sighted. After he had vented his wrathon me he had staggered below, and I understand he went to sleep on the floor ofhis own cabin. The mate practically assumed the command. He was the gaunt,taciturn individual we had seen at the wheel. Apparently he too was in an eviltemper with Montgomery. He took not the slightest notice of either of us. Wedined with him in a sulky silence, after a few ineffectual efforts on my part totalk. It struck me, too, that the men regarded my companion and his animals in asingularly unfriendly manner. I found Montgomery very reticent about his purposewith these creatures and about his destination, and though I was sensible of agrowing curiosity I did not press him.We remained talking on the quarter-deck until the sky was thick with stars.Except for an occasional sound in the yellow-lit forecastle, and a movement ofthe animals now and then, the night was very still. The puma lay crouchedtogether, watching us with shining eyes, a black heap in the corner of its cage.The dogs seemed to be asleep. Montgomery produced some cigars.He talked to me of London in a tone of half-painful reminiscence, asking allkinds of questions about changes that had taken place. He spoke like a man whohad loved his life there, and had been suddenly and irrevocably cut off from it.I gossiped as well as I could of this and that. All the time the strangeness ofhim was shaping itself in my mind, and as I talked I peered at his odd pallidface in the dim light of the binnacle lantern behind me. Then I looked out atthe darkling sea, where in the dimness his little island was hidden.This man, it seemed to me, had come out of Immensity merely to save my life.Tomorrow he would drop over the side and vanish again out of my existence. Evenhad it been under commonplace circumstances it would have made me a triflethoughtful. But in the first place was the singularity of an educated man livingon this unknown little island, and coupled with that, the extraordinary natureof his luggage. I found myself repeating the captain’s question: What did hewant with the beasts? Why, too, had he pretended they were not his when I hadremarked about them at first? Then again, in his personal attendant there was abizarre quality that had impressed me profoundly. These circumstances threw ahaze of mystery round the man. They laid hold of my imagination and hampered mytongue.Towards midnight our talk of London died away, and we stood side by side leaningover the bulwarks, and staring dreamily over the silent starlit sea, eachpursuing his own thoughts. It was the atmosphere for sentiment, and I began uponmy gratitude.‘If I may say it,’ said I, after a time, ‘you have saved my life.’‘Chance,’ he answered; ‘just chance.’‘I prefer to make my thanks to the accessible agent.’‘Thank no one. You had the need, and I the knowledge, and I injected and fed youmuch as I might have collected a specimen. I was bored, and wanted something todo. If I’d been jaded that day, or hadn’t liked your face, well – it’s a curiousquestion where you would have been now.’This damped my mood a little. ‘At any rate–’ I began.‘It’s a chance, I tell you,’ he interrupted, ‘as everything is in a man’s life.Only the asses won’t see it. Why am I here now -an outcast from civilization –instead of being a happy man enjoying all the pleasures of London? Simplybecause – eleven years ago -I lost my head for ten minutes on a foggy night.’He stopped. ‘Yes?’ said I.‘That’s all.’We relapsed into silence. Presently he laughed. ‘There’s something in thisstarlight that loosens one’s tongue. I’m an ass, and yet somehow I would like totell you.’‘Whatever you tell me, you may rely upon my keeping to myself…. If that’s it.’He was on the point of beginning, and then shook his head doubtfully. ‘Don’t,’said I. ‘It is all the same to me. After all, it is better to keep your secret.There’s nothing gained but a little relief, if I respect your confidence. If Idon’t… well?’He grunted undecidedly. I felt I had him at a disadvantage, had caught him inthe mood of indiscretion; and, to tell the truth, I was not curious to learnwhat might have driven a young medical student out of London. I have animagination. I shrugged my shoulders, and turned away. Over the taffrail leaneda silent black figure, staring at the waves. It was Montgomery’s strangeattendant. It looked over its shoulder quickly with my movement, then lookedaway again.It may seem a little thing to you, perhaps, but it came like a sudden blow tome. The only light near us was a lantern at the wheel. The creature’s face wasturned for one brief instant out of the dimness of the stern towards thisillumination, and I saw that the eyes that glanced at me shone with a pale-greenlight.I did not know then that a reddish luminosity, at least, is not uncommon inhuman eyes. The thing came to me as a stark inhumanity. That black figure, withits eyes of fire, struck down through all my adult thoughts and feelings, andfor a moment the forgotten horrors of childhood came back to my mind. Then theeffect passed as it had come. An uncouth black figure of a man, a figure of noparticular import, hung over the taffrail, against the starlight, and I foundMontgomery was speaking to me.‘I’m thinking of turning in, then,’ said he; ‘if you’ve had enough of this.’I answered him incongruously. We went below, and he wished me good night at thedoor of my cabin.That night I had some very unpleasant dreams. The waning moon rose late. Itslight struck a ghostly faint white beam across my cabin, and made an ominousshape on the planking by my bunk. Then the staghounds woke and began howling andbaying, so that I dreamed fitfully and scarcely slept until the approach ofdawn."},{"pageContent":"VTHE LANDING ON THE ISLANDIn the early morning – it was the second morning after my recovery, and Ibelieve the fourth after I was picked up – I awoke through an avenue oftumultuous dreams, dreams of guns and howling mobs, and became sensible of ahoarse shouting above me. I rubbed my eyes, and lay listening to the noise,doubtful for a little while of my whereabouts. Then came a sudden pattering ofbare feet, the sound of heavy objects being thrown about, a violent creaking andrattling of chains. I heard the swish of the water as the ship was suddenlybrought round, and a foamy yellow-green wave flew across the little round windowand left it streaming. I jumped into my clothes and went on deck.As I came up the ladder I saw against the flushed sky – for the sun was justrising – the broad back and red hair of the captain, and over his shoulder thepuma spinning from a tackle rigged on to the mizzen spanker-boom. The poor bruteseemed horribly scared, and crouched in the bottom of its little cage.‘Overboard with ’em!’ bawled the captain. ‘Overboard with ’em! We’ll have aclean ship soon of the whole bilin’ of ’em.’1 [note.html#ich05en01]He stood in my way, so that I had perforce to tap his shoulder to come on deck.He came round with a start, and staggered back a few paces to stare at me. Itneeded no expert eye to tell that the man was still drunk. ‘Hullo!’ said hestupidly, and then with a light coming into his eyes, ‘Why, it’s Mister –Mister—?’‘Prendick,’ said I.‘Prendick be damned!’ said he. ‘Shut Up – that’s your name. Mister Shut Up.’It was no good answering the brute. But I certainly did not expect his nextmove. He held out his hand to the gangway by which Montgomery stood talking to amassive white-haired man in dirty blue flannels, who had apparently just comeaboard. ‘That way, Mister Blasted Shut Up. That way,’ roared the captain.Montgomery and his companion turned as he spoke.‘What do you mean?’ said I.‘That way, Mister Blasted Shut Up – that’s what I mean. Overboard, Mister ShutUp – and sharp. We’re clearing the ship out, cleaning the whole blessed shipout. And overboard you go.’I stared at him dumbfounded. Then it occurred to me it was exactly the thing Iwanted. The lost prospect of a journey as sole passenger with this quarrelsomesot was not one to mourn over. I turned towards Montgomery.‘Can’t have you,’ said Montgomery’s companion concisely.‘You can’t have me!’ said I, aghast. He had the squarest and most resolute faceI ever set eyes upon.‘Look here,’ I began, turning to the captain.‘Overboard,’ said the captain. ‘This ship ain’t for beasts and worse thanbeasts, any more. Overboard you go… Mister Shut Up. If they can’t have you, yougoes adrift. But anyhow you go! With your Friends. I’ve done with this blessedisland for evermore amen! I’ve had enough of it.’‘But, Montgomery,’ I appealed.He distorted his lower lip, and nodded his head hopelessly at the grey-hairedman beside him, to indicate his powerlessness to help me.‘I’ll see to you presently,’ said the captain.Then began a curious three-cornered altercation. Alternately I appealed to oneand another of the three men, first to the grey-haired man to let me land, andthen to the drunken captain to keep me aboard. I even bawled entreaties to thesailors. Montgomery said never a word; only shook his head. ‘You’re goingoverboard, I tell you,’ was the captain’s refrain…. ‘Law be damned! I’m kinghere.’At last, I must confess, my voice suddenly broke in the middle of a vigorousthreat. I felt a gust of hysterical petulance, and went aft, and stared dismallyat nothing.Meanwhile the sailors progressed rapidly with the task of unshipping thepackages and caged animals. A large launch with two standing lugs2[note.html#ich05en02] lay under the lee of the schooner, and into this theassortment of goods was swung. I did not then see the hands from the island thatwere receiving the packages, for the hull of the launch was hidden from me bythe side of the schooner.Neither Montgomery nor his companion took the slightest notice of me, but busiedthemselves in assisting and directing the four or five sailors who wereunloading the goods. The captain went forward, interfering rather thanassisting. I was alternately despairful and desperate. Once or twice, as I stoodwaiting there for things to accomplish themselves, I could not resist an impulseto laugh at my miserable quandary. I felt all the wretcheder for the lack of abreakfast. Hunger and a shortage of blood-corpuscles take all the manhood from aman. I perceived pretty clearly that I had not the stamina either to resist whatthe captain chose to do to expel me, or to force myself upon Montgomery and hiscompanion. So I waited passively upon fate, and the work of transferringMontgomery’s possessions to the launch went on as if I did not exist.Presently that work was finished, and then came a struggle; I was hauled,resisting weakly enough, to the gangway. Even then I noticed the oddness of thebrown faces of the men who were with Montgomery in the launch. But the launchwas now fully laden, and was shoved off hastily. A broadening gap of green waterappeared under me, and I pushed back with all my strength to avoid fallingheadlong.The hands in the launch shouted derisively, and I heard Montgomery curse atthem. And then the captain, the mate and one of the seamen helping him, ran meaft towards the stern. The dinghy of the Lady Vain had been towing behind; itwas half full of water, had no oars, and was quite unvictualled. I refused to goaboard her, and flung myself full-length on the deck. In the end they swung meinto her by a rope – for they had no stern ladder – and cut me adrift.I drifted slowly from the schooner. In a kind of stupor I watched all hands taketo the rigging and slowly but surely she came round to the wind. The sailsfluttered, and then bellied out as the wind came into them. I stared at herweather-beaten side heeling steeply towards me. And then she passed out of myrange of view.I did not turn my head to follow her. At first I could scarcely believe what hadhappened. I crouched in the bottom of the dinghy, stunned, and staring blanklyat the vacant oily sea. Then I realized I was in that little hell of mine again,now half-swamped. Looking back over the gunwale I saw the schooner standing awayfrom me, with the red-haired captain mocking at me over the taffrail; and,turning towards the island, saw the launch growing smaller as she approached thebeach.Abruptly the cruelty of this desertion became clear to me. I had no means ofreaching the land unless I should chance to drift there. I was still weak, youmust remember, from my exposure in the boat; I was empty and very faint, or Ishould have had more heart. But as it was I suddenly began to sob and weep as Ihad never done since I was a little child. The tears ran down my face. In apassion of despair I struck with my fists at the water in the bottom of theboat, and kicked savagely at the gunwale. I prayed aloud to God that he wouldlet me die."},{"pageContent":"VITHE EVIL-LOOKING BOATMENBut the islanders, seeing I was really adrift, took pity on me. I drifted veryslowly to the eastward, approaching the island slantingly, and presently I sawwith hysterical relief the launch come round and return towards me. She washeavily laden, and as she drew near I could make out Montgomery’s white-hairedbroad-shouldered companion sitting cramped up with the dogs and severalpacking-cases in the stern-sheets. This individual stared fixedly at me withoutmoving or speaking. The black-faced cripple was glaring at me as fixedly in thebows near the puma. There were three other men besides, strange brutish-lookingfellows, at whom the staghounds were snarling savagely. Montgomery, who wassteering, brought the boat by me and, rising, caught and fastened my painter tothe tiller1 [note.html#ich06en01] to tow me – for there was no room aboard.I had recovered from my hysterical phase by this time, and answered his hail ashe approached bravely enough. I told him the dinghy was nearly swamped, and hereached me a piggin.2 [note.html#ich06en02] I was jerked back as the ropetightened between the boats. For some time I was busy baling.It was not until I had got the water under – for the water in the dinghy hadbeen shipped, the boat was perfectly sound – that I had leisure to look at thepeople in the launch again.The white-haired man, I found, was still regarding me steadfastly, but with anexpression, as I now fancied, of some perplexity. When my eyes met his he lookeddown at the stag-hounds that sat between his knees. He was a powerfully builtman, as I have said, with a fine forehead and rather heavy features; but hiseyes had that odd drooping of the skin above the lids that often comes withadvancing years, and the fall of his heavy mouth at the corners gave him anexpression of pugnacious resolution. He talked to Montgomery in a tone too lowfor me to hear. From him my eyes travelled to his three men, and a strange crewthey were. I saw only their faces, yet there was something in their faces – Iknew not what – that gave me a spasm of disgust. I looked steadily at them, andthe impression did not pass though I failed to see what had occasioned it.They seemed to me then to be brown men, but their limbs were oddly swathed insome thin dirty white stuff down even to the fingers and feet. I have never seenmen so wrapped up before, and women so only in the East. They wore turbans, too,and thereunder peered out their elfin faces at me, faces with protruding lowerjaws and bright eyes. They had lank black hair almost like horse-hair, andseemed, as they sat, to exceed in stature any race of men I have seen. Thewhite-haired man, who I knew was a good six feet in height, sat a head below anyone of the three. I found afterwards that really none were taller than myself,but their bodies were abnormally long and the thigh part of the leg short andcuriously twisted. At any rate they were an amazingly ugly gang, and over theheads of them, under the forward lug, peered the black face of the man whoseeyes were luminous in the dark.As I stared at them they met my gaze, and then first one and then another turnedaway from my direct stare and looked at me in an odd furtive manner. It occurredto me that I was perhaps annoying them, and I turned my attention to the islandwe were approaching.It was low, and covered with thick vegetation, chiefly of the inevitablepalm-trees. From one point a thin white thread of vapour rose slantingly to animmense height, and then frayed out like a down feather. We were now within theembrace of a broad bay flanked on either hand by a low promontory. The beach wasof a dull grey sand, and sloped steeply up to a ridge, perhaps sixty or seventyfeet above the sea-level, and irregularly set with trees and undergrowth.Halfway up was a square stone enclosure that I found subsequently was builtpartly of coral and partly of pumiceous lava. Two thatched roofs peeped fromwithin this enclosure.A man stood awaiting us at the water’s edge. I fancied, while we were still faroff, that I saw some other and very grotesque-looking creatures scuttle into thebushes upon the slope, but I saw nothing of these as we drew nearer. This manwas of a moderate size, and with a black negroid face. He had a large, almostlipless mouth, extraordinary, lank arms, long thin feet and bow legs, and stoodwith his heavy face thrust forward staring at us. He was dressed like Montgomeryand his white-haired companion, in jacket and trousers of blue serge.As we came still nearer, this individual began to run to and fro on the beach,making the most grotesque movements. At a word of command from Montgomery thefour men in the launch sprang up with singular awkward gestures and struck thelugs. Montgomery steered us round and into a narrow little dock excavated in thebeach. Then the man on the beach hastened towards us. This dock, as I call it,was really a mere ditch just long enough at this phase of the tide to take thelong-boat.I heard the bows ground in the sand, staved the dinghy off the rudder of the bigboat with my piggin, and, freeing the painter, landed. The three muffled men,with the clumsiest movements, scrambled out upon the sand, and forthwith set tolanding the cargo, assisted by the man on the beach. I was struck especiallywith the curious movements of the legs of the three swathed and bandaged boatmen– not stiff they were, but distorted in some odd way, almost as if they werejointed in the wrong place. The dogs were still snarling, and strained at theirchains after these men, as the white-haired man landed with them.The three big fellows spoke to one another in odd guttural tones, and the manwho had waited for us on the beach began chattering to them excitedly – aforeign language, as I fancied – as they laid hands on some bales piled near thestern. Somewhere I had heard such a voice before, and I could not think where.The white-haired man stood holding in a tumult of six dogs, and bawling ordersover their din. Montgomery, having unshipped the rudder, landed likewise, andall set to work at unloading. I was too faint, what with my long fast and thesun beating down on my bare head, to offer any assistance.Presently the white-haired man seemed to recollect my presence, and came up tome. ‘You look,’ said he, ‘as though you had not breakfasted.’His little eyes were a brilliant black under his heavy brows. ‘I must apologizefor that. Now you are our guest, we must make you comfortable – though you areuninvited, you know.’He looked keenly into my face. ‘Montgomery says you are an educated man, MrPrendick – says you know something of science. May I ask what that signifies?’I told him I had spent some years at the Royal College of Science, and had donesome research in biology under Huxley.3 [note.html#ich06en03] He raised hiseyebrows slightly at that.‘That alters the case a little, Mr Prendick,’ he said with a trifle more respectin his manner. ‘As it happens, we are biologists here. This is a biologicalstation – of a sort.’ His eye rested on the men in white, who were busilyhauling the puma, on rollers, towards the walled yard. ‘I and Montgomery, atleast,’ he added.Then, ‘When you will be able to get away, I can’t say. We’re off the track toanywhere. We see a ship once in a twelvemonth or so.’He left me abruptly and went up the beach past this group, and, I think, enteredthe enclosure. The other two men were with Montgomery erecting a pile of smallerpackages on a low-wheeled truck. The llama was still on the launch with therabbit-hutches; the staghounds still lashed to the thwarts. The pile of thingscompleted, all three men laid hold of the truck, and began shoving theton-weight or so upon it after the puma. Presently Montgomery left them, and,coming back to me, held out his hand.‘I’m glad,’ said he, ‘for my own part. That captain was a silly ass. He’d havemade things lively for you.’‘It was you,’ said I, ‘that saved me again.’‘That depends. You’ll find this island an infernally rum place, I promise you.I’d watch my goings carefully if I were you. He–’ He hesitated, and seemed toalter his mind about what was on his lips. ‘I wish you’d help me with theserabbits,’ he said.His procedure with the rabbits was singular. I waded in with him and helped himlug one of the hutches ashore. No sooner was that done than he opened the doorof it, and tilting the thing on one end, turned its living contents out on theground. They fell in a struggling heap one on the top of the other. He clappedhis hands, and forthwith they went off with that hopping run of theirs, fifteenor twenty of them, I should think, up the beach. ‘Increase and multiply, myfriends,’ said Montgomery. ‘Replenish the island. Hitherto we’ve had a certainlack of meat here.’As I watched them disappearing, the white-haired man returned with a brandyflask and some biscuits. ‘Something to go on with, Prendick,’ said he in a farmore familiar tone than before.I made no ado, but set to work on the biscuits at once, while the white-hairedman helped Montgomery to release about a score more of the rabbits. Three bighutches, however, went up to the house with the puma. The brandy I did nottouch, for I have been an abstainer from my birth."},{"pageContent":"VIITHE LOCKED DOORThe reader will perhaps understand that at first everything was so strange aboutme, and my position was the outcome of such unexpected adventures, that I had nodiscernment of the relative strangeness of this or that thing about me. Ifollowed the llama up the beach, and was overtaken by Montgomery who asked menot to enter the stone enclosure. I noticed then that the puma in its cage andthe pile of packages had been placed outside the entrance to this quadrangle.I turned and saw that the launch had now been unloaded, run out again, andbeached, and the white-haired man was walking towards us. He addressedMontgomery.‘And now comes the problem of this uninvited guest. What are we to do with him?’‘He knows something of science,’ said Montgomery.‘I’m itching to get to work again – with this new stuff,’ said the grey-hairedman, nodding towards the enclosure. His eyes grew brighter.‘I dare say you are,’ said Montgomery in anything but a cordial tone.‘We can’t send him over there, and we can’t spare the time to build him a newshanty. And we certainly can’t take him into our confidence just yet.’‘I’m in your hands,’ said I. I had no idea of what he meant by ‘over there’.‘I’ve been thinking of the same things,’ Montgomery answered. ‘There’s my roomwith the outer door—’‘That’s it,’ said the elder man promptly, looking at Montgomery, and all threeof us went towards the enclosure. ‘I’m sorry to make a mystery, Mr Prendick –but you’ll remember you’re uninvited. Our little establishment here contains asecret or so, is a kind of Bluebeard’s Chamber, in fact. Nothing very dreadfulreally – to a sane man. But just now – as we don’t know you—’‘Decidedly,’ said I; ‘I should be a fool to take offence at any want ofconfidence.’He twisted his heavy mouth into a faint smile – he was one of those saturninepeople who smile with the corners of the mouth down – and bowed hisacknowledgment of my complaisance. The main entrance to the enclosure we passed;it was a heavy wooden gate, framed in iron and locked, with the cargo of thelaunch piled outside it; and at the corner we came to a small doorway I had notpreviously observed. The grey-haired man produced a bundle of keys from thepocket of his greasy blue jacket, opened this door, and entered. His keys andthe elaborate locking up of the place, even while it was still under his eye,struck me as peculiar.I followed him, and found myself in a small apartment, plainly but notuncomfortably furnished, and with its inner door, which was slightly ajar,opening into a paved courtyard. This inner door Montgomery at once closed. Ahammock was slung across the darker corner of the room, and a small unglazedwindow, defended by an iron bar, looked out towards the sea.This, the grey-haired man told me, was to be my apartment, and the inner door,which, ‘for fear of accidents’, he said, he would lock on the other side, was mylimit inward. He called my attention to a convenient deck chair before thewindow, and to an array of old books, chiefly, I found, surgical works andeditions of the Latin and Greek classics – languages I cannot read with anycomfort – on a shelf near the hammock. He left the room by the outer door, as ifto avoid opening the inner one again.‘We usually have our meals in here,’ said Montgomery, and then, as if in doubt,went out after the other. ‘Moreau,’ I heard him call, and for the moment I donot think I noticed. Then as I handled the books on the shelf it came up inconsciousness: where had I heard the name of Moreau before?I sat down before the window, took out the biscuits that still remained to me,and ate them with an excellent appetite. ‘Moreau?’Through the window I saw one of those unaccountable men in white lugging apacking-case along the beach. Presently the window-frame hid him. Then I heard akey inserted and turned in the lock behind me. After a little while I heard,through the locked door, the noise of the staghounds, which had now been broughtup from the beach. They were not barking, but sniffing and growling in a curiousfashion. I could hear the rapid patter of their feet and Montgomery’s voicesoothing them.I was very much impressed by the elaborate secrecy of these two men regardingthe contents of the place, and for some time I was thinking of that, and of theunaccountable familiarity of the name of Moreau. But so odd is the human memory,that I could not then recall that well-known name in its proper connection. Fromthat my thoughts went to the indefinable queerness of the deformed andwhite-swathed man on the beach. I never saw such a gait, such odd motions, as hepulled at the box. I recalled that none of these men had spoken to me, thoughmost of them I had found looking at me at one time or another in a peculiarfurtive manner, quite unlike the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage. Iwondered what language they spoke. They had all seemed remarkably taciturn, andwhen they did speak, endowed with very uncanny voices. What was wrong with them?Then I recalled the eyes of Montgomery’s ungainly attendant.Just as I was thinking of him, he came in. He was now dressed in white, andcarried a little tray with some coffee and boiled vegetables thereon. I couldhardly repress a shuddering recoil as he came, bending amiably, and placed thetray before me on the table.Then astonishment paralysed me. Under his stringy black locks I saw his ear! Itjumped upon me suddenly, close to my face. The man had pointed ears, coveredwith a fine fur!‘Your breakfast, sair,’ he said. I stared at his face without attempting toanswer him. He turned and went towards the door, regarding me oddly over hisshoulder.I followed him out with my eyes, and as I did so, by some trick of unconsciouscerebration, there came surging into my head the phrase; ‘The Moreau – Hollows’was it? ‘The Moreau-?’ Ah! it sent my memory back ten years. ‘The MoreauHorrors.’ The phrase drifted loose in my mind for a moment, and then I saw it inred lettering on a little buff-coloured pamphlet, that to read made one shiverand creep. Then I remembered distinctly all about it. That long-forgottenpamphlet came back with startling vividness to my mind. I had been a mere ladthen, and Moreau was, I suppose, about fifty; a prominent and masterfulphysiologist, well known in scientific circles for his extraordinary imaginationand his brutal directness in discussion. Was this the same Moreau? He hadpublished some very astonishing facts in connection with the transfusion ofblood, and, in addition, was known to be doing valuable work on morbid growths.Then suddenly his career was closed. He had to leave England. A journalistobtained access to his laboratory in the capacity of laboratory assistant, withthe deliberate intention of making sensational exposures; and by the help of ashocking accident – if it was an accident -his gruesome pamphlet becamenotorious. On the day of its publication a wretched dog, flayed and otherwisemutilated, escaped from Moreau’s house.It was in the silly season,1 [note.html#ich07en01] and a prominent editor, acousin of the temporary laboratory assistant, appealed to the conscience of thenation. It was not the first time that conscience has turned against the methodsof research. The doctor was simply howled out of the country. It may be hedeserved to be, but I still think the tepid support of his fellow investigatorsand his desertion by the great body of scientific workers, was a shameful thing.Yet some of his experiments, by the journalist’s account, were wantonly cruel.He might perhaps have purchased his social peace by abandoning hisinvestigations, but he apparently preferred the latter, as most men would whohave once fallen under the overmastering spell of research. He was unmarried,and had indeed nothing but his own interests to consider….I felt convinced that this must be the same man. Everything pointed to it. Itdawned upon me to what end the puma and the other animals, which had now beenbrought with other luggage into the enclosure behind the house, were destined;and a curious faint odour, the halitus2 [note.html#ich07en02] of somethingfamiliar, an odour that had been in the background of my consciousness hitherto,suddenly came forward into the forefront of my thoughts. It was the antisepticodour of the operating-room. I heard the puma growling through the wall, and oneof the dogs yelped as though it had been struck.Yet surely, and especially to another scientific man, there was nothing sohorrible in vivisection as to account for this secrecy. And by some odd leap inmy thoughts the pointed ears and luminous eyes of Montgomery’s attendant cameback again before me with the sharpest definition. I stared out at the greensea, frothing under a freshening breeze, and let these and other strangememories of the last few days chase each other through my mind.What could it mean? A locked enclosure on a lonely island, a notoriousvivisector, and these crippled and distorted men?…"},{"pageContent":"VIIITHE CRYING OF THE PUMAMontgomery interrupted my tangle of mystification and suspicion about one, andhis grotesque attendant followed him with a tray bearing bread, some herbs, andother eatables, a flask of whisky, a jug of water, and three glasses and knives.I glanced askance at this strange creature, and found him watching me with hisqueer restless eyes. Montgomery said he would lunch with me, but that Moreau wastoo preoccupied with some work to come.‘Moreau!’ said I; ‘I know that name.’‘The devil you do!’ said he. ‘What an ass I was to mention it to you. I mighthave thought. Anyhow, it will give you an inkling of our – mysteries. Whisky?’‘No thanks – I’m an abstainer.’‘I wish I’d been. But it’s no use locking the door after the steed is stolen. Itwas that infernal stuff led to my coming here. That and a foggy night. I thoughtmyself in luck at the time when Moreau offered to get me off. It’s queer….’‘Montgomery,’ said I suddenly, as the outer door closed; ‘why has your manpointed ears?’‘Damn!’ he said, over his first mouthful of food. He stared at me for a moment,and then repeated, ‘Pointed ears?’‘Little points to them,’ said I as calmly as possible, with a catch in mybreath; ‘and a fine brown fur at the edges.’He helped himself to whisky and water with great deliberation. ‘I was under theimpression… that his hair covered his ears.’‘I saw them as he stooped by me to put that coffee you sent to me on the table.And his eyes shine in the dark.’By this time Montgomery had recovered from the surprise of my question. ‘Ialways thought,’ he said deliberately, with a certain accentuation of hisflavouring of lisp; ‘that there was something the matter with his ears. From theway he covered them…. What were they like?’I was persuaded from his manner that this ignorance was a pretence. Still Icould hardly tell the man I thought him a liar. ‘Pointed,’ I said; ‘rather smalland furry – distinctly furry. But the whole man is one of the strangest beings Iever set eyes on.’A sharp, hoarse cry of animal pain came from the enclosure behind us. Its depthand volume testified to the puma. I saw Montgomery wince.‘Yes!’ he said.‘Where did you pick the creature up?’‘Er – San Francisco…. He’s an ugly brute; I admit. Halfwitted, you know. Can’tremember where he came from. But I’m used to him, you know. We both are. Howdoes he strike you?’‘He’s unnatural,’ I said. ‘There’s something about him…. Don’t think mefanciful, but it gives me a nasty little sensation, a tightening of my muscles,when he comes near me. It’s a touch… of the diabolical, in fact.’Montgomery had stopped eating while I told him this. ‘Rum,’ he said. ‘I can’tsee it.’He resumed his meal. ‘I had no idea of it,’ he said, and masticated. ‘The crewof the schooner… must have felt it the same…. Made a dead set at the poordevil…. You saw the captain?’Suddenly the puma howled again, this time more painfully. Montgomery swore underhis breath. I had half a mind to attack him about the men on the beach. Then thepoor brute within gave vent to a series of short, sharp screams.‘Your men on the beach,’ said I; ‘what race are they?’‘Excellent fellows, aren’t they?’ said he absent-mindedly, knitting his brows asthe animal yelled. I said no more. There was another outcry worse than theformer. He looked at me with his dull grey eyes, and then took some more whisky.He tried to draw me into a discussion about alcohol, professing to have saved mylife with it. He seemed anxious to lay stress on the fact that I owed my life tohim. I answered him distractedly. Presently our meal came to an end, themisshapen monster with the pointed ears cleared away, and Montgomery left mealone in the room again. All the time he was in a state of ill-concealedirritation at the noise of the vivisected puma. He spoke of his odd want ofnerve, and left me to the obvious application.I found myself that the cries were singularly irritating, and they grew in depthand intensity as the afternoon wore on. They were painful at first, but theirconstant resurgence at last altogether upset my balance. I flung aside a crib ofHorace1 [note.html#ich08en01] I had been reading, and began to clench my fists,to bite my lips, and pace the room.Presently I got to stopping my ears with my fingers.The emotional appeal of these yells grew upon me steadily, grew at last to suchan exquisite expression of suffering that I could stand it in that confined roomno longer. I stepped out of the door into the slumberous heat of the lateafternoon, and walking past the main entrance – locked again I noticed – turnedthe corner of the wall.The crying sounded even louder out of doors. It was as if all the pain in theworld had found a voice. Yet had I known such pain was in the next room, and hadit been dumb, I believe – I have thought since – I could have stood it wellenough. It is when suffering finds a voice and sets our nerves quivering thatthis pity comes troubling us. But in spite of the brilliant sunlight and thegreen fans of the trees waving in the soothing sea-breeze, the world was aconfusion, blurred with drifting black and red phantasms, until I was out ofearshot of the house in the stone wall."},{"pageContent":"IXTHE THING IN THE FORESTI strode through the undergrowth that clothed the ridge behind the house,scarcely heeding whither I went, passed on through the shadow of a thick clusterof straight-stemmed trees beyond it, and so presently found myself some way onthe other side of the ridge, and descending towards a streamlet that ran througha narrow valley. I paused and listened. The distance I had come, or theintervening masses of thicket, deadened any sound that might be coming from theenclosure. The air was still. Then with a rustle a rabbit emerged, and wentscampering up the slope before me. I hesitated, and sat down in the edge of theshade.The place was a pleasant one. The rivulet was hidden by the luxuriant vegetationof the banks, save at one point, where I caught a triangular patch of itsglittering water. On the further side I saw through a bluish haze a tangle oftrees and creepers, and above these again the luminous blue of the sky. Here andthere a splash of white or crimson marked the blooming of some trailingepiphyte.1 [note.html#ich09en01] I let my eyes wander over this scene for awhile, and then began to turn over in my mind again the strange peculiarities ofMontgomery’s man. But it was too hot to think elaborately, and presently I fellinto a tranquil state midway between dozing and waking.From this I was aroused, after I know not how long, by a rustling amidst thegreenery on the other side of the stream. For a moment I could see nothing butthe waving summits of the ferns and reeds. Then suddenly upon the bank of thestream appeared something – at first I could not distinguish what it was. Itbowed its head to the water and began to drink. Then I saw it was a man, goingon all fours like a beast!He was clothed in bluish cloth, and was of a copper-coloured hue, with blackhair. It seemed that grotesque ugliness was an invariable character of theseislanders. I could hear the suck of the water at his lips as he drank.I leaned forward to see him better, and a piece of lava, detached by my hand,went pattering down the slope. He looked up guiltily, and his eyes met mine.Forthwith he scrambled to his feet and stood wiping his clumsy hand across hismouth and regarding me. His legs were scarcely half the length of his body. So,staring one another out of countenance, we remained for perhaps the space of aminute. Then, stopping to look back once or twice, he slunk off among the bushesto the right of me, and I heard the swish of the fronds grow faint in thedistance and die away. Every now and then he regarded me with a steadfast stare.Long after he had disappeared I remained sitting up staring in the direction ofhis retreat. My drowsy tranquillity had gone.I was startled by a noise behind me, and, turning suddenly, saw the flappingwhite tail of a rabbit vanishing up the slope. I jumped to my feet.The apparition of this grotesque half-bestial creature had suddenly populatedthe stillness of the afternoon for me. I looked around me rather nervously, andregretted that I was unarmed. Then I thought that the man I had just seen hadbeen clothed in bluish cloth, had not been naked as a savage would have been,and I tried to persuade myself from that fact that he was after all probably apeaceful character, that the dull ferocity of his countenance belied him.Yet I was greatly disturbed at the apparition. I walked to the left along theslope, turning my head about and peering this way and that among the straightstems of the trees. Why should a man go on all fours and drink with his lips?Presently I heard an animal wailing again, and taking it to be the puma, Iturned about and walked in a direction diametrically opposite to the sound. Thisled me down to the stream, across which I stepped and pushed my way up throughthe undergrowth beyond.I was startled by a great patch of vivid scarlet on the ground, and going up toit found it to be a peculiar fungus branched and corrugated like a foliaceouslichen, but deliquescing into slime at the touch. And then in the shadow of someluxuriant ferns I came upon an unpleasant thing, the dead body of a rabbit,covered with shining flies but still warm, and with its head torn off. I stoppedaghast at the sight of the scattered blood. Here at least was one visitor to theisland disposed of!There were no traces of other violence about it. It looked as though it had beensuddenly snatched up and killed. And as I stared at the little furry body camethe difficulty of how the thing had been done. The vague dread that had been inmy mind since I had seen the inhuman face of the man at the stream grewdistincter as I stood there. I began to realize the hardihood of my expeditionamong these unknown people. The thicket about me became altered to myimagination. Every shadow became something more than a shadow, became an ambush,every rustle became a threat. Invisible things seemed watching me.I resolved to go back to the enclosure on the beach. I suddenly turned away andthrust myself violently – possibly even frantically – through the bushes,anxious to get a clear space about me again.I stopped just in time to prevent myself emerging upon an open space. It was akind of glade in the forest made by a fall; seedlings were already starting upto struggle for the vacant space, and beyond, the dense growth of stems andtwining vines and splashes of fungus and flowers closed in again. Before me,squatting together upon the fungoid ruins of a huge fallen tree, and stillunaware of my approach, were three grotesque human figures.One was evidently a female. The other two were men. They were naked, save forswathings of scarlet cloth about their middles, and their skins were of a dullpinkish drab colour, such as I had seen in no savages before. They had fat heavychinless faces, retreating foreheads, and a scant bristly hair upon their heads.Never before had I seen such bestial-looking creatures.They were talking, or at least one of the men was talking to the other two, andall three had been too closely interested to heed the rustling of my approach.They swayed their heads and shoulders from side to side. The speaker’s wordscame thick and sloppy, and though I could hear them distinctly I could notdistinguish what he said. He seemed to me to be reciting some complicatedgibberish. Presently his articulation became shriller, and spreading his handshe rose to his feet.At that time the others began to gibber in unison, also rising to their feet,spreading their hands, and swaying their bodies in rhythm with their chant. Inoticed then the abnormal shortness of their legs and their lank clumsy feet.All three began slowly to circle round, raising and stamping their feet andwaving their arms; a kind of tune crept into their rhythmic recitation, and arefrain – ‘Aloola’ or ‘Baloola’ it sounded like. Their eyes began to sparkle andtheir ugly faces to brighten with an expression of strange pleasure. Salivadropped from their lipless mouths.Suddenly, as I watched their grotesque and unaccountable gestures, I perceivedclearly for the first time what it was that had offended me, what had given methe two inconsistent and conflicting impressions of utter strangeness and yet ofthe strangest familiarity. The three creatures engaged in this mysterious ritewere human in shape, and yet human beings with the strangest air about them ofsome familiar animal. Each of these creatures, despite its human form, its ragof clothing, and the rough humanity of its bodily form, had woven into it, intoits movements, into the expression of its countenance, into its whole presence,some now irresistible suggestion of a hog, a swinish taint, the unmistakablemark of the beast.I stood overcome by this realization, and then the most horrible questioningscame rushing into my mind. They began leaping into the air, first one and thenthe other, whooping and grunting. Then one slipped, and for a moment was on allfours, to recover indeed forthwith. But that transitory gleam of the trueanimalism of these monsters was enough.I turned as noiselessly as possible, and becoming every now and then rigid withthe fear of being discovered as a branch cracked or leaf rustled, I pushed backinto the bushes. It was long before I grew bolder and dared to move freely.My one idea for the moment was to get away from these foul beings, and Iscarcely noticed that I had emerged upon a faint pathway amidst the trees. Then,suddenly traversing a little glade, I saw with an unpleasant start two clumsylegs among the trees, walking with noiseless footsteps parallel with my course,and perhaps thirty yards away from me. The head and upper part of the body werehidden by a tangle of creeper. I stopped abruptly, hoping the creature did notsee me. The feet stopped as I did. So nervous was I that I controlled an impulseto headlong flight with the utmost difficulty.Then, looking hard, I distinguished through the interlacing network the head andbody of the brute I had seen drinking. He moved his head. There was an emeraldflash in his eyes as he glanced at me from the shadow of the trees, ahalf-luminous colour, that vanished as he turned his head again. He wasmotionless for a moment, and then with noiseless tread began running through thegreen confusion. In another moment he had vanished behind some bushes. I couldnot see him, but I felt that he had stopped and was watching me again.What on earth was he – man or animal? What did he want with me? I had no weapon,not even a stick. Flight would be madness. At any rate the Thing, whatever itwas, lacked the courage to attack me. Setting my teeth hard I walked straighttowards him. I was anxious not to show the fear that seemed chilling mybackbone. I pushed through a tangle of tall white-flowered bushes, and saw himtwenty yards beyond, looking over his shoulder at me and hesitating. I advanceda step or two looking steadfastly into his eyes.‘Who are you?’ said I. He tried to meet my gaze.‘No!’ he said suddenly, and, turning, went bounding away from me through theundergrowth. Then he turned and stared at me again. His eyes shone brightly outof the dusk under the trees.My heart was in my mouth, but I felt my only chance was to face the danger, andwalked steadily towards him. He turned again and vanished into the dusk. Oncemore I thought I caught the glint of his eyes, and that was all.For the first time I realized how the lateness of the hour might affect me. Thesun had set some minutes since, the swift dusk of the tropics was already fadingout of the eastern sky, and a pioneer moth fluttered silently by my head. UnlessI would spend the night among the unknown dangers of the mysterious forest, Imust hasten back to the enclosure.The thought of a return to that pain-haunted refuge was extremely disagreeable,but still more so was the idea of being overtaken in the open by darkness, andall that darkness might conceal. I gave one more look into the blue shadows thathad swallowed up this odd creature, and then retraced my way down the slopetowards the stream, going as I judged in the direction from which I had come.I walked eagerly, perplexed by all these things, and presently found myself in alevel place among scattered trees. The colourless clearness that comes after thesunset flush was darkling. The blue sky above grew momentarily deeper, and thelittle stars one by one pierced the attenuated light; the interspaces of thetrees, the gaps in the further vegetation that had been hazy blue in thedaylight, grew black and mysterious.I pushed on. Colour vanished from the world, the tree tops rose against theluminous blue sky in inky silhouette, and all below that outline melted intoformless blackness. Presently the trees grew thinner, and the shrubbyundergrowth more abundant. Then there was a desolate space covered with whitesand, and then another expanse of tangled bushes.I was tormented by a faint rustling upon my right hand. I thought at first itwas fancy, for whenever I stopped there was silence save for the evening breezein the treetops. Then when I went on again there was an echo to my footsteps.I moved away from the thickets, keeping to the more open ground, andendeavouring by sudden turns now and then to surprise this thing, if it existed,in the act of creeping upon me. I saw nothing, and nevertheless my sense ofanother presence grew steadily. I increased my pace, and after some time came toa slight ridge, crossed it and turned sharply, regarding it steadfastly from thefurther side. It came out black and clear-cut against the darkling sky.And presently a shapeless lump heaved up momentarily against the skyline andvanished again. I felt assured now that my tawny-faced antagonist was stalkingme again. And coupled with that was another unpleasant realization, that I hadlost my way.For a time I hurried on hopelessly perplexed, pursued by that stealthy approach.Whatever it was, the thing either lacked the courage to attack me, or it waswaiting to take me at some disadvantage. I kept studiously to the open. At timesI would turn and listen, and presently I half-persuaded myself that my pursuerhad abandoned the chase, or was a mere creation of my disordered imagination.Then I heard the sound of the sea. I quickened my footsteps almost to a run, andimmediately there was a stumble in my rear.I turned suddenly and stared at the uncertain trees behind me. One black shadowseemed to leap into another. I listened rigid, and heard nothing but the whisperof the blood in my ears. I thought that my nerves were unstrung and that myimagination was tricking me, and turned resolutely towards the sound of the seaagain.In a minute or so the trees grew thinner, and I emerged upon a bare low headlandrunning out into the sombre water. The night was calm and clear, and thereflection of the growing multitude of the stars shivered in the tranquilheaving of the sea. Some way out, the wash upon an irregular band of reef shonewith a pallid light of its own. Westward I saw the zodiacal light mingling withthe yellow brilliance of the evening star. The coast fell away from me to theeast, and westward it was hidden by the shoulder of the cape. Then I recalledthe fact that Moreau’s beach lay to the west.A twig snapped behind me and there was a rustle. I turned and stood facing thedark trees. I could see nothing – or else I could see too much. Every dark formin the dimness had its ominous quality, its peculiar suggestion of alertwatchfulness. So I stood for perhaps a minute, and then, with an eye to thetrees still, turned westward to cross the headland. And as I moved, one amongthe lurking shadows moved to follow me.My heart beat quickly. Presently the broad sweep of a bay to the westward becamevisible, and I halted again. The noiseless shadow halted a dozen yards from me.A little point of light shone on the further bend of the curve, and the greysweep of the sandy beach lay faint under the starlight. Perhaps two miles awaywas that little point of light. To get to the beach I should have to go throughthe trees where the shadows lurked, and down a bushy slope.I could see the thing rather more distinctly now. It was no animal, for it stooderect. At that I opened my mouth to speak, and found a hoarse phlegm choked myvoice. I tried again, and shouted, ‘Who is there?’ There was no answer. Iadvanced a step. The thing did not move; only gathered itself together. My footstruck a stone.That gave me an idea. Without taking my eyes off the black form before me Istooped and picked up this lump of rock. But at my motion the thing turnedabruptly as a dog might have done, and slunk obliquely into the furtherdarkness. Then I recalled a schoolboy expedient against big dogs, twisted therock into my handkerchief, and gave this a turn round my wrist. I heard amovement further off among the shadows as if the thing was in retreat. Thensuddenly my tense excitement gave way; I broke into a profuse perspiration andfell a-trembling, with my adversary routed and this weapon in my hand.It was some time before I could summon resolution to go down through the treesand bushes upon the flank of the headland to the beach. At last I did it at arun, and as I emerged from the thicket upon the sand I heard some other bodycome crashing after me.At that I completely lost my head with fear, and began running along the sand.Forthwith there came the swift patter of soft feet in pursuit. I gave a wild cryand redoubled my pace. Some dim black things about three or four times the sizeof rabbits went running or hopping up from the beach towards the bushes as Ipassed. So long as I live I shall remember the terror of that chase. I ran nearthe water’s edge, and heard every now and then the splash of the feet thatgained upon me. Far away, hopelessly far, was the yellow light. All the nightabout us was black and still. Splash, splash came the pursuing feet nearer andnearer. I felt my breath going, for I was quite out of training; it whooped as Idrew it, and I felt a pain like a knife in my side. I perceived the thing wouldcome up with me long before I reached the enclosure, and, desperate and sobbingfor breath, I wheeled round upon it and struck at it as it came up to me –struck with all my strength. The stone came out of the sling of the handkerchiefas I did so.As I turned, the thing, which had been running on all fours, rose to its feet,and the missile fell fair on its left temple. The skull rang loud and theanimal-man blundered into me, thrust me back with his hands, and went staggeringpast me to fall headlong upon the sand with its face in the water. And there itlay still.I could not bring myself to approach that black heap. I left it there with thewater rippling round it under the still stars, and, giving it a wide berth,pursued my way towards the yellow glow of the house. And presently, with apositive effect of relief, came the pitiful moaning of the puma, the sound thathad originally driven me out to explore this mysterious island. At that, thoughI was faint and horribly fatigued, I gathered together all my strength and beganrunning again towards the light. It seemed to me a voice was calling me."},{"pageContent":"XTHE CRYING OF THE MANAs I drew near the house I saw that the light shone from the open door of myroom; and then I heard, coming from out the darkness at the side of that orangeoblong, the voice of Montgomery shouting ‘Prendick.’I continued running. Presently I heard him again. I replied by a feeble ‘Hullo!’and in another moment had staggered up to him.‘Where have you been?’ said he, holding me at arm’s length, so that the lightfrom the door fell on my face. ‘We have both been so busy that we forgot aboutyou until about half an hour ago.’He led me into the room and sat me down in the deck chair. For a while I wasblinded by the light. ‘We did not think you would start to explore this islandof ours without telling us,’ he said. And then, ‘I was afraid! But… what….Hullo!’For my last remaining strength slipped from me, and my head fell forward on mychest. I think he found a certain satisfaction in giving me brandy. ‘For God’ssake,’ said I, ‘fasten that door.’‘You’ve been meeting some of our curiosities, eh?’ said he. He locked the doorand turned to me again. He asked me no questions, but gave me some more brandyand water, and pressed me to eat. I was in a state of collapse. He saidsomething vague about his forgetting to warn me, and asked me briefly when Ileft the house and what I had seen. I answered him as briefly in fragmentarysentences. ‘Tell me what it all means,’ said I, in a state bordering onhysterics.‘It’s nothing so very dreadful,’ said he. ‘But I think you have been aboutenough for one day.’ The puma suddenly gave a sharp yell of pain. At that heswore under his breath. ‘I’m damned,’ said he, ‘if this place is not as bad asGower Street – with its cats.’‘Montgomery,’ said I, ‘what was that thing that came after me. Was it a beast,or was it a man?’‘If you don’t sleep tonight,’ he said, ‘you’ll be off your head tomorrow.’I stood up in front of him. ‘What was that thing that came after me?’ I asked.He looked me squarely in the eyes and twisted his mouth askew. His eyes, whichhad seemed animated a minute before, went dull. ‘From your account,’ said he,‘I’m thinking it was a bogle.’1 [note.html#ich10en01]I felt a gust of intense irritation that passed as quickly as it came. I flungmyself into the chair again and pressed my hands on my forehead. The puma beganagain.Montgomery came round behind me and put his hand on my shoulder. ‘Look here,Prendick,’ he said; ‘I had no business to let you drift out into this sillyisland of ours. But it’s not so bad as you think, man. Your nerves are worked torags. Let me give you something that will make you sleep. That… will keep on forhours yet. You simply must get to sleep, or I won’t answer for it.’I did not reply. I bowed forward and covered my face with my hands. Presently hereturned with a small measure containing a dark liquid. This he gave me. I tookit unresistingly, and he helped me into the hammock.When I awoke it was broad day. For a little while I lay flat, staring at theroof above me. The rafters, I observed, were made out of the timbers of a ship.Then I turned my head and saw a meal prepared for me on the table. I perceivedthat I was hungry, and prepared to clamber out of the hammock which, verypolitely anticipating my intention, twisted round and deposited me uponall-fours on the floor.I got up and sat down before the food. I had a heavy feeling in my head, andonly the vaguest memory at first of the things that had happened overnight. Themorning breeze blew very pleasantly through the unglazed window, and that andthe food contributed to the sense of animal comfort I experienced. Presently thedoor behind me, the door inward towards the yard of the enclosure, opened. Iturned and saw Montgomery’s face. ‘All right?’ said he. ‘I’m frightfully busy.’And he shut the door. Afterwards I discovered that he forgot to re-lock it.Then I recalled the expression of his face the previous night, and with that thememory of all I had experienced reconstructed itself before me. Even as thatfear returned to me came a cry from within. But this time it was not the cry ofthe puma.I put down the mouthful that hesitated upon my lips, and listened. Silence, savefor the whisper of the morning breeze. I began to think my ears had deceived me.After a long pause I resumed my meal, but with my ears still vigilant. PresentlyI heard something else very faint and low. I sat as if frozen in my attitude.Though it was faint and low, it moved me more profoundly than all that I hadhitherto heard of the abominations behind the wall. There was no mistake thistime in the quality of the dim broken sounds, no doubt at all of their source;for it was groaning, broken by sobs and gasps of anguish. It was no brute thistime. It was a human being in torment!And as I realized this I rose, and in three steps had crossed the room, seizedthe handle of the door into the yard, and flung it open before me.‘Prendick, man! Stop!’ cried Montgomery, intervening. A startled deerhoundyelped and snarled. There was blood, I saw, in the sink, brown and some scarlet,and I smelled the peculiar smell of carbolic acid. Then through an open doorwaybeyond in the dim light of the shadow, I saw something bound painfully upon aframework, scarred, red, and bandaged. And then blotting this out appeared theface of old Moreau, white and terrible.In a moment he had gripped me by the shoulder with a hand that was smeared red,had twisted me off my feet, and flung me headlong back into my own room. Helifted me as though I was a little child. I fell at full length upon the floor,and the door slammed and shut out the passionate intensity of his face. Then Iheard the key turn in the lock, and Montgomery’s voice in expostulation.‘Ruin the work of a lifetime!’ I heard Moreau say.‘He does not understand,’ said Montgomery, and other things that were inaudible.‘I can’t spare the time yet,’ said Moreau.The rest I did not hear. I picked myself up and stood trembling, my mind a chaosof the most horrible misgivings. Could the vivisection of men be possible? Thequestion shot like lightning across a tumultuous sky. And suddenly the cloudedhorror of my mind condensed into a vivid realization of my danger."},{"pageContent":"XITHE HUNTING OF THE MANIt came before my mind with an unreasonable hope of escape, that the outer doorof my room was still open to me. I was convinced now, absolutely assured, thatMoreau had been vivisecting a human being. All the time since I had heard hisname I had been trying to link in my mind in some way the grotesque animalism ofthe islanders with his abominations; and now I thought I saw it all. The memoryof his works in the transfusion of blood recurred to me. These creatures I hadseen were the victims of some hideous experiment!These sickening scoundrels had merely intended to keep me back, to fool me withtheir display of confidence, and presently to fall upon me with a fate morehorrible than death, with torture, and after torture the most hideousdegradation it was possible to conceive – to send me off, a lost soul, a beast,to the rest of their Comus rout.1 [note.html#ich11en01] I looked round for someweapon. Nothing. Then, with an inspiration, I turned over the deck chair, put myfoot on the side of it, and tore away the side rail. It happened that a nailcame away with the wood, and, projecting, gave a touch of danger to an otherwisepetty weapon. I heard a step outside, incontinently flung open the door, andfound Montgomery within a yard of it. He meant to lock the outer door.I raised this nailed stick of mine and cut at his face, but he sprang back. Ihesitated a moment, then turned and fled round the corner of the house.‘Prendick!’ I heard his astonished cry. ‘Don’t be a silly ass, man!’Another minute, thought I, and he would have had me locked in, and as ready as ahospital rabbit for my fate. He emerged behind the corner, for I heard himshout, ‘Prendick!’ Then he began to run after me, shouting things as he ran.This time, running blindly, I went northeastward, in a direction at right anglesto my previous expedition. Once, as I went running headlong up the beach, Iglanced over my shoulder and saw his attendant with him. I ran furiously up theslope, over it, then turned eastward along a rocky valley, fringed on eitherside with jungle. I ran perhaps a mile altogether, my chest straining, my heartbeating in my ears, and then, hearing nothing of Montgomery or his man andfeeling upon the verge of exhaustion, I doubled sharply back towards the beach,as I judged; and lay down in the shelter of a cane-brake.There I remained for a long time, too fearful to move, and indeed too fearfuleven to plan a course of action. The wild scene about me lay sleeping silentlyunder the sun, and the only sound near me was the thin hum of some small gnatsthat had discovered me. Presently I became aware of a drowsy breathing sound –the soughing of the sea upon the beach.After about an hour I heard Montgomery shouting my name far away to the north.That set me thinking of my plan of action. As I interpreted it then, this islandwas inhabited only by these two vivisectors and their animalized victims. Someof these, no doubt, they could press into their service against me, if needarose. I knew both Moreau and Montgomery carried revolvers; and, save for afeeble bar of deal spiked with a small nail, the merest mockery of a mace, I wasunarmed.So I lay still where I was until I began to think of food and drink. And at thatmoment the real hopelessness of my position came home to me. I knew no way ofgetting anything to eat; I was too ignorant of botany to discover any resort ofroot or fruit that might lie about me; I had no means of trapping the fewrabbits upon the island. It grew blanker the more I turned the prospect over. Atlast, in the desperation of my position, my mind turned to the animal-men I hadencountered. I tried to find some hope in what I remembered of them. In turn Irecalled each one I had seen, and tried to draw some augury of assistance frommy memory.Then suddenly I heard a staghound bay, and at that realized a new danger. I tooklittle time to think, or they would have caught me then, but, snatching up mynailed stick, rushed headlong from my hiding place towards the sound of the sea.I remember a growth of thorny plants with spines that stabbed like penknives. Iemerged, bleeding and with torn clothes, upon the lip of a long creek openingnorthward. I went straight into the waves without a minute’s hesitation, wadingup the creek, and presently finding myself knee-deep in a little stream. Iscrambled out at last on the westward bank, and, with my heart beating loudly inmy ears, crept into a tangle of ferns to await the issue. I heard the dog – itwas only one – draw nearer, and yelp when it came to the thorns. Then I heard nomore, and presently began to think I had escaped.The minutes passed, the silence lengthened out, and at last, after an hour ofsecurity, my courage began to return to me.By this time I was no longer very terrified or very miserable. For I had, as itwere, passed the limit of terror and despair. I felt now that my life waspractically lost, and that persuasion made me capable of daring anything. I hadeven a certain wish to encounter Moreau face to face. And as I had waded intothe water, I remembered that if I were too hard pressed at least one path ofescape from torment still lay open to me – they could not very well prevent mydrowning myself. I had half a mind to drown myself then, but an odd wish to seethe whole adventure out, a queer impersonal spectacular interest in myself,restrained me. I stretched my limbs, sore and painful from the pricks of thespiny plants, and stared around me at the trees; and, so suddenly that it seemedto jump out of the green tracery about it, my eyes lit upon a black facewatching me.I saw that it was the simian creature who had met the launch upon the beach. Hewas clinging to the oblique stem of a palm-tree. I gripped my stick, and stoodup facing him. He began chattering. ‘You, you, you,’ was all I could distinguishat first. Suddenly he dropped from the tree, and in another moment was holdingthe fronds apart, and staring curiously at me.I did not feel the same repugnance towards this creature that I had experiencedin my encounters with the other Beast Men. ‘You,’ he said, ‘in the boat.’ He wasa man then – at least, as much of a man as Montgomery’s attendant – for he couldtalk.‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I came in the boat. From the ship.’‘Oh!’ he said, and his bright restless eyes travelled over me, to my hands, tothe stick I carried, to my feet, to the tattered places in my coat and the cutsand scratches I had received from the thorns. He seemed puzzled at something.His eyes came back to my hands. He held his own hand out, and counted his digitsslowly, ‘One, Two, Three, Four, Five – eh?’I did not grasp his meaning then. Afterwards I was to find that a greatproportion of these Beast People had malformed hands, lacking sometimes eventhree digits. But guessing this was in some way a greeting, I did the same thingby way of reply. He grinned with immense satisfaction. Then his quick rovingglance went round again. He made a swift movement, and vanished. The fern frondshe had stood between came swishing together.I pushed out of the brake after him, and was astonished to find him swingingcheerfully by one lank arm from a rope of creepers that looped down from thefoliage overhead. His back was to me.‘Hullo!’ said I.He came down with a twisting jump, and stood facing me. ‘I say,’ said I, ‘wherecan I get something to eat?’‘Eat!’ he said. ‘Eat man’s food now.’ And his eyes went back to the swing ofropes. ‘At the huts.’‘But where are the huts?’‘Oh!’‘I’m new, you know.’At that he swung round, and set off at a quick walk. All his motions werecuriously rapid. ‘Come along,’ said he. I went with him to see the adventureout. I guessed the huts were some rough shelter, where he and some more of theseBeast People lived. I might perhaps find them friendly, find some handle intheir minds to take hold of. I did not know yet how far they were from the humanheritage I ascribed to them.My ape-like companion trotted along by my side, with his hands hanging down andhis jaw thrust forward. I wondered what memory he might have in him. ‘How longhave you been on this island?’ said I.‘How long?’ he asked. And, after having the question repeated, he held up threefingers. The creature was little better than an idiot. I tried to make out whathe meant by that, and it seems I bored him. After another question or two, hesuddenly left my side and sprang at some fruit that hung from a tree. He pulleddown a handful of prickly husks, and went on eating the contents. I noted thiswith satisfaction, for here, at least, was a hint for feeding. I tried him withsome other questions, but his chattering prompt responses were, as often as not,at cross-purposes with my question. Some few were appropriate, others quiteparrot-like.I was so intent upon these peculiarities that I scarcely noted the path wefollowed. Presently we came to trees, all charred and brown, and so to a bareplace covered with a yellow-white incrustation, across which went a driftingsmoke, pungent in whiffs to nose and eyes. On our right, over a shoulder of barerock, I saw the level blue of the sea. The path coiled down abruptly into anarrow ravine between two tumbled and knotty masses of blackish scoriae.2[note.html#ich11en02] Into this we plunged.It was extremely dark, this passage, after the blinding sunlight reflected fromthe sulphurous ground. Its walls grew steep, and approached one another.Blotches of green and crimson drifted across my eyes. My conductor stoppedsuddenly. ‘Home,’ said he, and I stood on the floor of a chasm that was at firstabsolutely dark to me. I heard some strange noises, and thrust the knuckles ofmy left hand into my eyes. I became aware of a disagreeable odour like that of amonkey’s cage ill-cleaned. Beyond, the rock opened again upon a gradual slope ofsunlit greenery, and on either hand the light smote down through a narrowchannel into the central gloom."},{"pageContent":"XIITHE SAYERS OF THE LAWThen something cold touched my hand. I started violently, and saw close to me adim pinkish thing, looking more like a flayed child than anything else in theworld. The creature had exactly the mild but repulsive features of a sloth, thesame low forehead and slow gestures. As the first shock of the change of lightpassed, I saw about me more distinctly. The little sloth-like creature wasstanding and staring at me. My conductor had vanished.This place was a narrow passage between high walls of lava, a crack in itsknotted flow; and on either side interwoven heaps of sea-mat, palm fans andreeds leaning against the rock, formed rough and impenetrably dark dens. Thewinding way up the ravine between these was scarcely three yards wide, and wasdisfigured by lumps of decaying fruit pulp and other refuse which accounted forthe disagreeable stench of the place.The little pink sloth creature was still blinking at me when my Ape Manreappeared at the aperture of the nearest of these dens, and beckoned me in. Ashe did so a slouching monster wriggled out of one of the places further up thisstrange street, and stood up in featureless silhouette against the bright greenbeyond, staring at me. I hesitated – had half a mind to bolt the way I had come– and then, determined to go through with the adventure, gripped my nailed stickabout the middle, and crawled into the little evil-smelling lean-to after myconductor.It was a semicircular space, shaped like the half of a beehive, and against therocky wall that formed the inner side of it was a pile of variegated fruits,coconuts and others. Some rough vessels of lava and wood stood about the floor,and one on a rough stool. There was no fire. In the darkest corner of the hutsat a shapeless mass of darkness that grunted ‘Hey!’ as I came in, and my ApeMan stood in the dim light of the doorway and held out a split coconut to me asI crawled into the other corner and squatted down. I took it and began gnawingit, as serenely as possible in spite of my tense trepidation and the nearlyintolerable closeness of the den. The little pink sloth creature stood in theaperture of the hut, and something else with a drab face and bright eyes camestaring over its shoulder.‘Hey,’ came out of the lump of mystery opposite. ‘It is a man! It is a man!’gabbled my conductor – ‘a man, a man, a live man, like me.’‘Shut up!’ said the voice from the dark, and grunted. I gnawed my coconut amidan impressive silence. I peered hard into the blackness, but could distinguishnothing. ‘It is a man,’ the voice repeated. ‘He comes to live with us?’ It was athick voice with something in it, a kind of whistling overtone, that struck meas peculiar, but the English accent was strangely good.The Ape Man looked at me as though he expected something. I perceived the pausewas interrogative. ‘He comes to live with you,’ I said.‘It is a man. He must learn the Law.’I began to distinguish now a deeper blackness in the black, a vague outline of ahunched-up figure. Then I noticed the opening of the place was darkened by twomore heads. My hand tightened on my stick. The thing in the dark repeated in alouder tone, ‘Say the words.’ I had missed its last remark. ‘Not to go onall-Fours; that is the Law’ – it repeated in a kind of singsong.I was puzzled. ‘Say the words,’ said the Ape Man, repeating, and the figures inthe doorway echoed this with a threat in the tone of their voices. I realized Ihad to repeat this idiotic formula. And then began the insanest ceremony. Thevoice in the dark began intoning a mad litany, line by line, and I and the restto repeat it. As they did so, they swayed from side to side, and beat theirhands upon their knees, and I followed their example. I could have imagined Iwas already dead and in another world. The dark hut, these grotesque dimfigures, just flecked here and there by a glimmer of light, and all of themswaying in unison and chanting:–‘Not to go on all-Fours; that is the Law. Are we not Men?‘Not to suck up Drink; that is the Law. Are we not Men?‘Not to eat Flesh or Fish; that is the Law. Are we not Men?‘Not to claw Bark of Trees; that is the Law. Are we not Men?‘Not to chase other Men; that is the Law. Are we not Men?’And so from the prohibition of these acts of folly, on to the prohibition ofwhat I thought then were the maddest, most impossible, and most indecent thingsone could well imagine. A kind of rhythmic fervour fell on all of us; we gabbledand swayed faster and faster, repeating this amazing law. Superficially thecontagion of these brute men was upon me, but deep down within me laughter anddisgust struggled together. We ran through a long list of prohibitions, and thenthe chant swung round to a new formula:‘His is the House of Pain.‘His is the Hand that makes.‘His is the Hand that wounds.‘His is the Hand that heals.’1 [note.html#ich12en01]And so on for another long series, mostly quite incomprehensible gibberish tome, about Him, whoever he might be. I could have fancied it was a dream, butnever before have I heard chanting in a dream.‘His is the lightning-flash,’ we sang. ‘His is the deep salt sea.’A horrible fancy came into my head that Moreau, after animalizing these men, hadinfected their dwarfed brains with a kind of deification of himself. However, Iwas too keenly aware of white teeth and strong claws about me to stop mychanting on that account. ‘His are the stars in the sky.’At last that song ended. I saw the Ape Man’s face shining with perspiration, andmy eyes being now accustomed to the darkness, I saw more distinctly the figurein the corner from which the voice came. It was the size of a man, but it seemedcovered with a dull grey hair almost like a Skye terrier. What was it? What werethey all? Imagine yourself surrounded by the most horrible cripples and maniacsit is possible to conceive, and you may understand a little of my feelings withthese grotesque caricatures of humanity about me.‘He is a five-man, a five-man, a five-man… like me,’ said the Ape Man.I held out my hands. The grey creature in the corner leaned forward. ‘Not to runon all-Fours; that is the Law. Are we not Men?’ he said. He put out a strangelydistorted talon, and gripped my fingers. The thing was almost like the hoof of adeer produced into claws. I could have yelled with surprise and pain. His facecame forward and peered at my nails, came forward into the light of the openingof the hut, and I saw with a quivering disgust that it was like the face ofneither man nor beast, but a mere shock of grey hair, with three shadowyover-archings to mark the eyes and mouth.‘He has little nails,’ said this grisly creature in his hairy beard. ‘It iswell. Many are troubled with big nails.’He threw my hand down, and instinctively I gripped my stick. ‘Eat roots andherbs – it is His will,’ said the Ape Man.‘I am the Sayer of the Law,’ said the grey figure. ‘Here come all that be new,to learn the Law. I sit in the darkness and say the Law.’‘It is even so,’ said one of the beasts in the doorway.‘Evil are the punishments of those who break the Law. None escape.’‘None escape,’ said the Beast Folk, glancing furtively at each other.‘None, none,’ said the Ape Man. ‘None escape. See! I did a little thing, a wrongthing, once. I jabbered, jabbered, stopped talking. None could understand. I amburned, branded in the hand. He is great, he is good!’‘None escape,’ said the grey creature in the corner.‘None escape,’ said the Beast People, looking askance at one another.‘For everyone the want that is bad,’ said the grey Sayer of the Law. ‘What youwill want, we do not know. We shall know. Some want to follow things that move,to watch and slink and wait and spring, to kill and bite, bite deep and rich,sucking the blood…. It is bad. “Not to chase other Men; that is the Law. Are wenot Men? Not to eat Flesh or Fish; that is the Law. Are we not Men?” ’‘None escape,’ said a dappled brute standing in the doorway.‘For everyone the want that is bad,’ said the grey Sayer of the Law. ‘Some wantto go tearing with teeth and hands into the roots of things, snuffing into theearth…. It is bad.’‘None escape,’ said the men in the door.‘Some go clawing trees, some go scratching at the graves of the dead; some gofighting with foreheads or feet or claws; some bite suddenly, none givingoccasion; some love uncleanness.’‘None escape,’ said the Ape Man, scratching his calf.‘None escape,’ said the little pink sloth creature.‘Punishment is sharp and sure. Therefore learn the Law. Say the words,’ andincontinently he began again the strange litany of the Law, and again I and allthese creatures began singing and swaying. My head reeled with this jabberingand the close stench of the place, but I kept on, trusting to find presentlysome chance of a new development. ‘Not to go on all-Fours; that is the Law. Arewe not Men?’We were making such a noise that I noticed nothing of a tumult outside untilsomeone, who, I think, was one of the two Swine Men I had seen, thrust his headover the little pink sloth creature and shouted something excitedly, somethingthat I did not catch. Incontinently those at the opening of the hut vanished, myApe Man rushed out, the thing that had sat in the dark followed him – I onlyobserved it was big and clumsy, and covered with silvery hair – and I was leftalone.Then before I reached the aperture I heard the yelp of a staghound.In another moment I was standing outside the hovel, my chair-rail in my hand,every muscle of me quivering. Before me were the clumsy backs of perhaps a scoreof these Beast People, their misshapen heads half hidden by theirshoulder-blades. They were gesticulating excitedly. Other half-animal facesglared interrogation out of the hovels. Looking in the direction in which theyfaced I saw coming through the haze under the trees beyond the end of thepassage of dens the dark figure and awful white face of Moreau. He was holdingthe leaping staghound back, and close behind him came Montgomery, revolver inhand.For a moment I stood horror-struck.I turned and saw the passages behind me blocked by another heavy brute with ahuge grey face and twinkling little eyes, advancing towards me. I looked roundand saw to the right of me, and half a dozen yards in front of me, a narrow gapin the wall of rock through which a ray of light slanted into the shadows.‘Stop!’ cried Moreau, as I strode towards this, and then, ‘Hold him!’ At that,first one face turned towards me, and then others. Their bestial minds werehappily slow.I dashed my shoulder into a clumsy monster who was turning to see what Moreaumeant, and flung him forward into another. I felt his hands fly round, clutchingat me and missing me. The little pink sloth creature dashed at me and I cut itover, gashed down its ugly face with the nail in my stick, and in another minuteI was scrambling up a steep side pathway, a kind of sloping chimney out of theravine. I heard a howl behind me, and cries of ‘Catch him!’ ‘Hold him!’ and thegrey-faced creature appeared behind me and jammed his huge bulk into the cleft.‘Go on, go on!’ they howled. I clambered up the narrow cleft in the rock, andcame out upon the sulphur on the westward side of the village of the Beast Men.I ran over the white space and down a steep slope through a scattered growth oftrees, and came to a low-lying stretch of tall reeds. Through this I pushed intoa dark thick undergrowth that was black and succulent under foot. That gap wasaltogether fortunate for me, for the narrow way slanting obliquely upward musthave impeded the nearer pursuers. As I plunged into the reeds the foremost hadonly just emerged from the gap. I broke my way through this undergrowth for someminutes. The air behind me and about me was soon full of threatening cries. Iheard the tumult of my pursuers in the gap up the slope, then the crashing ofthe reeds, and every now and then the crackling of a branch. Some of thecreatures roared like excited beasts of prey. The staghound yelped to the left.I heard Moreau and Montgomery shouting in the same direction. I turned sharplyto the right. It seemed to me even then that I heard Montgomery shouting for meto run for my life.Presently the ground gave, rich and oozy, under my feet; but I was desperate,and went headlong into it, struggled through knee-deep, and so came to a windingpath among tall canes. The noise of my pursuers passed away to my left. In oneplace three strange pink hopping animals, about the size of cats, bolted beforemy footsteps. This pathway ran uphill, across another open space covered withwhite incrustation, and plunged into a cane-brake again.Then suddenly it turned parallel with the edge of a steep walled gap which camewithout warning like the haha of an English park2 [note.html#ich12en02] – turnedwith unexpected abruptness. I was still running with all my might, and I neversaw this drop until I was flying headlong through the air.I fell on my forearms and head, among thorns, and rose with a torn ear andbleeding face. I had fallen into a precipitous ravine, rocky and thorny, full ofa hazy mist that drifted about me in wisps, and with a narrow streamlet, fromwhich this mist came, meandering down the centre. I was astonished at this thinfog in the full blaze of daylight, but I had no time to stand wondering then. Iturned to my right downstream, hoping to come to the sea in that direction, andso have my way open to drown myself. It was only later I found that I haddropped my nailed stick in my fall.Presently the ravine grew narrower for a space, and carelessly I stepped intothe stream. I jumped out again pretty quickly, for the water was almost boiling.I noticed, too, there was a thin sulphurous scum drifting upon its coilingwater. Almost immediately came a turn in the ravine and the indistinct bluehorizon. The nearer sea was flashing the sun from a myriad facets. I saw mydeath before me.But I was hot and panting. I felt more than a touch of exultation, too, athaving distanced my pursuers. It was not in me then to go out and drown myself.My blood was too warm.I stared back the way I had come. I listened. Save for the hum of the gnats andthe chirp of some small insects that hopped among the thorns, the air wasabsolutely still.Then came the yelp of a dog, very faint, and a chattering and gibbering, thesnap of a whip and voices. They grew louder, then fainter again. The noisereceded up the stream and faded away. For a while the chase was over.But I knew now how much hope of help for me lay in the Beast People."},{"pageContent":"XIIIA PARLEYI turned again and went on down towards the sea. I found the hot streambroadened out to a shallow weedy sand, in which an abundance of crabs, andlong-bodied, many-legged creatures started from my footfall. I walked to thevery edge of the salt water, and then I felt I was safe. I turned and stared –arms akimbo – at the thick green behind me, into which the steamy ravine cutlike a smoking gash. But as I say, I was too full of excitement, and – a truesaying, though those who have never known danger may doubt it – too desperate todie.Then it came into my head that there was one chance before me yet. While Moreauand Montgomery and their bestial rabble chased me through the island, might Inot go round the beach until I came to their enclosure? – make a flank marchupon them, in fact, and then with a rock lugged out of their loosely built wallperhaps smash in the lock of the smaller door and see what I could find – knife,pistol, or what-not – to fight them with when they returned? It was at any ratea chance of getting a price for my life.So I turned to the westward and walked along by the water’s edge. The settingsun flashed his blinding heat into my eyes. The slight Pacific tide was runningin with a gentle ripple.Presently the shore fell away southward and the sun came round upon my righthand. Then suddenly, far in front of me, I saw first one and then severalfigures emerging from the bushes – Moreau with his grey staghound, thenMontgomery, and two others. At that I stopped.They saw me and began gesticulating and advancing. I stood watching themapproach. The two Beast Men came running forward to cut me off from theundergrowth inland. Montgomery came running also, but straight towards me.Moreau followed slower with the dog.At last I roused myself from inaction, and turning seaward walked straight intothe water. The water was very shallow at first. I was thirty yards out beforethe waves reached to my waist. Dimly I could see the intertidal creaturesdarting away from my feet.‘What are you doing, man?’ cried Montgomery.I turned, standing waist-deep, and stared at them.Montgomery stood panting at the margin of the water. His face was bright redwith exertion, his long flaxen hair blown about his head, and his droppingnether lip showed his irregular teeth. Moreau was just coming up, his face paleand firm, and the dog at his hand barked at me. Both men had heavy whips.Further up the beach stared the Beast Men.‘What am I doing? – I am going to drown myself,’ said I.Montgomery and Moreau looked at one another. ‘Why?’ asked Moreau.‘Because that is better than being tortured by you.’‘I told you so,’ said Montgomery, and Moreau said something in a low tone.‘What makes you think I shall torture you?’ asked Moreau.‘What I saw,’ I said. ‘And those – yonder.’‘Hush!’ said Moreau, and held up his hand.‘I will not,’ said I; ‘they were men: what are they now? I at least will not belike them.’ I looked past my interlocutors. Up the beach were M’ling,Montgomery’s attendant, and one of the white swathed brutes from the boat.Further up, in the shadow of the trees, I saw my little Ape Man, and behind himsome other dim figures.‘Who are these creatures?’ said I, pointing to them, and raising my voice moreand more that it might reach them. ‘They were men – men like yourselves, whomyou have infected with some bestial taint, men whom you have enslaved, and whomyou still fear. – You who listen,’ I cried, pointing now to Moreau, and shoutingpast him to the Beast Men, ‘You who listen! Do you not see these men still fearyou, go in dread of you? Why then do you fear them? You are many—’‘For God’s sake,’ cried Montgomery, ‘stop that, Prendick!’‘Prendick!’ cried Moreau.They both shouted together as if to drown my voice. And behind them lowered thestaring faces of the Beast Men, wondering, their deformed hands hanging down,their shoulders hunched up. They seemed, as I fancied then, to be trying tounderstand me, to remember something of their human past.I went on shouting, I scarcely remember what. That Moreau and Montgomery couldbe killed; that they were not to be feared: that was the burthen of what I putinto the heads of the Beast People to my own ultimate undoing. I saw thegreen-eyed man in the dark rags, who had met me on the evening of my arrival,come out from among the trees, and others followed him to hear me better.At last for want of breath I paused.‘Listen to me for a moment,’ said the steady voice of Moreau, ‘and then say whatyou will.’‘Well?’ said I.He coughed, thought, then shouted: ‘Latin, Prendick! Bad Latin! Schoolboy Latin!But try and understand. Hi non sunt homines, sunt animalia qui nos habemus…vivisected.1 [note.html#ich13en01] A humanizing process. I will explain. Comeashore.’I laughed. ‘A pretty story,’ said I. ‘They talk, build houses, cook. They weremen. It’s likely I’ll come ashore.’‘The water just beyond where you stand is deep… and full of sharks.’‘That’s my way,’ said I. ‘Short and sharp. Presently.’‘Wait a minute.’ He took something out of his pocket that flashed back the sun,and dropped the object at his feet. ‘That’s a loaded revolver,’ said he.‘Montgomery here will do the same. Now we are going up the beach until you aresatisfied the distance is safe. Then come and take the revolvers.’‘Not I. You have a third between you.’‘I want you to think over things, Prendick. In the first place, I never askedyou to come upon this island. In the next, we had you drugged last night, had wewanted to work you any mischief; and in the next, now your first panic is over,and you can think a little – is Montgomery here quite up to the character yougive him? We have chased you for your good. Because this island is full of…inimical phenomena. Why should we want to shoot you when you have just offeredto drown yourself?’‘Why did you set… your people on to me when I was in the hut?’‘We felt sure of catching you and bringing you out of danger. Afterwards we drewaway from the scent – for your good.’I mused. It seemed just possible. Then I remembered something again.‘But I saw,’ said I, ‘in the enclosure—’‘That was the puma.’‘Look here, Prendick,’ said Montgomery. ‘You’re a silly ass. Come out of thewater and take these revolvers, and talk. We can’t do anything more then than wecould do now.’I will confess that then, and indeed always, I distrusted and dreaded Moreau.But Montgomery was a man I felt I understood.‘Go up the beach,’ said I, after thinking, and added, ‘holding your hands up.’‘Can’t do that,’ said Montgomery, with an explanatory nod over his shoulder.‘Undignified.’‘Go up to the trees, then,’ said I, ‘as you please.’‘It’s a damned silly ceremony,’ said Montgomery.Both turned and faced the six or seven grotesque creatures, who stood there inthe sunlight, solid, casting shadows, moving, and yet so incredibly unreal.Montgomery cracked his whip at them, and forthwith they all turned and fledhelter-skelter into the trees. And when Montgomery and Moreau were at a distanceI judged sufficient, I waded ashore, and picked up and examined the revolvers.To satisfy myself against the subtlest trickery I discharged one at a roundedlump of lava, and had the satisfaction of seeing the stone pulverized and thebeach splashed with lead.Still I hesitated for a moment.‘I’ll take the risk,’ said I, at last, and with a revolver in each hand I walkedup the beach towards them.‘That’s better,’ said Moreau, without affectation. ‘As it is, you have wastedthe best part of my day with your confounded panic.’And with a touch of contempt that humiliated me, he and Montgomery turned andwent on in silence before me.The knot of Beast Men, still wondering, stood back among the trees. I passedthem as serenely as possible. One started to follow me, but retreated again whenMontgomery cracked his whip. The rest stood silent – watching. They may oncehave been animals. But never before did I see an animal trying to think."},{"pageContent":"XIVDOCTOR MOREAU EXPLAINS‘And now, Prendick, I will explain,’ said Doctor Moreau, so soon as we had eatenand drunk. ‘I must confess you are the most dictatorial guest I everentertained. I warn you that this is the last I do to oblige you. The next thingyou threaten to commit suicide about I shan’t do – even at some personalinconvenience.’He sat in my deck chair, a cigar half consumed in his white dexterous-lookingfingers. The light of the swinging lamp fell on his white hair; he staredthrough the little window out at the starlight. I sat as far away from him aspossible, the table between us and the revolvers to hand. Montgomery was notpresent. I did not yet care to be with the two of them in such a little room.‘You admit that vivisected human being, as you called it, is after all only thepuma?’ said Moreau. He had made me visit that horror in the inner room to assuremyself of its inhumanity.‘It is the puma,’ I said, ‘still alive, but cut and mutilated as I pray I maynever see living flesh again. Of all vile—’‘Never mind that,’ said Moreau. ‘At least spare me those youthful horrors.Montgomery used to be just the same. You admit it is the puma. Now be quietwhile I reel off my physiological lecture to you.’ And forthwith, beginning inthe tone of a man supremely bored, but presently warming a little, he explainedhis work to me. He was very simple and convincing. Now and then there was atouch of sarcasm in his voice. Presently I found myself hot with shame at ourmutual positions.The creatures I had seen were not men, had never been men. They were animals –humanized animals – triumphs of vivisection.‘You forget all that a skilled vivisector can do with living things,’ saidMoreau. ‘For my own part I’m puzzled why the things I have done here have notbeen done before. Small efforts of course have been made – amputation,tongue-cutting, excisions. Of course you know a squint may be induced or curedby surgery? Then in the case of excisions you have all kinds of secondarychanges, pigmentary disturbances, modifications of the passions, alterations inthe secretion of fatty tissue. I have no doubt you have heard of these things?’‘Of course,’ said I. ‘But these foul creatures of yours—’‘All in good time,’ said he, waving his hand at me; ‘I am only beginning. Thoseare trivial cases of alteration. Surgery can do better things than that. Thereis building up as well as breaking down and changing. You have heard, perhaps,of a common surgical operation resorted to in cases where the nose has beendestroyed. A flap of skin is cut from the forehead, turned down on the nose, andheals in the new position. This is a kind of grafting in a new position of partof an animal upon itself. Grafting of freshly obtained material from anotheranimal is also possible – the case of teeth, for example. The grafting of skinand bone is done to facilitate healing. The surgeon places in the middle of thewound pieces of skin snipped from another animal, or fragments of bone from avictim freshly killed. Hunter’s cockspur – possibly you have heard of that –flourished on the bull’s neck.1 [note.html#ich14en01] And the rhinoceros rats ofthe Algerian Zouaves2 [note.html#ich14en02] are also to be thought of – monstersmanufactured by transferring a slip from the tail of an ordinary rat to itssnout, and allowing it to heal in that position.’‘Monsters manufactured!’ said I. ‘Then you mean to tell me—’‘Yes. These creatures you have seen are animals carven and wrought into newshapes. To that – to the study of the plasticity of living forms – my life hasbeen devoted. I have studied for years, gaining in knowledge as I go. I see youlook horrified, yet I am telling you nothing new. It all lay on the surface ofpractical anatomy years ago, but no one had the temerity to touch it. It’s notsimply the outward form of an animal I can change. The physiology, the chemicalrhythm of the creature may also be made to undergo an enduring modification, ofwhich vaccination and other methods of inoculation with living or dead matterare examples that will no doubt be familiar to you. A similar operation is thetransfusion of blood, with which subject indeed I began. These are all familiarcases. Less so, and probably far more extensive, were the operations of thosemediaeval practitioners who made dwarfs and beggar cripples and show-monsters;some vestiges of whose art still remain in the preliminary manipulation of theyoung mountebank or contortionist. Victor Hugo gives an account of them in‘L’Homme qui Rit’….3 [note.html#ich14en03] But perhaps my meaning grows plainnow. You begin to see that it is a possible thing to transplant tissue from onepart of an animal to another or from one animal to another, to alter itschemical reactions and methods of growth, to modify the articulation of itslimbs, and indeed to change it in its most intimate structure?‘And yet this extraordinary branch of knowledge has never been sought as an end,and systematically, by modern investigators, until I took it up! Some suchthings have been hit upon in the last resort of surgery; most of the kindredevidence that will recur to your mind has been demonstrated, as it were, byaccident – by tyrants, by criminals, by the breeders of horses and dogs, by allkinds of untrained clumsy-handed men working for their own immediate ends. I wasthe first man to take up this question armed with antiseptic surgery, and with areally scientific knowledge of the laws of growth.‘Yet one would imagine it must have been practised in secret before. Suchcreatures as the Siamese Twins…. And in the vaults of the Inquisition. No doubttheir chief aim was artistic torture, but some at least of the inquisitors musthave had a touch of scientific curiosity….’‘But,’ said I. ‘These things – these animals talk!’He said that was so, and proceeded to point out that the possibilities ofvivisection do not stop at a mere physical metamorphosis. A pig may be educated.The mental structure is even less determinate than the bodily. In our growingscience of hypnotism we find the promise of a possibility of replacing oldinherent instincts by new suggestions, grafted upon or replacing the inheritedfixed ideas. Very much indeed of what we call moral education is such anartificial modification and perversion of instinct; pugnacity is trained intocourageous self-sacrifice, and suppressed sexuality into religious emotion. Andthe great difference between man and monkey is in the larynx, he said, in theincapacity to frame delicately different sound-symbols by which thought could besustained. In this I failed to agree with him, but with a certain incivility hedeclined to notice my objection. He repeated that the thing was so, andcontinued his account of his work.But I asked him why he had taken the human form as a model. There seemed to methen, and there still seems to me now, a strange wickedness in that choice.He confessed that he had chosen that form by chance. ‘I might just as well haveworked to form sheep into llamas, and llamas into sheep. I suppose there issomething in the human form that appeals to the artistic turn of mind morepowerfully than any animal shape can. But I’ve not confined myself toman-making. Once or twice…’ He was silent, for a minute perhaps. ‘These years!How they have slipped by! And here I have wasted a day saving your life, and amnow wasting an hour explaining myself!’‘But,’ said I, ‘I still do not understand. Where is your justification forinflicting all this pain? The only thing that could excuse vivisection to mewould be some application—’‘Precisely,’ said he. ‘But you see I am differently constituted. We are ondifferent platforms. You are a materialist.’‘I am not a materialist,’ I began hotly.‘In my view – in my view. For it is just this question of pain that parts us. Solong as visible or audible pain turns you sick, so long as your own pains driveyou, so long as pain underlies your propositions about sin, so long, I tell you,you are an animal, thinking a little less obscurely what an animal feels. Thispain—’I gave an impatient shrug at such sophistry.‘Oh! but it is such a little thing. A mind truly opened to what science has toteach must see that it is a little thing. It may be that, save in this littleplanet, this speck of cosmic dust, invisible long before the nearest star couldbe attained – it may be, I say, that nowhere else does this thing called painoccur. But the laws we feel our way towards… Why, even on this earth, even amongliving things, what pain is there?’He drew a little penknife, as he spoke, from his pocket, opened the smallerblade and moved his chair so that I could see his thigh. Then, choosing theplace deliberately, he drove the blade into his leg and withdrew it.‘No doubt you have seen that before. It does not hurt a pin-prick. But what doesit show? The capacity for pain is not needed in the muscle, and it is not placedthere; it is but little needed in the skin, and only here and there over thethigh is a spot capable of feeling pain. Pain is simply our intrinsic medicaladviser to warn us and stimulate us. All living flesh is not painful, nor is allnerve, nor even all sensory nerve. There’s no taint of pain, real pain, in thesensations of the optic nerve. If you wound the optic nerve you merely seeflashes of light, just as disease of the auditory nerve merely means a hummingin our ears. Plants do not feel pain; the lower animals – it’s possible thatsuch animals as the starfish and crayfish do not feel pain. Then with men, themore intelligent they become the more intelligently they will see after theirown welfare, and the less they will need the goad to keep them out of danger. Inever yet heard of a useless thing that was not ground out of existence byevolution sooner or later. Did you? And pain gets needless.‘Then I am a religious man, Prendick, as every sane man must be. It may be Ifancy I have seen more of the ways of this world’s Maker than you – for I havesought his laws, in my way, all my life, while you, I understand, have beencollecting butterflies. And I tell you, pleasure and pain have nothing to dowith heaven and hell. Pleasure and pain – Bah! What is your theologian’s ecstasybut Mahomet’s houri in the dark?4 [note.html#ich14en04] This store men and womenset on pleasure and pain, Prendick, is the mark of the beast upon them, the markof the beast from which they came. Pain! Pain and pleasure – they are for us,only so long as we wriggle in the dust….‘You see, I went on with this research just the way it led me. That is the onlyway I ever heard of research going. I asked a question, devised some method ofgetting an answer, and got – a fresh question. Was this possible, or thatpossible? You cannot imagine what this means to an investigator, what anintellectual passion grows upon him. You cannot imagine the strange colourlessdelight of these intellectual desires. The thing before you is no longer ananimal, a fellow-creature, but a problem. Sympathetic pain – all I know of it Iremember as a thing I used to suffer from years ago. I wanted – it was the onlything I wanted – to find out the extreme limit of plasticity in a livingshape.’5 [note.html#ich14en05]‘But,’ said I, ‘the thing is an abomination—’‘To this day I have never troubled about the ethics of the matter. The study ofNature makes a man at last as remorseless as Nature. I have gone on, not heedinganything but the question I was pursuing, and the material has… dripped into thehuts yonder…. It is nearly eleven years since we came here, I and Montgomery andsix Kanakas.6 [note.html#ich14en06] I remember the green stillness of the islandand the empty ocean about us as though it was yesterday. The place seemedwaiting for me.‘The stores were landed and the house was built. The Kanakas founded some hutsnear the ravine. I went to work here upon what I had brought with me. Somedisagreeable things happened at first. I began with a sheep, and killed it aftera day and a half by a slip of the scalpel; I took another sheep and made a thingof pain and fear, and left it bound up to heal. It looked quite human to me whenI had finished it, but when I went to it I was discontented with it; itremembered me and was terrified beyond imagination, and it had no more than thewits of a sheep. The more I looked at it the clumsier it seemed, until at last Iput the monster out of its misery. These animals without courage, thesefear-haunted pain-driven things, without a spark of pugnacious energy to facetorment – they are no good for man-making.‘Then I took a gorilla I had, and upon that, working with infinite care, andmastering difficulty after difficulty, I made my first man. All the week, nightand day, I moulded him. With him it was chiefly the brain that needed moulding;much had to be added, much changed. I thought him a fair specimen of the negroidtype when I had done him, and he lay, bandaged, bound, and motionless before me.It was only when his life was assured that I left him, and came into the roomand found Montgomery much as you are. He had heard some of the cries as thething grew human, cries like those that disturbed you so. I didn’t take himcompletely into my confidence at first. And the Kanakas, too, had realizedsomething of it. They were scared out of their wits by the sight of me. I gotMontgomery over to me – in a way, but I and he had the hardest job to preventthe Kanakas deserting. Finally they did, and so we lost the yacht. I spent manydays educating the brute – altogether I had him for three or four months. Itaught him the rudiments of English, gave him ideas of counting, even made thething read the alphabet. But at that he was slow – though I’ve met with idiotsslower. He began with a clean sheet, mentally; had no memories left in his mindof what he had been. When his scars were quite healed, and he was no longeranything but painful and stiff, and able to converse a little, I took him yonderand introduced him to the Kanakas as an interesting stowaway.‘They were horribly afraid of him at first, somehow – which offended me rather,for I was conceited about him – but his ways seemed so mild, and he was soabject, that after a time they received him and took his education in hand. Hewas quick to learn, very imitative and adaptive, and built himself a hovelrather better, it seemed to me, than their own shanties. There was one among theboys, a bit of a missionary, and he taught the thing to read, or at least topick out letters, and gave him some rudimentary ideas of morality, but it seemsthe beast’s habits were not all that is desirable.‘I rested from work for some days, and was in a mind to write an account of thewhole affair to wake up English physiology. Then I came upon the creaturesquatting up in a tree gibbering at two of the Kanakas who had been teasing him.I threatened him, told him the inhumanity of such a proceeding, aroused hissense of shame, and came here resolved to do better before I took my work backto England. I have been doing better; but somehow the things drift back again,the stubborn beast flesh grows, day by day, back again…. I mean to do betterthings still. I mean to conquer that. This puma….‘But that’s the story. All the Kanaka boys are dead now. One fell overboard thelaunch, and one died of a wounded heel that he poisoned in some way withplant-juice. Three went away in the yacht, and I suppose, and hope, weredrowned. The other one… was killed. Well – I have replaced them. Montgomery wenton much as you are disposed to do at first, and then…’‘What became of the other one?’ said I sharply – ‘the other Kanaka who waskilled?’‘The fact is, after I had made a number of human creatures I made a thing –’ Hehesitated.‘Yes?’ said I.‘It was killed.’‘I don’t understand,’ said I; ‘do you mean to say…’‘It killed the Kanaka – yes. It killed several other things that it caught. Wechased it for a couple of days. It only got loose by accident – I never meant itto get away. It wasn’t finished. It was purely an experiment. It was a limblessthing with a horrible face that writhed along the ground in a serpentinefashion. It was immensely strong and in infuriating pain, and it travelledrapidly in a rolling way like a porpoise swimming. It lurked in the woods forsome days, doing mischief to all it came across, until we hunted it, and then itwriggled into the northern part of the island, and we divided the party to closein upon it. Montgomery insisted upon coming with me. The man had a rifle, andwhen his body was found one of the barrels was curved into the shape of an S,and very nearly bitten through…. Montgomery shot the thing…. After that I stuckto the ideal of humanity – except for little things.’He became silent. I sat in silence watching his face.‘So for twenty years altogether – counting nine years in England – I have beengoing on, and there is still something in everything I do that defeats me, makesme dissatisfied, challenges me to further effort. Sometimes I rise above mylevel, sometimes I fall below it, but always I fall short of the things I dream.The human shape I can get now, almost with ease, so that it is lithe andgraceful, or thick and strong; but often there is trouble with the hands andclaws – painful things that I dare not shape too freely. But it is in the subtlegrafting and reshaping one must needs do to the brain that my trouble lies. Theintelligence is often oddly low, with unaccountable blank ends, unexpected gaps.And least satisfactory of all is something that I cannot touch, somewhere – Icannot determine where – in the seat of the emotions. Cravings, instincts,desires that harm humanity, a strange hidden reservoir to burst suddenly andinundate the whole being of the creature with anger, hate, or fear.‘These creatures of mine seemed strange and uncanny to you as soon as you beganto observe them, but to me, just after I make them, they seem to be indisputablehuman beings. It’s afterwards as I observe them that the persuasion fades. Firstone animal trait, then another, creeps to the surface and stares out at me…. ButI will conquer yet. Each time I dip a living creature into the bath of burningpain, I say: this time I will burn out all the animal, this time I will make arational creature of my own. After all, what is ten years? Man has been ahundred thousand in the making.’He thought darkly. ‘But I am drawing near the fastness. This puma of mine….’After a silence: ‘And they revert. As soon as my hand is taken from them thebeast begins to creep back, begins to assert itself again….’Another long silence.‘Then you take the things you make into those dens?’ said I.‘They go. I turn them out when I begin to feel the beast in them, and presentlythey wander there. They all dread this house and me. There is a kind of travestyof humanity over there. Montgomery knows about it, for he interferes in theiraffairs. He has trained one or two of them to our service. He’s ashamed of it,but I believe he half likes some of these beasts. It’s his business, not mine.They only sicken me with a sense of failure. I take no interest in them. I fancythey follow in the lines the Kanaka missionary marked out, and have a kind ofmockery of a rational life – poor beasts! There’s something they call the Law.Sing hymns about “all thine”. They build themselves their dens, gather fruit andpull herbs – marry even. But I can see through it all, see into their verysouls, and see there nothing but the souls of beasts, beasts that perish –anger, and the lusts to live and gratify themselves…. Yet they’re odd. Complex,like everything else alive. There is a kind of upward striving in them, partvanity, part waste sexual emotion, part waste curiosity. It only mocks me…. Ihave some hope of that puma; I have worked hard at her head and brain….‘And now,’ said he, standing up after a long gap of silence, during which we hadeach pursued our own thoughts; ‘what do you think? Are you in fear of me still?’I looked at him, and saw but a white-faced, white-haired man, with calm eyes.Save for his serenity, the touch almost of beauty that resulted from his settranquillity and from his magnificent build, he might have passed muster among ahundred other comfortable old gentlemen. Then I shivered. By way of answer tohis second question, I handed him a revolver with either hand.‘Keep them,’ he said, and snatched at a yawn. He stood up, stared at me for amoment and smiled. ‘You have had two eventful days,’ said he. ‘I should advisesome sleep. I’m glad it’s all clear. Good night.’He thought me over for a moment, then went out by the inner door. I immediatelyturned the key in the outer one.I sat down again, sat for a time in a kind of stagnant mood, so wearyemotionally, mentally, and physically, that I could not think beyond the pointat which he had left me. The black window stared at me like an eye. At last withan effort I put out the lamp, and got into the hammock. Very soon I was asleep."},{"pageContent":"XVCONCERNING THE BEAST FOLKI woke early. Moreau’s explanation stood before my mind, clear and definite,from the moment of my awakening. I got out of the hammock and went to the doorto assure myself that the key was turned. Then I tried the window bar, and foundit firmly fixed. That these man-like creatures were in truth only bestialmonsters, mere grotesque travesties of men, filled me with a vague uncertaintyof their possibilities that was far worse than any definite fear. A tapping cameat the door, and I heard the glutinous accents of M’ling speaking. I pocketedone of the revolvers (keeping one hand upon it) and opened to him.‘Good morning, sair,’ he said, bringing in addition to the customary herbbreakfast, an ill-cooked rabbit. Montgomery followed him. His roving eye caughtthe position of my arm, and he smiled askew.The puma was resting to heal that day; but Moreau, who was singularly solitaryin his habits, did not join us. I talked with Montgomery to clear my ideas ofthe way in which the Beast Folk lived. In particular, I was urgent to know howthese inhuman monsters were kept from falling upon Moreau and Montgomery, andfrom rending one another.He explained to me that the comparative safety of Moreau and himself was due tothe limited mental scope of these monsters. In spite of their increasedintelligence, and the tendency of their animal instincts to reawaken, they hadcertain Fixed Ideas implanted by Moreau in their minds which absolutely boundedtheir imaginations. They were really hypnotized, had been told certain thingswere impossible, and certain things were not to be done, and these prohibitionswere woven into the texture of their minds beyond any possibility ofdisobedience or dispute. Certain matters, however, in which old instinct was atwar with Moreau’s convenience, were in a less stable condition. A series ofprohibitions called the Law – I had already heard them recited – battled intheir minds with the deep-seated, ever-rebellious cravings of their animalnatures. This Law they were perpetually repeating, I found, and – perpetuallybreaking. Both Montgomery and Moreau displayed particular solicitude to keepthem ignorant of the taste of blood. They feared the inevitable suggestions ofthat flavour.Montgomery told me that the Law, especially among the feline Beast People,became oddly weakened about nightfall; that then the animal was at itsstrongest; a spirit of adventure sprang up in them at the dusk, they would darethings they never seemed to dream about by day. To that I owed my stalking bythe Leopard Man on the night of my arrival. But during these earlier days of mystay they broke the Law only furtively, and after dark; in the daylight therewas a general atmosphere of respect for its multifarious prohibitions.And here perhaps I may give a few general facts about the island and the BeastPeople. The island, which was of irregular outline and lay low upon the widesea, had a total area, I suppose, of seven or eight square miles.*[page81.html#ch15fn01] It was volcanic in origin, and was now fringed on threesides by coral reefs. Some fumaroles1 [note.html#ich15en01] to the northward,and a hot spring, were the only vestiges of the forces that had long sinceoriginated it. Now and then a faint quiver of earthquake would be sensible, andsometimes the ascent of the spire of smoke would be rendered tumultuous by gustsof steam. But that was all. The population of the island, Montgomery informedme, now numbered rather more than sixty of these strange creations of Moreau’sart, not counting the smaller monstrosities which lived in the undergrowth andwere without human form. Altogether he had made nearly a hundred and twenty, butmany had died; and others, like the writhing Footless Thing of which he had toldme, had come by violent ends. In answer to my question, Montgomery said thatthey actually bore offspring, but that these generally died. There was noevidence of the inheritance of the acquired human characteristics.2[note.html#ich15en02] When they lived, Moreau took them and stamped the humanform upon them. The females were less numerous than the males, and liable tomuch furtive persecution in spite of the monogamy the Law enjoined.It would be impossible for me to describe these Beast People in detail – my eyehas had no training in details – and unhappily I cannot sketch. Most strikingperhaps in their general appearance was the disproportion between the legs ofthese creatures and the length of their bodies; and yet – so relative is ouridea of grace – my eye became habituated to their forms, and at last I even fellin with their persuasion that my own long thighs were ungainly. Another pointwas the forward carriage of the head, and the clumsy and inhuman curvature ofthe spine. Even the Ape Man lacked that inward sinuous curve of the back thatmakes the human figure so graceful. Most had their shoulders hunched clumsily,and their short forearms hung weakly at their sides. Few of them wereconspicuously hairy – at least, until the end of my time upon the island.The next most obvious deformity was in their faces, almost all of which wereprognathous,3 [note.html#ich15en03] malformed about the ears, with large andprotuberant noses, very furry or very bristly hair, and often strangely colouredor strangely placed eyes. None could smile, though the Ape Man had a mirthlessgrin. Beyond these general characters their heads had little in common; eachpreserved the quality of its particular species: the human mark distorted butdid not hide the leopard, the ox, or the sow, or other animal or animals fromwhich the creature had been moulded. The voices too, varied exceedingly. Thehands were always malformed; and though some surprised me by their unexpectedhumanity, almost all were deficient in the number of the digits, clumsy aboutthe fingernails, and lacking any tactile sensibility.The two most formidable animal-men were the Leopard Man and a creature made ofhyena and swine. Larger than these were the three bull creatures who pulled inthe boat. Then came the Silvery Hairy Man, who was also the Sayer of the Law,M’ling, and a satyr-like creature of ape and goat. There were three Swine Menand a Swine Woman, a Horse-Rhinoceros creature, and several other females whosesources I did not ascertain. There were several Wolf creatures, a Bear-Bull, anda Saint Bernard Dog Man. I have already described the Ape Man, and there was aparticularly hateful (and evil-smelling) old woman made of Vixen and Bear, whomI hated from the beginning. She was said to be a passionate votary of the Law.Smaller creatures were certain dappled youths and my little sloth creature.At first I had a shivering horror of the brutes, felt all too keenly that theywere still brutes, but insensibly I became a little habituated to the idea ofthem, and, moreover, I was affected by Montgomery’s attitude towards them. Hehad been with them so long that he had come to regard them as almost normalhuman beings – his London days seemed a glorious impossible past to him. Onlyonce in a year or so did he go to Arica to deal with Moreau’s agent, a trader inanimals there. He hardly met the finest type of mankind in that seafaringvillage of Spanish mongrels. The men aboard ship, he told me, seemed at firstjust as strange to him as the Beast Men seemed to me -unnaturally long in theleg, flat in the face, prominent in the forehead, suspicious, dangerous, andcold-hearted. In fact, he did not like men. His heart had warmed to me, hethought, because he had saved my life.I fancied even then that he had a sneaking kindness for some of thesemetamorphosed brutes, a vicious sympathy with some of their ways, but that heattempted to veil from me at first.M’ling, the black-faced man, his attendant, the first of the Beast Folk I hadencountered, did not live with the others across the island, but in a smallkennel at the back of the enclosure. The creature was scarcely so intelligent asthe Ape Man, but far more docile, and the most human-looking of all the BeastFolk, and Montgomery had trained it to prepare food and indeed to discharge allthe trivial domestic offices that were required. It was a complex trophy ofMoreau’s horrible skill, a bear tainted with dog and ox, and one of the mostelaborately made of all the creatures. It treated Montgomery with a strangetenderness and devotion; sometimes he would notice it, pat it, call ithalf-mocking, half-jocular names, and so make it caper with extraordinarydelight; sometimes he would ill-treat it, especially after he had been at thewhisky, kicking it, beating it, pelting it with stones or lighted fusees.4[note.html#ich15en04] But whether he treated it well or ill, it loved nothing somuch as to be near him.I say I became habituated to the Beast People, so that a thousand things thathad seemed unnatural and repulsive speedily became natural and ordinary to me. Isuppose everything in existence takes its colour from the average hue of oursurroundings: Montgomery and Moreau were too peculiar and individual to keep mygeneral impressions of humanity well defined. I would see one of the bovinecreatures who worked the launch treading heavily through the undergrowth, andfind myself trying hard to recall how he differed from some really human yokeltrudging home from his mechanical labours; or I would meet the Fox-Bear Woman’svulpine shifty face, strangely human in its speculative cunning, and evenimagine I had met it before in some city byway.Yet every now and then the beast would flash out upon me beyond doubt or denial.An ugly-looking man, a hunchbacked human savage to all appearance, squatting inthe aperture of one of the dens, would stretch his arms and yawn, showing withstartling suddenness scissor-edged incisors and sabre-like canines, keen andbrilliant as knives. Or in some narrow pathway, glancing with a transitorydaring into the eyes of some lithe white-swathed female figure, I would suddenlysee with a spasmodic revulsion that they had slit-like pupils, or, glancingdown, note the curving nail with which she held her shapeless wrap about her. Itis a curious thing, by the by, for which I am quite unable to account, thatthese weird creatures – the females I mean – had in the earlier days of my stayan instinctive sense of their own repulsive clumsiness, and displayed inconsequence a more than human regard for the decencies and decorum of externalcostume."},{"pageContent":"XVIHOW THE BEAST FOLK TASTED BLOODBut my inexperience as a writer betrays me, and I wander from the thread of mystory. After I had breakfasted with Montgomery he took me across the island tosee the fumarole and the source of the hot spring, into whose scalding waters Ihad blundered on the previous day. Both of us carried whips and loadedrevolvers. While going through a leafy jungle on our road thither we heard arabbit squealing. We stopped and listened, but we heard no more; and presentlywe went on our way and the incident dropped out of our minds. Montgomery calledmy attention to certain little pink animals with long hind legs, that wentleaping through the undergrowth. He told me they were creatures made of theoffspring of the Beast People, that Moreau had invented. He had fancied theymight serve for meat, but a rabbit-like habit of devouring their young haddefeated this intention. I had already encountered some of these creatures, onceduring my moonlight flight from the Leopard Man, and once during my pursuit byMoreau on the previous day. By chance, one hopping to avoid us leapt into thehole caused by the uprooting of a wind-blown tree. Before it could extricateitself we managed to catch it. It spat like a cat, scratched and kickedvigorously with its hind legs and made an attempt to bite, but its teeth weretoo feeble to inflict more than a painless pinch. It seemed to me rather apretty little creature, and as Montgomery stated that it never destroyed theturf by burrowing, and was very cleanly in its habits, I should imagine it mightprove a convenient substitute for the common rabbit in gentlemen’s parks.We also saw on our way the trunk of a tree barked in long strips and splintereddeeply. Montgomery called my attention to this. ‘Not to claw Bark of Trees; thatis the Law,’ he said. ‘Much some of them care for it!’ It was after this, Ithink, that we met the Satyr and the Ape Man. The Satyr was a gleam of classicalmemory on the part of Moreau, his face ovine in expression – like the coarserHebrew type – his voice a harsh bleat, his nether extremities Satanic. He wasgnawing the husk of a pod-like fruit as he passed us. Both of them salutedMontgomery.‘Hail,’ said they, ‘to the Other with the whip!’‘There’s a third with a whip now,’ said Montgomery. ‘So you’d better mind!’‘Was he not made?’ said the Ape Man. ‘He said – he said he was made.’The Satyr Man looked curiously at me. ‘The Third with the whip, he that walksweeping into the sea, has a thin white face.’‘He has a thin long whip,’ said Montgomery.‘Yesterday he bled and wept,’ said the Satyr. ‘You never bleed nor weep. TheMaster does not bleed nor weep.’‘Ollendorffian beggar!’1 [note.html#ich16en01] said Montgomery. ‘You’ll bleedand weep if you don’t look out.’‘He has five fingers; he is a five-man like me,’ said the Ape Man.‘Come along, Prendick,’ said Montgomery, taking my arm, and I went on with him.The Satyr and the Ape Man stood watching us and making other remarks to eachother.‘He says nothing,’ said the Satyr. ‘Men have voices.’‘Yesterday he asked me of things to eat,’ said the Ape Man. ‘He did not know.’Then they spoke inaudible things, and I heard the Satyr laughing.It was on our way back that we came upon the dead rabbit. The red body of thewretched little beast was rent to pieces, many of the ribs stripped white, andthe backbone indisputably gnawed.At that Montgomery stopped. ‘Good God!’ said he, stooping down and picking upsome of the crushed vertebrae to examine them more closely. ‘Good God!’ herepeated, ‘what can this mean?’‘Some carnivore of yours has remembered its old habits,’ I said, after a pause.‘This backbone has been bitten through.’He stood staring, with his face white and his lip pulled askew. ‘I don’t likethis,’ he said slowly.‘I saw something of the same kind,’ said I, ‘the first day I came here.’‘The devil you did! What was it?’‘A rabbit with its head twisted off.’‘The day you came here?’‘The day I came here. In the undergrowth, at the back of the enclosure, when Icame out in the evening. The head was completely wrung off.’He gave a low whistle.‘And what is more, I have an idea which of your brutes did the thing. It’s onlya suspicion, you know. Before I came on the rabbit I saw one of your monstersdrinking in the stream.’‘Sucking his drink?’‘Yes.’‘Not to suck your Drink; that is the Law. Much the brutes care for the Law, eh –when Moreau’s not about?’‘It was the brute who chased me.’‘Of course,’ said Montgomery; ‘it’s just the way with carnivores. After a killthey drink. It’s the taste of blood, you know.‘What was the brute like?’ he asked. ‘Would you know him again?’ He glancedabout us, standing astride over the mess of dead rabbit, his eyes roving amongthe shadows and screens of greenery, the lurking-places and ambuscades of theforest, that bounded us in. ‘The taste of blood,’ he said again.He took out his revolver, examined the cartridges in it, and replaced it. Thenhe began to pull at his dropping lip.‘I think I should know the brute again. I stunned him. He ought to have ahandsome bruise on the forehead of him.’‘But then we have to prove he killed the rabbit,’ said Montgomery. ‘I wish I’dnever brought the things here.’I should have gone on, but he stayed there thinking over the mangled rabbit in apuzzle-headed way. As it was, I went to such a distance that the rabbit’sremains were hidden.‘Come on!’ I said.Presently he woke up and came towards me. ‘You see,’ he said, almost in awhisper, ‘they are all supposed to have a fixed idea against eating anythingthat runs on land. If some brute has by accident tasted blood….’We went on some way in silence. ‘I wonder what can have happened,’ he said tohimself. Then, after a pause, again: ‘I did a foolish thing the other day. Thatservant of mine… I showed him how to skin and cook a rabbit. It’s odd…. I sawhim licking his hands…. It never occurred to me.’Then: ‘We must put a stop to this. I must tell Moreau.’He could think of nothing else on our homeward journey.Moreau took the matter even more seriously than Montgomery, and I need scarcelysay I was infected by their evident consternation. ‘We must make an example,’said Moreau. ‘I’ve no doubt in my own mind that the Leopard Man was the sinner.But how can we prove it? I wish, Montgomery, you had kept your taste for meat inhand, and gone without these exciting novelties. We may find ourselves in a messyet through it.’‘I was a silly ass,’ said Montgomery. ‘But the thing’s done now. And you said Imight have them, you know.’‘We must see to the thing at once,’ said Moreau. ‘I suppose, if anything shouldturn up, M’ling can take care of himself?’‘I’m not so sure of M’ling,’ said Montgomery. ‘I think I ought to know him.’In the afternoon, Moreau, Montgomery, myself, and M’ling went across the islandto the huts in the ravine. We three were armed. M’ling carried the littlehatchet he used in chopping firewood, and some coils of wire. Moreau had a hugecowherd’s horn slung over his shoulder. ‘You will see a gathering of the BeastPeople,’ said Montgomery. ‘It’s a pretty sight.’ Moreau said not a word on theway, but his heavy white-fringed face was grim.We crossed the ravine, down which smoked the stream of hot water, and followedthe winding pathway through the cane-brakes until we reached a wide area coveredover with a thick powdery yellow substance which I believe was sulphur. Abovethe shoulder of a weedy bank the sea glittered. We came to a kind of shallownatural amphitheatre, and here the four of us halted. Then Moreau sounded thehorn and broke the sleeping stillness of the tropical afternoon. He must havehad strong lungs. The hooting note rose and rose amidst its echoes to at last anear-penetrating intensity. ‘Ah!’ said Moreau, letting the curved instrument fallto his side again.Immediately there was a crashing through the yellow canes, and a sound of voicesfrom the dense green jungle that marked the morass through which I had run onthe previous day. Then at three or four points on the edge of the sulphurousarea appeared the grotesque forms of the Beast People, hurrying towards us. Icould not help a creeping horror as I perceived first one and then another trotout from the trees or reeds, and come shambling along over the hot dust. ButMoreau and Montgomery stood calmly enough, and, perforce, I stuck beside them.First to arrive was the Satyr, strangely unreal for all that he cast a shadow,and tossed the dust with his hoofs; after him from the brake came a monstrouslout, a thing of horse and rhinoceros, chewing a straw as it came; and thenappeared the Swine Woman and two Wolf Women; then the Fox-Bear Witch with herred eyes in her peaked red face, and then others – all hurrying eagerly. As theycame forward they began to cringe towards Moreau and chant, quite regardless ofone another, fragments of the latter half of the litany of the Law: ‘His is theHand that wounds, His is the Hand that heals,’ and so forth.As soon as they had approached within a distance of perhaps thirty yards theyhalted, and bowing on knees and elbows, began flinging the white dust upon theirheads. Imagine the scene if you can. We three blue-clad men, with our misshapenblack-faced attendant, standing in a wide expanse of sunlit yellow dust underthe blazing blue sky, and surrounded by this circle of crouching andgesticulating monstrosities, some almost human save in their subtle expressionand gestures, some like cripples, some so strangely distorted as to resemblenothing but the denizens of our wildest dreams. And beyond were the reedy linesof a cane-brake in one direction and a dense tangle of palm-trees on the other,separating us from the ravine with the huts, and to the north the hazy horizonof the Pacific Ocean.‘Sixty-two, sixty-three,’ counted Moreau. ‘There are four more.’‘I do not see the Leopard Man,’ said I.Presently Moreau sounded the great horn again, and at the sound of it all theBeast People writhed and grovelled in the dust. Then, slinking out of thecane-brake, stooping near the ground, and trying to join the dust-throwingcircle behind Moreau’s back, came the Leopard Man. And I saw that his foreheadwas bruised. The last of the Beast People to arrive was the little Ape Man. Theearlier animals, hot and weary with their grovelling, shot vicious glances athim.‘Cease,’ said Moreau, in his firm loud voice, and the Beast People sat back upontheir hams and rested from their worshipping.‘Where is the Sayer of the Law?’ said Moreau, and the hairy grey monster bowedhis face in the dust.‘Say the words,’ said Moreau, and forthwith all in the kneeling assembly,swaying from side to side and dashing up the sulphur with their hands, first theright hand and a puff of dust, and then the left, began once more to chant theirstrange litany.When they reached ‘Not to eat Flesh or Fish; that is the Law,’ Moreau held uphis lank white hand. ‘Stop!’ he cried, and there fell absolute silence upon themall.I think they all knew and dreaded what was coming. I looked round at theirstrange faces. When I saw their wincing attitudes and the furtive dread in theirbright eyes, I wondered that I had ever believed them to be men.‘That Law has been broken,’ said Moreau.‘None escape,’ from the faceless creature with the Silvery Hair. ‘None escape,’repeated the kneeling circle of Beast People.‘Who is he?’ cried Moreau, and looked round at their faces, cracking his whip. Ifancied the Hyena-Swine looked dejected, so, too, did the Leopard Man. Moreaustopped, facing this creature, who cringed towards him with the memory and dreadof infinite torment. ‘Who is he?’ repeated Moreau, in a voice of thunder.‘Evil is he who breaks the Law,’ chanted the Sayer of the Law.Moreau looked into the eyes of the Leopard Man, and seemed to be dragging thevery soul out of the creature.‘Who breaks the Law –’ said Moreau, taking his eyes off his victim and turningtowards us. It seemed to me there was a touch of exultation in his voice.‘–goes back to the House of Pain,’ they all clamoured; ‘goes back to the Houseof Pain, O Master!’‘Back to the House of Pain – back to the House of Pain,’ gabbled the Ape Man, asthough the idea was sweet to him.‘Do you hear?’ said Moreau, turning back to the criminal, ‘my friend…. Hullo!’For the Leopard Man, released from Moreau’s eye, had risen straight from hisknees, and now, with eyes aflame and his huge feline tusks flashing out fromunder his curling lips, leapt towards his tormentor. I am convinced that onlythe madness of unendurable fear could have prompted this attack. The wholecircle of threescore monsters seemed to rise about us. I drew my revolver. Thetwo figures collided. I saw Moreau reeling back from the Leopard Man’s blow.There was wild yelling and howling all about us. Every one was moving rapidly.For a moment I thought it was a general revolt.The furious face of the Leopard Man flashed by mine, with M’ling close inpursuit. I saw the yellow eyes of the Hyena-Swine blazing with excitement, hisattitude as if he were half resolved to attack me. The Satyr, too, glared at meover the Hyena-Swine’s hunched shoulders. I heard the crack of Moreau’s pistol,and saw the pink flash dart across the tumult. The whole crowd seemed to swinground in the direction of the glint of fire, and I, too, was swung round by themagnetism of the movement. In another second I was running, one of a tumultuousshouting crowd, in pursuit of the escaping Leopard Man.That is all I can tell definitely. I saw the Leopard Man strike Moreau, and theneverything spun about me until I was running headlong.M’ling was ahead, close in pursuit of the fugitive. Behind, their tonguesalready lolling out, ran the Wolf-Women in great leaping strides. The Swine-Folkfollowed, squealing with excitement, and the two Bull Men in their swathings ofwhite. Then came Moreau in a cluster of the Beast People, his wide-brimmed strawhat blown off, his revolver in hand, and his lank white hair streaming out. TheHyena-Swine ran beside me, keeping pace with me, and glancing furtively at meout of his feline eyes, and the others came pattering and shouting behind us.The Leopard Man went bursting his way through the long canes, which sprang backas he passed and rattled in M’ling’s face. We others in the rear found atrampled path for us when we reached the brake. The chase lay through the brakefor perhaps a quarter of a mile, and then plunged into a dense thicket thatretarded our movements exceedingly, though we went through it in a crowdtogether – fronds flicking into our faces, ropy creepers catching us under thechin or gripping our ankles, thorny plants hooking into and tearing cloth andflesh together.‘He has gone on all-fours through this,’ panted Moreau, now just ahead of me.‘None escape,’ said the Wolf-Bear, laughing into my face with the exultation ofhunting.We burst out again among rocks, and saw the quarry ahead, running lightly onall-fours, and snarling at us over his shoulder. At that the Wolf-Folk howledwith delight. The thing was still clothed, and, at a distance, its face stillseemed human, but the carriage of its four limbs was feline, and the furtivedroop of its shoulder was distinctly that of a hunted animal. It leaped oversome thorny yellow-flowering bushes and was hidden. M’ling was halfway acrossthe space.Most of us now had lost the first speed of the chase, and had fallen into alonger and steadier stride. I saw, as we traversed the open, that the pursuitwas now spreading from a column into a line. The Hyena-Swine still ran close tome, watching me as it ran, every now and then puckering its muzzle with asnarling laugh.At the edge of the rocks the Leopard Man, realizing he was making for theprojecting cape upon which he had stalked me on the night of my arrival, haddoubled in the undergrowth. But Montgomery had seen the manoeuvre, and turnedhim again.So, panting, tumbling against rocks, torn by brambles, impeded by ferns andreeds, I helped to pursue the Leopard Man who had broken the Law, and theHyena-Swine ran, laughing savagely, by my side. I staggered on, my head reeling,and my heart beating against my ribs, tired almost to death, and yet not daringto lose sight of the chase, lest I should be left alone with this horriblecompanion. I staggered on in spite of infinite fatigue and the dense heat of thetropical afternoon.And at last the fury of the hunt slackened. We had pinned the wretched bruteinto a corner of the island. Moreau, whip in hand, marshalled us all into anirregular line, and we advanced now slowly, shouting to one another as weadvanced, and tightening the cordon about our victim. He lurked, noiseless andinvisible, in the bushes through which I had run from him during that midnightpursuit.‘Steady!’ cried Moreau; ‘steady!’ as the ends of the line crept round the tangleof undergrowth, and hemmed the brute in.‘’Ware a rush!’ came the voice of Montgomery from beyond the thicket.I was on the slope above the bushes. Montgomery and Moreau beat along the beachbeneath. Slowly we pushed in among the fretted network of branches and leaves.The quarry was silent.‘Back to the House of Pain, the House of Pain, the House of Pain!’ yelped thevoice of the Ape Man, some twenty yards to the right.When I heard that I forgave the poor wretch all the fear he had inspired in me.I heard the twigs snap and the boughs swish aside before the heavy tread of theHorse-Rhinoceros upon my right. Then suddenly, through a polygon of green, inthe half darkness under the luxuriant growth, I saw the creature we werehunting. I halted. He was crouched together into the smallest possible compass,his luminous green eyes turned over his shoulder regarding me.It may seem a strange contradiction in me – I cannot explain the fact – but now,seeing the creature there in a perfectly animal attitude, with the lightgleaming in its eyes, and its imperfectly human face distorted with terror, Irealized again the fact of its humanity. In another moment others of itspursuers would see it, and it would be overpowered and captured, to experienceonce more the horrible tortures of the enclosure. Abruptly I slipped out myrevolver, aimed between its terror-struck eyes and fired.As I did so the Hyena-Swine saw the thing, and flung itself upon it with aneager cry, thrusting thirsty teeth into its neck. All about me the green massesof the thicket were swaying and cracking as the Beast People came rushingtogether. One face and then another appeared.‘Don’t kill it, Prendick,’ cried Moreau. ‘Don’t kill it!’ And I saw him stoopingas he pushed through the under fronds of the big ferns.In another moment he had beaten off the Hyena-Swine with the handle of his whip,and he and Montgomery were keeping away the excited carnivorous Beast People,and particularly M’ling, from the still quivering body. The Hairy Grey Thingcame sniffing at the corpse under my arm. The other animals, in their animalardour, jostled me to get a nearer view.‘Confound you, Prendick!’ said Moreau. ‘I wanted him.’‘I’m sorry,’ said I, though I was not. ‘It was the impulse of the moment.’ Ifelt sick with exertion and excitement. Turning, I pushed my way out of thecrowding Beast People and went on alone up the slope towards the higher part ofthe headland. Under the shouted instructions of Moreau, I heard the threewhite-swathed Bull Men begin dragging the victim down towards the water.It was easy now for me to be alone. The Beast People manifested a quite humancuriosity about the dead body, and followed it in a thick knot, sniffing andgrowling at it, as the Bull Men dragged it down the beach. I went to theheadland, and watched the Bull Men, black against the evening sky, as theycarried the weighted dead body out to sea, and, like a wave across my mind, camethe realization of the unspeakable aimlessness of things upon the island. Uponthe beach, among the rocks beneath me, were the Ape Man, the Hyena-Swine, andseveral other of the Beast People, standing about Montgomery and Moreau. Theywere all intensely excited, and all overflowing with noisy expressions of theirloyalty to the Law. Yet I felt an absolute assurance in my own mind that theHyena-Swine was implicated in the rabbit-killing. A strange persuasion came uponme that, save for the grossness of the line, the grotesqueness of the forms, Ihad here before me the whole balance of human life in miniature, the wholeinterplay of instinct, reason, and fate in its simplest form. The Leopard Manhad happened to go under. That was all the difference.Poor brutes! I began to see the viler aspect of Moreau’s cruelty. I had notthought before of the pain and trouble that came to these poor victims afterthey had passed from Moreau’s hands. I had shivered only at the days of actualtorment in the enclosure. But now that seemed to be the lesser part. Before theyhad been beasts, their instincts fitly adapted to their surroundings, and happyas living things may be. Now they stumbled in the shackles of humanity, lived ina fear that never died, fretted by a law they could not understand; theirmock-human existence began in an agony, was one long internal struggle,2[note.html#ich16en02] one long dread of Moreau – and for what? It was thewantonness that stirred me.Had Moreau had any intelligible object I could have sympathized at least alittle with him. I am not so squeamish about pain as that. I could have forgivenhim a little even had his motive been hate. But he was so irresponsible, soutterly careless. His curiosity, his mad, aimless investigations, drove him on,and the things were thrown out to live a year or so, to struggle and blunder andsuffer; at last to the painfully. They were wretched in themselves, the oldanimal hate moved them to trouble one another, the Law held them back from abrief hot struggle and a decisive end to their natural animosities.In those days my fear of the Beast People went the way of my personal fear ofMoreau. I fell indeed into the morbid state, deep and enduring, alien to fear,which has left permanent scars upon my mind. I must confess I lost faith in thesanity of the world when I saw it suffering the painful disorder of this island.A blind fate, a vast pitiless mechanism, seemed to cut and shape the fabric ofexistence, and I, Moreau by his passion for research, Montgomery by his passionfor drink, the Beast People, with their instincts and mental restrictions, weretorn and crushed, ruthlessly, inevitably, amid the infinite complexity of itsincessant wheels. But this condition did not come all at once…. I think indeedthat I anticipate a little in speaking of it now."},{"pageContent":"XVIIA CATASTROPHEScarcely six weeks passed before I had lost every feeling but dislike andabhorrence for these infamous experiments of Moreau’s. My one idea was to getaway from these horrible caricatures of my Maker’s image, back to the sweet andwholesome intercourse of men. My fellow-creatures, from whom I was thusseparated, began to assume idyllic virtue and beauty in my memory. My firstfriendship with Montgomery did not increase. His long separation from humanity,his secret drunkenness, his evident sympathy with the Beast People, tainted himto me. Several times I let him go alone among them. I avoided intercourse withthem in every possible way. I spent an increasing proportion of my time upon thebeach, looking for some liberating sail that never appeared, until one day therefell upon us an appalling disaster, that put an altogether different aspect uponmy strange surroundings.It was about seven or eight weeks after my landing – rather more, I think,though I had not troubled to keep account of the time – when this catastropheoccurred. It happened in the early morning – I should think about six. I hadrisen and breakfasted early, having been aroused by the noise of three Beast Mencarrying wood into the enclosure.After breakfast I went to the open gateway of the enclosure and stood theresmoking a cigarette and enjoying the freshness of the early morning. Moreaupresently came round the corner of the enclosure and greeted me. He passed byme, and I heard him behind me unlock and enter his laboratory. So indurated wasI at that time to the abomination of the place, that I heard without a touch ofemotion the puma victim begin another day of torture. It met its persecutor witha shriek almost exactly like that of an angry virago.Then something happened. I do not know what it was exactly to this day. I hearda sharp cry behind me, a fall, and turning, saw an awful face rushing upon me,not human, not animal, but hellish, brown, seamed with red branching scars, reddrops starting out upon it, and the lidless eyes ablaze. I flung up my arm todefend myself from the blow that flung me headlong with a broken forearm, andthe great monster, swathed in lint and with red-stained bandages flutteringabout it, leaped over me and passed. I rolled over and over down the beach,tried to sit up, and collapsed upon my broken arm. Then Moreau appeared, hismassive white face all the more terrible for the blood that trickled from hisforehead. He carried a revolver in one hand. He scarcely glanced at me, butrushed off at once in pursuit of the puma.I tried the other arm and sat up. The muffled figure in front ran in greatstriding leaps along the beach, and Moreau followed her. She turned her head andsaw him, then, doubling abruptly, made for the bushes. She gained upon him atevery stride. I saw her plunge into them, and Moreau, running slantingly tointercept her, fired and missed as she disappeared. Then he, too, vanished inthe green confusion.I stared after them, and then the pain in my arm flamed up, and with a groan Istaggered to my feet. Montgomery appeared in the doorway dressed, and with hisrevolver in his hand.‘Great God, Prendick!’ he said, not noticing that I was hurt. ‘That brute’sloose! Tore the fetter out of the wall. Have you seen them?’ Then sharply,seeing I gripped my arm: ‘What’s the matter?’‘I was standing in the doorway,’ said I.He came forward and took my arm. ‘Blood on the sleeve,’ said he, and rolled backthe flannel. He pocketed the weapon, felt my arm about painfully, and led meinside. ‘Your arm is broken,’ he said; and then: ‘Tell me exactly how ithappened – what happened.’I told him what I had seen, told him in broken sentences, with gasps of painbetween them, and very dexterously and swiftly he bound my arm meanwhile. Heslung it from my shoulder, stood back, and looked at me. ‘You’ll do,’ he said.‘And now?’ He thought. Then he went out and locked the gates of the enclosure.He was absent some time.I was chiefly concerned about my arm. The incident seemed merely one more ofmany horrible things. I sat down in the deck chair and, I must admit, sworeheartily at the island. The first dull feeling of injury in my arm had alreadygiven way to a burning pain when Montgomery reappeared.His face was rather pale, and he showed more of his lower gums than ever. ‘I canneither see nor hear anything of him,’ he said. ‘I’ve been thinking he may wantmy help.’ He stared at me with his expressionless eyes. ‘That was a strongbrute,’ he said. ‘It simply wrenched its fetter out of the wall.’He went to the window, then to the door, and there turned to me. ‘I shall goafter him,’ he said. ‘There’s another revolver I can leave with you. It’s justpossible you may need it.’He obtained the weapon and put it ready to my hand on the table, then went out,leaving a restless contagion in the air. I did not sit long after he left. Itook the revolver in hand and went to the doorway.The morning was as still as death. Not a whisper of wind stirred, the sea waslike polished glass, the sky empty, the beach desolate. This stillness of thingsoppressed me.I tried to whistle, and the tune died away. I swore again – the second time thatmorning. Then I went to the corner of the enclosure and stared inland at thegreen bush that had swallowed up Moreau and Montgomery. When would they return?And how?Then far away up the beach a little grey Beast Man appeared, ran down to thewater’s edge, and began splashing about. I strolled back to the doorway, then tothe corner again, and so began pacing to and fro like a sentinel upon duty. OnceI was arrested by the distant voice of Montgomery bawling, ‘Coo-ee… Mor-eau!’ Myarm became less painful, but very hot. I got feverish and thirsty. My shadowgrew shorter. I watched the distant figure until it went away again. WouldMoreau and Montgomery never return? Three seabirds began fighting for somestranded treasure.Then from far away behind the enclosure I heard a pistol-shot. A long silence,and then came another. Then a yelling cry nearer, and another dismal gap ofsilence. My imagination set to work to torment me. Then suddenly a shot closeby.I went to the corner, startled, and saw Montgomery, his face scarlet, his hairdisordered, and the knee of his trousers torn. His face expressed profoundconsternation. Behind him slouched the Beast Man M’ling, and round M’ling’s jawswere some ominous brown stains.‘Has he come?’ he said.‘Moreau?’ said I. ‘No.’‘My God!’ The man was panting, almost sobbing for breath. ‘Go back in,’ he said,taking my arm. ‘They’re mad. They’re all rushing about mad. What can havehappened? I don’t know. I’ll tell you when my breath comes. Where’s somebrandy?’He limped before me into the room and sat down in the deck chair. M’ling flunghimself down just outside the doorway, and began panting like a dog. I gotMontgomery some brandy and water. He sat staring blankly in front of him,recovering his breath. After some minutes he began to tell me what had happened.He had followed their track for some way. It was plain enough at first onaccount of the crushed and broken bushes, white rags torn from the puma’sbandages, and occasional smears of blood on the leaves of the shrubs andundergrowth. He lost the track, however, on the stony ground beyond the streamwhere I had seen the Beast Man drinking, and went wandering aimlessly westwardshouting Moreau’s name. Then M’ling had come to him carrying a light hatchet.M’ling had seen nothing of the puma affair, had been felling wood and heard himcalling. They went on shouting together. Two Beast Men came crouching andpeering at them through the undergrowth, with gestures and a furtive carriagethat alarmed Montgomery by their strangeness. He hailed them, and they fledguiltily. He stopped shouting after that, and after wandering some time furtherin an undecided way, determined to visit the huts.He found the ravine deserted.Growing more alarmed every minute, he began to retrace his steps. Then it was heencountered the two Swine Men I had seen dancing on the night of my arrival;bloodstained they were about the mouth, and intensely excited. They camecrashing through the ferns, and stopped with fierce faces when they saw him. Hecracked his whip in some trepidation, and forthwith they rushed at him. Neverbefore had a Beast Man dared to do that. One he shot through the head, M’lingflung himself upon the other, and the two rolled grappling. M’ling got his bruteunder and with his teeth in its throat, and Montgomery shot that, too, as itstruggled in M’ling’s grip. He had some difficulty in inducing M’ling to come onwith him.Thence they had hurried back to me. On the way M’ling had suddenly rushed into athicket and driven out an undersized Ocelot Man, also bloodstained, and lamethrough a wound in the foot. This brute had run a little way and then turnedsavagely at bay, and Montgomery – with a certain wantonness, I thought – hadshot him.‘What does it all mean?’ said I.He shook his head and turned once more to the brandy."},{"pageContent":"XVIIITHE FINDING OF MOREAUWhen I saw Montgomery swallow a third dose of brandy I took it upon myself tointerfere. He was already more than half fuddled. I told him that some seriousthing must have happened to Moreau by this time, or he would have returned, andthat it behoved us to ascertain what that catastrophe was. Montgomery raisedsome feeble objections, and at last agreed. We had some food, and then all threeof us started.It is possibly due to the tension of my mind at the time, but even now thatstart into the hot stillness of the tropical afternoon is a singularly vividimpression. M’ling went first, his shoulders hunched, his strange black headmoving with quick starts as he peered first on this side of the way and then onthat. He was unarmed. His axe he had dropped when he encountered the Swine Men.Teeth were his weapons when it came to fighting. Montgomery followed withstumbling footsteps, his hands in his pockets, his face downcast; he was in astate of muddled sullenness with me on account of the brandy. My left arm was ina sling – it was lucky it was my left – and I carried my revolver in my right.We took a narrow path through the wild luxuriance of the island, goingnorthwestward. And presently M’ling stopped and became rigid with watchfulness.Montgomery almost staggered into him, and then stopped too. Then, listeningintently, we heard, coming through the trees, the sound of voices and footstepsapproaching us.‘He is dead,’ said a deep vibrating voice.‘He is not dead, he is not dead,’ jabbered another.‘We saw, we saw,’ said several voices.‘Hul-lo!’ suddenly shouted Montgomery. ‘Hul-lo there!’‘Confound you!’ said I, and gripped my pistol.There was a silence, then a crashing among the interlacing vegetation, firsthere, then there, and then half a dozen faces appeared, strange faces, lit by astrange light. M’ling made a growling noise in his throat. I recognized the ApeMan – I had, indeed, already identified his voice – and two of the white-swathedbrown-featured creatures I had seen in Montgomery’s boat. With them were the twodappled brutes, and that grey, horrible, crooked creature who said the Law, withgrey hair streaming down its cheeks, heavy grey eyebrows, and grey locks pouringoff from a central parting upon its sloping forehead, a heavy faceless thing,with strange red eyes, looking at us curiously from amidst the green.For a space no one spoke. Then Montgomery hiccoughed, ‘Who… said he was dead?’The Ape Man looked guiltily at the Hairy Grey Thing. ‘He is dead,’ said thismonster. ‘They saw.’There was nothing threatening about this detachment at any rate. They seemedawe-stricken and puzzled. ‘Where is he?’ said Montgomery.‘Beyond,’ and the grey creature pointed.‘Is there a Law now?’ asked the Ape Man. ‘Is it still to be this and that? Is hedead indeed?’ ‘Is there a Law?’ repeated the man in white. ‘Is there a Law, thouOther with the whip? He is dead,’ said the Hairy Grey Thing. And they all stoodwatching us.‘Prendick,’ said Montgomery, turning his dull eyes to me. ‘He’s dead –evidently.’I had been standing behind him during this colloquy. I began to see how thingslay with them. I suddenly stepped in front of him and lifted up my voice:‘Children of the Law,’ I said, ‘he is not dead.’M’ling turned his sharp eyes on me. ‘He has changed his shape – he has changedhis body,’ I went on. ‘For a time you will not see him. He is… there’ – Ipointed upward – ‘where he can watch you. You cannot see him. But he can seeyou. Fear the Law.’I looked at them squarely. They flinched. ‘He is great, he is good,’ said theApe Man, peering fearfully upward among the dense trees.‘And the other Thing?’ I demanded.‘The Thing that bled and ran screaming and sobbing – that is dead, too,’ saidthe Grey Thing, still regarding me.‘That’s well,’ grunted Montgomery.‘The Other with the whip,’ began the Grey Thing.‘Well?’ said I.‘Said he was dead.’But Montgomery was still sober enough to understand my motive in denyingMoreau’s death. ‘He is not dead,’ he said slowly. ‘Not dead at all. No more deadthan me.’‘Some,’ said I, ‘have broken the Law. They will die. Some have died. Show us nowwhere his old body lies. The body he cast away because he had no more need ofit.’‘It is this way, Man who walked in the Sea,’ said the Grey Thing.And with these six creatures guiding us, we went through the tumult of ferns andcreepers and tree stems towards the north-west. Then came a yelling, a crashingamong the branches, and a little pink homunculus rushed by us shrieking.Immediately after appeared a feral monster in headlong pursuit, blood-bedabbled,who was amongst us almost before he could stop his career. The Grey Thing leaptaside; M’ling with a snarl flew at it, and was struck aside; Montgomery firedand missed, bowed his head, threw up his arm, and turned to run. I fired, andthe thing still came on; fired again point-blank into its ugly face. I saw itsfeatures vanish in a flash. Its face was driven in. Yet it passed me, grippedMontgomery, and holding him, fell headlong beside him, and pulled him sprawlingupon itself – in its death-agony.I found myself alone with M’ling, the dead brute, and the prostrate man.Montgomery raised himself slowly and stared in a muddled way at the shatteredBeast Man beside him. It more than half sobered him. He scrambled to his feet.Then I saw the Grey Thing returning cautiously through the trees.‘See,’ said I, pointing to the dead brute. ‘Is the Law not alive? This came ofbreaking the Law.’He peered at the body. ‘He sends the Fire that kills,’ said he in his deepvoice, repeating part of the ritual.The others gathered round and stared for a space.At last we drew near the westward extremity of the island. We came upon thegnawed and mutilated body of the puma, its shoulder-bone smashed by a bullet,and perhaps twenty yards further found at last what we sought. He lay facedownward in a trampled space in a cane-brake. One hand was almost severed at thewrist, and his silvery hair was dabbled in blood. His head had been battered inby the fetters of the puma. The broken canes beneath him were smeared withblood. His revolver we could not find. Montgomery turned him over.Resting at intervals, and with the help of the seven Beast People – for he was aheavy man – we carried him back to the enclosure. The night was darkling. Twicewe heard unseen creatures howling and shrieking past our little band, and oncethe little pink sloth creature appeared and stared at us, and vanished again.But we were not attacked again. At the gates of the enclosure our company ofBeast People left us – M’ling going with the rest. We locked ourselves in, andthen took Moreau’s mangled body into the yard, and laid it upon a pile ofbrushwood.Then we went into the laboratory and put an end to all we found living there."},{"pageContent":"XIXMONTGOMERY’S ‘BANK HOLIDAY’When this was accomplished, and we had washed and eaten, Montgomery and I wentinto my little room and seriously discussed our position for the first time. Itwas then near midnight. He was almost sober, but greatly disturbed in his mind.He had been strangely under the influence of Moreau’s personality. I do notthink it had ever occured to him that Moreau could die. This disaster was thesudden collapse of the habits that had become part of his nature in the ten ormore monotonous years he had spent on the island. He talked vaguely, answered myquestions crookedly, wandered into general questions.‘This silly ass of a world,’ he said. ‘What a muddle it all is! I haven’t hadany life. I wonder when it’s going to begin. Sixteen years being bullied bynurses and schoolmasters at their own sweet will, five in London grinding hardat medicine – bad food, shabby lodgings, shabby clothes, shabby vice – a blunder– I didn’t know any better – and hustled off to this beastly island. Ten yearshere! What’s it all for, Prendick? Are we bubbles blown by a baby?’It was hard to deal with such ravings. ‘The thing we have to think of now,’ saidI, ‘is how to get away from this island.’‘What’s the good of getting away? I’m an outcast. Where am I to join on? It’sall very well for you, Prendick. Poor old Moreau! We can’t leave him here tohave his bones picked. As it is…. And besides, what will become of the decentpart of the Beast Folk?’‘Well,’ said I. ‘That will do tomorrow. I’ve been thinking we might make thebrushwood into a pyre and burn his body – and those other things…. Then whatwill happen with the Beast Folk?’‘I don’t know. I suppose those that were made of beasts of prey will make sillyasses of themselves sooner or later. We can’t massacre the lot, can we? Isuppose that’s what your humanity would suggest?… But they’ll change. They aresure to change.’He talked thus inconclusively until at last I felt my temper going. ‘Damnation!’he exclaimed, at some petulance of mine. ‘Can’t you see I’m in a worse hole thanyou are?’ And he got up and went for the brandy. ‘Drink,’ he said, returning.‘You logic-chopping, chalky-faced saint of an atheist, drink.’‘Not I,’ said I, and sat grimly watching his face under the yellow paraffinflare as he drank himself into a garrulous misery. I have a memory of infinitetedium. He wandered into a maudlin defence of the Beast People and of M’ling.M’ling, he said, was the only thing that had ever really cared for him. Andsuddenly an idea came to him.‘I’m damned!’ said he, staggering to his feet, and clutching the brandy bottle.By some flash of intuition I knew what it was he intended. ‘You don’t give drinkto that beast!’ I said, rising and facing him.‘Beast!’ said he. ‘You’re the beast. He takes his liquor like a Christian. Comeout of the way, Prendick.’‘For God’s sake,’ said I.‘Get… out of the way,’ he roared, and suddenly whipped out his revolver.‘Very well,’ said I, and stood aside, half minded to fall upon him as he put hishand upon the latch, but deterred by the thought of my useless arm. ‘You’ve madea beast of yourself. To the beasts you may go.’He flung the doorway open and stood, half facing me, between the yellowlamplight and the pallid glare of the moon; his eye-sockets were blotches ofblack under his stubbly eyebrows. ‘You’re a solemn prig, Prendick, a silly ass!You’re always fearing and fancying. We’re on the edge of things. I’m bound tocut my throat tomorrow. I’m going to have a damned good bank holiday tonight.’He turned and went out into the moonlight. ‘M’ling,’ he cried; ‘M’ling, oldfriend!’Three dim creatures in the silvery light came along the edge of the wan beach,one a white-wrapped creature, the other two blotches of blackness following it.They halted, staring. Then I saw M’ling’s hunched shoulders as he came round thecorner of the house.‘Drink,’ cried Montgomery; ‘drink, ye brutes! Drink, and be men. Dammy, I’m thecleverest. Moreau forgot this. This is the last touch. Drink, I tell you.’ Andwaving the bottle in his hand, he started off at a kind of quick trot to thewestward, M’ling ranging himself between him and the three dim creatures whofollowed.I went to the doorway. They were already indistinct in the mist of the moonlightbefore Montgomery halted. I saw him administer a dose of the raw brandy toM’ling, and saw the five figures melt into one vague patch. ‘Sing,’ I heardMontgomery shout; ‘sing all together, “Confound old Prendick,”… That’s right.Now, again: “Confound old Prendick.” ’The black group broke up into five separate figures and wound slowly away fromme along the band of shining beach. Each went howling at his own sweet will,yelping insult at me, or giving whatever other vent this new inspiration ofbrandy demanded.Presently I heard Montgomery’s remote voice shouting, ‘Right turn!’ and theypassed with their shouts and howls into the blackness of the landward trees.Slowly, very slowly, they receded into silence.The peaceful splendour of the night healed again. The moon was now past themeridian and travelling down the west. It was at its full, and very bright,riding through the empty blue sky. The shadow of the wall lay, a yard wide andof inky blackness, at my feet. The eastward sea was a featureless grey, dark andmysterious, and between the sea and the shadow the grey sands (of volcanic glassand crystals) flashed and shone like a beach of diamonds. Behind me the paraffinlamp flared hot and ruddy.Then I shut the door, locked it, and went into the enclosure where Moreau laybeside his latest victims – the staghounds and the llama, and some otherwretched brutes – his massive face, calm even after his terrible death, and withthe hard eyes open, staring at the dead white moon above. I sat down upon theedge of the sink, and, with my eyes upon that ghastly pile of silvery light andominous shadows, began to turn over plans in my mind.In the morning I would gather some provisions in the dinghy, and after settingfire to the pyre before me, push out into the desolation of the high sea oncemore. I felt that for Montgomery there was no help; that he was in truth halfakin to these Beast Folk, unfitted for human kindred. I do not know how long Isat there scheming. It must have been an hour or so. Then my planning wasinterrupted by the return of Montgomery to my neighbourhood. I heard a yellingfrom many throats, a tumult of exultant cries, passing down towards the beach,whooping and howling and excited shrieks, that seemed to come to a stop near thewater’s edge. The riot rose and fell; I heard heavy blows and the splinteringsmash of wood, but it did not trouble me then. A discordant chanting began.My thoughts went back to my means of escape. I got up, brought the lamp, andwent into a shed to look at some kegs I had seen there. Then I became interestedin the contents of some biscuit tins, and opened one. I saw something out of thetail of my eye, a red flicker, and turned sharply.Behind me lay the yard, vividly black and white in the moonlight, and the pileof wood and faggots on which Moreau and his mutilated victims lay, one onanother. They seemed to be gripping one another in one last revengeful grapple.His wounds gaped black as night, and the blood that had dripped lay in blackpatches upon the sand. Then I saw, without understanding, the cause of thephantom, a ruddy glow that came and danced and went upon the wall opposite. Imisinterpreted this, fancied it was a reflection of my flickering lamp, andturned again to the stores in the shed. I went on rummaging among them as wellas a one-armed man could, finding this convenient thing and that, and puttingthem aside for tomorrow’s launch. My movements were slow, and the time passedquickly. Presently the daylight crept upon me.The chanting died down, gave place to a clamour, then began again, and suddenlybroke into a tumult. I heard cries of ‘More, more!’ a sound like quarrelling,and a sudden wild shriek. The quality of the sounds changed so greatly that itarrested my attention. I went out into the yard and listened. Then, cutting likea knife across the confusion, came the crack of a revolver.I rushed at once through my room to the little doorway. As I did so I heard someof the packing-cases behind me go sliding down and smash together, with aclatter of glass on the floor of the shed. But I did not heed these. I flung thedoor open and looked out.Up the beach by the boathouse a bonfire was burning, raining up sparks into theindistinctness of the dawn. Around this struggled a mass of black figures. Iheard Montgomery call my name. I began to run at once towards this fire,revolver in hand. I saw the pink tongue of Montgomery’s pistol lick out once,close to the ground. He was down. I shouted with all my strength and fired intothe air.I heard someone cry ‘The Master!’ The knotted black struggle broke intoscattering units, the fire leapt and sank down. The crowd of Beast People fledin sudden panic before me up the beach. In my excitement I fired at theirretreating backs as they disappeared among the bushes. Then I turned to theblack heaps upon the ground.Montgomery lay on his back with the hairy grey Beast Man sprawling across hisbody. The brute was dead, but still gripping Montgomery’s throat with itscurving claws. Near by lay M’ling on his face, and quite still, his neck bittenopen, and the upper part of the smashed brandy bottle in his hand. Two otherfigures lay near the fire, the one motionless, the other groaning fitfully,every now and then raising its head slowly, then dropping it again.I caught hold of the Grey Man and pulled him off Montgomery’s body; his clawsdrew down the torn coat reluctantly as I dragged him away.Montgomery was dark in the face and scarcely breathing. I splashed sea-water onhis face, and pillowed his head on my rolled-up coat. M’ling was dead. Thewounded creature by the fire – it was a Wolf Brute with a bearded grey face –lay, I found, with the fore part of its body upon the still glowing timber. Thewretched thing was injured so dreadfully that in mercy I blew its brains out atonce. The other brute was one of the Bull Men swathed in white. He, too, wasdead.The rest of the Beast People had vanished from the beach. I went to Montgomeryagain and knelt beside him, cursing my ignorance of medicine.The fire beside me had sunk down, and only charred beams of timber glowing atthe central ends, and mixed with a grey ash of brushwood, remained. I wonderedcasually where Montgomery had got his wood. Then I saw that the dawn was uponus. The sky had grown brighter, the setting moon was growing pale and opaque inthe luminous blue of the day. The sky to the eastward was rimmed with red.Then I heard a thud and a hissing behind me, and, looking round, sprang to myfeet with a cry of horror. Against the warm dawn great tumultuous masses ofblack smoke were boiling up out of the enclosure, and through their stormydarkness shot flickering threads of blood-red flame. Then the thatched roofcaught. I saw the curving charge of the flames across the sloping straw. A spurtof fire jetted from the window of my room.I knew at once what had happened. I remembered the crash I had heard. When I hadrushed out to Montgomery’s assistance I had overturned the lamp.The hopelessness of saving any of the contents of the enclosure stared me in theface. My mind came back to my plan of flight, and turning swiftly I looked tosee where the two boats lay upon the beach. They were gone! Two axes lay uponthe sands beside me, chips and splinters were scattered broadcast, and the ashesof the bonfire were blackening and smoking under the dawn. He had burnt theboats to revenge himself upon me and prevent our return to mankind.A sudden convulsion of rage shook me. I was almost moved to batter his foolishhead in as he lay there helpless at my feet. Then suddenly his hand moved, sofeebly, so pitifully, that my wrath vanished. He groaned and opened his eyes fora minute.I knelt down beside him and raised his head. He opened his eyes again, staringsilently at the dawn, and then they met mine. The lids fell. ‘Sorry,’ he saidpresently, with an effort. He seemed trying to think. ‘The last,’ he murmured,‘the last of this silly universe. What a mess—’I listened. His head fell helplessly to one side. I thought some drink mightrevive him, but there was neither drink nor vessel in which to bring drink athand. He seemed suddenly heavier. My heart went cold.I bent down to his face, put my hand through the rent in his blouse. He wasdead; and even as he died a line of white heat, the limb of the sun, roseeastward beyond the projection of the bay, splashing its radiance across the skyand turning the dark sea into a weltering tumult of dazzling light. It fell likea glory upon his death-shrunken face.I let his head fall gently upon the rough pillow I had made for him, and stoodup. Before me was the glittering desolation of the sea, the awful solitude uponwhich I had already suffered so much; behind me the island, hushed under thedawn, its Beast People silent and unseen. The enclosure with all its provisionsand ammunition burned noisily with sudden gusts of flame, a fitful crackling,and now and then a crash. The heavy smoke drove up the beach away from me,rolling low over the distant tree tops towards the huts in the ravine. Beside mewere the charred vestiges of the boats and these five dead bodies.Then out of the bushes came three Beast People, with hunched shoulders,protruding heads, misshapen hands awkwardly held, and inquisitive unfriendlyeyes, and advanced towards me with hesitating gestures."},{"pageContent":"XXALONE WITH THE BEAST FOLKI faced these people, facing my fate in them single-handed – now literallysingle-handed, for I had a broken arm. In my pocket was a revolver with twoempty chambers. Among the chips scattered about the beach lay the two axes thathad been used to chop up the boats. The tide was creeping in behind me.There was nothing for it but courage. I looked squarely into the faces of theadvancing monsters. They avoided my eyes, and their quivering nostrilsinvestigated the bodies that lay beyond me on the beach. I took half a dozensteps, picked up the bloodstained whip that lay beneath the body of the WolfMan, and cracked it.They stopped and stared at me. ‘Salute,’ said I. ‘Bow down!’They hesitated. One bent his knees. I repeated my command, with my heart in mymouth, and advanced upon them. One knelt, then the other two.I turned and walked towards the dead bodies, keeping my face towards the threekneeling Beast Men, very much as an actor passing up the stage faces hisaudience.‘They broke the Law,’ said I, putting my foot on the Sayer of the Law. ‘Theyhave been slain. Even the Sayer of the Law. Even the Other with the whip. Greatis the Law! Come and see.’‘None escape,’ said one of them, advancing and peering.‘None escape,’ said I. ‘Therefore hear and do as I command.’ They stood up,looking questioningly at one another.‘Stand there,’ said I.I picked up the hatchets and swung them by their heads from the sling of my arm,turned Montgomery over, picked up his revolver, still loaded in two chambers,and bending down to rummage, found half a dozen cartridges in his pocket.‘Take him,’ said I, standing up again and pointing with the whip; ‘take him andcarry him out, and cast him into the sea.’They came forward, evidently still afraid of Montgomery but still more afraid ofmy cracking red whiplash, and after some fumbling and hesitation, somewhip-cracking and shouting, lifted him gingerly, carried him down to the beach,and went splashing into the dazzling welter of the sea. ‘On,’ said I, ‘on –carry him far.’They went in up to their armpits and stood regarding me. ‘Let go,’ said I, andthe body of Montgomery vanished with a splash. Something seemed to tightenacross my chest. ‘Good!’ said I, with a break in my voice, and they came back,hurrying and fearful, to the margin of the water, leaving long wakes of black inthe silver. At the water’s edge they stopped, turning and glaring into the seaas though they presently expected Montgomery to arise thencefrom and exactvengeance.‘Now these,’ said I, pointing to the other bodies.They took care not to approach the place where they had thrown Montgomery intothe water, but instead carried the four dead Beast People slantingly along thebeach for perhaps a hundred yards before they waded out and cast them away.As I watched them disposing of the mangled remains of M’ling I heard a lightfootfall behind me, and turning quickly saw the big Hyena-Swine perhaps a dozenyards away. His head was bent down, his bright eyes were fixed upon me, hisstumpy hands clenched and held close by his side. He stopped in this crouchingattitude when I turned, his eyes a little averted.For a moment we stood eye to eye. I dropped the whip and snatched at the pistolin my pocket. For I meant to kill this brute – the most formidable of any leftnow upon the island – at the first excuse. It may seem treacherous, but so I wasresolved. I was far more afraid of him than of any other two of the Beast Folk.His continued life was, I knew, a threat against mine.I was perhaps a dozen seconds collecting myself. Then I cried, ‘Salute! Bowdown!’His teeth flashed upon me in a snarl. ‘Who are you, that I should….’Perhaps a little too spasmodically, I drew my revolver, aimed, and quicklyfired. I heard him yelp, saw him run sideways and turn, knew I had missed, andclicked back the cock with my thumb for the next shot. But he was alreadyrunning headlong, jumping from side to side, and I dared not risk another miss.Every now and then he looked back at me over his shoulder. He went slantingalong the beach, and vanished beneath the driving masses of dense smoke thatwere still pouring out from the burning enclosure. For some time I stood staringafter him. I turned to my three obedient Beast Folk again, and signalled them todrop the body they still carried. Then I went back to the place by the firewhere the bodies had fallen, and kicked the sand until all the brown bloodstainswere absorbed and hidden.I dismissed my three serfs with a wave of the hand, and went up the beach intothe thickets. I carried my pistol in my hand, my whip thrust, with the hatchets,in the sling of my arm. I was anxious to be alone, to think out the position inwhich I was now placed.A dreadful thing, that I was only beginning to realize, was that over all thisisland there was now no safe place where I could be alone, and secure to rest orsleep. I had recovered strength amazingly since my landing, but I was stillinclined to be nervous and to break down under any great stress. I felt I oughtto cross the island and establish myself with the Beast People, making myselfsecure in their confidence. And my heart failed me. I went back to the beachand, turning eastward past the burning enclosure, made for a point where ashallow spit of coral sand ran out towards the reef. Here I could sit down andthink, my back to the sea and my face against any surprise. And there I sat,chin on knees, the sun beating down upon my head and a growing dread in my mind,plotting how I could live on against the hour of my rescue (if ever rescuecame). I tried to review the whole situation as calmly as I could, but it wasimpossible to clear the thing of emotion.I began turning over in my mind the reason of Montgomery’s despair. ‘They willchange,’ he said. ‘They are sure to change.’ And Moreau – what was it thatMoreau had said? ‘The stubborn beast flesh grows day by day back again….’ Then Icame round to the Hyena-Swine. I felt assured that if I did not kill that brutehe would kill me…. The Sayer of the Law was dead – worse luck!… They knew nowthat we of the Whips could be killed, even as they themselves were killed….Were they peering at me already out of the green masses of ferns and palms overyonder – watching until I came within their spring? Were they plotting againstme? What was the Hyena-Swine telling them? My imagination was running away withme into a morass of unsubstantial fears.My thoughts were disturbed by a crying of seabirds, hurrying towards some blackobject that had been stranded by the waves on the beach near the enclosure. Iknew what that object was, but I had not the heart to go back and drive themoff. I began walking along the beach in the opposite direction, designing tocome round the eastward corner of the island, and so approach the ravine of thehuts, without traversing the possible ambuscades of the thickets.Perhaps half a mile along the beach I became aware of one of my three Beast Folkadvancing out of the landward bushes towards me. I was now so nervous with myown imaginings that I immediately drew my revolver. Even the propitiatorygestures of the creature failed to disarm me.He hesitated as he approached. ‘Go away,’ cried I. There was something verysuggestive of a dog in the cringing attitude of the creature. It retreated alittle way, very like a dog being sent home, and stopped, looking at meimploringly with canine brown eyes. ‘Go away,’ said I. ‘Do not come near me.’‘May I not come near you?’ it said.‘No. Go away,’ I insisted, and snapped my whip. Then, putting my whip in myteeth, I stooped for a stone, and with that threat drove the creature away.So, in solitude, I came round by the ravine of the Beast People, and, hidingamong the weeds and reeds that separated this crevice from the sea, I watchedsuch of them as appeared, trying to judge from their gestures and appearance howthe death of Moreau and Montgomery and the destruction of the House of Pain hadaffected them. I know now the folly of my cowardice. Had I kept my courage up tothe level of the dawn, had I not allowed it to ebb away in solitary thought, Imight have grasped the vacant sceptre of Moreau, and ruled over the BeastPeople. As it was, I lost the opportunity, and sank to the position of a mereleader among my fellows.Towards noon certain of them came and squatted basking in the hot sand. Theimperious voices of hunger and thirst prevailed over my dread. I came out of thebushes, and, revolver in hand, walked down towards these seated figures. One, aWolf Woman, turned her head and stared at me, and then the others. Noneattempted to rise or salute me. I felt too faint and weary to insist against somany, and I let the moment pass.‘I want food,’ said I, almost apologetically, and drawing near.‘There is food in the huts,’ said an Ox-Boar Man drowsily, and looking away fromme.I passed them, and went down into the shadow and odours of the almost desertedravine. In an empty hut I feasted on some specked and half-decayed fruit, andthen, after I had propped some branches and sticks about the opening, and placedmyself with my face towards it, and my hand upon my revolver, the exhaustion ofthe last thirty hours claimed its own, and I let myself fall into a lightslumber, trusting that the flimsy barricade I had erected would cause sufficientnoise in its removal to save me from surprise."},{"pageContent":"XXITHE REVERSION OF THE BEAST FOLKIn this way I became one among the Beast People in the Island of Doctor Moreau.When I awoke it was dark about me. My arm ached in its bandages. I sat up,wondering at first where I might be. I heard coarse voices talking outside. ThenI saw that my barricade was gone, and that the opening of the hut stood clear.My revolver was still in my hand.I heard something breathing, saw something crouched together close beside me. Iheld my breath, trying to see what it was. It began to move slowly,interminably. Then something soft and warm and moist passed across my hand.All my muscles contracted. I snatched my hand away. A cry of alarm began, andwas stifled in my throat. Then I just realized what had happened sufficiently tostay my fingers on the revolver.‘Who is that?’ I said in a hoarse whisper, the revolver still pointed.‘I, Master.’‘Who are you?’‘They say there is no Master now. But I know, I know. I carried the bodies intothe sea, O Walker in the Sea, the bodies of those you slew. I am your slave,Master.’‘Are you the one I met on the beach?’ I asked.‘The same, Master.’The thing was evidently faithful enough, for it might have fallen upon me as Islept. ‘It is well,’ I said, extending my hand for another licking kiss. I beganto realize what its presence meant, and the tide of my courage flowed. ‘Whereare the others?’ I asked.‘They are mad. They are fools,’ said the Dog Man. ‘Even now they talk togetherbeyond there. They say, “The Master is dead; the Other with the Whip is dead.That Other who walked in the Sea is – as we are. We have no Master, no Whips, noHouse of Pain any more. There is an end. We love the Law, and will keep it; butthere is no pain, no Master, no Whips for ever again.” So they say. But I know,Master, I know.’I felt in the darkness and patted the Dog Man’s head. ‘it is well,’ I saidagain.‘Presently you will slay them all,’ said the Dog Man.‘Presently,’ I answered, ‘I will slay them all – after certain days and certainthings have come to pass. Every one of them save those you spare, every one ofthem shall be slain.’‘What the Master wishes to kill the Master kills,’ said the Dog Man with acertain satisfaction in his voice.‘And that their sins may grow,’ I said; ‘let them live in their folly untiltheir time is ripe. Let them not know that I am the Master.’‘The Master’s will is sweet,’ said the Dog Man, with the ready tact of hiscanine blood.‘But one has sinned,’ said I. ‘Him I will kill, whenever I may meet him. When Isay to you, “That is he,” see that you fall upon him. And now I will go to themen and women who are assembled together.’For a moment the opening of the hut was blackened by the exit of the Dog Man.Then I followed and stood up, almost in the exact spot where I had been when Ihad heard Moreau and his staghound pursuing me. But now it was night, and allthe miasmatic ravine about me was black, and beyond, instead of a green sunlitslope, I saw a red fire before which hunched grotesque figures moved to and fro.Further were the thick trees, a bank of black fringed above with the black laceof the upper branches. The moon was just riding up on the edge of the ravine,and like a bar across its face drove the spire of vapour that was for everstreaming from the fumaroles of the island.‘Walk by me,’ said I, nerving myself, and side by side we walked down the narrowway, taking little heed of the dim things that peered at us out of the huts.None about the fire attempted to salute me. Most of them disregarded me –ostentatiously. I looked round for the Hyena-Swine, but he was not there.Altogether, perhaps, twenty of the Beast Folk squatted, staring into the fire ortalking to one another.‘He is dead, he is dead, the Master is dead,’ said the voice of the Ape Man tothe right of me. ‘The House of Pain – there is no House of Pain.’‘He is not dead,’ said I, in a loud voice. ‘Even now he watches us.’This startled them. Twenty pairs of eyes regarded me.‘The House of Pain is gone,’ said I. ‘It will come again. The Master you cannotsee. Yet even now he listens above you.’‘True, true!’ said the Dog Man.They were staggered at my assurance. An animal may be ferocious and cunningenough, but it takes a real man to tell a lie. ‘The Man with the Bound Armspeaks a strange thing,’ said one of the Beast Folk.‘I tell you it is so,’ I said. ‘The Master and the House of Pain will comeagain. Woe be to him who breaks the Law!’They looked curiously at one another. With an affectation of indifference Ibegan to chop idly at the ground in front of me with my hatchet. They looked, Inoticed, at the deep cuts I made in the turf.Then the Satyr raised a doubt; I answered him, and then one of the dappledthings objected, and an animated discussion sprang up round the fire. Everymoment I began to feel more convinced of my present security. I talked nowwithout the catching in my breath, due to the intensity of my excitement, thathad troubled me at first. In the course of about an hour I had really convincedseveral of the Beast Folk of the truth of my assertions, and talked most of theothers into a dubious state. I kept a sharp eye for my enemy the Hyena-Swine,but he never appeared. Every now and then a suspicious movement would startleme, but my confidence grew rapidly. Then as the moon crept down from the zenith,one by one the listeners began to yawn (showing the oddest teeth in the light ofthe sinking fire), and first one, and then another, retired towards the dens inthe ravine. And I, dreading the silence and darkness, went with them, knowing Iwas safer with several of them than with one alone.In this manner began the longer part of my sojourn upon this Island of DoctorMoreau. But from that night until the end came there was but one thing happenedto tell, save a series of innumerable small unpleasant details and the frettingof an incessant uneasiness. So that I prefer to make no chronicle for that gapof time, to tell only one cardinal incident of the ten months I spent as anintimate of these half-humanized brutes. There is much that sticks in my memorythat I could write, things that I would cheerfully give my right hand to forget.But they do not help the telling of the story. In the retrospect it is strangeto remember how soon I fell in with these monsters’ ways and gained myconfidence again. I had my quarrels, of course, and could show some teeth marksstill, but they soon gained a wholesome respect for my trick of throwing stonesand the bite of my hatchet. And my St Bernard Dog Man’s loyalty was of infiniteservice to me. I found their simple scale of honour was based mainly on thecapacity for inflicting trenchant wounds. Indeed I may say – without vanity, Ihope – that I held something like a pre-eminence among them. One or two whom invarious disputes I had scarred rather badly, bore me a grudge; but it venteditself, chiefly behind my back and at a safe distance from my missiles, ingrimaces.The Hyena-Swine avoided me, and I was always on the alert for him. Myinseparable Dog Man hated and dreaded him intensely. I really believe that wasat the root of the brute’s attachment to me. It was soon evident to me that theformer monster had tasted blood and gone the way of the Leopard Man. He formed alair somewhere in the forest and became solitary. Once I tried to induce theBeast Folk to hunt him, but I lacked the authority to make them cooperate forone end. Again and again I tried to approach his den and come upon him unawares,but always he was too acute for me, and saw or winded me and got away. He madeevery forest pathway dangerous to me and my allies with his lurking ambuscades.The Dog Man scarcely dared to leave my side.In the first month or so the Beast Folk, compared with their latter condition,were human enough; and for one or two besides my canine friend I even conceiveda friendly tolerance. The little pink sloth creature displayed an odd affectionfor me, and took to following me about. The Ape Man bored me however. Heassumed, on the strength of his five digits, that he was my equal, and was forever jabbering at me, jabbering the most arrant nonsense. One thing about himentertained me a little: he had a fantastic trick of coining new words. He hadan idea, I believe, that to gabble about names that meant nothing was the properuse of speech. He called it ‘big thinks’, to distinguish it from ‘little thinks’– the sane everyday interests of life. If ever I made a remark he did notunderstand, he would praise it very much, ask me to say it again, learn it byheart, and go off repeating it, with a word wrong here or there, to all themilder of the Beast People. He thought nothing of what was plain andcomprehensible. I invented some very curious ‘big thinks’ for his especial use.I think now that he was the silliest creature I ever met; he had developed inthe most wonderful way the distinctive silliness of man without losing one jotof the natural folly of a monkey.This, I say, was in the earlier weeks of my solitude among these brutes. Duringthat time they respected the usage established by the Law, and behaved withgeneral decorum. Once I found another rabbit torn to pieces – by theHyena-Swine, I am assured – but that was all. It was about May when I firstdistinctly perceived a growing difference in their speech and carriage, agrowing coarseness of articulation, a growing disinclination to talk. My ApeMan’s jabber multiplied in volume, but grew less and less comprehensible, moreand more simian. Some of the others seemed altogether slipping their hold uponspeech, though they still understood what I said to them at that time. Can youimagine language, once clear-cut and exact, softening and guttering, losingshape and import, becoming mere lumps of sound again? And they walked erect withan increasing difficulty. Though they evidently felt ashamed of themselves,every now and then I would come upon one or other running on toes andfinger-tips, and quite unable to recover the vertical attitude. They held thingsmore clumsily; drinking by suction, feeding by gnawing, grew commoner every day.I realized more keenly than ever what Moreau had told me about the ‘stubbornbeast flesh’. They were reverting, and reverting very rapidly.Some of them – the pioneers, I noticed with some surprise, were all females –began to disregard the injunction of decency – deliberately for the most part.Others even attempted public outrages upon the institution of monogamy. Thetradition of the Law was clearly losing its force. I cannot pursue thisdisagreeable subject. My Dog Man imperceptibly slipped back to the dog again;day by day he became dumb, quadrupedal, hairy. I scarcely noticed the transitionfrom the companion on my right hand to the lurching dog at my side. As thecarelessness and disorganization increased from day to day, the lane ofdwelling-places, at no time very sweet, became so loathsome that I left it, andgoing across the island made myself a hovel of boughs amid the black ruins ofMoreau’s enclosure. Some memory of pain, I found, still made that place thesafest from the Beast Folk.It would be impossible to detail every step of the lapsing of these monsters; totell how, day by day, the human semblance left them; how they gave up bandagingsand wrappings, abandoned at last every stitch of clothing; how the hair began tospread over the exposed limbs; how their foreheads fell away and their facesprojected; how the quasi-human intimacy I had permitted myself with some of themin the first month of my loneliness became a horror to recall.The change was slow and inevitable. For them and for me it came without anydefinite shock. I still went among them in safety, because no jolt in thedownward glide had released the increasing charge of explosive animalism thatousted the human day by day. But I began to fear that soon now that shock mustcome. My St Bernard Brute followed me to the enclosure, and his vigilanceenabled me to sleep at times in something like peace. The little pink sloththing became shy and left me, to crawl back to its natural life once more amongthe tree branches. We were in just the state of equilibrium that would remain inone of those ‘Happy Family’ cages that animal-tamers exhibit, if the tamer wereto leave it for ever.Of course these creatures did not decline into such beasts as the reader hasseen in zoological gardens – into ordinary bears, wolves, tigers, oxen, swine,and apes. There was still something strange about each; in each Moreau hadblended this animal with that; one perhaps was ursine chiefly, another felinechiefly, another bovine chiefly, but each was tainted with other creatures – akind of generalized animalism appeared through the specific dispositions. Andthe dwindling shreds of their humanity still startled me every now and then, amomentary recrudescence of speech perhaps, an unexpected dexterity of the forefeet, a pitiful attempt to walk erect.I, too, must have undergone strange changes. My clothes hung about me as yellowrags, through whose rents glowed the tanned skin. My hair grew long, and becamematted together. I am told that even now my eyes have a strange brightness, aswift alertness of movement.At first I spent the daylight hours on the southward beach watching for a ship,hoping and praying for a ship. I counted on the Ipecacuanhareturning as the yearwore on, but she never came. Five times I saw sails, and thrice smoke, butnothing ever touched the island. I always had a bonfire ready, but no doubt thevolcanic reputation of the island was taken to account for that.It was only about September or October that I began to think of making a raft.By that time my arm had healed, and both my hands were at my service again. Atfirst I found my helplessness appalling. I had never done any carpentry orsuchlike work in my life, and I spent day after day in experimental chopping andbinding among the trees. I had no ropes, and could hit on nothing wherewith tomake ropes; none of the abundant creepers seemed limber or strong enough, andwith all my litter of scientific education I could not devise any way of makingthem so. I spent more than a fortnight grubbing among the black ruins of theenclosure and on the beach where the boats had been burned, looking for nailsand other stray pieces of metal that might prove of service. Now and then someBeast creature would watch me, and go leaping off when I called to it. Therecame a season of thunderstorms and heavy rain that greatly retarded my work, butat last the raft was completed. I was delighted with it. But with a certain lackof practical sense that has always been my bane I had made it a mile or morefrom the sea, and before I had dragged it down to the beach the thing had fallento pieces. Perhaps it is as well I was saved from launching it. But at the timemy misery at my failure was so acute, that for some days I simply moped on thebeach and stared at the water and thought of death.But I did not mean to die, and an incident occurred that warned me unmistakablyof the folly of letting the days pass so - for each fresh day was fraught withincreasing danger from the Beast Monsters. I was lying in the shade of theenclosure wall staring out to sea, when I was startled by something coldtouching the skin of my heel, and starting round found the little pink slothcreature blinking into my face. He had long since lost speech and activemovement, and the lank hair of the little brute grew thicker every day, and hisstumpy claws more askew. He made a moaning noise when he saw he had attracted myattention, went a little way towards the bushes, and looked back at me.At first I did not understand, but presently it occurred to me that he wished meto follow him, and this I did at last, slowly – for the day was hot. When hereached the trees he clambered into them, for he could travel better among theirswinging creepers than on the ground.And suddenly in a trampled space I came upon a ghastly group. My St Bernardcreature lay on the ground dead, and near his body crouched the Hyena-Swine,gripping the quivering flesh with misshapen claws, gnawing at it and snarlingwith delight. As I approached the monster lifted its glaring eyes to mine, itslips went trembling back from its red-stained teeth, and it growled menacingly.It was not afraid and not ashamed; the last vestige of the human taint hadvanished. I advanced a step further, stopped, pulled out my revolver. At last Ihad him face to face.The brute made no sign of retreat. But its ears went back, its hair bristled,and its body crouched together. I aimed between the eyes and fired. As I did sothe thing rose straight at me in a leap, and I was knocked over like a ninepin.It clutched at me with its crippled hand, and struck me in the face. Its springcarried it over me. I fell under the hind part of its body, but luckily I hadhit as I meant, and it had died even as it leapt. I crawled out from under itsunclean weight and stood up trembling, staring at its quivering body. Thatdanger at least was over. But this, I knew, was only the first of the series ofrelapses that must come.I burned both the bodies on a pyre of brushwood. Now, indeed, I saw clearly thatunless I left the island my death was only a question of time. The Beasts bythat time had, with one or two exceptions, left the ravine, and made themselveslairs according to their tastes among the thickets of the island. Few prowled byday; most of them slept, and the island might have seemed deserted to anewcomer; but at night the air was hideous with their calls and howling. I hadhalf a mind to make a massacre of them – to build traps or fight them with myknife. Had I possessed sufficient cartridges, I should not have hesitated tobegin the killing. There could now be scarcely a score left of the dangerouscarnivores; the braver of these were already dead. After the death of this poordog of mine, my last friend, I too adopted to some extent the practice ofslumbering in the daytime, in order to be on my guard at night. I rebuilt my denin the walls of the enclosure with such a narrow opening that anythingattempting to enter must necessarily make a considerable noise. The creatureshad lost the art of fire too, and recovered their fear of it. I turned oncemore, almost passionately now, to hammering together stakes and branches to forma raft for my escape.I found a thousand difficulties. I am an extremely unhandy man – my schoolingwas over before the days of Slöjd1 [note.html#ich21en01] – but most of therequirements of a raft I met at last in some clumsy circuitous way or other, andthis time I took care of the strength. The only insurmountable obstacle was thatI had no vessel to contain the water I should need if I floated forth upon theseuntravelled seas. I would have even tried pottery, but the island contained noclay. I used to go moping about the island, trying with all my might to solvethis one last difficulty. Sometimes I would give way to wild outbursts of rage,and hack and splinter some unlucky tree in my intolerable vexation. But I couldthink of nothing.And then came a day, a wonderful day, that I spent in ecstasy. I saw a sail tothe south-west, a small sail like that of a little schooner, and forthwith I lita great pile of brushwood and stood by it in the heat of it and the heat of themidday sun, watching. All day I watched that sail, eating or drinking nothing,so that my head reeled; and the Beasts came and glared at me, and seemed towonder, and went away. The boat was still distant when night came and swallowedit up, and all night I toiled to keep my blaze bright and high, and the eyes ofthe Beasts shone out of the darkness, marvelling. In the dawn it was nearer, andI saw it was the dirty lug sail of a small boat. My eyes were weary withwatching, and I peered and could not believe them. Two men were in the boat,sitting low down, one by the bows and the other at the rudder. But the boatsailed strangely. The head was not kept to the wind; it yawed and fell away.As the day grew brighter I began waving the last rag of my jacket to them; butthey did not notice me, and sat still, facing one another. I went to the lowestpoint of the low headland and gesticulated and shouted. There was no response,and the boat kept on her aimless course, making slowly, very slowly, for thebay. Suddenly a great white bird flew up out of the boat, and neither of the menstirred. It circled round, and then came sweeping overhead with its strong wingsoutspread.Then I stopped shouting, and sat down on the headland and rested my chin on myhands and stared. Slowly, slowly, the boat drove past towards the west. I wouldhave swum out to it, but something, a cold vague fear, kept me back. In theafternoon the tide stranded it, and left it a hundred yards or so to thewestward of the ruins of the enclosure.The men in it were dead, had been dead so long that they fell to pieces when Itilted the boat on its side and dragged them out. One had a shock of red hairlike the captain of the Ipecacuanha, and a dirty white cap lay in the bottom ofthe boat. As I stood beside the boat, three of the Beasts came slinking out ofthe bushes and sniffing towards me. One of my spasms of disgust came upon me. Ithrust the little boat down the beach and clambered on board her. Two of thebrutes were Wolf Beasts, and came forward with quivering nostrils and glitteringeyes; the third was the horrible nondescript of bear and bull.When I saw them approaching those wretched remains, heard them snarling at oneanother, and caught the gleam of their teeth, a frantic horror succeeded myrepulsion. I turned my back upon them, struck the lug, and began paddling out tosea. I could not bring myself to look behind me.But I lay between the reef and the island that night, and the next morning wentround to the stream and filled the empty keg aboard with water. Then, with suchpatience as I could command, I collected a quantity of fruit, and waylaid andkilled two rabbits with my last three cartridges. While I was doing this I leftthe boat moored to an inward projection of the reef, for fear of the BeastMonsters."},{"pageContent":"XXIITHE MAN ALONEIn the evening I started and drove out to sea before a gentle wind from thesouth-west, slowly and steadily; and the island grew smaller and smaller, andthe lank spire of smoke dwindled to a finer and finer line against the hotsunset. The ocean rose up around me, hiding that low dark patch from my eyes.The daylight, the trailing glory of the sun, went streaming out of the sky, wasdrawn aside like some luminous curtain, and at last I looked into that blue gulfof immensity that the sunshine hides, and saw the floating hosts of the stars.The sea was silent, the sky was silent; I was alone with the night and silence.So I drifted for three days, eating and drinking sparingly, and meditating uponall that had happened to me, nor desiring very greatly to see men again. Oneunclean rag was about me, my hair a black tangle. No doubt my discoverersthought me a madman. It is strange, but I felt no desire to return to mankind. Iwas only glad to be quit of the foulness of the Beast Monsters. And on the thirdday I was picked up by a brig from Apia1 [note.html#ich22en01] to San Francisco.Neither the captain nor the mate would believe my story, judging that solitudeand danger had made me mad. And fearing their opinion might be that of others, Irefrained from telling my adventures further, and professed to recall nothingthat had happened to me between the loss of the Lady Vain and the time when Iwas picked up again – the space of a year.I had to act with the utmost circumspection to save myself from the suspicion ofinsanity. My memory of the Law, of the two dead sailors, of the ambuscades ofthe darkness, of the body in the cane-brake, haunted me. And, unnatural as itseems, with my return to mankind came, instead of that confidence and sympathy Ihad expected, a strange enhancement of the uncertainty and dread I hadexperienced during my stay upon the island. No one would believe me, I wasalmost as queer to men as I had been to the Beast People. I may have caughtsomething of the natural wildness of my companions.They say that terror is a disease, and anyhow I can witness that for severalyears now, a restless fear has dwelt in my mind, such a restless fear as ahalf-tamed lion cub may feel. My trouble took the strangest form. I could notpersuade myself that the men and women I met were not also another, stillpassably human, Beast People, animals half-wrought into the outward image ofhuman souls; and that they would presently begin to revert, to show first thisbestial mark and then that. But I have confided my case to a strangely able man,a man who had known Moreau and seemed half to credit my story, a mentalspecialist – and he has helped me mightily.Though I do not expect that the terror of that island will ever altogether leaveme, at most times it lies far in the back of my mind, a mere distant cloud, amemory and a faint distrust; but there are times when the little cloud spreadsuntil it obscures the whole sky. Then I look about me at my fellow men. And I goin fear. I see faces keen and bright, others dull or dangerous, others unsteady,insincere; none that have the calm authority of a reasonable soul. I feel asthough the animal was surging up through them; that presently the degradation ofthe Islanders will be played over again on a larger scale. I know this is anillusion, that these seeming men and women about me are indeed men and women,men and women for ever, perfectly reasonable creatures full of human desires andtender solicitude, emancipated from instinct and the slaves of no fantastic Law– beings altogether different from the Beast Folk. Yet I shrink from them, fromtheir curious glances, their inquiries and assistance, and long to be away fromthem and alone.For that reason I live near the broad free downland, and can escape thither whenthis shadow is over my soul; and very sweet is the empty downland then, underthe wind-swept sky. When I lived in London the horror was well-nighinsupportable. I could not get away from men; their voices came through windows,locked doors were flimsy safeguards. I would go out into the streets to fightwith my delusion, and prowling women would mew after me, furtive craving menglance jealously at me, weary pale workers go coughing by me with tired eyes andeager paces like wounded deer dripping blood, old people, bent and dull, passmurmuring to themselves and all unheeding a ragged tail of gibing children. ThenI would turn aside into some chapel, and even there, such was my disturbance, itseemed that the preacher gibbered Big Thinks even as the Ape Man had done; orinto some library, and there the intent faces over the books seemed but patientcreatures waiting for prey. Particularly nauseous were the blank expressionlessfaces of people in trains and omnibuses; they seemed no more my fellow-creaturesthan dead bodies would be, so that I did not dare to travel unless I was assuredof being alone. And even it seemed that I, too, was not a reasonable creature,but only an animal tormented with some strange disorder in its brain, that sentit to wander alone like a sheep stricken with the gid.2 [note.html#ich22en02]EDWARD PRENDICKBut this is a mood that comes to me now – I thank God – more rarely. I havewithdrawn myself from the confusion of cities and multitudes, and spend my dayssurrounded by wise books, bright windows in this life of ours lit by the shiningsouls of men. I see few strangers, and have but a small household. My days Idevote to reading and to experiments in chemistry, and I spend many of the clearnights in the study of astronomy. There is, though I do not know how there is orwhy there is, a sense of infinite peace and protection in the glittering hostsof heaven. There it must be, I think, in the vast and eternal laws of matter,and not in the daily cares and sins and troubles of men, that whatever is morethan animal within us must find its solace and its hope. I hope, or I could notlive. And so, in hope and solitude, my story ends."},{"pageContent":"* [chapter15.html#ich15fn01] This description corresponds in every respect toNoble’s Isle — C.E.P."},{"pageContent":"NOTESINTRODUCTION1 [part.html#fm01en01].

Not to go on all-Fours… His is the Hand that heals:The Island of Doctor Moreau received a number of hostile reviews which objectedto the obvious parallels between the Beast Folk’s recital of Moreau’s Law andhuman religious practices, among other things. For the anonymous reviewerwriting in the Guardian of 3 June 1896, there is a definite hint of blasphemy inthe novel: ‘his [Wells’s] object seems to be to parody the work of the Creatorof the human race, and cast contempt upon the dealings of God with Hiscreatures’.2 [chapter12.html#ch12en02]. like the haha of an English park: A haha is a ditchwith a wall on its inner side below ground level, forming a boundary withoutinterrupting the view.CHAPTER XIIIA PARLEY1 [chapter13.html#ch13en01].

Wells responded furiously to the claim, made by Chambers Mitchell ina review of The Island of Doctor Moreau, that the grafting of tissue betweenanimals of different species was not possible. In a letter to the Editor of theSaturday Review published on 7 November 1896, he wrote that: ‘I was aware at thetime that Mr Chambers Mitchell was mistaken in relying upon Oscar Hertwig as hisfinal authority upon this business, that he was making the rash assertion andnot I, but for a while I was unable to replace the stigma of ignorance he hadgiven me, for the simple reason that I knew of no published results of the kindI needed.’ Wells then pointed to a report in The British Medical Journal of 31October 1896 of a successful graft of connective tissue between man and rabbit.2 [chapter14.html#ch14en02].

There was no evidence of the inheritance of theacquired human characteristics: The French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck(1744–1829) theorized that the characteristics an organism acquires from itsenvironment are transmitted to future generations, although he was unable toprove it. While there is no evidence that Moreau’s creations inherit humancharacteristics, there is substantial evidence that Prendick acquires the traitsof the Beast Folk. Hence he remarks that ‘I may have caught something of thenatural wildness of my companions’ (p. 130).3 [chapter15.html#ch15en03]. prognathous: Having a projecting jaw.4 [chapter15.html#ch15en04]. fusees: Large-headed matches.CHAPTER XVIHOW THE BEAST FOLK TASTED BLOOD1 [chapter16.html#ch16en01].

Now they stumbled in the shackles of humanity… onelong internal struggle: The intermingling of human and animal portrayed in thenovel was a further aspect of The Island of Doctor Moreau which invited thecensure of critics.
