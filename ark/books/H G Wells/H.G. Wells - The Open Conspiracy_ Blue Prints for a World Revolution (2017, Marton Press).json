G. WellsHerbert George Wells was born in Bromley, England in 1866. He apprenticed as adraper before becoming a pupil-teacher at Midhurst Grammar School in WestSussex. Some years later, Wells won a scholarship to the School of Science inLondon, where he developed a strong interest in biology and evolution, foundingand editing the Science Schools Journal. However, he left before graduating toreturn to teaching, and began to focus increasingly on writing. His first majoressay on science, ‘The Rediscovery of the Unique’, appeared in 1891. However, itwas in 1895 that Wells seriously established himself as a writer, with thepublication of the now iconic novel, The Time Machine.Wells followed The Time Machine with the equally well-received War of the Worlds(1898), which proved highly popular in the USA, and was serialized in themagazine Cosmopolitan. Around the turn of the century, he also began to writeextensively on politics, technology and the future, producing works TheDiscovery of the Future (1902) and Mankind in the Making (1903). An activesocialist, in 1904 Wells joined the Fabian Society, and his 1905 book A ModernUtopia presented a vision of a socialist society founded on reason andcompassion. Wells also penned a range of successful comic novels, such as Kipps(1905) and The History of Mr Polly (1910).Wells’ 1920 work, The Outline of History, was penned in response to the RussianRevolution, and declared that world would be improved by education, rather thanrevolution. It made Wells one of the most important political thinkers of thetwenties and thirties, and he began to write for a number of journals andnewspapers, even travelling to Russia to lecture Lenin and Trotsky on socialreform. Appalled by the carnage of World War II, Wells began to work on aproject dealing with the perils of nuclear war, but died before completing it.He is now regarded as one of the greatest science-fiction writers of all time,and an important political thinker."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONThe Open Conspiracy was Wells' Blue Print for A World Revolution; he regardedthis book as his finished statement on the way the world ought to be ordered.Possibly he underestimated, or ignored, the fact that it is often in theinterest of subsets of the human race to act against other subsets. Moreover theemphasis on religion seems odd, from a rationalist.After the First World War, observing the lack of knowledge of most people aboutmost things, he turned to history, starting, in 1918, his Outline of History first published in parts with 'gorgeous' covers, then in 1920 as a two-volumework including colour plates of a lavish nature for the time. In effect it wasjointly authored—his chapters were sent to collaborators, and the resultingmultiple corrections reassembled by the duly-chastened Wells. A 'popular'one-volume edition appeared in 1930. By the standards of its time this was abest-seller. It was praised decades later by A.J.P. Taylor as 'still the bestintroduction to history'. Toynbee had a favourable opinion of it. During the1920s it sparked a controversy with Hilaire Belloc, who believed in such thingsas the 'Fall of Man'. It was also attacked by a teacher of Greek. Wells' hopesthat school history could be taught in an international sense still, of course,have not come to fruition.He planned and collaborated a hefty set of volumes on biology, The Science ofLife, with his own son, and with Julian Huxley; the theme was largelyevolutionary (The Origin of Specieswas published only a few years before hisbirth). Huxley, a descendant of T.H. Huxley, regarded Wells as something of aCockney upstart.And he wrote a descriptive, rather than analytical, book on economics, whichincludes many ingenious observations but was eclipsed by Keynes' GeneralTheory of four years later.Some of his books were filmed; his Invisible Man was turned into a filmscriptby Preston Sturges, who however regarded his books as not very filmable andinfuriated Wells by making the invisible man mad. Another media incident wasOrson Welles' radio broadcast of War of the Worlds in 1938, involvingaggressive Martians landing in a location Americanised from its original Surrey,and which was reported to have cause mass panic among less educated Americans onthe eastern seaboard.C.P. Snow wrote of Wells that he could 'throw out a phrase that crystallised awhole argument', and that he 'never heard anyone remotely in the same class.'Among these phrases were 'the War that will end War', coined when he worked withthe Ministry of Propaganda under Northcliffe during the First World War, whichhe supported, and 'the New World Order', which he seemed to be the first to use,or popularise, in a 1940 book of that title. His less successful phrasesincluded the 'competent receiver'. He said of himself that he 'worked all thetime'.He was a socialist of an empirical, rather vague, rationalist type, dislikingMarx and unenthusiastic about the managerial socialism of the Webbs.His book The Open Conspiracy was published in 1928, subtitled Blue Prints fora World Revolution. Bertrand Russell said of this book '...I do not know ofanything with which I agree more entirely' though since this was in a beggingletter perhaps he was just being polite. It was revised and republished as WhatAre We to Do with Our Lives? in 1931.In this short book, Wells attempts to answer the question: What shouldsocialists actually do?—to which he confessed several times to having no veryclear idea. It's a counter to Marx: why shouldn't non-proletarians unite tochange the world?"},{"pageContent":"I. — THE PRESENT CRISIS IN HUMAN AFFAIRSTHE world is undergoing immense changes. Never before have the conditions oflife changed so swiftly and enormously as they have changed for mankind in thelast fifty years. We have been carried along—with no means of measuring theincreasing swiftness in the succession of events. We are only now beginning torealize the force and strength of the storm of change that has come upon us.These changes have not come upon our world from without. No meteorite from outerspace has struck our planet; there have been no overwhelming outbreaks ofvolcanic violence or strange epidemic diseases; the sun has not flared up toexcessive heat or suddenly shrunken to plunge us into Arctic winter. The changeshave come through men themselves. Quite a small number of people, heedless ofthe ultimate consequence of what they did, one man here and a group there, havemade discoveries and produced and adopted inventions that have changed all thecondition, of social life.We are now just beginning to realize the nature of these changes, to find wordsand phrases for them and put them down. First they began to happen, and then webegan to see that they were happening. And now we are beginning to see how thesechanges are connected together and to get the measure of their consequences. Weare getting our minds so clear about them that soon we shall be able todemonstrate them and explain them to our children in our schools. We do not doso at present. We do not give our children a chance of discovering that theylive in a world of universal change.What are the broad lines upon which these alterations of condition areproceeding?It will be most convenient to deal with them in the order in which they came tobe realized and seen clearly, rather than by the order in which they came aboutor by their logical order. They are more or less interdependent changes; theyoverlap and interact.It was only in the beginning of the twentieth century that people began torealize the real significance of that aspect of our changing conditions to whichthe phrase \"the abolition of distance\" has been applied. For a whole centurybefore that there had been a continual increase in the speed and safety oftravel and transport and the ease and swiftness with which messages could betransmitted, but this increase had not seemed to be a matter of primaryimportance. Various results of railway, steamship, and telegraph becamemanifest; towns grew larger, spreading into the countryside, once inaccessiblelands became areas of rapid settlement and cultivation, industrial centres beganto live on imported food, news from remote parts lost its time-lag and tended tobecome contemporary, but no one hailed these things as being more than\"improvements\" in existing conditions. They are not observed to be thebeginnings of a profound revolution in the life of mankind. The attention ofyoung people was not drawn to them; no attempt was made, or considerednecessary, to adapt political and social institutions to this creepingenlargement of scale.Until the closing years of the nineteenth century there was no recognition ofthe real state of affairs. Then a few observant people began, in a rathertentative, commentary sort of way, to call attention to what was happening. Theydid not seem to be moved by the idea that something had to be done about it;they merely remarked, brightly and intelligently, that it was going on. And thenthey went on to the realization that this \"abolition of distance\" was only oneaspect of much more far-reaching advances.Men were travelling about so much faster and flashing their communicationsinstantly about the world because a progressive conquest of force and substancewas going on. Improved transport was only one of a number of portentousconsequences of that conquest; the first to be conspicuous and set men thinking;but not perhaps the first in importance. It dawned upon them that in the lasthundred years there had been a stupendous progress in obtaining and utilizingmechanical power, a vast increase in the efficiency of mechanism, and associatedwith that an enormous increase in the substances available for man's purposes,from vulcanized rubber to the modern steels, and from petroleum and margarine totungsten and aluminium. At first the general intelligence was disposed to regardthese things as lucky \"finds,\" happy chance discoveries. It was not apprehendedthat the shower of finds was systematic and continuous. Popular writers toldabout these things but they told of them at first as \"Wonders\"—\"Wonders\" likethe Pyramids, the Colossus of Rhodes, and the Great Wall of China. Few realizedhow much more they were than any \"Wonders.\" The \"Seven Wonders of the World\"left men free to go on living, toiling, marrying, and dying as they had beenaccustomed to for immemorial ages. If the \"Seven Wonders\" had vanished or beenmultiplied three score it would not have changed the lives of any largeproportion of human beings. But these new powers and substances were modifyingand transforming—unobtrusively, surely, and relentlessly—very particular of thenormal life of mankind.They increased the amount of production and the methods of production. They madepossible \"Big-Business,\" to drive the small producer and the small distributorout of the market. They swept away factories and evoked new ones. They changedthe face of the fields. They brought into the normal life, thing by thing andday by day, electric light and heating, bright cities at night, better aeration,new types of clothing, a fresh cleanliness. They changed a world where there hadnever been enough into a world of potential plenty, into a world of excessiveplenty. It dawned upon their minds after their realization of the \"abolition ofdistance\" that shortage of supplier had also been abolished and that irksometoil was no longer necessary to produce everything material that man mightrequire. It is only in the last dozen years that this broader and profounderfact has come through to the intelligence of any considerable number of people.Most of them have still to carry their realization a step farther and see howcomplete is the revolution in the character of the daily life these thingsinvolve.But there are still other changes outside this vast advance in the pace andpower of material life. The biological sciences have undergone a correspondingextension. Medical art has attained a new level of efficiency, so that in allthe modernizing societies of the world the average life is prolonged, and thereis, in spite of a great fall in the birth rate, a steady, alarming increase inthe world's population. The proportion of adults alive is greater than it hasever been before. Fewer and fewer human beings die young This has changed thesocial atmosphere about us. The tragedy of lives cut short and ended prematurelyis passing out of general experience. Health becomes prevalent. The continualtoothaches, headaches, rheumatism, neuralgias, coughs, colds, indigestions thatmade up so large a part of the briefer lives of our grandfathers andgrandmothers fade out of experience. We may all live now, we discover, withoutany great burthen of fear, wholesomely and abundantly, for as long as the desireto live is in us.But we do not do so. All this possible freedom of movement, this power andabundance, remains for most of us no more than possibility. There is a sense ofprofound instability about these achievements of our race. Even those who enjoy,enjoy without security, and for the great multitude of mankind there is neitherease, plenty, nor freedom. Hard tasks, insufficiency, and unending money worriesare still the ordinary stuff of life. Over everything human hangs the threat ofsuch war as man has never known before, were armed and reinforced by all thepowers and discoveries of modern science.When we demand why the achievement of power turns to distress and danger in ourhands, we get some very unsatisfactory replies. The favourite platitude of thepolitician excusing himself for the futilities of his business, is that \"moralprogress has not kept pace with material advance.\" That seems to satisfy himcompletely, but it can satisfy no other intelligent person. He says \"moral.\" Heleaves that word unexplained. Apparently he wants to shift the responsibility toour religious teachers. At the most he has made but the vaguest gesture towardsa reply. And yet, when we consider it, charitably and sympathetically, theredoes seem to be a germ of reality in that phrase of his.What does moral mean? Mores means manners and customs. Morality is the conductof life. It is what we do with our social lives. It is how we deal withourselves in relation to our fellow creatures. And there does seem to be a muchgreater discord now than there was (say) a couple of hundred years ago betweenthe prevailing ideas of how to carry on life and the opportunities and dangersof the time. We are coming to see more and more plainly that certain establishedtraditions which have made up the frame of human relationships for ages are notmerely no longer as convenient as they were, but are positively injurious anddangerous. And yet at present we do not know how to shake off these traditions,these habits of social behaviour which rule us. Still less are we able to state,and still less bring into operation, the new conceptions of conduct andobligation that must replace them.For example, the general government of human affairs has hitherto beendistributed among a number of sovereign states—there are about seventy of themnow—and until recently that was a quite tolerable system of frame-works intowhich a general way of living could be fitted. The standard of living may nothave been as high as our present standards, but the social stability andassurance were greater. The young were trained to be loyal, law-regarding,patriotic, and a defined system of crimes and misdemeanours with properlyassociated pains, penalties, and repressions, kept the social body together.Everyone was taught a history glorifying his own state, and patriotism was chiefamong the Virtues. Now, with great rapidity, there has been that \"abolition ofdistance,\" and everyone has become next-door neighbour to everyone else. Statesonce separate, social and economic systems formerly remote from one another, nowjostle each other exasperatingly. Commerce under the new conditions isperpetually breaking nationalist bounds and making militant raids upon theeconomic life of other countries. This exacerbates patriotism in which we haveall been trained and with which we are all, with scarcely an exception,saturated. And meanwhile war, which was once a comparative slow bickering upon afront, has become war in three dimensions; it gets at the \"non-combatant\" almostas searchingly as at the combatant, and has acquired weapons of a stupendouscruelty and destructiveness. At present there exists no solution to thisparadoxical situation. We are continually being urged by our training andtraditions to antagonisms and conflicts that will impoverish, starve, anddestroy both our antagonists and ourselves. We are all trained to distrust andhate foreigners, salute our flag, stiffen up in a wooden obedient way at ournational anthem, and prepare to follow the little fellows in spurs and featherswho pose as the heads of our states into the most horrible common destruction.Our political and economic ideas of living are out of date, and we find greatdifficulty in adjusting them and reconstructing them to meet the huge andstrenuous demands of the new times. That is really what our gramophonepoliticians have in mind—in the vague way in which they have anything inmind—when they put on that well-worn record about moral progress not having keptpace with material inventions.Socially and politically we want a revised system of ideas about conduct, a viewof social and political life brought up to date. We are not doing the effectivething with our lives, we are drifting, we are being hoodwinked and bamboozledand misled by those who trade upon the old traditions. It is preposterous thatwe should still be followed about and pestered by war, taxed for warpreparations, and threatened bodily and in our liberties by this unnecessary andexaggerated and distorted survival of the disunited world of the pre-scientificera. And it is not simply that our political way of living is now no better thanan inherited defect and malformation, but that our everyday life, our eating anddrinking and clothing and housing and going about, is also cramped, thwarted,and impoverished, because we do not know how to set about shaking off the oldways and fitting the general life to our new opportunities. The strain takes theform of increased unemployment and a dislocation of spending power. We do notknow whether to spend or save. Great swarms of us find ourselves unaccountablythrown out of work. Unjustly, irrationally. Colossal business reconstructionsare made to increase production and accumulate profits, and meanwhile thecustomers with purchasing power dwindle in numbers and fade away. The economicmachine creaks and makes every sign of stopping—and its stopping means universalwant and starvation. It must not stop. There must be a reconstruction, achange-over. But what sort of a change-over?Though none of us are yet clear as to the precise way in which this greatchange-over is to be effected, there is a world-wide feeling now that change-over or a vast catastrophe is before us. Increasing multitudes participate inthat uneasy sense of insecure transition. In the course of one lifetime mankindhas passed from a state of affairs that seems to us now to have been slow, dull,ill-provided, and limited, but at least picturesque and tranquil-minded, to anew phase of excitement, provocation, menace, urgency, and actual or potentialdistresses. Our lives are part of one another. We cannot get away from it. Weare items in a social mass. What are we to do with our lives?"},{"pageContent":"II. — THE IDEA OF THE OPEN CONSPIRACYI AM a writer upon social and political matters. Essentially I am a veryordinary, undistinguished person. I have a mediocre brain, a very average brain,and the way in which my mind reacts to these problems is therefore very much theway in which most brains will react to them. But because it is my business towrite and think about these questions, because on that account I am able to givemore time and attention to them than most people, I am able to get rather aheadof my equals and to write articles and books just a little before the ideas Iexperience become plain to scores of thousands, and then to hundreds ofthousands, and at last to millions of other people. And so it happened that afew years ago (round about 1927) I became very anxious to clear up and give formto a knot of suggestions that seemed to me to have in them the solution of thisriddle of adapting our lives to the immense new possibilities and the immensenew dangers that confront mankind.It seemed to me that all over the world intelligent people were waking up to theindignity and absurdity of being endangered, restrained, and impoverished, by amere uncritical adhesion to traditional governments, traditional ideas ofeconomic life, and traditional forms of behaviour, and that these awakingintelligent people must constitute first a protest and then a creativeresistance to the inertia that was stifling and threatening us. These people Iimagined would say first, \"We are drifting; we are doing nothing worth whilewith our lives. Our lives are dull and stupid and not good enough.\"Then they would say, \"What are we to do with our lives?\"And then, \"Let us get together with other people of our sort and make over theworld into a great world-civilization that will enable us to realize thepromises and avoid the dangers of this new time.\"It seemed to me that as, one after another, we woke up, that is what we shouldbe saying. It amounted to a protest, first mental and then practical, itamounted to a sort of unpremeditated and unorganized conspiracy, against thefragmentary and insufficient governments and the wide-spread greed,appropriation, clumsiness, and waste that are now going on. But unlikeconspiracies in general this widening protest and conspiracy against establishedthings would, by its very nature, go on in the daylight, and it would be willingto accept participation and help from every quarter. It would, in fact, becomean \"Open Conspiracy,\" a necessary, naturally evolved conspiracy, to adjust ourdislocated world.I made various attempts to develop this idea. I published a little book calledThe Open Conspiracy as early as 1928, into which I put what I had in my mind atthat time. It was an unsatisfactory little book even when I published it, notquite plain enough and not quite confident enough, and evidently unsure of itsreaders. I could not find out how to do it better at the time, and it seemed inits way to say something of living and current interest, and so I publishedit—but I arranged things so that I could withdraw it in a year or so. That Idid, and this present book is a largely rewritten version, much clearer and moreexplicit. Since that first publication we have all got forward surprisingly.Events have hustled thought along and have been hustled along by thought. Theidea of reorganizing the affairs of the world on quite a big scale, which was\"Utopian,\" and so forth, in 1926 and 1927, and still \"bold\" in 1928, has nowspread about the world until nearly everybody has it. It has broken out all overthe place, thanks largely to the mental stimulation of the Russian Five YearPlan. Hundreds of thousands of people everywhere are now thinking upon the linesforeshadowed by my Open Conspiracy, not because they had ever heard of the bookor phrase, but because that was the way thought was going.The first Open Conspiracy conveyed the general idea of a world reconstructed,but it was very vague about the particular way in which this or that individuallife could be lived in relation to that general idea. It gave a general answerto the question, \"What are we to do with our lives?\" It said, \"Help to make overthe New World amidst the confusions of the Old.\" But when the question wasasked, \"What am I to do with my life?\" the reply was much less satisfactory.The intervening years of thought and experience make it possible, now, to bringthis general idea of a reconstructive effort, an attempt to build up a new worldwithin the dangers and disharmonies of our present state, into a much closer andmore explicit relation to the individual \"Open Conspirator.\" We can present thething in a better light and handle it with a surer touch."},{"pageContent":"III. — WE HAVE TO CLEARAND CLEAN UP OUR MINDSNow, one thing is fairly plain to most of us who are waking up to the need ofliving our lives in a new way and of making over the state, which is theframework of our lives, to meet the new demands upon it, and that is, that wehave to put our own minds in order. Why have we only awakened now to the crisisin human affairs. The changes in progress have been going on with a steadyacceleration for a couple of centuries. Clearly we must all have been veryunobservant, our knowledge as it came to us must have been very badly arrangedin our minds, and our way of dealing with it must have been cloudy and muddled,or else we should surely have awakened long ago to the immense necessities thatnow challenge us. And if that is so, if it has taken decades to rouse us, thenquite probably we are not yet completely awake. Even now we may not haverealized the job before us in its completeness. We may still have much to getplain in our minds, and we certainly have much more to learn. One primary andpermanent duty therefore is to go on with our thinking and to think as well aswe can about the way in which we think and about the ways in which we get anduse knowledge.Fundamentally the Open Conspiracy must be an intellectual rebirth.Human thought is still very much confused by the imperfection of the words andother symbols it employs and the consequences of this confused thinking are muchmore serious and extensive than is commonly realized. We still see the worldthrough a mist of words; it is only the things immediately about us that areplain fact. Through symbols, and especially through words, man has raisedhimself above the level of the ape and come to a considerable mastery over hisuniverse. But every step in his mental ascent has involved entanglement withthese symbols and words he was using; they were at once helpful and verydangerous and misleading. A great part of our affairs, social, political,intellectual, is in a perplexing and dangerous state to-day because of ourloose, uncritical, slovenly use of words.All through the later Middle Ages there were great disputes among the schoolmenabout the use of words and symbols. There is a queer disposition in the humanmind to think that symbols and words and logical deductions are truer thanactual experiences, and these great controversies were due to the struggle ofthe human intelligence against that disposition. On the one side were theRealists, who were so called because they believed, in effect, that names weremore real than facts, and on the other side were the Nominalists, who from thefirst were pervaded by a suspicion about names and words generally; who thoughtthere might be some sort of catch in verbal processes, and who gradually workedtheir way towards verification by experiment which is the fundamental thingabout experimental science—experimental science which has given our human worldall these immense powers and possibilities that tempt and threaten it to-day.These controversies of the schoolmen were of the utmost importance to mankind.The modern world could not begin to come into existence until the human mind hadbroken away from the narrow-minded verbalist way of thinking which the Realistsfollowed.But all through my education I never had this matter explained to me. TheUniversity of London intimated that I was a soundly educated young man by givingme a degree in first-class honours and the liberty to acquire and wear anelegant gown and hood, and the London College of Preceptors gave me and theworld its highest assurances that I was fit to educate and train the minds of myfellow creatures, and yet I had still to discover that a Realist was not anovelist who put rather too highly flavoured sex appeal into his books, and aNominalist, nothing in particular. But it had crept into my mind as I learntabout individuality in my biological work and about logic and psychology in mypreparation as the perfect preceptor, that something very important andessential was being left out and that I wasn't at all as well equipped as mydiplomas presently said I was, and in the next few years I found the time toclean up this matter pretty thoroughly. I made no marvellous discoveries,everything I found out was known already; nevertheless, I had to find out someof this stuff for myself quite over again, as though it had never been done; soinaccessible was any complete account of human thinking to an ordinary man whowanted to get his mind into proper working condition. And this was not that Ihad missed some recondite, precious refinements of philosophy; it was that myfundamental thinking, at the very root of my political and social conduct, waswrong. I was in a human community, and that community, and I with it, wasthinking of phantoms and fantasies as though they were real and living things,was in a reverie of unrealities, was blind, slovenly, hypnotized, base andineffective, blundering about in an extremely beautiful and an extremelydangerous world.I set myself to re-educate myself, and after the practice of writers wrote it invarious trial pamphlets, essays, and books. There is no need to refer to thesebooks here. The gist of the matter is set out in three compilations, to which Ishall refer again almost immediately. They are The Outline of History (Ch. XXI,§ 6, and Ch. XXXIII, § 6), The Science of Life (Book VIII, on Thought andBehaviour) and The Work, Wealth, and Happiness of Mankind (Ch. II, § § 1-4). Inthe last, it is shown quite plainly how man has had to struggle for the masteryof his mind, has discovered only after great controversies the proper andeffective use of his intellectual tools, and has had to learn to avoid certainwidespread traps and pitfalls before he could achieve his present mastery overmatter. Thinking clearly and effectively does not come by nature. Hunting thetruth is an art. We blunder naturally into a thousand misleading generalizationsand false processes. Yet there is hardly any intelligent mental training done inthe schools of the world to-day. We have to learn this art, if we are topractise it at all. Our schoolteachers have had no proper training themselves,they miseducate by example and precept, and so it is that our press and currentdiscussions are more like an impromptu riot of crippled and deaf and blind mindsthan an intelligent interchange of ideas. What bosh one reads! What rash andimpudent assumptions! What imbecile inferences!But re-educating oneself, getting one's mind into health and exercising it andtraining it to think properly, is only the beginning of the task before theawakening Open Conspirator. He has not only to think clearly, but he has to seethat his mind is equipped with the proper general ideas to form a true frameworkfor his everyday judgments and decisions.It was the Great War first brought home to me how ignorant I was, and howill-finished and untidy my mind, about the most important things of life. Thatdisastrous waste of life, material and happiness, since it was practically worldwide, was manifestly the outcome of the processes that constitute the bulk ofhistory, and yet I found I did not know—and nobody else seemed to know—historyin such a fashion as to be able to explain how the Great War came about or whatought to come out of it. \"Versailles,\" we all seem to be agreed nowadays, wassilly, but how could Versailles be anything else than what it was in view of theimperfect, lopsided, historical knowledge and the consequent suspicion, emotion,and prejudice of those who assembled there. They did not know any better thanthe rest of us what the war was, and so how could they know what the peace oughtto be? I perceived that I was in the same case with everyone else, and I setmyself first of all for my own guidance to make a summary if all history and getsome sort of map to more serviceable conclusions about the political state ofmankind. This summary I made was The Outline of History, a shameless compilationand arrangement of the main facts of the world story, written without a touch ofart or elegance, written indeed in a considerable hurry and excitement, and itssale, which is now in the third million, showed how much I had in common with agreat dispersed crowd of ordinary people, all wanting to know, all disgustedwith the patriotic, litigious twaddling gossipy stuff given them as history bytheir schoolmasters and schoolmistresses which had led them into the disaster ofthe war.The Outline of History is not a whole history of life. Its main theme is thegrowth of human intercommunication and human communities and their rulers andconflicts, the story of how and why the myriads of little tribal systems of tenthousand years ago have fought and coalesced into the sixty- or seventy-oddgovernments of to-day and are now straining and labouring in the grip of forcesthat must presently accomplish their final unison. And even as I completed TheOutline, I realized that there remained outside its scope wider and morefundamental, and closer, more immediate fields of knowledge which I still had toget in order for my own practical ends and the ends of like-minded people whowanted to use their lives effectively, if my existence was to escape futility.I realized that I did not know enough about the life in my body and itsrelations to the world of life and matter outside it to come to proper decisionsabout a number of urgent matters—from race conflicts, birth control, and myprivate life, to the public control of health and the conservation of naturalresources. And also, I found, I was astonishingly ignorant about the everydaybusiness of life, the how and why of the miner who provided the coal to cook mydinner, and the banker who took my money in return for a cheque-book, and theshopkeeper from whom I bought things, and the policeman who kept the streets inorder for me. Yet I was voting for laws affecting my relations with thesepeople, paying them directly or indirectly, airing my ignorant opinions aboutthem, and generally contributing by my behaviour to sustain and affect theirlives.So with the aid and direction of two very competent biologists I set to work toget out as plain and clear a statement as possible of what was known about thesources and nature of life and the relation of species to individuals and toother species, and the processes of consciousness and thought. This I publishedas The Science of Life. And while this was going on I set myself to the task ofmaking a review of all human activities in relation to each other, the work ofpeople and the needs of people, cultivation, manufacture, trade, direction,government, and all. This was the most difficult part of this attempt to get arational account of the modern world, and it called for the help and counsel ofa great variety of people. I had to ask and find some general answer to thequestion, \"What are the nineteen hundred-odd million human beings who are aliveto-day doing, and how and why are they doing it?\" It was, in fact, an outline ofeconomic, social, and political science, but since, after The Outline ofHistory, the word \"outline\" has been a good deal cheapened by variousenterprising publishers, I have called it, The Work, Wealth, and Happiness ofMankind.Now, I find, by getting these three correlated compilations into existence, Ihave at last, in however rough a fashion, brought together a complete system ofideas upon which an Open Conspirator can go. Before anyone could hope to get onto anything like a practical working directive answer to \"What are we to do withour lives?\" it was necessary to know what our lives were—The Science of Life;what had led up to their present pattern—The Outline of History; and this thirdbook, to tell what we were actually doing and supposed to be doing with ourworking lives, day by day, at the present time. By the time I was through withthese books I felt I had really something sound and comprehensive to go upon, an\"ideology,\" as people say, on which it was possible to think of building a newworld without fundamental surprises, and, moreover, that I had got my mindstripped down and cleaned of many illusions and bad habits, so that it couldhandle life with an assurance it had never known before.There is nothing marvellous about these compilations of mine. Any steady writerof average intelligence with the same will and the same resources, who coulddevote about nine or ten years to the task and get the Proper sort of help,could have made them. It can be done, it is no doubt being done, all over againby other people, for themselves and perhaps for others, much more beautifullyand adequately. But to get that amount of vision and knowledge, to achieve thatgeneral arrangement and understanding, was a necessary condition that had to besatisfied before any answer to the question, \"What are we to do with our lives?\"could even be attempted, and before one could become in any effective way anOpen Conspirator.There is nothing indispensable even now, I repeat, about these three particularbooks. I know about them and refer to them because I put them together myselfand so they are handy for me to explain myself. But most of what they containcan be extracted from any good encyclopædia. Any number of people have madesimilar outlines of history for themselves, have read widely, grasped theleading principles of biology and grappled with the current literature ofbusiness science and do not in the least need my particular summary. So far ashistory and biology are concerned there are parallel books, that are as good andserviceable. Van Loon's books for example. Yet even for highly-educated peoplethese summaries may be useful in bringing things known with different degrees ofthoroughness, into a general scheme. They correlate, and they fill up gaps.Between them they cover the ground; and in some fashion that ground has to becovered before the mind of a modern citizen is prepared to tackle the problemsthat confront it. Otherwise he is an incapable citizen, he does not know wherehe is and where the world is, and if he is rich or influential he may be a verydangerous citizen indeed. Presently there will be far better compilations tomeet this need, or perhaps the gist of all the three divisions of knowledge,concentrated and made more lucid and attractive, may be available as theintellectual frame of modern education throughout the world, as a \"GeneralAccount of Life\" that should be given to everyone.But certainly no one can possibly set about living properly and satisfactorilyunless he knows what he is, where he is, and how he stands to the people andthings about him."},{"pageContent":"IV. — THE REVOLUTION IN EDUCATIONSOME sort of reckoning therefore between people awakened to the new world thatdawns about us and the schools, colleges, and machinery of formal education isoverdue. As a body the educated are getting nothing like that Account of Lifewhich is needed to direct our conduct in this modern world.It is the crowning absurdity in the world to-day that these institutions shouldgo through a solemn parade of preparing the new generation for life and thatthen, afterwards, a minority of their victims, finding this preparation has leftthem almost totally unprepared, should have of their own accord to struggle outof our world heap of starved and distorted minds to some sort of real education.The world cannot be run by such a minority of escaped and re-educated mindsalone, with all the rest of the heap against them. Our necessities demand theintelligence and services of everyone who can be trained to give them. The newworld demands new schools, therefore, to give everyone a sound and thoroughmental training and equip everyone with clear ideas about history, about life,and about political and economic relationships instead of the rubbishyhead-content at present prevalent. The old-world teachers and schools have to bereformed or replaced. A vigorous educational reform movement arises as a naturaland necessary expression of the awakening Open Conspirator. A revolution ineducation is the most imperative and fundamental part of the adaptation of lifeto its new conditions.These various compendia of knowledge constituting a Modern Account of Life, onwhich we have laid stress in the previous section, these supplements toteaching, which are now produced and read outside the established formaleducational world and in the teeth of its manifest hostility) arise because ofthe backwardness of that world, and as that world yields slowly but surely tothe pressure of the new spirit, so they will permeate and replace its text-booksand disappear as a separate class of book. The education these new dangeroustimes in which we are now living demands, must start right, from the beginningand there must be nothing to replace and nothing to relearn in it. Before we cantalk politics, finance, business, or morals, we must see that we have got theright mental habits and the right foundation of realized facts. There is nothingmuch to be done with our lives until we have seen to that."},{"pageContent":"V. — RELIGION IN THE NEW WORLD\"YES,\" objects a reader, \"but does not our religion tell us what we are to dowith our lives?\"We have to bring religion, as its fundamental matter, into this discussion. Fromour present point of view, religion is that central essential part of educationwhich determines conduct. Religion certainly should tell us what to do with ourlives. But in the vast stir and occasions of modern life, so much of what wecall religion remains irrelevant or dumb. Religion does not seem to \"join on\" tothe main parts of the general problem of living. It has lost touch.Let us try and bring this problem of the Open Conspiracy to meet and make thenew world, into relation with the traditions of religion. The clear-minded OpenConspirator who has got his modern ideology, his lucidly arranged account of theuniverse in order, is obliged to believe that only by giving his life to thegreat processes of social reconstruction, and shaping his conduct with referenceto that, can he do well with his life. But that merely launches him into themost subtle and unending of struggles, the struggle against the incessantgravitation of our interests to ourselves. He has to live the broad life andescape from the close narrow life. We all try to attain the dignity andhappiness of magnanimity and escape from the tormenting urgencies of personaldesire. In the past that struggle has generally assumed the form of a religiousstruggle. Religion is the antagonist of self.In their completeness, in the life that was professionally religious, religionshave always demanded great subordinations of self. Therein lay their creativeforce. They demanded devotion and gave reasons for that demand. Theydisentangled the will from the egotistical preoccupations, often verycompletely. There is no such thing as a self-contained religion, a privatereligious solo. Certain forms of Protestantism and some mystical types come nearto making religion secluded duet between the individual and his divinity, buthere that may be regarded as a perversion of the religious impulse. Just as thenormal sexual complex excites and stirs the individual out of his egotism toserve the ends of the race, so the normal religious process takes the individualout of his egotism for the service of the community. It is not a bargain, a\"social contract,\" between the individual and the community; it is asubordination of both the existing individual and the existing community inrelation to something, a divinity, a divine order, a standard, a righteousness,more important than either. What is called in the phraseology of certainreligions \"conviction of sin\" and \"the flight from the City of Destruction\" arefamiliar instances of this reference of the self-centred individual and thecurrent social life to something far better than either the one or the other.This is the third element in the religious relationship, a hope, a promise, anobjective which turns the convert not only from himself but from the \"world,\" asit is, towards better things. First comes self disregard then service, and thenthis reconstructive creative urgency.For the finer sort of mind this aspect of religion seems always to have been itsprimary attraction. One has to remember that there is a real will for religionscattered throughout mankind—a real desire to get away from self. Religion hasnever pursued its distinctive votaries; they have come to meet it. The desire togive oneself to greater ends than the everyday life affords, and to give oneselffreely, is clearly dominant in that minority, and traceable in an incalculableproportion of the majority.But hitherto religion has never been presented simply as a devotion to auniversal cause. The devotion has always been in it, but it has been complicatedby other considerations. The leaders in every great religious movement haveconsidered it necessary that it should explain itself in the form of history anda cosmogony. It has been felt necessary to say Why? and To what end? Everyreligion therefore has had to adopt the physical conceptions, and usually alsoto assume many of the moral and social values, current at the time of itsformation. It could not transcend the philosophical phrases and attitudes thatseemed then to supply the natural frame for a faith, nor draw upon anythingbeyond the store of scientific knowledge of its time. In this lurked the seedsof the ultimate decay and supersession of every successive religion.But as the idea of continual change, going farther and farther from existingrealities and never returning to them, is a new one, as nobody until veryrecently has grasped the fact that the knowledge of today is the ignorance ofto-morrow, each fresh development of religion in the world so far has beenproclaimed in perfect good faith as the culminating and final truth.This finality of statement has considerable immediate practical value. Thesuggestion of the possibility of further restatement is an unsettlingsuggestion; it undermines conviction and breaks the ranks of the believers,because there are enormous variations in the capacities of men to recognize thesame spirit under a changing shape. These variations cause endless difficultiesto-day. While some intelligences can recognize the same God under a variety ofnames and symbols without any severe strain, others cannot even detect the mostcontrasted Gods one from the other provided they wear the same mask and title Itappears a perfectly natural and reasonable thing to many minds to restatereligion now in terms of biological and psychological necessity, while to othersany variation whatever in the phrasing of the faith seems to be nothing lessthan atheistical misrepresentations of the most damnable kind. For these latterGod a God still anthropomorphic enough to have a will and purpose to displaypreferences and reciprocate emotions, to be indeed in person, must be retaineduntil the end of time. For others, God can be thought of as a Great First Cause,as impersonal and inhuman as atomic structure.It is because of the historical and philosophical commitments they haveundertaken, and because of concessions made to common human weaknesses in regardto such once apparently minor but now vital moral issues as property, mentalactivity, and public veracity—rather than of any inadequacy in their adaptationto psychological needs—that the present wide discredit of organized religionshas come about. They no longer seem even roughly truthful upon issues of fact,and they give no imperatives over large fields of conduct in which perplexity isprevalent. People will say, \"I could be perfectly happy leading the life of aCatholic devotee if only I could believe.\" But most of the framework ofreligious explanation upon which that life is sustained is too old-fashioned andtoo irrelevant to admit of that thoroughness of belief which is necessary forthe devotion of intelligent people.Great ingenuity has been shown by modern writers and thinkers in the adaptationof venerated religious expressions to new ideas. Peccavi. [Usu. translated 'Ihave sinned'—RW] Have I not written of the creative will in humanity as \"God theInvisible King\" and presented it in the figure of a youthful and adventurousfinite god?The word \"God\" is in most minds so associated with the concept of religion thatit is abandoned only with the greatest reluctance. The word remains, though theidea is continually attenuated. Respect for Him demands that He should have nolimitations. He is pushed farther and farther from actuality, therefore, and Hisdefinition becomes increasingly a bundle of negations, until at last, in Hisrôle of The Absolute, He becomes an entirely negative expression. While we canspeak of good, say some, can speak of God. God is the possibility of goodness,the good side of things. If phrases in which the name of God is used are to beabandoned, they argue, religion will be left speechless before many occasions.Certainly there is something beyond the individual that is and the world thatis; on that we have already insisted as a characteristic of all religions; thatpersuasion is the essence of faith and the key to courage. But whether that isto be considered, even after the most strenuous exercises in personification, asa greater person or a comprehensive person, is another matter. Personality isthe last vestige of anthropomorphism. The modern urge to a precise veracity isagainst such concessions to traditional expression.On the other hand there is in many fine religious minds a desire amountingalmost to a necessity for an object of devotion so individualized as to becapable at least of a receptive consciousness even if no definite response isconceded. One type of mind can accept a reality in itself which another mustproject and dramatize before it can comprehend it and react to it. The humansoul is an intricate thing which will not endure elucidation when that passesbeyond a certain degree of harshness and roughness. The human spirit has learntlove, devotion, obedience and humility in relation to other personalities, andwith difficulty it takes the final step to a transcendent subordination, fromwhich the last shred of personality has stripped.In matters not immediately material, language has to work by metaphors, andthough every metaphor carries its own peculiar risks of confusion, we cannot dowithout them. Great intellectual tolerance is necessary, therefore --acultivated disposition --to translate and retranslate from one metaphysical oremotional idiom to another—if there is not to be a deplorable wastage of moralforce in our world. Just now I wrote Peccavi because I had written God theInvisible King, but after all I do not think it was so much a sin to use thatphrase, God the Invisible King, as an error in expression. If there is nosympathetic personal leader outside us, there is at least in us the attitude weshould adopt towards a sympathetic personal leader.Three profound differences between the new mental dispositions of the presenttime and those of preceding ages have to be realized if current developments ofthe religious impulse are to be seen in their correct relationship to thereligious life of the past. There has been a great advance in the analysis ofpsychic processes and the courage with which men have probed into the origins ofhuman thought and feeling. Following upon the biological advances that have madeus recognize fish and amphibian in the bodily structure of man, have come theseparallel developments in which we see elemental fear and lust and self-lovemoulded, modified, and exalted, under the stress of social progress, intointricate human motives. Our conception of sin and our treatment of sin havebeen profoundly modified by this analysis. Our former sins are seen asignorances, inadequacies and bad habits, and the moral conflict is robbed ofthree-fourths of its ego-centred melodramatic quality. We are no longer moved tobe less wicked; we are moved to organize our conditioned reflexes and lead alife less fragmentary and silly.Secondly, the conception of individuality has been influenced and relaxed bybiological thought, so that we do not think so readily of the individual contramundum as our fathers did. We begin to realize that we are egotists bymisapprehension. Nature cheats the self to serve the purposes of the species byfilling it with wants that war against its private interests. As our eyes areopened to these things, we see ourselves as beings greater or less than thedefinitive self. Man's soul is no longer his own. It is, he discovers, part of agreater being which lived before he was born and will survive him. The idea of asurvival of the definite individual with all the accidents and idiosyncrasies ofhis temporal nature upon him dissolves to nothing in this new view ofimmortality.The third of the main contrasts between modern and former thought which haverendered the general shapes of established religion old-fashioned andunserviceable is a reorientation of current ideas about time. The powerfuldisposition of the human mind to explain everything as the inevitable unfoldingof a past event which, so to speak, sweeps the future helplessly before it, hasbeen checked by a mass of subtle criticisms. The conception of progress as abroadening and increasing purpose, a conception which is taking hold of thehuman imagination more and more firmly, turns religious life towards the future.We think no longer of submission to the irrevocable decrees of absolutedominion, but of participation in an adventure on behalf of a power that gainsstrength and establishes itself. The history of our world, which has beenunfolded to us by science, runs counter to all the histories on which religionshave been based. There was no Creation in the past, we begin to realize, buteternally there is creation; there was no Fall to account for the conflict ofgood and evil, but a stormy ascent. Life as we know it is a mere beginning.It seems unavoidable that if religion is to develop unifying and directive powerin the present confusion of human affairs it must adapt itself to thisforward-looking, individuality-analyzing turn of mind; it must divest itself ofits sacred histories, its gross preoccupations, its posthumous prolongation ofpersonal ends. The desire for service, for subordination, for permanent effect,for an escape from the distressful pettiness and mortality of the individuallife, is the undying element in every religious system.The time has come to strip religion right down to that, to strip it for greatertasks than it has ever faced before. The histories and symbols that served ourfathers encumber and divide us. Sacraments and rituals harbour disputes andwaste our scanty emotions. The explanation of why things are is an unnecessaryeffort in religion. The essential fact in religion is the desire for religionand not how it came about. If you do not want religion, no persuasions, noconvictions about your place in the universe can give it to you. The firstsentence in the modern creed must be, not \"I believe,\" but \"I give myself.\"To what? And how? To these questions we will now address ourselves."},{"pageContent":"VI. — MODERN RELIGION IS OBJECTIVETo give oneself religiously is a continuing operation expressed in a series ofacts. It can be nothing else. You cannot dedicate yourself and then go away tolive just as you have lived before. It is a poor travesty of religion that doesnot produce an essential change in the life which embraces it. But in theestablished and older religions of our race, this change of conduct has involvedmuch self-abasement merely to the God or Gods, or much self-mortification merelywith a view to the moral perfecting of self. Christian devotion, for example, inthese early stages, before the hermit life gave place to organized monasticlife, did not to any extent direct itself to service except the spiritualservice of other human beings. But as Christianity became a definite socialorganizing force, it took on a great series of healing, comforting, helping, andeducational activities.The modern tendency has been and is all in the direction of minimizing what onemight call self-centred devotion and self-subjugation, and of expanding anddeveloping external service. The idea of inner perfectibility dwindles with thediminishing importance attached to individuality. We cease to think ofmortifying or exalting or perfecting ourselves and seek to lose ourselves in agreater life. We think less and less of \"conquering\" self and more and more ofescaping from self. If we attempt to perfect ourselves in any respect it is onlyas a soldier sharpens and polishes an essential weapon.Our quickened apprehension of continuing change, our broader and fuller visionof the history of life, disabuse our minds of many limitations set to theimaginations of our predecessors. Much that they saw as fixed and determinate,we see as transitory and controllable. They saw life fixed in its species andsubjected to irrevocable laws. We see life struggling insecurely but with agathering successfulness for freedom and power against restriction and death. Wesee life coming at last to our tragic and hopeful human level. Unprecedentedpossibilities, mighty problems, we realize, confront mankind to-day. They frameour existences. The practical aspect, the material form, the embodiment of themodernized religious impulse is the direction of the whole life to the solutionof these problems and the realization of their possibilities. The alternativebefore man now is either magnificence of spirit and magnificence of achievement,or disaster.The modern religious life, like all forms of religious life, must needs have itsown subtle and deep inner activities, its meditations, its self- confrontations,its phases of stress and search and appeal, its serene and prayerful moods, butthese inward aspects do not come into the scope of this present inquiry, whichis concerned entirely with the outward shape, the direction, and theorganization of modern religious effort, with the question of what, givenreligious devotion, we have to do and how that has to be done.Now, in the new and greater universe to which we are awakening, its immensepossibilities furnish an entirely new frame and setting for the moral life. Inthe fixed and limited outlook of the past, practical good works took the formmainly of palliative measures against evils that were conceived of as incurable;the religious community nursed the sick, fed the hungry, provided sanctuary forthe fugitive, pleaded with the powerful for mercy. It did not dream ofpreventing sickness, famine, or tyranny. Other-worldliness was its ready refugefrom the invincible evil and confusion of the existing scheme of things.But it is possible now to imagine an order in human affairs from which theseevils have been largely or entirely eliminated. More and more people are comingto realize that such an order is a material possibility. And with therealization that this is a material possibility, we can no longer be contentwith a field of \"good deeds\" and right action restricted to palliative andconsolatory activities. Such things are merely \"first aid.\" The religious mindgrows bolder than it has ever been before. It pushes through the curtain it onceimagined was a barrier. It apprehends its larger obligations. The way in whichour activities conduce to the realization of that conceivable better order inhuman affairs, becomes the new criterion of conduct. Other-worldliness hasbecome unnecessary.The realization of this possible better order brings us at once to certaindefinite lines of conduct. We have to make an end to war, and to make an end towar we must be cosmopolitan in our politics. It is impossible for anyclear-headed person to suppose that the ever more destructive stupidities of warcan be eliminated from human affairs until some common political controldominates the earth, and unless certain pressures due to the growth ofpopulation, due to the enlarging scope of economic operations or due toconflicting standards and traditions of life, are disposed of.To avoid the positive evils of war and to attain the new levels of prosperityand power that now come into view, an effective world control, not merely ofarmed force, but of the production and main movements of staple commodities andthe drift and expansion of population is required. It is absurd to dream ofpeace and world-wide progress without that much control. These things assuredthe abilities and energies of a greatly increased proportion of human beingscould be diverted to the happy activities of scientific research and creativework, with an ever-increasing release and enlargement of human possibility. Onthe political side it is plain that our lives must be given to the advancementof that union.Such a forward stride in human life, the first stride in a mighty continuingadvance, an advance to which no limit appears, is now not simply materiallypossible. It is urgent. The opportunity is plain before mankind. It is thealternative to social decay. But there is no certainty, no material necessity,that it should ever be taken. It will not be taken by mankind inadvertently. Itcan only be taken through such an organization of will and energy to take it asthis world has never seen before.These are the new imperatives that unfold themselves before the more alert mindsof our generation. They will presently become the general mental background, asthe modern interpretations of the history of life and of the material and mentalpossibilities about us establish themselves. Evil political, social, andeconomic usages and arrangements may seem obdurate and huge, but they areneither permanent nor uncontrollable. They can be controlled, however, only byan effort more powerful and determined than the instincts and inertias thatsustain them. Religion, modern and disillusioned, has for its outward task toset itself to the control and direction of political, social, and economic life.If it does not do that, then it is no more than a drug for easing discomfort,\"the opium of the peoples.\"Can religion, or can it not, synthesize the needed effort to lift mankind out ofour present disorders, dangers, baseness, frustrations, and futilities to aphase of relative security, accumulating knowledge, systematic and continuinggrowth in power and the widespread, deep happiness of hopeful and increasinglife?Our answer here is that the religious spirit, in the light of modern knowledge,can do this thing, and our subject now is to enquire what are the necessaryopening stages in the synthesis of that effort. We write, from this pointonward, for those who believe that it can, and who do already grasp theimplications of world history and contemporary scientific achievement."},{"pageContent":"VII. — WHAT MANKIND HAS TO DOBEFORE we can consider the forms and methods of attacking this inevitable taskof reconstruction it will be well to draw the main lines and to attempt somemeasure of the magnitude of that task. What are the new forms that it is thusproposed to impose upon human life, and how are they to be evolved from orimposed upon the current forms? And against what passive and active resistanceshas this to be done?There can be no pause for replacement in the affairs of life. Day must followday, and the common activities continue. The new world as a going concern mustarise out of the old as a going concern.Now the most comprehensive conception of this new world is of one politically,socially, and economically unified. Within that frame fall all the other ideasof our progressive ambition. To this end we set our faces and seek to direct ourlives. Many there are at present who apprehend it as a possibility but do notdare, it seems, to desire it, because of the enormous difficulties thatintervene, and because they see as yet no intimations of a way through or roundthese difficulties. They do not see a way of escape from the patchwork ofgovernments that grips them and divides mankind. The great majority of humanbeings have still to see the human adventure as one whole; they are obsessed bythe air of permanence and finality in established things; they accept currentreality as ultimate reality. As the saying goes, they take the world as theyfind it.But here we are writing for the modern-minded, and for them it is impossible tothink of the world as secure and satisfactory until there exists a single worldcommonweal, preventing war and controlling those moral, biological, and economicforces and wastages that would otherwise lead to wars. And controlling them inthe sense that science and man's realization and control of his powers andpossibilities continually increase.Let us make clear what sort of government we are trying to substitute for thepatchwork of to-day. It will be a new sort of direction with a new psychology.The method of direction of such a world commonweal is not likely to imitate themethods of existing sovereign states. It will be something new and altogetherdifferent.This point is not yet generally realized. It is too often assumed that the worldcommonweal will be, as it were, just the one heir and survivor of existingstates, and that it will be a sort of megatherium of the same form and anatomyas its predecessors.But a little reflection will show that this is a mistake. Existing states areprimarily militant states, and a world state cannot be militant. There will belittle need for president or king to lead the marshalled hosts of humanity, forwhere there is no war there is no need of any leader to lead hosts anywhere, andin a polyglot world a parliament of mankind or any sort of council that meetsand talks is an inconceivable instrument of government. The voice will cease tobe a suitable vehicle. World government, like scientific process, will beconducted by statement, criticism, and publication that will be capable ofefficient translation.The fundamental organization of contemporary states is plainly still military,and that is exactly what a world organization cannot be. Flags, uniforms,national anthems, patriotism sedulously cultivated in church and school, thebrag, blare, and bluster of our competing sovereignties, belong to the phase ofdevelopment the Open Conspiracy will supersede. We have to get clear of thatclutter. The reasonable desire of all of us is that we should have thecollective affairs of the world managed by suitably equipped groups of the mostinterested, intelligent, and devoted people, and that their activities should besubjected to a free, open, watchful criticism, restrained from making spasmodicinterruptions but powerful enough to modify or supersede without haste or delaywhatever is weakening or unsatisfactory in the general direction.A number of readers will be disposed to say that this is a very vague,undefined, and complicated conception of world government. But indeed it is asimplification. Not only are the present governments of the world a fragmentarycompetitive confusion, but none of them is as simple as it appears. They seem tobe simple because they have formal heads and definite forms, councils, votingassemblies, and so forth, for arriving at decisions. But the formal heads, thekings, presidents, and so forth, are really not the directive heads. They aremerely the figure heads. They do not decide. They merely make gestures of potentand dignified acquiescence when decisions are put to them. They are complicatingshams. Nor do the councils and assemblies really decide. They record, often veryimperfectly and exasperatingly, the accumulating purpose of outer forces. Theseouter really directive forces are no doubt very intricate in their operation;they depend finally on religious and educational forms and upon waves ofgregarious feeling, but it does not in the least simplify the process ofcollective human activity to pretend that it is simple and to set up symbols anddummies in the guise of rulers and dictators to embody that pretence. Torecognize the incurable intricacy of collective action is a mentalsimplification; to remain satisfied with the pretensions of existinggovernmental institutions, and to bring in all the problems of their procedureand interaction is to complicate the question.The present rudimentary development of collective psychology obliges us to bevague and provisional about the way in which the collective mind may best defineits will for the purpose of administrative action. We may know that a thing ispossible and still be unable to do it as yet, just as we knew that aviation waspossible in 1900. Some method of decision there must certainly be and a definiteadministrative machinery. But it may turn out to be a much slighter, lesselaborate organization than a consideration of existing methods might lead us toimagine. It may never become one single interlocking administrative system. Wemay have systems of world control rather than a single world state. Thepractical regulations, enforcements, and officials needed to keep the world ingood health, for example may be only very loosely related to the system ofcontrols that will maintain its communications in a state of efficiency.Enforcement and legal decisions, as we know them now, may be found to beenormously and needlessly cumbrous by our descendants. As the reasonableness ofa thing is made plain, the need for its enforcement is diminished, and thenecessity for litigation disappears.The Open Conspiracy, the world movement for the supercession or enlargement orfusion of existing political, economic, and social institutions mustnecessarily, as it grows, draw closer and closer to questions of practicalcontrol. It is likely in its growth to incorporate many active public servantsand many industrial and financial leaders and directors. It may assimilate greatmasses of intelligent workers. As its activities spread it will work out a wholesystem of special methods of co-operation. As it grows, and by growing, it willlearn the business of general direction and how to develop its criticalfunction. A lucid, dispassionate, and immanent criticism is the primarynecessity, the living spirit of a world civilization. The Open Conspiracy isessentially such a criticism, and the carrying out of such a criticism intoworking reality is the task of the Open Conspiracy. It will by its very naturebe aiming not so much to set up a world direction, as to become itself a worlddirection, and the educational and militant forms of its opening phase willevoke, step by step, as experience is gained and power and responsibilityacquired, forms of administration and research and correlation.The differences in nature and function between the world controls of the futureand the state governments of the present age which we have just pointed outfavours a hope that the Open Conspiracy may come to its own in many cases ratherby the fading out of these state governments through the inhibition andparalysis of their destructive militant and competitive activities than by adirect conflict to overthrow them. As new world controls develop, it becomes thesupreme business of the Open Conspiracy to keep them world wide and impartial,to save them by an incessant critical educational and propagandist activity fromentanglement with the old traditional rivalries and feuds of states and nations.It is quite possible that such world controls should be able to developindependently, but it is highly probable, on the other hand, that they willcontinue to be entangled as they are to-day, and that they will need to bedisengaged with a struggle. We repeat, the new directive organizations of men'saffairs will not be of the same nature as old-fashioned governments. They willbe in their nature biological, financial, and generally economic, and the oldgovernments were primarily nothing of the sort. Their directive force will be(1) an effective criticism having the quality of science, and (2) the growingwill in men to have things right. The directive force of the older governmentswas the uncriticized fantasies and wilfulness of an individual, a class, atribe, or a majority.The modernization of the religious impulse leads us straight to this effort forthe establishment of the world state as a duty, and the close consideration ofthe necessary organization of that effort will bring the reader to theconclusion that a movement aiming at the establishment of a world directorate,however restricted that movement may be at first in numbers and power, musteither contemplate the prospect of itself developing into a world directorate,and by the digestion and assimilation of superseded factors into an entiremodern world community, or admit from the outset the futility, the spare-timeamateurishness, of its gestures."},{"pageContent":"VIII. — BROAD CHARACTERISTICS OF A SCIENTIFIC WORLD COMMONWEALCONTINUING our examination of the practical task before the modern mind, we maynext note the main lines of contemporary aspiration within this comprehensiveoutline of a world commonweal. Any sort of unification of human affairs will notserve the ends we seek. We aim at a particular sort of unification; a worldCaesar is hardly better from the progressive viewpoint than world chaos; theunity we seek must mean a world-wide liberation of thought, experiment andcreative effort.A successful Open Conspiracy merely to seize governments and wield and retainworld power would be at best only the empty frame of success. It might be theexact reverse of success. Release from the threat of war and from the waste ofinternational economic conflicts is a poor release if it demands as its pricethe loss of all other liberties.It is because we desire a unification of human direction, not simply for thesake of unity, but as a means of release to happiness and power, that it isnecessary, at any cost—in delay, in loss of effective force, in strategic ortactical disadvantage—that the light of free, abundant criticism should playupon that direction and upon the movements and unifying organizations leading tothe establishment of that unifying direction.Man is an imperfect animal and never quite trustworthy in the dark. Neithermorally nor intellectually is he safe from lapses. Most of us who are past ourfirst youth know how little we can trust ourselves and glad to have ouractivities checked and guarded by a sense of helpful inspection. It is for thisreason that a movement to realize the conceivable better state of the world mustdeny itself the advantages of secret methods and tactical insincerities. It mustleave that to its adversaries. We must declare our end plainly from the outsetand risk no misunderstandings of our procedure.The Open Conspiracy against the traditional and now cramping and dangerousinstitutions of the world must be an Open Conspiracy and cannot remain righteousotherwise. It is lost if it goes underground. Every step to world unity must betaken in the daylight with the understanding sympathy of as many people aspossible, or the sort of unity that will be won will be found to be scarcelyworth the winning. The essential task would have to be recommenced again withinthe mere frame of unity thus attained.This candid attempt to take possession of the whole world, this Open Conspiracyof ours, must be made in the name of and for the sake of science and creativeactivity. Its aim is to release science and creative activity and every stage inthe struggle must be watched and criticized, lest there be any sacrifice ofthese ends to the exigencies of conflict.The security of creative progress and creative activity implies a competentregulation of the economic life in the collective interest. There must be food,shelter and leisure for all. The fundamental needs of the animal life must beassured before human life can have free play. Man does not live by bread alone;he eats that he may learn and adventure creatively, but unless he eats he cannotadventure. His life is primarily economic, as a house is primarily a foundation,and economic justice and efficiency must underlie all other activities; but tojudge human society and organize political and social activities entirely oneconomic grounds is to forget the objectives of life's campaign in apreoccupation with supply.It is true that man, like the animal world in general from which he has risen,is the creature of a struggle for sustenance, but unlike the animals, man canresort to methods of escape from that competitive pressure upon the means ofsubsistence, which has been the lot of every other animal species. He canrestrain the increase in his numbers, and he seems capable of still quiteundefined expansions of his productivity per head of population. He can escapetherefore from the struggle for subsistence altogether with a surplus of energysuch as no other kind of animal species has ever possessed. Intelligent controlof population is a possibility which puts man outside competitive processes thathave hitherto ruled the modification of species, and he can be released fromthese processes in no other way.There is a clear hope that, later, directed breeding will come within his scope,but that goes beyond his present range of practical achievement, and we need notdiscuss it further here. Suffice it for us here that the world community of ourdesires, the organized world community conducting and ensuring its own progress,requires a deliberate collective control of population as a primary condition.There is no strong instinctive desire for multitudinous offspring, as such, inthe feminine make-up. The reproductive impulses operate indirectly. Natureensures a pressure of population through passions and instincts that, givensufficient knowledge, intelligence, and freedom on the part of women, can besatisfactorily gratified and tranquillized, if need be, without the productionof numerous children. Very slight adjustments in social and economicarrangements will, in a world of clear available knowledge and straightforwardpractice in these matters, supply sufficient inducement or discouragement toaffect the general birth rate or the birth rate of specific types as thedirective sense of the community may consider desirable. So long as the majorityof human beings are begotten involuntarily in lust and ignorance so long doesman remain like any other animal under the moulding pressure of competition forsubsistence. Social and political processes change entirely in their characterwhen we recognize the possibility and practicability of this fundamentalrevolution in human biology.In a world so relieved, the production of staple necessities presents a seriesof problems altogether less distressful than those of the present scramble forpossessions and self-indulgence on the part of the successful, and for work anda bare living on the part of the masses. With the increase of populationunrestrained, there was, as the end of the economic process, no practicalalternative to a multitudinous equality at the level of bare subsistence, exceptthrough such an inequality of economic arrangements as allowed a minority tomaintain a higher standard of life by withholding whatever surplus of productionit could grasp, from consumption in mere proletarian breeding. In the past andat present, what is called the capitalist system, that is to say theunsystematic exploitation of production by private owners under the protectionof the law, has, on the whole, in spite of much waste and conflict, workedbeneficially by checking that gravitation to a universal low-grade consumptionwhich would have been the inevitable outcome of a socialism oblivious ofbiological processes. With effective restraint upon the increase of population,however, entirely new possibilities open out before mankind.The besetting vice of economic science, orthodox and unorthodox alike, has beenthe vice of beginning in the air, with current practice and current convictions,with questions of wages, prices, values, and possession, when the profounderissues of human association are really not to be found at all on these levels.The primary issues of human association are biological and psychological, andthe essentials of economics are problems in applied physics and chemistry. Thefirst thing we should examine is what we want to do with natural resources, andthe next, how to get men to do what has to be done as pleasurably andeffectively as possible. Then we should have a standard by which to judge themethods of to-day.But the academic economists, and still more so Marx and his followers, refuse todeal with these fundamentals, and, with a stupid pose of sound practical wisdom,insist on opening up their case with an uncritical acceptance of the commonantagonism of employers and employed and a long rigmarole about profits andwages. Ownership and expropriated labour are only one set of many possible setsof economic method.The economists, however, will attend seriously only to the current set; the restthey ignore; and the Marxists, with their uncontrollable disposition to usenicknames in the place of judgments, condemn all others as \"Utopian\"—a word asfinal in its dismissal from the minds of the elect as that other pet counter inthe Communist substitute for thought, \"Bourgeois.\" If they can persuadethemselves that an idea or a statement is \"Utopian\" or \"Bourgeois,\" it does notseem to matter in the least to them whether it is right or wrong. It is disposedof. Just as in genteeler circles anything is disposed of that can be labelled\"atheistical\", \"subversive\" or \"disloyal.\"If a century and a half ago the world had submitted its problems of transport tothe economists, they would have put aside, with as little wasted breath and inkas possible, all talk about railways, motorcars, steamships, and aeroplanes,and, with a fine sense of extravagance rebuked, set themselves to long neuralgicdissertations, disputations, and treatises upon highroads and the methods ofconnecting them, turnpike gates, canals, influence of lock fees on bargemen,tidal landing places, anchorages, surplus carrying capacity, carriers, caravans,hand-barrows, and the pedestrianariat. There would have been a rapid and easydifferentiation in feeling and requirements between the horse-owning minorityand the walking majority; the wrongs of the latter would have tortured the mindof every philosopher who could not ride, and been minimized by every philosopherwho could; and there would have been a broad rift between the narrow-footpathschool, the no-footpath school, and the school which would look forward to atime when every horse would have to be led along one universal footpath underthe dictatorship of the pedestrianariat. All with the profoundest gravity anddignity. These things, footpaths and roads and canals with their traffic, were\"real,\" and \"Utopian\" projects for getting along at thirty or forty miles anhour or more uphill and against wind and tide, let alone the still moreincredible suggestion of air transport, would have been smiled and sneered outof court. Life went about on its with a certain assistance from wheels, orfloated, rowed and was blown about on water; so it had been—and so it wouldalways be.The psychology of economic co-operation is still only dawning, and so theeconomists and the doctrinaire socialists have had the freest range for pedantryand authoritative pomp. For a hundred years they have argued and argued about\"rent,\" about \"surplus value,\" and so on, and have produced a literature tenthousand times as bulky, dreary, and foolish as the worst outpourings of themediaeval schoolmen.But as soon as this time-honoured preoccupation with the allotment of the sharesof originators, organizers, workers, owners of material, credit dealers, and taxcollectors in the total product, ceases to be dealt with as the primary questionin economics; as soon as we liberate our minds from a preoccupation which fromthe outset necessarily makes that science a squabble rather than a science, andbegin our attack upon the subject with a survey of the machinery and otherproductive material required in order that the staple needs of mankind should besatisfied, if we go on from that to consider the way in which all this materialand machinery can be worked and the product distributed with the least labourand the greatest possible satisfaction, we shift our treatment of economicquestions towards standards by which all current methods of exploitation,employment, and finance can be judged rather than wrangled over. We can dismissthe question of the claims of this sort of participant or that, for later andsubordinate consideration, and view each variety of human assistance in thegeneral effort entirely from the standpoint of what makes that assistance leastonerous and most effective.The germs of such really scientific economics exist already in the study ofindustrial organization and industrial psychology. As the science of industrialpsychology in particular develops, we shall find all this discussion ofownership, profit, wages, finance, and accumulation, which has been treatedhitherto as the primary issues of economics, falling into place under the largerenquiry of what conventions in these matters, what system of money and whatconceptions of property, yield the greatest stimulus and the least friction inthat world-wide system of co-operation which must constitute the generaleconomic basis to the activities of a unified mankind.Manifestly the supreme direction of the complex of human economic activities insuch a world must centre upon a bureau of information and advice, which willtake account of all the resources of the planet, estimate current needs,apportion productive activities and control distribution. The topographical andgeological surveys of modern civilized communities, their government maps, theirperiodic issue of agricultural and industrial statistics, are the first crudeand unco-ordinated beginnings of such an economic world intelligence. In thepropaganda work of David Lubin, a pioneer whom mankind must not forget, and inhis International Institute of Agriculture in Rome, there were the beginnings ofan impartial review month by month and year by year of world production, worldneeds and world transport. Such a great central organization of economic sciencewould necessarily produce direction; it would indicate what had best be donehere, there, and everywhere, solve general tangles, examine, approve andinitiate fresh methods and arrange the transitional process from old to new. Itwould not be an organization of will, imposing its will upon a reluctant orrecalcitrant race; it would be a direction, just as a map is a direction.A map imposes no will on anyone, breaks no one in to its \"policy.\" And yet weobey our maps.The will to have the map full, accurate, and up to date, and the determinationto have its indications respected, would have to pervade the whole community. Tonourish and sustain that will must be the task not of any particular social oreconomic division of the community, but of the whole body of right-minded peoplein that community. The organization and preservation of that power of will isthe primary undertaking, therefore, of a world revolution aiming at universalpeace, welfare and happy activity. And through that will it will produce as thecentral organ the brain of the modern community, a great encyclopædicorganization, kept constantly up to date and giving approximate estimates anddirections for all the material activities of mankind.The older and still prevalent conception of government is bullying, is thebreaking-in and subjugation of the \"subject,\" to the God, or king, or lords ofthe community. Will-bending, the overcoming of the recalcitrant junior andinferior, was an essential process in the establishment of primitive societies,and its tradition still rules our education and law. No doubt there must be anecessary accommodation of the normal human will to every form of society; noman is innately virtuous; but compulsion and restraint are the friction of thesocial machine and, other things being equal, the less compulsive socialarrangements are, the more willingly, naturally, and easily they are accepted,the less wasteful of moral effort and the happier that community will be. Theideal state, other things being equal, is the state with the fewest possiblenumber of will fights and will suppressions. This must be a primaryconsideration in arranging the economic, biological, and mental organization ofthe world community at which we aim.We have advanced the opinion that the control of population pressure ispracticable without any violent conflict with \"human nature,\" that given aproper atmosphere of knowledge and intention, there need be far less suppressionof will in relation to production than prevails to-day. In the same way, it ispossible that the general economic life of mankind may be made universallysatisfactory that there may be an abundance out of all comparison greater thanthe existing supply of things necessary for human well-being, freedom, andactivity, with not merely not more, but infinitely less subjugation andenslavement than now occurs. Man is still but half born out of the blindstruggle for existence, and his nature still partakes of the infinitewastefulness of his mother Nature. He has still to learn how to price thecommodities he covets in terms of human life. He is indeed only beginning torealize that there is anything to be learnt in that matter. He wastes will andhuman possibility extravagantly in his current economic methods.We know nowadays that the nineteenth century expended a great wealth ofintelligence upon a barren controversy between Individualism and Socialism. Theywere treated as mutually exclusive alternatives, instead of being questions ofdegree. Human society has been is and always must be an intricate system ofadjustments between unconditional liberty and the disciplines and subordinationsof co-operative enterprise. Affairs do not move simply from a more individualistto a more socialist state or vice versa; there may be a release of individualinitiative going on here and standardization or restraint increasing there.Personal property never can be socially guaranteed as the extremerindividualists desired, nor can it be \"abolished\" as the extremer socialistsproposed. Property is not robbery, as Proudhon asserted; it is the protection ofthings against promiscuous and mainly wasteful use. Property is not necessarilypersonal. In some cases property may restrict or forbid a use of things thatcould be generally advantageous, and it may be and is frequently unfair in itsassignment of initiative, but the remedy for that is not an abolition but arevision of property. In the concrete it is a form necessary for liberty ofaction upon material, while abstracted as money, which is a liquidatedgeneralized form of property; it is a ticket for individual liberty of movementand individual choice of reward.The economic history of mankind is a history of the operation of the idea ofproperty; it relates the conflict of the unlimited acquisitiveness of egoisticindividuals against the resentment of the disinherited and unsuccessful and thefar less effective consciousness of a general welfare. Money grew out of asystem of abstracting conventions and has been subjected to a great variety ofrestrictions, monopolizations, and regulations. It has never been an altogetherlogical device, and it has permitted the most extensive and complex developmentsof credit, debt, and dispossession. All these developments have brought withthem characteristic forms of misuse and corruption. The story is intricate, andthe tangle of relationships, of dependence, of pressure, of interception, ofmisdirected services, crippling embarrassments, and crushing obligations inwhich we live to-day admits of no such simple and general solutions as manyexponents of socialism, for example, seem to consider possible.But the thought and investigations of the past century or so have made it clearthat a classification of property, according to the nature of the rightsexercisable and according to the range of ownership involved, must be the basisof any system of social justice in the future.Certain things, the ocean, the air, rare wild animals, must be the collectiveproperty of all mankind and cannot be altogether safe until they are soregarded, and until some concrete body exists to exercise these proprietaryrights. Whatever collective control exists must protect these universalproperties, the sea from derelicts, the strange shy things of the wild fromextermination by the hunter and the foolish collector. The extinction of manybeautiful creatures is one of the penalties our world is paying for itssluggishness in developing a collective common rule. And there are many staplethings and general needs that now also demand a unified control in the commoninterest. The raw material of the earth should be for all, not to be monopolizedby any acquisitive individual or acquisitive sovereign state, and not to bewithheld from exploitation for the general benefit of any chance claims toterritorial priority of this or that backward or bargaining person or tribe.In the past, most of these universal concerns have had to be left to thecompetitive enterprise of profit-seeking individuals because there were as yetno collectivities organized to the pitch of ability needed to develop andcontrol these concerns, but surely nobody in his senses believes that the supplyand distribution of staple commodities about the earth by irresponsible personsand companies working entirely for monetary gain is the best possible methodfrom the point of view of the race as a whole. The land of the earth, allutilizable natural products, have fallen very largely under the rules and usagesof personal property because in the past that was the only recognized andpracticable form of administrative proprietorship. The development both ofextensive proprietary companies and of government departments with economicfunctions has been a matter of the last few centuries, the development, that isto say, of communal, more or less impersonal ownership, and it is only throughthese developments that the idea of organized collectivity of proprietorship hasbecome credible.Even in quite modern state enterprises there is a tendency to recall the rôle ofthe vigilant, jealous, and primitive personal proprietor in the fiction ofownership by His Majesty the King. In Great Britain, for example, Georgius Rexis still dimly supposed to hover over the Postmaster General of his Post Office,approve, disapprove, and call him to account. But the Postal Union of the worldwhich steers a registered letter from Chile to Norway or from Ireland to Pekinis almost completely divorced from the convention of an individual owner. Itworks; it is criticized without awe or malice. Except for the stealing andsteaming of letters practised by the political police of various countries, itworks fairly well. And the only force behind it to keep it working well is theconscious common sense of mankind.But when we have stipulated for the replacement of individual private ownershipby more highly organized forms of collective ownership, subject to freecriticism and responsible to the whole republic of mankind, in the generalcontrol of sea and land, in the getting, preparation, and distribution of stapleproducts and in transport, we have really named all the possible generalizationsof concrete ownership that the most socialistic of contemporaries will bedisposed to demand. And if we add to that the necessary maintenance of a moneysystem by a central world authority upon a basis that will make money keep faithwith the worker who earns it, and represent from first to last for him the valuein staple commodities he was given to understand it was to have, and if weconceive credit adequately controlled in the general interest by a socializedworld banking organization, we shall have defined the entire realm from whichindividual property and unrestricted individual enterprise have been excluded.Beyond that, the science of social psychology will probably assure us that thebest work will be done for the world by individuals free to exploit theirabilities as they wish. If the individual landowner or mineral-owner disappearsaltogether from the world, he will probably be replaced over large areas bytenants with considerable security of tenure, by householders and by licenseesunder collective proprietors. It will be the practice, the recognized bestcourse, to allow the cultivator to profit as fully as possible by his ownindividual productivity and to leave the householder to fashion his house andgarden after his own desire.Such in the very broadest terms is the character of the world commonweal towardswhich the modern imagination is moving, so far as its direction and economiclife are concerned. The organization of collective bodies capable of exercisingthese wider proprietorships, which cannot be properly used in the commoninterest by uncorrelated individual owners, is the positive practical problembefore the intelligent portion of mankind to-day. The nature of such collectivebodies is still a series of open questions, even upon such points as whetherthey will be elected bodies or groups deriving their authority from othersanctions. Their scope and methods of operation, their relations to one anotherand to the central bureau of intelligence, remain also to be defined. But beforewe conclude this essay we may be able to find precisions for at least thebeginning of such definition.Nineteenth-century socialism in its various forms, including the highlyindurated formulae of communism, has been a series of projects for theestablishment of such collective controls, for the most part very sketchyprojects from which the necessary factor of a sound psychological analysis wasalmost completely wanting. Primarily movements of protest and revolt against theblazing injustices arising out of the selfishly individualistic exploitation ofthe new and more productive technical and financial methods of the eighteenthand nineteenth centuries, they have been apt to go beyond the limits ofreasonable socialization in their demands and to minimize absurdly thedifficulties and dangers of collective control. Indignation and impatience weretheir ruling moods, and if they constructed little they exposed much. We arebetter able to measure the magnitude of the task before us because of theclearances and lessons achieved by these pioneer movements."},{"pageContent":"IX. — NO STABLE UTOPIA IS NOW CONCEIVABLETHIS unified world towards which the Open Conspiracy would direct its activitiescannot be pictured for the reader as any static and stereotyped spectacle ofhappiness. Indeed, one may doubt if such a thing as happiness is possiblewithout steadily changing conditions involving continually enlarging andexhilarating opportunities. Mankind, released from the pressure of population,the waste of warfare and the private monopolization of the sources of wealth,will face the universe with a great and increasing surplus of will and energy.Change and novelty will be the order of life; each day will differ from itspredecessor in its great amplitude of interest. Life which was once routine,endurance, and mischance will become adventure and discovery. It will no longerbe \"the old, old story.\"We have still barely emerged from among the animals in their struggle forexistence. We live only in the early dawn of human self-consciousness and in thefirst awakening of the spirit of mastery. We believe that the persistentexploration of our outward and inward worlds by scientific and artisticendeavour will lead to developments of power and activity upon which at presentwe can set no limits nor give any certain form.Our antagonists are confusion of mind, want of courage, want of curiosity andwant of imagination, indolence, and spendthrift egotism. These are the enemiesagainst which the Open Conspiracy arrays itself; these are the jailers of humanfreedom and achievement."},{"pageContent":"X. — THE OPEN CONSPIRACY IS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF AS A SINGLE ORGANIZATION; IT ISA CONCEPTION OF LIFE OUT OF WHICH EFFORTS, ORGANIZATIONS, AND NEW ORIENTATIONSWILL ARISETHIS open and declared intention of establishing a world order out of thepresent patchwork of particularist governments, of effacing the militaristconceptions that have hitherto given governments their typical form, and ofremoving credit and the broad fundamental processes of economic life out ofreach of private profit-seeking and individual monopolization, which is thesubstance of this Open Conspiracy to which the modern religious mind mustnecessarily address its practical activities, cannot fail to arouse enormousopposition. It is not a creative effort in a clear field; it is a creativeeffort that can hardly stir without attacking established things. It is therepudiation of drift, of \"leaving things alone.\" It criticizes everything inhuman life from the top to the bottom and finds everything not good enough. Itstrikes at the universal human desire to feel that things are \"all right.\"One might conclude, and it would be a hasty, unsound conclusion, that the onlypeople to whom we could look for sympathy and any passionate energy inforwarding the revolutionary change would be the unhappy, the discontented, thedispossessed, and the defeated in life's struggle. This idea lies at the root ofthe class-war dogmas of the Marxists, and it rests on an entirely crudeconception of human nature. The successful minority is supposed to have noeffective motive but a desire to retain and intensify its advantages. A quiteimaginary solidarity to that end is attributed to it, a preposterous, base classactivity. On the other hand, the unsuccessful mass—\"proletariat\"—is supposed tobe capable of a clear apprehension of its disadvantages, and the more it isimpoverished and embittered, the clearer-minded it becomes, and the nearer drawsits uprising, its constructive \"dictatorship,\" and the Millennium.No doubt a considerable amount of truth is to be found in this theory of theMarxist revolution. Human beings, like other animals, are disposed to remainwhere their circumstances are tolerable and to want change when they areuncomfortable, and so a great proportion of the people who are \"well off\" wantlittle or no change in present conditions, particularly those who are too dullto be bored by an unprogressive life, while a great proportion of those whoactually feel the inconveniences of straitened means and population pressure,do. But much vaster masses of the rank and file of humanity are accustomed toinferiority and dispossession, they do not feel these things to the extent evenof desiring change, or even if they do feel their disadvantages, they still fearchange more than they dislike their disadvantages. Moreover, those who aresufficiently distressed to realize that \"something ought to be done about it\"are much more disposed to childish and threatening demands upon heaven and thegovernment for redress and vindictive and punitive action against the enviedfortunate with whom they happen to be in immediate contact, than to any reactiontowards such complex, tentative, disciplined constructive work as alone canbetter the lot of mankind. In practice Marxism is found to work out in a readyresort to malignantly destructive activities, and to be so uncreative as to bepractically impotent in the face of material difficulties. In Russia, where—inand about the urban centres, at least—Marxism has been put to the test, thedoctrine of the Workers' Republic remains as a unifying cant, a test oforthodoxy of as little practical significance there as the communism of Jesusand communion with Christ in Christendom, while beneath this creed a smalloligarchy which has attained power by its profession does its obstinate best,much hampered by the suspicion and hostility of the Western financiers andpoliticians, to carry on a series of interesting and varyingly successfulexperiments in the socialization of economic life. Here we have no scope todiscuss the N.E.P. and the Five Year Plan. They are dealt with in The Work,Wealth, and Happiness of Mankind. Neither was properly Communist. The Five YearPlan is carried out as an autocratic state capitalism. Each year shows more andmore clearly that Marxism and Communism are divagations from the path of humanprogress and that the line of advance must follow a course more intricate andless flattering to the common impulses of our nature.The one main strand of truth in the theory of social development woven by Marxand Engels is that successful, comfortable people are disposed to dislike,obstruct and even resist actively any substantial changes in the currentpatchwork of arrangements, however great the ultimate dangers of that patchworkmay be or the privations and sufferings of other people involved in it. The onemain strand of error in that theory is the facile assumption that the people ata disadvantage will be stirred to anything more than chaotic and destructiveexpressions of resentment. If now we reject the error and accept the truth, welose the delusive comfort of belief in that magic giant, the Proletariat, whowill dictate, arrange, restore, and create, but we clear the way for therecognition of an élite of intelligent, creative-minded people scattered throughthe whole community, and for a study of the method of making this creativeelement effective in human affairs against the massive oppositions ofselfishness and unimaginative self-protective conservatism.Now, certain classes of people such as thugs and burglars seem to be harmful tosociety without a redeeming point about them, and others, such as racecoursebookmakers, seem to provide the minimum of distraction and entertainment with amaximum of mischief. Wilful idlers are a mere burthen on the community. Othersocial classes again, professional soldiers, for example, have a certaintraditional honourableness which disguises the essentially parasiticrelationship of their services to the developing modern community. Armies andarmaments are cancers produced by the malignant development of the patrioticvirus under modern conditions of exaggeration and mass suggestion. But sincethere are armies prepared to act coercively in the world to-day, it is necessarythat the Open Conspiracy should develop within itself the competence to resistmilitary coercion and combat and destroy armies that stand in the way of itsemergence. Possibly the first two types here instanced may be condemned asclasses and excluded as classes from any participation in the organized effortto recast the world, but quite obviously the soldier cannot. The worldcommonweal will need its own scientific methods of protection so long as thereare people running about the planet with flags and uniforms and weapons,offering violence to their fellow men and interfering with the free movements ofcommodities in the name of national sovereignty.And when we come to the general functioning classes, landowners, industrialorganizers, bankers, and so forth, who control the present system, such as itis, it should be still plainer that it is very largely from the ranks of theseclasses, and from their stores of experience and traditions of method, that thedirective forces of the new order must emerge. The Open Conspiracy can havenothing to do with the heresy that the path of human progress lies through anextensive class war.Let us consider, for example, how the Open Conspiracy stands to such a complexof activities, usages, accumulations, advantages as constitutes the bankingworld. There are no doubt many bankers and many practices in banking which makefor personal or group advantage to the general detriment. They forestall,monopolize, constrain, and extort, and so increase their riches. And anotherlarge part of that banking world follows routine and established usage; it iscarrying on and keeping things going, and it is neither inimical nor conduciveto the development of a progressive world organization of finance. But thereremains a residuum of original and intelligent people in banking or associatedwith banking or mentally interested in banking, who do realize that bankingplays a very important, interesting part in the world's affairs, who are curiousabout their own intricate function and disposed towards a scientificinvestigation of its origins, conditions, and future possibilities. Such typesmove naturally towards the Open Conspiracy. Their enquiries carry theminevitably outside the bankers' habitual field to an examination of the nature,drift, and destiny of the entire economic process.Now the theme of the preceding paragraph might be repeated with variationsthrough a score of paragraphs in which appropriate modifications would adapt itto the industrial organizer, the merchant and organizer of transport, theadvertiser, the retail distributor, the agriculturalist, the engineer, thebuilder, the economic chemist, and a number of other types functional in thecontemporary community. In all we should distinguish firstly a base and harmfulsection, then a mediocre section following established usage, and lastly, anactive, progressive section to whom we turn naturally for developments leadingtowards the progressive world commonweal of our desires. And our analysis mightpenetrate further than separation into types of individuals. In nearly everyindividual instance we should find a mixed composition, a human being offluctuating moods and confused purposes, sometimes base, sometimes drifting withthe tide and sometimes alert and intellectually and morally quickened. The OpenConspiracy must be content to take a fraction of a man, as it appeals tofractions of many classes, if it cannot get him altogether.This idea of drawing together a proportion of all or nearly all the functionalclasses in contemporary communities in order to weave the beginnings of a worldcommunity out of their selection is a fairly obvious one—and yet it has still towin practical recognition. Man is a morbidly gregarious and partisan creature;he is deep in his immediate struggles and stands by his own kind because in sodoing he defends himself; the industrialist is best equipped to criticize hisfellow industrialist, but he finds the root of all evil in the banker; the wagesworker shifts the blame for all social wrongs on the \"employing class.\" There isan element of exasperation in most economic and social reactions, and there ishardly a reforming or revolutionary movement in history which is not essentiallyan indiscriminate attack of one functioning class or type upon another, on theassumption that the attacked class is entirely to blame for the clash and thatthe attacking class is self-sufficient in the commonweal and can dispense withits annoying collaborator. A considerable element of justice usually enters intosuch recriminations. But the Open Conspiracy cannot avail itself of these classanimosities for its driving force. It can have, therefore, no uniform method ofapproach. For each class it has a conception of modification and development,and each class it approaches therefore at a distinctive angle. Some classes, nodoubt, it would supersede altogether; others—the scientific investigator, forexample—it must regard as almost wholly good and seek only to multiply andempower, but it can no more adopt the prejudices and extravagances of anyparticular class as its basis than it can adopt the claims of any existing stateor empire.When it is clearly understood that the binding links of the Open Conspiracy wehave in mind are certain broad general ideas, and that—except perhaps in thecase of scientific workers—we have no current set of attitudes of mind andhabits of activity which we can turn over directly and unmodified to the serviceof the conspiracy, we are in a position to realize that the movement wecontemplate must from the outset be diversified in its traditions and elementsand various in its methods. It must fight upon several fronts and with manysorts of equipment. It will have a common spirit, but it is quite conceivablethat between many of its contributory factors there may be very wide gaps inunderstanding and sympathy. It is no sort of simple organization."},{"pageContent":"XI. — FORCES AND RESISTANCES IN THE GREAT MODERN COMMUNITIES NOW PREVALENT,WHICH ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO THE OPEN CONSPIRACY. THE WAR WITH TRADITIONWe have now stated broadly but plainly the idea of the world commonweal which isthe objective of the Open Conspiracy, and we have made a preliminary examinationof the composition of that movement, showing that it must be necessarily not aclass development, but a convergence of many different sorts of people upon acommon idea. Its opening task must be the elaboration, exposition, andpropaganda of this common idea, a steady campaign to revolutionize education andestablish a modern ideology in men's minds and, arising out of this, theincomparably vaster task of the realization of its ideas.These are tasks not to be done in vacuo; they have to be done in a dense worldof crowding, incessant, passionate, unco-ordinated activities, the world ofmarket and newspaper, seed-time and harvest, births, deaths, jails, hospitals,riots, barracks and army manoeuvres, false prophets and royal processions, gamesand shows, fire, storm, pestilence, earthquake, war. Every day and every hourthings will be happening to help or thwart, stimulate or undermine, obstruct ordefeat the creative effort to set up the world commonweal.Before we go on to discuss the selection and organization of these heterogeneousand mainly religious impulses upon which we rest our hopes of a greater life formankind, before we plan how these impulses may be got together into a system ofco-ordinated activities, it will be well to review the main antagonistic forceswith which, from its very inception, the Open Conspiracy will be—is now—inconflict.To begin with, we will consider these forces as they present themselves in thehighly developed Western European States of to-day and in their Americanderivatives, derivatives which, in spite of the fact that in most cases theyhave far outgrown their lands of origin, still owe a large part of their socialhabits and political conceptions to Europe. All these States touch upon theAtlantic or its contributory seas; they have all grown to their present formsince the discovery of America; they have a common tradition rooting in theideas of Christendom and a generic resemblance of method. Economically andsocially they present what is known in current parlance as the Capitalistsystem, but it will relieve us of a considerable load of disputatious matter ifwe call them here simply the \"Atlantic\" civilizations and communities.The consideration of these Atlantic civilizations in relation to the comingworld civilization will suffice for the present chapter. Afterwards we willconsider the modification of the forces antagonistic to the Open Conspiracy asthey display themselves beyond the formal confines of these now dominant statesin the world's affairs, in the social systems weakened and injured by theirexpansion, and among such less highly organized communities as still survivefrom man's savage and barbaric past.The Open Conspiracy is not necessarily antagonistic to any existing government.The Open Conspiracy is a creative, organizing movement and not an anarchisticone. It does not want to destroy existing controls and forms of humanassociation, but either to supersede or amalgamate them into a common worlddirectorate. If constitutions, parliaments, and kings can be dealt with asprovisional institutions, trustees for the coming of age of the worldcommonweal, and in so far as they are conducted in that spirit, the OpenConspiracy makes no attack upon them.But most governments will not set about their business as in any way provisionalthey and their supporters insist upon a reverence and obedience which repudiateany possibility of supersession. What should be an instrument becomes adivinity. In nearly every country of the world there is, in deference to thepretended necessities of a possible war, a vast degrading and dangerouscultivation of loyalty and mechanical subservience to flags, uniforms,presidents, and kings. A president or king who does his appointed work well andrighteously is entitled to as much subservience as a bricklayer who does hiswork well and righteously and to no more, but instead there is a sustainedendeavour to give him the privileges of an idol above criticism or reproach, andthe organized worship of flags has become—with changed conditions of intercourseand warfare—an entirely evil misdirection of the gregarious impulses of ourrace. Emotion and sentimentality are evoked in the cause of disciplines andco-operations that could quite easily be sustained and that are better sustainedby rational conviction.The Open Conspiracy is necessarily opposed to all such implacable loyalties, andstill more so to the aggressive assertion and propaganda of such loyalties. Whenthese things take the form of suppressing reasonable criticism and forbiddingeven the suggestion of other forms of government, they become plainlyantagonists to any comprehensive project for human welfare. They becomemanifestly, from the wider point of view, seditious, and loyalty to \"king andcountry\" passes into plain treason to mankind. Almost everywhere, at present,educational institutions organize barriers in the path of progress, and thereare only the feeblest attempts at any counter education that will break up thesebarriers. There is little or no effort to restrain the aggressive nationalistwhen he waves his flag against the welfare of our race, or to protect thechildren of the world from the infection of his enthusiasms. And this last is astrue now of the American system as it is of any European State.In the great mass of the modern community there is little more than a favourableacquiescence in patriotic ideas and in the worship of patriotic symbols, andthat is based largely on such training. These things are not necessary thingsfor the generality of to-day. A change of mental direction would be possible forthe majority of people now without any violent disorganization of their intimatelives or any serious social or economic readjustments for them. Mental infectionin such cases could be countered by mental sanitation. A majority of people inEurope, and a still larger majority in the United States and the other AmericanRepublics, could become citizens of the world without any serious hindrance totheir present occupations, and with an incalculably vast increase of theirpresent security.But there remains a net of special classes in every community, from kings tocustom-house officers, far more deeply involved in patriotism because it istheir trade and their source of honour, and prepared in consequence with aninstinctive resistance to any reorientation of ideas towards a broader outlook.In the case of such people no mental sanitation is possible without dangerousand alarming changes in their way of living. For the majority of these patriotsby metier, the Open Conspiracy unlocks the gates leading from a fussy paradiseof eminence, respect, and privilege,—and motions them towards an austerewilderness which does not present even the faintest promise of a congenial,distinguished life for them. Nearly everything in human nature will dispose themto turn away from these gates which open towards the world peace, to bang-to andlock them again if they can, and to grow thickets as speedily as possible toconceal them and get them forgotten. The suggestion of being trustees in atransition will seem to most of such people only the camouflage of an ultimatedegradation.From such classes of patriots by metier, it is manifest that the Open Conspiracycan expect only opposition. It may detach individuals from them, but only bydepriving them of their essential class loyalties and characteristics. The classas a class will remain none the less antagonistic. About royal courts andpresidential residences, in diplomatic, consular, military, and naval circles,and wherever people wear titles and uniforms and enjoy pride and precedencesbased on existing political institutions, there will be the completest generalinability to grasp the need for the Open Conspiracy. These people and theirwomankind, their friends and connections, their servants and dependents, arefortified by time-honoured traditions of social usage, of sentiment and romanticprestige. They will insist that they are reality and Cosmopolis a dream. Onlyindividuals of exceptional liveliness, rare intellectual power, and innate moralforce can be expected to break away from the anti-progressive habits such classconditions impose upon them.This tangle of traditions and loyalties, of interested trades and professions,of privileged classes and official patriots, this complex of human beingsembodying very easy and natural and time-honoured ideas of eternal nationalseparation and unending international and class conflict, is the main objectiveof the Open Conspiracy in its opening phase. This tangle must be disentangled asthe Open Conspiracy advances, and until it is largely disentangled and clearedup that Open Conspiracy cannot become anything very much more than a desire anda project.This tangle of \"necessary patriots,\" as one may call them, is different in itsnature, less intricate and extensive proportionally in the United States and theStates of Latin America, than it is in the old European communities, but it isnone the less virulent in its action on that account. It is only recently thatmilitary and naval services have become important factors in American sociallife, and the really vitalizing contact of the interested patriot and the Statehas hitherto centred mainly upon the custom house and the concession. Instead ofa mellow and romantic loyalty to \"king and country\" the American thinks simplyof America and his flag.The American exaggeration of patriotism began as a resistance to exploitationfrom overseas. Even when political and fiscal freedom were won, there was a longphase of industrial and financial dependence. The American's habits of mind, inspite of his recent realization of the enormous power and relative prosperity ofthe United States and of the expanding possibilities of their Spanish andPortuguese-speaking neighbours, are still largely self- protective against a nowimaginary European peril. For the first three quarters of the nineteenth centurythe people of the American continent, and particularly the people of the UnitedStates, felt the industrial and financial ascendancy of Great Britain and had areasonable fear of European attacks upon their continent. A growing tide ofimmigrants of uncertain sympathy threatened their dearest habits. Flag worshipwas imposed primarily as a repudiation of Europe. Europe no longer looms overAmerica with overpowering intimations, American industries no longer have anypractical justification for protection, American finance would be happierwithout it, but the patriotic interests are so established now that they go onand will go on. No American statesman who ventures to be cosmopolitan in hisutterance and outlook is likely to escape altogether from the raucous attentionsof the patriotic journalist.We have said that the complex of classes in any country interested in thecurrent method of government is sustained by traditions and impelled by itsnature and conditions to protect itself against exploratory criticism. It istherefore unable to escape from the forms of competitive and militantnationalism in which it was evolved. It cannot, without grave danger ofenfeeblement, change any such innate form. So that while parallel complexes ofpatriotic classes are found in greater or less intricacy grouped about the flagsand governments of most existing states, these complexes are by their natureobliged to remain separate, nationalist, and mutually antagonistic. You cannotexpect a world union of soldiers or diplomatists. Their existence and naturedepend upon the idea that national separation is real and incurable, and thatwar, in the long run, is unavoidable. Their conceptions of loyalty involve anantagonism to all foreigners, even to foreigners of exactly the same types asthemselves, and make for a continual campaign of annoyances, suspicions, andprecautions—together with a general propaganda, affecting all other classes, ofthe necessity of an international antagonism—that creeps persistently towardswar.But while the methods of provoking war employed by the patriotic classes aretraditional, modern science has made a new and enormously more powerful thing ofwarfare and, as the Great War showed, even the most conservative generals onboth sides are unable to prevent the gigantic interventions of the mechanicianand the chemist. So that a situation is brought about in which the militaristelement is unable to fight without the support of the modern industrialorganization and the acquiescence of the great mass of people. We are confrontedtherefore at the present time with the paradoxical situation that a patriotictradition sustains in power and authority warlike classes who are quiteincapable of carrying on war. The other classes to which they must go forsupport when the disaster of war is actually achieved are classes developedunder peace conditions, which not only have no positive advantage in war, butmust, as a whole, suffer great dislocation, discomfort, destruction, anddistress from war. It is of primary importance therefore, to the formallydominant classes that these new social masses and powers should remain under thesway of the old social, sentimental, and romantic traditions, and equallyimportant is it to the Open Conspiracy that they should be released.Here we bring into consideration another great complex of persons, interests,traditions—the world of education, the various religious organizations, and,beyond these, the ramifying, indeterminate world of newspapers and otherperiodicals, books, the drama, art, and all the instruments of presentation andsuggestion that mould opinion and direct action. The sum of the operations ofthis complex will be either to sustain or to demolish the old nationalistmilitant ascendancy. Its easiest immediate course is to accept it. Educationalorganizations on that account are now largely a conservative force in thecommunity; they are in most cases directly controlled by authority and boundofficially as well as practically to respect current fears and prejudices. Itevokes fewer difficulties for them if they limit and mould rather than releasethe young. The schoolmaster tends, therefore, to accept and standardize andstereotype, even in the living, progressive fields of science and philosophy.Even there he is a brake on the forward movement. It is clear that the OpenConspiracy must either continually disturb and revivify him or else franklyantagonize him. Universities also struggle between the honourable past on whichtheir prestige rests, and the need of adaptation to a world of enquiry,experiment, and change. It is an open question whether these particularorganizations of intellectual prestige are of any real value in the livingworld. A modern world planned de novo would probably produce nothing like acontemporary university. Modern research, one may argue, would be stimulatedrather than injured by complete detachment from the lingering mediaevalism ofsuch institutions, their entanglement with adolescent education, and theirancient and contagious conceptions of precedence and honour.Ordinary religious organizations, again, exist for self-preservation and areprone to follow rather than direct the currents of popular thought. They arekept alive, indeed, by revivalism and new departures which at the outlet theyare apt to resist, as the Catholic Church, for instance, resisted the Franciscanawakening, but their formal disposition is conservative. They say to religiousdevelopment, thus far and no farther.Here, in school, college, and church, are activities of thought and instructionwhich, generally speaking, drag upon the wheels of progress, but which need notnecessarily do so. A schoolmaster may be original, stimulating, and creative,and if he is fortunate and a good fighter he may even achieve considerableworldly success; university teachers and investigators may strike out upon newlines and yet escape destruction by the older dons. Universities compete againstother universities at home and abroad and cannot altogether yield to the forcesof dullness and subservience. They must maintain a certain difference fromvulgar opinion and a certain repute of intellectual virility.As we pass from the more organized to the less organized intellectualactivities, we find conservative influence declining in importance, and a freerplay for the creative drive. Freshness is a primary condition of journalistic,literary, and artistic success, and orthodoxy has nothing new to say or do. Butthe desire for freshness may be satisfied all too readily by merely extravagant,superficial, and incoherent inventions.The influence of this old traditional nationalist social and political hierarchywhich blocks the way to the new world is not, however, exerted exclusivelythrough its control over schools and universities. Nor is that indeed its morepowerful activity. Would that it were There is also a direct, less definedcontact of the old order with the nascent powers, that plays a far moreeffective part in delaying the development of the modern world commonweal.Necessarily the old order has determined the established way of life, which is,at its best, large, comfortable, amusing, respected. It possesses all theentrances and exits and all the controls of the established daily round. It isable to exact, and it does exact, almost without design, many conformities.There can be no very ample social life, therefore, for those who areconspicuously dissentient. Again the old order has a complete provision for thegrowth, welfare, and advancement of its children. It controls the founts ofhonour and self-respect; it provides a mapped-out world of behaviour. The newinitiatives make their appearance here and there in the form of isolatedindividuals, here an inventor, there a bold organizer or a vigorous thinker.Apart from his specific work the innovating type finds that he must fall in withestablished things or his womenfolk will be ostracized, and he will bedistressed by a sense of isolation even in the midst of successful activities.The more intensely he innovates in particular, the more likely is he to be toobusy to seek out kindred souls and organize a new social life in general. Thenew things and ideas, even when they arise abundantly, arise scattered andunorganized, and the old order takes them in its net. America for example --bothon its Latin and on its English-speaking side—is in many ways a triumph of theold order over the new.Men like Winwood Reade thought that the New World would be indeed a new world.They idealized its apparent emancipations. But as the more successful of thetoiling farmers and traders of republican America rose one by one to affluence,leisure, and freedom, it was far more easy for them to adopt the polished andprepared social patterns and usages of Europe than to work out a newcivilization in accordance with their equalitarian professions. Yet thereremains a gap in their adapted \"Society.\" Henry James, that acute observer ofsubtle social flavours, has pointed out the peculiar headlessness of social lifein America because of the absence of court functions to \"go on\" to and justifythe assembling and dressing. The social life has imitated the preparation forthe Court without any political justification. In Europe the assimilation of thewealthy European industrialist and financier by the old order has been paralleland naturally more logically complete. He really has found a court to \"go on\"to. His social scheme was still undecapitated until kingdoms began to changeinto republics after 1917.In this way the complex of classes vitally involved in the old militantnationalist order is mightily reinforced by much larger masses of imitative andannexed and more or less assimilated rich and active people. The greatindustrialist has married the daughter of the marquis and has a couple of sonsin the Guards and a daughter who is a princess. The money of the American Leeds,fleeing from the social futility of its land of origin, helped bolster up amischievous monarchy in Greece. The functional and private lives of the new menare thus at war with one another. The real interests of the great industrialistor financier lie in cosmopolitan organization and the material development ofthe world commonweal, but his womenfolk pin flags all over him, and his sons areprepared to sacrifice themselves and all his business creations for the sake oftrite splendours and Ruritanian romance.But just so far as the great business organizer is capable and creative, so faris he likely to realize and resent the price in frustration that the old orderobliges him to pay for amusement, social interest, and domestic peace andcomfort. The Open Conspiracy threatens him with no effacement; it may evenappear with an air of release. If he had women who were interested in hisbusiness affairs instead of women who had to be amused, and if he realized intime the practical, intellectual, and moral kidnap of sons and daughters by theold order that goes on, he might pass quite easily from acquiescence toantagonism. But in this respect he cannot a single-handed. This is a social andnot an individual operation. The Open Conspiracy, it is clear, must include inits activities a great fight for the souls of economically-functional people. Itmust carve out a Society of its own from Society. Only by the creation of a newand better social life can it resist the many advantages and attractions of theold.This constant gravitation back to traditional uses on the part of what mightbecome new social types applies not merely to big people but to such smallpeople as are really functional in the modern economic scheme. The have nosocial life adapted to their new economic relationships, and they forced backupon the methods of behaviour established for what were roughly their analoguesin the old order of things. The various sorts of managers and foremen in bigmodern concerns, for example, carry on ways of living they have taken ready-madefrom the stewards, tradesmen, tenantry, and upper servants of an aristocraticterritorial system. They release themselves and are released almost in spite ofthemselves, slowly, generation by generation, from habits of social subserviencethat are no longer necessary nor convenient in the social process, acquire anofficial pride in themselves and take on new conceptions of responsible loyaltyto a scheme. And they find themselves under suggestions of class aloofness andsuperiority to the general mass of less cardinal workers, that are oftenunjustifiable under new conditions. Machinery and scientific organization havebeen and still are revolutionizing productive activity by the progressiveelimination of the unskilled worker, the hack, the mere toiler. But the socialorganization of the modern community and the mutual deportment of the associatedworkers left over after this elimination are still haunted by the tradition ofthe lord, the middle-class tenant, and the servile hind. The development ofself-respect and mutual respect among the mass of modern functional workers isclearly an intimate concern of the Open Conspiracy.A vast amount of moral force has been wasted in the past hundred years by theantagonism of \"Labour\" to \"Capital,\" as though this were the primary issue inhuman affairs. But this never was the primary issue, and it is steadily recedingfrom its former importance. The ancient civilizations did actually rest upon abroad basis of slavery and serfdom. Human muscle was a main source ofenergy-ranking with sun, wind, and flood. But invention and discovery have sochanged the conditions under which power is directed and utilized that musclebecomes economically secondary and inessential. We no longer want hewers of woodand drawers of water, carriers and pick and spade men. We no longer want thatbreeding swarm of hefty sweaty bodies without which the former civilizationscould not have endured. We want watchful and understanding guardians and driversof complex delicate machines, which can be mishandled and brutalized and spoiltall too easily. The less disposed these masters of our machines are toinordinate multiplication, the more room and food in the world for their amplerlives. Even to the lowest level of a fully-mechanicalized civilization it isrequired that the human element should be select. In the modern world, crowdsare a survival, and they will presently be an anachronism, and crowd psychologytherefore cannot supply the basis of a new order. It is just because labour isbecoming more intelligent, responsible, and individually efficient that it isbecoming more audible and impatient in social affairs.It is just because it is no longer mere gang labour, and is becoming more andmore intelligent co-operation in detail, that it now resents being treated as aserf, housed like a serf, fed like a serf, and herded like a serf, and its prideand thoughts and feelings disregarded. Labour is in revolt because as a matterof fact it is, in the ancient and exact sense of the word, ceasing to be labourat all.The more progressive elements of the directive classes recognize this, but, aswe have shown, there are formidable forces still tending to maintain the oldsocial attitudes when arrogance became the ruler and the common man accepted hisservile status. A continual resistance is offered by large sections of theprosperous and advantaged to the larger claims of the modernized worker, and inresponse the rising and differentiating workers develop an angry antagonism tothese directive classes which allow themselves to be controlled by theirconservative and reactionary elements. Moreover, the increasing relativeintelligence of the labour masses, the unprecedented imaginative stimulationthey experience, the continually more widespread realization of the availablefreedoms and comforts and indulgences that might be and are not shared by all ina modern state, develop a recalcitrance where once there was little butfatalistic acquiescence. An objection to direction and obligation, always mutelypresent in the toiling multitude since the economic life of man began, becomesarticulate and active. It is the taste of freedom that makes labour desire to befree. This series of frictions is a quite inevitable aspect of socialreorganization, but it does not constitute a primary antagonism in the process.The class war was invented by the classes; it is a natural tradition of theupper strata of the old order. It was so universally understood that there wasno need to state it. It is implicit in nearly all the literature of the worldbefore the nineteenth century—except the Bible, the Koran, and other sequelae.The \"class war\" of the Marxist is merely a poor snobbish imitation, a tu quoque,a pathetic, stupid, indignant reversal of and retort to the old arrogance, apathetic upward arrogance.These conflicts cut across rather than oppose or help the progressivedevelopment to which the Open Conspiracy devotes itself. Labour, awakened,enquiring, and indignant, is not necessarily progressive; if the ordinaryundistinguished worker is no longer to be driven as a beast of burthen, he has--which also goes against the grain—to be educated to as high a level ofco-operative efficiency as possible. He has to work better, even if he works formuch shorter hours and under better conditions, and his work must besubordinated work still; he cannot become en masse sole owner and master of ascheme of things he did not make and is incapable of directing. Yet this is theambition implicit in an exclusively \"Labour\" movement. Either the Labourrevolutionary hopes to cadge the services of exceptional people withoutacknowledgment or return on sentimental grounds, or he really believes thatanyone is as capable as anyone else—if not more so. The worker at a low levelmay be flattered by dreams of \"class-conscious\" mass dominion from which allsense of inferiority is banished, but they will remain dreams. The deepinstinctive jealousy of the commonplace individual for outstanding quality andnovel initiative may be organized and turned to sabotage and destruction,masquerading as and aspiring to be a new social order, but that will be a blindalley and not the road of progress. Our hope for the human future does not liein crowd psychology and the indiscriminating rule of universal democracy.The Open Conspiracy can have little use for mere resentments as a driving forcetowards its ends; it starts with a proposal not to exalt the labour class but toabolish it, its sustaining purpose is to throw drudges out of employment andeliminate the inept—and it is far more likely to incur suspicion and distrust inthe lower ranks of the developing industrial order of to-day than to win supportthere. There, just as everywhere else in the changing social complexes of ourtime, it can appeal only to the exceptionally understanding individual who canwithout personal humiliation consider his present activities and relationshipsas provisional and who can, without taking offence, endure a searchingcriticising of his present quality and mode of living."},{"pageContent":"XII. — THE RESISTANCES OF THE LESS INDUSTRIALIZED PEOPLES TO THE DRIVE OF THEOPEN CONSPIRACYSo far, in our accounting of the powers, institutions, dispositions, types, andclasses which will be naturally opposed to the Open Conspiracy, we have surveyedonly such territory in the domain of the future world commonweal as isrepresented by the complex, progressive, highly-industrialized communities,based on a preceding landlord-soldier, tenant, town-merchant, and tradesmansystem, of the Atlantic type. These communities have developed farthest in thedirection of mechanicalization, and they are so much more efficient and powerfulthat they now dominate the rest of the world. India, China, Russia, Africapresent mélanges of social systems, thrown together, outpaced, overstrained,shattered, invaded, exploited, and more or less subjugated by the finance,machinery, and political aggressions of the Atlantic, Baltic, and Mediterraneancivilization. In many ways they have an air of assimilating themselves to thatcivilization, evolving modern types and classes, and abandoning much of theirdistinctive traditions. But that they take from the West is mainly the newdevelopments, the material achievements, rather than the social and politicalachievements, that, empowered by modern inventions, have won their to worldpredominance. They may imitate European nationalism to a certain extent; forthem it becomes a convenient form of self-assertion against the pressure of arealized practical social and political inferiority; but the degree to whichthey will or can take over the social assumptions and habits of thelong-established European-American hierarchy is probably very restricted. Theirnationalism will remain largely indigenous; the social traditions in which theywill try to make the new material forces subservient will be traditions of anOriental life widely different from the original life of Europe. They will havetheir own resistances to the Open Conspiracy, therefore, but they will bedifferent resistances from those we have hitherto considered. The automobile andthe wireless set, the harvester and steel construction building, will come tothe jungle rajah and the head hunter, the Brahmin and the Indian peasant, with aparallel and yet dissimilar message to the one they brought the Britishlandowner or the corn and cattle farmers of the Argentine and the Middle West.Also they may be expected to evoke dissimilar reactions. To a number of thefiner, more energetic minds of these overshadow communities which have laggedmore or less ill the material advances t which this present ascendancy ofwestern Europe and America is due, the Open Conspiracy may come with an effectof immense invitation. At one step they may go from the sinking vessel of theirantiquated order, across their present conquerors, into a brotherhood of worldrulers They may turn to the problem of saving and adapting all that is rich anddistinctive of their inheritance to the common ends of the race. But to the lessvigorous intelligences of this outer world, the new project of the OpenConspiracy will seem no better than a new form of Western envelopment and theywill fight a mighty liberation as though it were a further enslavement to theEuropean tradition. They will watch the Open Conspiracy for any signs ofconscious superiority and racial disregard. Necessarily they will recognize itas a product of Western mentality and they may well be tempted to regard it asan elaboration and organization of current dispositions rather than theevolution of a new phase which will make no discrimination at last between theeffete traditions of either East or West. Their suspicions will be sustained anddeveloped by the clumsy and muddle-headed political and economic aggressions ofthe contemporary political and business systems, such as they are, of the West,now in progress. Behind that cloud of aggression Western thought has necessarilyadvanced upon them. It could have got to their attention in no other way.Partly these resistances and criticisms of the decadent communities outside theAtlantic capitalist system will be aimed, not at the developing methods of thecoming world community, but at the European traditions and restrictions thathave imposed themselves upon these methods, and so far the clash of the East andWest may be found to subserve the aims of the Open Conspiracy. In the conflictof old traditions and in the consequent deadlocks lies much hope for the directacceptance of the groups of ideas centring upon the Open Conspiracy One of themost interesting areas of humanity in this respect is the great system ofcommunities under the sway or influence of Soviet Russia. Russia has never beencompletely incorporated with the European system; she became a just passableimitation of a western European monarchy in the seventeenth and eighteenthcenturies, and talked at last of constitutions and parliaments—but the realityof that vast empire remained an Asiatic despotism, and the European mask wasaltogether smashed by the successive revolutions of 1917. The ensuing system isa government presiding over an enormous extent of peasants and herdsmen, by adisciplined association professing the faith and dogmas of Marx, as interpretedand qualified by Lenin and Stalin.In many ways this government is a novelty of extraordinary interest. It laboursagainst enormous difficulties within itself and without. Flung amazingly into aposition of tremendous power, its intellectual flexibility is greatly restrictedby the urgent militant necessity for mental unanimity and a consequentrepression of criticism. It finds itself separated, intellectually and morally,by an enormous gap from the illiterate millions over which it rules. More openperhaps to scientific and creative conceptions than any other government, andcertainly more willing to experiment and innovate, its enterprise is starved bythe economic depletion of the country in the Great War and by the technical andindustrial backwardness of the population upon which it must draw for itspersonnel. Moreover, it struggles within itself between concepts of a modernscientific social organization and a vague anarchistic dream in which the\"State\" is to disappear, and an emancipated proletariat, breeding andexpectorating freely, fills the vistas of time forevermore. The tradition oflong years of hopeless opposition has tainted the world policy of the Marxistcult with a mischievous and irritating quality that focuses upon it theanimosity of every government in the dominant Atlantic system. Marxism never hadany but the vaguest fancies about the relation of one nation to another, and thenew Russian government, for all its cosmopolitan phrases, is more and moreplainly the heir to the obsessions of Tsarist Imperialism, using the Communistparty, as other countries have used Christian missionaries, to maintain apropagandist government to forward its schemes. Nevertheless, the Sovietgovernment has maintained itself for more than twelve years, and it seems farmore likely to evolve than to persist. It is quite possible that it will evolvetowards the conceptions of the Open Conspiracy, and in that case Russia maywitness once again a conflict between new ideas and Old Believers. So far theCommunist party in Moscow has maintained a considerable propaganda of ideas inthe rest of the world and especially across its western frontier. Many of theseideas are now trite and stale. The time may be not far distant when the tide ofpropaganda will flow in the reverse direction. It has pleased the vanity of theCommunist party to imagine itself conducting a propaganda of world revolution.Its fate may be to develop upon lines that will make its more intelligentelements easily assimilable to the Open Conspiracy for a world revolution. TheOpen Conspiracy as it spreads and grows may find a less encumbered field fortrying out the economic developments implicit in its conceptions in Russia andSiberia than anywhere else in the world.However severely the guiding themes and practical methods of the present Sovietgovernment in Russia may be criticized, the fact remains that it has cleared outof its way many of the main obstructive elements that we find still vigorous inthe more highly-organized communities in the West. It has liberated vast areasfrom the kindred superstitions of monarchy and the need for a privateproprietary control of great economic interests. And it has presented both Chinaand India with the exciting spectacle of a social and political system capableof throwing off many of the most characteristic features of triumphantWesternism, and yet holding its own. In the days when Japan faced up to modernnecessities there were no models for imitation that were not communities of theAtlantic type pervaded by the methods of private capitalism, and in consequencethe Japanese reconstituted their affairs on a distinctly European plan, adoptinga Parliament and bringing their monarchy, social hierarchy, and business andfinancial methods into a general conformity with that model. It is extremelydoubtful whether any other Asiatic community will now set itself to a parallelimitation, and it will be thanks largely to the Russian revolution that thisbreakaway from Europeanization has occurred.But it does not follow that such a breakaway will necessarily lead more directlyto the Open Conspiracy. If we have to face a less highly organized system ofinterests and prejudices in Russia and China, we have to deal with a vastlywider ignorance and a vastly more formidable animalism. Russia is a land of tensof millions of peasants ruled over by a little band of the intelligentsia whocan be counted only by tens of thousands. It is only these few score thousandswho are accessible to ideas of world construction, and the only hope of bringingthe Russian system into active participation in the world conspiracy is throughthat small minority and through its educational repercussion on the myriadsbelow. As we go eastward from European Russia the proportion of soundly preparedintelligence to which we can appeal for understanding and participationdiminishes to an even more dismaying fraction. Eliminate that fraction, and oneis left face to face with inchoate barbarism incapable of social and politicalorganization above the level of the war boss and the brigand leader. Russiaitself is still by no means secure against a degenerative process in thatdirection, and the hope of China struggling out of it without some forcibledirective interventions is a hope to which constructive liberalism clings withvery little assurance.We turn back therefore from Russia, China and the communities of Central Asia tothe Atlantic world. It is in that world alone that sufficient range andamplitude of thought and discussion are possible for the adequate development ofthe Open Conspiracy. In these communities it must begin and for a long time itsmain activities will need to be sustained from these necessary centres ofdiffusion. It will develop amidst incessant mental Strife, and through thatstrife it will remain alive. It is no small part of the practical weakness ofpresent-day communism that it attempts to centre its intellectual life and itsdirective activities in Moscow and so cuts itself off from the free and opendiscussions of the Western world. Marxism lost the world when it went to Moscowand took over the traditions of Tsarism as Christianity lost the world when itwent to Rome and took over the traditions of Caesar. Entrenched in Moscow fromsearching criticism, the Marxist ideology may become more and more dogmatic andunprogressive, repeating its sacred credo and issuing its disregarded orders tothe proletariat of the world, and so stay ineffectively crystallized until therising tide of the Open Conspiracy submerges, dissolves it afresh, andincorporates whatever it finds assimilable.India, like Japan, is cut off from the main body of Asiatic affairs. But whileJapan has become a formally Westernized nationality in the comity of suchnations, India remains a world in itself. In that one peninsula nearly everytype of community is to be found, from the tribe of jungle savages, through agreat diversity of barbaric and mediaeval principalities, to the child andwomen—sweating factories and the vigorous modern commercialism of Bombay. Overit all the British imperialism prevails, a constraining and restraininginfluence, keeping the peace, checking epidemics, increasing the food supply byirrigation and the like, and making little or no effort to evoke responses tomodern ideas. Britain in India is no propagandist of modern ferments: all thoseare left the other side of Suez. In India the Briton is a ruler as firm andself-assured and uncreative as the Roman. The old religious and socialtraditions, the complex customs, castes, tabus, and exclusions of astrangely-mixed but unamalgamated community, though a little discredited by thisforeign predominance, still hold men's minds. They have been, so to speak,pickled in the preservative of the British raj.The Open Conspiracy has to invade the Indian complex in conflict with theprejudices of both ruler and governed. It has to hope for individual breaches inthe dull Romanism of the administration: here a genuine educationist, here acreative civil servant, here an official touched by the distant stir of theliving homeland; and it has to try to bring these types into a co-operativerelationship with a fine native scholar here or an active-minded prince orlandowner or industrialist there. As the old methods of passenger transport aresuperseded by flying, it will be more and more difficult to keep the stir of theliving homeland out of either the consciousness of the official hierarchy or theknowledge of the recalcitrant \"native.\"Very similar to Indian conditions is the state of affairs in the foreignpossessions of France, the same administrative obstacles to the Open Conspiracyabove, and below the same resentful subordination, cut off from the mentalinvigoration of responsibility. Within these areas of restraint, India and itslesser, simpler parallels in North Africa, Syria and the Far East, there goes ona rapid increase of low-grade population, undersized physically and mentally,and retarding the mechanical development of civilization by its standing offerof cheap labour to the unscrupulous entrepreneur, and possible feebleinsurrectionary material to the unscrupulous political adventurer. It isimpossible to estimate how slowly or how rapidly the knowledge and ideas thathave checked the rate of increase of all the Atlantic populations may bediffused through these less alert communities.We must complete our survey of the resistances against which the Open Conspiracyhas to work by a few words about the Negro world and the regions of forest andjungle in which barbaric and even savage human life still escapes the infectionof civilization. It seems inevitable that the development of modern means ofcommunication and the conquest of tropical diseases should end in giving accesseverywhere to modern administration and to economic methods, and everywhere theincorporation of the former wilderness in the modern economic process means thedestruction of the material basis, the free hunting, the free access to thesoil, of such barbaric and savage communities as still precariously survive. Thedusky peoples, who were formerly the lords of these still imperfectly assimilateareas, are becoming exploited workers, slaves, serfs, hut-tax payers, labourersto a caste of white immigrants. The spirit of the plantation broods over allthese lands. The Negro in America differs only from his subjugated brother inSouth Africa or Kenya Colony in the fact that he also, like his white master, isan immigrant. The situation in Africa and America adjusts itself thereforetowards parallel conditions, the chief variation being in the relativeproportions of the two races and the details of the methods by which blacklabour is made to serve white ends.In these black and white communities which are establishing themselves in allthose parts of the earth where once the black was native, or in which asub-tropical climate is favourable to his existence at a low level of socialdevelopment, there is—and there is bound to be for many years to come—muchracial tension. The steady advance of birth-control may mitigate the biologicalfactors of this tension later on, and a general amelioration of manners andconduct may efface that disposition to persecute dissimilar types, which manshares with many other gregarious animals. But meanwhile this tension increasesand a vast multitude of lives is strained to tragic issues.To exaggerate the dangers and evils of miscegenation is a weakness of our time.Man interbreeds with all his varieties and yet deludes himself that there areraces of outstanding purity, the \"Nordic,\" the \"Semitic,\" and so forth. Theseare phantoms of the imagination. The reality is more intricate, less dramatic,and grips less easily upon the mind; the phantoms grip only too well and inciteto terrible suppressions. Changes in the number of half-breeds and in theproportion of white and coloured are changes of a temporary nature that maybecome controllable and rectifiable in a few generations. But until this levelof civilization is reached, until the colour of a man's skin or the kinks in awoman's hair cease to have the value of shibboleths that involve educational,professional, and social extinction or survival, a black and white community isbound to be continually preoccupied by a standing feud too intimate andpersuasive to permit of any long views of the world's destiny.We come to the conclusion therefore that it is from the more vigorous, varied,and less severely obsessed centres of the Atlantic civilizations in thetemperate zone, with their abundant facilities for publication and discussion,their traditions of mental liberty and their immense variety of interacting freetypes, that the main beginnings of the Open Conspiracy must develop. For therest of the world, its propaganda, finding but poor nourishment in the localconditions, may retain a missionary quality for many years."},{"pageContent":"XIII. — RESISTANCES AND ANTAGONISTIC FORCES IN OUR CONSCIOUS ANDUNCONSCIOUS SELVESWE have dealt in the preceding two chapters with great classes and assemblagesof human beings as, in the mass, likely to be more or less antagonistic to theOpen Conspiracy, and it has been difficult in those chapters to avoid theimplication that \"we,\" some sort of circle round the writer, were aloof fromthese obstructive and hostile multitudes, and ourselves entirely identified withthe Open Conspiracy. But neither are these multitudes so definitely against, northose who are with us so entirely for, the Open Conspiracy to establish a worldcommunity as the writer, in his desire for clearness and contrast and with anall too human disposition perhaps towards plain ego-centred combative issues,has been led to represent. There is no \"we,\" and there can be no \"we,\" inpossession of the Open Conspiracy.The Open Conspiracy is in partial possession of us, and we attempt to serve it.But the Open Conspiracy is a natural and necessary development of contemporarythought arising here, there, and everywhere. There are doubts and sympathiesthat weigh on the side of the Open Conspiracy in nearly everyone, and not one ofus but retains many impulses, habits, and ideas in conflict with our generaldevotion, checking and limiting our service.Let us therefore in this chapter cease to discuss classes and types and considergeneral mental tendencies and reactions which move through all humanity.In our opening chapters we pointed out that religion is not universallydistributed throughout human society. And of no one does it seem to havecomplete possession. It seizes upon some of us and exalts us for one hour nowand then, for a day now and then; it may leave its afterglow upon our conductfor some time; it may establish restraints and habitual dispositions; sometimesit dominates us with but brief intermissions through long spells, and then wecan be saints and martyrs. In all our religious phases there appears a desire tohold the phase, to subdue the rest of our life to the standards and exigenciesof that phase. Our quickened intelligence sets itself to a general analysis ofour conduct and to the problem of establishing controls over our unilluminatedintervals.And when the religious elements in the mind set themselves to such self-analysis, and attempt to order and unify the whole being upon this basis of theservice and advancement of the race, they discover first a great series ofindifferent moods, wherein the resistance to thought and word for the OpenConspiracy is merely passive and in the nature of inertia. There is a wholeclass of states of mind which may be brought together under the head of\"everydayism.\" The dinner bell and the playing fields, the cinema and thenewspaper, the week-end visit and the factory siren, a host of such expectantthings calls to a vast majority of people in our modern world to stop thinkingand get busy with the interest in hand, and so on to the next, without a thoughtfor the general frame and drama in which these momentary and personal incidentsare set. We are driven along these marked and established routes and turned thisway or that by the accidents of upbringing, of rivalries and loves, of chanceencounters and vivid experiences, and it is rarely for many of us, and never forsome, that the phases of broad reflection and self-questioning arise. For manypeople the religious life now, as in the past, has been a quite desperate effortto withdraw sufficient attention and energy from the flood of events to get somesort of grasp, and keep whatever grip is won, upon the relations of the self tothe whole. Far more recoil in terror from such a possibility and would strugglestrenuously against solitude in the desert, solitude under the stars, solitudein a silent room or indeed any occasion for comprehensive thought.But the instinct and purpose of the religious type is to keep hold upon thecomprehensive drama, and at the heart of all the great religions of the world wefind a parallel disposition to escape in some manner from the aimless drive andcompulsion of accident and everyday. Escape is attempted either by withdrawalfrom the presence of crowding circumstance into a mystical contemplation andaustere retirement, or—what is more difficult and desperate and reasonable—byimposing the mighty standards of enduring issues upon the whole mass oftransitory problems which constitute the actual business of life. We havealready noted how the modern mind turns from retreat as a recognizable method ofreligion, and faces squarely up to the second alternative. The tumult of lifehas to be met and conquered. Aim must prevail over the aimless. Remaining innormal life we must yet keep our wills and thoughts aloof from normal life andfixed upon creative processes. However busied we may be, however challenged, wemust yet save something of our best mental activity for self-examination andkeep ourselves alert against the endless treacheries within that would trip usback into everydayism and disconnected responses to the stimuli of life.Religions in the past, though they have been apt to give a preference to therenunciation of things mundane, have sought by a considerable variety ofexpedients to preserve the faith of those whom chance or duty still kept innormal contact with the world. It would provide material for an interestingstudy to enquire how its organizations to do this have worked in the past andhow far they may be imitated and paralleled in the progressive life of thefuture. All the wide-reaching religions which came into existence in the fivecenturies before and the five centuries after Christ have made great use ofperiodic meetings for mutual reassurance, of sacred books, creeds, fundamentalheart-searchings, of confession, prayer, sacraments, seasons of withdrawal,meditation, fasting, and prayer. Do these methods mark a phase in the world'sdevelopment, or are they still to be considered available?This points to a very difficult tangle of psychological problems. The writer inhis earlier draft of this book wrote that the modern religious individual leads,spiritually speaking, a life of extreme wasteful and dangerous isolation. Hestill feels that is true, but he realizes that the invention of correctivedevices is not within his range. He cannot picture a secular Mass norcongregations singing hymns about the Open Conspiracy. Perhaps the modern soulin trouble will resort to the psychoanalysts instead of the confessional; inwhich case we need to pray for better psychoanalysts.Can the modern mind work in societies? May the daily paper be slowly usurpingthe functions of morning prayer, a daily mental reminder of large things, withmore vividness and, at present, lower standards? One of the most distressfulfacts of the spread of education in the nineteenth century was the unscrupulousexploitation of the new reading public by a group of trash-dealers who grew richand mighty in the process. Is the popular publisher and newspaper proprietoralways to remain a trash-dealer? Or are we to see, in the future, publicationstaking at times some or all of the influence of revivalist movements, andparticular newspapers rising to the task of sustaining a common faith in agathering section of the public?The modern temple in which we shall go to meditate may be a museum; the modernreligious house and its religious life may be a research organization. The OpenConspirator must see to it that the museums show their meaning plain. There maybe not only literature presently, but even plays, shows, and music, to subservenew ideas instead of trading upon tradition.It is plain that to read and be moved by great ideas and to form goodresolutions with no subsequent reminders and moral stocktaking is no enough tokeep people in the way of the Open Conspiracy. The relapse to everydayism is tooeasy. The contemporary Open Conspirator may forget, and he has nothing to remindhim; he may relapse, and he w hear no reproach to warn him of his relapse.Nowhere has he recorded vow. \"Everyday\" has endless ways of justifying thereturn of the believer to sceptical casualness. It is easy to persuade oneselfthat one is taking life or oneself \"too seriously.\" The mind is veryself-protective; has a disposition to abandon too great or too far-reaching aneffort and return to things indisputably within its scope. We have aninstinctive preference for thinking things are \"all right\"; we economizeanxiety; defend the delusions that we can work with, even though we half realizethey are no more that' delusions. We resent the warning voice, the criticalquestion that robs our activities of assurance. Our everyday moods not only theantagonists of our religious moods, but they resent all outward appeals to ourreligious moods, and they welcome every help against religious appeals. We passvery readily from the merely defensive to the defensive aggressive, and fromrefusing to hear the word that might stir our consciences to a vigorous effortto suppress its utterance.Churches, religious organizations, try to keep the revivifying phase and usagewhere it may strike upon the waning or slumbering faith of the convert, butmodern religion as yet has no such organized rebinders. {sic-RW} They cannot beimprovised. Crude attempts to supply the needed corrective of conduct may doless good than harm. Each one of us for himself must do what he can to keep hishigh resolve in mind and protect himself from the snare of his own moods offatigue or inadvertency.But these passive and active defences of current things which operate in andthrough ourselves, and find such ready sympathy and assistance in the worldabout us, these massive resistance systems, are only the beginning of our taleof the forces antagonistic to the Open Conspiracy that lurk in our complexities.Men are creatures with other faults quite beyond and outside our commondisposition to be stupid, indolent, habitual, and defensive. Not only have weactive creative impulses, but also acutely destructive ones. Man is a jealousanimal. In youth and adolescence egotism is extravagant. It is natural for it tobe extravagant, then, and there is no help for it. A great number of us at thatstage would rather not see a beautiful or wonderful thing come into existencethen have it come into existence disregarding us. Something of that jealousmalice, that self-assertive ruthlessness, remains in all of us throughout life.At his worst man can be an exceedingly combative, malignant, mischievous andcruel animal. None of us are altogether above the possibility of such phases.When we consider the oppositions to the Open Conspiracy that operate in thenormal personality, we appreciate the soundness of the catechism which instructsus to renounce not only the trivial world and the heavy flesh, but the activeand militant devil.To make is a long and wearisome business, with many arrests and disappointments,but to break gives an instant thrill. We all know something of the delight ofthe Bang. It is well for the Open Conspirator to ask himself at times how far heis in love with the dream of a world in order, and how far he is driven byhatred of institutions that bore or humiliate him. He may be no more than arevengeful incendiary in the mask of a constructive worker. How safe is he,then, from the reaction to some fresh humiliation? The Open Conspiracy which isnow his refuge and vindication may presently fail to give him the compensationhe has sought, may offer him no better than a minor röle, may display Irritatingand incomprehensible preferences. And for a great number of things in overtantagonism to the great aim of the Open Conspiracy, he will still find withinhimself not simply acquiescence but sympathy and a genuine if inconsistentadmiration. There they are, waiting for his phase of disappointment. Back he maygo to the old loves with a new animus against the greater scheme. He may be gladto be quit of prigs and humbugs, and back among the good fellowship of nothingin particular.Man has pranced a soldier in reality and fancy for so many generations that fewof us can altogether release our imaginations from the brilliant pretensions offlags, empire, patriotism, and aggression. Business men, especially in America,seem to feel a sort of glory in calling even the underselling andoveradvertising of rival enterprises \"fighting.\" Pill vendors and publicdepartments can have their \"wars,\" their heroisms, their desperate mischiefs,and so get that Napoleonic feeling. The world and our reveries are full of thesentimentalities, the false glories and loyalties of the old combativetraditions, trailing after them, as they do, so much worth and virtue in adulled and stupefied condition. It is difficult to resist the fine gravity, thehigh self-respect, the examples of honour and good style in small things, thatthe military and naval services can present to us, for all that they are now nomore than noxious parasites upon the nascent world commonweal. In France not aword may be said against the army; in England, against the navy. There will bemany Open Conspirators at first who will scarcely dare to say that word even tothemselves.But all these obsolete values and attitudes with which our minds are cumberedmust be cleared out if the new faith is to have free play. We have to clear themout not only from our own minds but from the minds of others who are to becomeour associates. The finer and more picturesque these obsolescent loyalties,obsolescent standards of honour, obsolescent religious associations, may seem tous, the more thoroughly must we seek to release our minds and the minds of thoseabout us from them and cut off all thought of a return.We cannot compromise with these vestiges of the ancient order and be faithfulservants of the new. Whatever we retain of them will come back to life and growagain. It is no good to operate for cancer unless the whole growth is removed.Leave a crown about and presently you will find it being worn by someoneresolved to be a king. Keep the name and image of a god without a distinctmuseum label and sooner or later you will discover a worshipper on his knees toit and be lucky not to find a human sacrifice upon the altar. Wave a flag and itwill wrap about you. Of yourself even more than of the community is this true;these can be no half measures. You have not yet completed your escape to theOpen Conspiracy from the cities of the plain while it is still possible for youto take a single backward glance."},{"pageContent":"XIV. — THE OPEN CONSPIRACY BEGINS AS A MOVEMENT OF DISCUSSION, EXPLANATION, ANDPROPAGANDAA NEW and happier world, a world community, is awakening, within the body of theold order, to the possibility of its emergence. Our phrase, \"the OpenConspiracy\" is merely a name for that awakening. To begin with, the OpenConspiracy is necessarily a group of ideas.It is a system of modern ideas which has been growing together in the lastquarter of the century, and particularly since the war. It is the reaction of arapidly progressing biological conception of life and of enlarged historicalrealizations upon the needs and urgencies of the times. In this book we areattempting to define this system and to give it this provisional name.Essentially at first it is a dissemination of this new ideology that must occur.The statement must be tried over and spread before a widening circle of people.Since the idea of the Open Conspiracy rests upon and arises out of a synthesisof historical, biological, and sociological realizations, we may look for theserealizations already in the case of people with sound knowledge in these fields;such people will be prepared for acquiescence without any explanatory work;there is nothing to set out to them beyond the suggestion that it is time theybecame actively conscious of where they stand. They constitute already the OpenConspiracy in an unorganized solution, and they will not so much adhere as admitto themselves and others their state of mind. They will say, \"We knew all that.\"Directly we pass beyond that comparatively restricted world, however, we findthat we have to deal with partial knowledge, with distorted views, or with blankignorance, and that a revision and extension of historical and biological ideasand a Considerable elucidation of economic misconceptions have to be undertaken.Such people have to be brought up to date with their information.I have told already how I have schemed out a group of writings to embody thenecessary ideas of the new time in a form adapted to the current reading public;I have made a sort of provisional \"Bible,\" so to speak, for some factors atleast in the Open Conspiracy. It is an early sketch. As the current readingpublic changes, all this work will become obsolescent so far as its present formand method go. But not so far as its substantial method goes. That I believewill remain.Ultimately this developing mass of biological, historical, and economicinformation and suggestion must be incorporated in general education if the OpenConspiracy is to come to its own. At present this propaganda has to go on amongadolescents and adults because of the backwardness and political conservatism ofexisting educational organizations. Most real modern education now is done inspite of the schools and to correct the misconceptions established by theschools. But what will begin as adult propaganda must pass into a kultur-kampfto win our educational machinery from reaction and the conservation of outwornideas and attitudes to the cause of world reconstruction. The Open Conspiracyitself can never be imprisoned and fixed in the form of an organization, buteverywhere Open Conspirators should be organizing themselves for educationalreform.And also within the influence of this comprehensive project there will be allsorts of groupings for study and progressive activity. One can presuppose theformation of groups of friends, of family groups, of students and employees orother sorts of people, meeting and conversing frequently in the course of theirnormal occupations, who will exchange views and find themselves in agreementupon this idea of a constructive change of the world as the guiding form ofhuman activities.Fundamentally important issues upon which unanimity must be achieved from theoutset are:Firstly, the entirely provisional nature of all existing governments, and theentirely provisional nature, therefore, of all loyalties associated therewith;Secondly, the supreme importance of population control in human biology and thepossibility it affords us of a release from the pressure of the struggle forexistence on ourselves; andThirdly, the urgent necessity of protective resistance against the presenttraditional drift towards war.People who do not grasp the vital significance of these test issues do notreally begin to understand the Open Conspiracy. Groups coming into agreementupon these matters, and upon their general interpretation of history, will be ina position to seek adherents, enlarge themselves, and attempt to establishcommunication and co-operation with kindred groups for common ends. They cantake up a variety of activities to develop a sense and habit of combined actionand feel their way to greater enterprises.We have seen already that the Open Conspiracy must be heterogeneous in origin.Its initial groupings and associations will be of no uniform pattern. They willbe of a very different size, average age, social experience, and influence.Their particular activities will be determined by the things. Their diversequalities and influences will express themselves by diverse attempts atorganization, each effective in its own sphere. A group or movement of studentsmay find itself capable of little more than self-education and personalpropaganda; a handful of middle-class people in small town may find its smallresources fully engaged at first in such things as, for example, seeing thatdesirable literature is available for sale or in local public library,protecting books and news vendors from suppression, or influencing localteachers. Most parents of school children can press for the teaching ofuniversal history and sound biology and protest against the inculcation ofaggressive patriotism. There is much scope for the single individual in thisdirection. On the other hand, a group of ampler experience and resources mayundertake the printing, publication, and distribution of literature, andexercise considerable influence upon public opinion in turning education in theright direction. The League of Nations movement, the Birth Control movement, andmost radical and socialist societies, are fields into which Open Conspiratorsmay go to find adherents more than half prepared for their wider outlook. TheOpen Conspiracy is a fuller and ampler movement into which these incompleteactivities must necessarily merge as its idea takes possession of men'simaginations.From the outset, the Open Conspiracy will set its face against militarism. Thereis a plain present need for the organization now, before war comes again, of anopen and explicit refusal to serve in any war—or at most to serve in war,directly or indirectly, only after the issue has been fully and fairly submittedto arbitration. The time for a conscientious objection to war service ismanifestly before and not after the onset of war. People who have by theirsilence acquiesced in a belligerent foreign policy right up to the onset of war,have little to complain of if they are then compelled to serve. And a refusal toparticipate with one's country in warfare is a preposterously incomplete gestureunless it is rounded off by the deliberate advocacy of a world pax, a worldeconomic control, and a restrained population, such as the idea of the OpenConspiracy embodies.The putting upon record of its members' reservation of themselves from any orall of the military obligations that may be thrust upon the country by militaryand diplomatic effort, might very conceivably be the first considerable overtact of many Open Conspiracy groups. It would supply the practical incentive tobring many of them together in the first place. It would necessitate thecreation of regional or national ad hoc committees for the establishment of acollective legal and political defensive for this dissent from current militantnationalism. It would bring the Open Conspiracy very early out of the provinceof discussion into the field of practical conflict. It would from the outsetinvest it with a very necessary quality of present applicability.The anticipatory repudiation of military service, so far as this last may beimposed by existing governments in their factitious international rivalries,need not necessarily involve a denial of the need of military action on behalfof the world commonweal for the suppression of nationalist brigandage, nor needit prevent the military training of Open Conspirators. It is simply thepractical form of assertion that the normal militant diplomacy and warfare ofthe present time are offences against civilization, processes in the nature ofbrigandage, sedition, and civil war, and that serious men cannot be expected toplay anything but a röle of disapproval, non-participation, or active preventiontowards them. Our loyalty to our current government, we would intimate, issubject to its sane and adult behaviour.These educational and propagandist groups drawing together into an organizedresistance to militarism and to the excessive control of individuals by themakeshift governments of to-day, constitute at most only the earliest and moreelementary grade of the Open Conspiracy, and we will presently go on to considerthe more specialized and constructive forms its effort must evoke. Before doingso, however, we may say a little more about the structure and method of thesepossible initiatory groupings.Since they are bound to be different and miscellaneous in form, size, quality,and ability, any early attempts to organize them into common general action oreven into regular common gatherings are to be deprecated. There should be manytypes of groups. Collective action had better for a time - perhaps for a longtime—be undertaken not through the merging of groups but through the formationof ad hoc associations for definitely specialized ends, all making for the newworld civilization. Open Conspirators will come into these associations to makea contribution very much as people come into limited liability companies, thatis to say with a subscription and not with their whole capital. A comprehensiveorganization attempting from the first to cover all activities would necessarilyrest upon and promote one prevalent pattern of activity and hamper or estrangethe more original and interesting forms. It would develop a premature orthodoxy,it would cease almost at once to be creative, and it would begin to form a crustof tradition. It would become anchylosed. With the dreadful examples ofChristianity and Communism before us, we must insist that the idea of the OpenConspiracy ever becoming a single organization must be dismissed from the mind.It is a movement, yes, a system of purposes, but its end is a free and living,if unified, world.At the utmost seven broad principles may be stated as defining the OpenConspiracy and holding it together. And it is possible even of these, one, theseventh, may be, if not too restrictive, at least unnecessary. To the writer itseems unavoidable because it is so intimately associated with that continualdying out of tradition upon which our hopes for an unencumbered and expandinghuman future rest.(1) The complete assertion, practical as well as theoretical, of the provisionalnature of existing governments and of our acquiescence in them;(2) The resolve to minimize by all available means the conflicts of thesegovernments, their militant use of individuals and property, and theirinterferences with the establishment of a world economic system;(3) The determination to replace private, local or national ownership of atleast credit, transport, and staple production by a responsible worlddirectorate serving the common ends of the race;(4) The practical recognition of the necessity for world biological controls,for example, of population and disease;(5) The support of a minimum standard of individual freedom and welfare in theworld; and(6) The supreme duty of subordinating the personal career to the creation of aworld directorate capable of these tasks and to the general advancement of humanknowledge, capacity, and power;(7) The admission therewith that our immortality is conditional and lies in therace and not in our individual selves."},{"pageContent":"XV. — EARLY CONSTRUCTIVE WORK OF THE OPEN CONSPIRACYIN such terms we may sketch the practicable and possible opening phase of theOpen Conspiracy.We do not present it as a movement initiated by any individual or radiating fromany particular centre. In this book we are not starting something; we aredescribing and participating in something which has started. It arises naturallyand necessarily from the present increase of knowledge and the broadeningoutlook of many minds throughout the world, and gradually it becomes consciousof itself. It is reasonable therefore to anticipate its appearance all over theworld in sporadic mutually independent groupings and movements, and to recognizenot only that they will be extremely various, but that many of them will trailwith them racial and regional habits and characteristics which will only beshaken off as its cosmopolitan character becomes imperatively evident.The passage from the partial anticipations of the Open Conspiracy that alreadyabound everywhere to its complete and completely self-conscious statement may bemade by almost imperceptible degrees. To-day it may seem no more than avisionary idea; to-morrow it may be realized as a world-wide force of opinionand will. People will pass with no great inconsistency from saying that the OpenConspiracy is impossible to saying that it has always been plain and clear tothem, that to this fashion they have shaped their lives as long as they canremember.In its opening phase, in the day of small things, quite minor accidents may helpor delay the clear definition and popularization of its main ideas. The changingpattern of public events may disperse or concentrate attention upon it, or itmay win the early adherence of men of exceptional resources, energy, or ability.It is impossible to foretell the speed of its advance. Its development may beslower or faster, direct or devious, but the logic of accumulating realizationsthrusts it forward, will persist in thrusting it on, and sooner or later it willbe discovered, conscious and potent, the working religion of most sane andenergetic people.Meanwhile our supreme virtues must be faith and persistence.So far we have considered only two of the main activities of the OpenConspiracy, the one being its propaganda of confidence in the possible worldcommonweal, and the other its immediate practical attempt to systematizeresistance to militant and competitive imperialism and nationalism. But suchthings are merely its groundwork undertakings; they do no more than clear thesite and make the atmosphere possible for its organized constructive efforts.Directly we turn to that, we turn to questions of special knowledge, specialeffort, and special organization.Let us consider first the general advancement of science, the protection andsupport of scientific research, and the diffusion of scientific knowledge. Thesethings fall within the normal scheme of duty for the members of the OpenConspiracy. The world of science and experiment is the region of origin ofnearly all the great initiatives that characterize our times; the OpenConspiracy owes its inspiration, its existence, its form and direction entirelyto the changes of condition these initiatives have brought about, and yet alarge number of scientific workers live outside the sphere of sympathy in whichwe may expect the Open Conspiracy to materialize, and collectively theirpolitical and social influence upon the community is extraordinarily small.Having regard to the immensity of its contributions and the incalculable valueof its promise to the modern community, science—research, that is, and thediffusion of scientific knowledge—is extraordinarily neglected, starved, andthreatened by hostile interference. This is largely because scientific work hasno strong unifying organization and cannot in itself develop such anorganization.Science is a hard mistress, and the first condition of successful scientificwork is that the scientific man should stick to his research. The world ofscience is therefore in itself, at its core, a miscellany of specialists, oftenvery ungracious specialists, and, rather than offer him help and co-operation,it calls for understanding, tolerance, and service from the man of generalintelligence and wider purpose. The company of scientific men is less like ahost of guiding angels than like a swarm of marvellous bees --endowed withstings—which must be hived and cherished and multiplied by the Open Conspiracy.But so soon as we have the Open Conspiracy at work, putting its plainly andoffering its developing ideas and activities to those most preciouslypreoccupied men, then reasonably, when it involves no special trouble for them,when it is the line of least resistance for them, they may be expected to fallin with its convenient and helpful aims and find in it what they have hithertolacked, a common system of political and social concepts to hold them together.When that stage is reached, we shall be saved such spectacles of intellectualprostitution as the last Great War offered, when men of science were herdedblinking from their laboratories to curse one another upon nationalist lines,and when after the war stupid and wicked barriers were set up to the freecommunication of knowledge by the exclusion of scientific men of this or thatnationality from international scientific gatherings. The Open Conspiracy musthelp the man of science to realize, what at present he fails most astonishinglyto realize, that he belongs to a greater comity than any king or presidentrepresents to-day, and so prepare him for better behaviour in the next season oftrial.The formation of groups in, and not only in, but about and in relation to, thescientific world, which will add to those first main activities of the OpenConspiracy, propaganda and pacificism, a special attention to the needs ofscientific work, may be enlarged upon with advantage here, because it willillustrate quite typically the idea of a special work carried on in relation toa general activity, which is the subject of this section.The Open Conspiracy extends its invitation to all sorts and conditions of men,but the service of scientific progress is for those only who are speciallyequipped or who are sufficiently interested to equip themselves. For scientificwork there is first of all a great need of endowment and the setting up oflaboratories, observatories, experimental stations, and the like, in all partsof the world. Numbers of men and women capable of scientific work never achieveit for want of the stimulus of opportunity afforded by endowment. Few contriveto create their own opportunities. The essential man of science is very rarelyan able collector or administrator of money, and anyhow, the detailed work oforganization is a grave call upon his special mental energy. But many mencapable of a broad and intelligent appreciation of scientific work, but notcapable of the peculiar intensities of research, have the gift of extractingmoney from private and public sources, and it is for them to use that giftmodestly and generously in providing the framework for those more especiallyendowed.And there is already a steadily increasing need for the proper storage andindexing of scientific results, and every fresh worker enhances it. Quite aconsiderable amount of scientific work goes fruitless or is needlessly repeatedbecause of the growing volume of publication, and men make discoveries in thefield of reality only to lose them again in the lumber room of record. Here is asecond line of activity to which the Open Conspirator with a scientific bias maydirect his attention.A third line is the liaison work between the man of science and the commonintelligent man; the promotion of publications which will either state thesubstance, implications and consequences of new work in the vulgar tongue, or,if that is impossible, train the general run of people to the new idioms andtechnicalities which need to be incorporated with the vulgar tongue if it isstill to serve its ends as a means of intellectual intercourse.Through special ad hoc organizations, societies for the promotion of Research,for Research Defence, for World Indexing, for the translation of ScientificPapers, for the Diffusion of New Knowledge, the surplus energies of a greatnumber of Open Conspirators can be directed to entirely creative ends and a newworld system of scientific work built up, within which such dear oldinstitutions as the Royal Society of London, the various European Academies ofScience and the like, now overgrown and inadequate, can maintain their venerablepride in themselves, their mellowing prestige, and their distinguishedexclusiveness, without their present privilege of inflicting cramping slightsand restrictions upon the more abundant scientific activities of to-day.So in relation to science—and here the word is being used in its narroweraccepted meaning for what is often spoken of as pure science, the search forphysical and biological realities, uncomplicated by moral, social, and\"practical\" considerations—we evoke a conception of the Open Conspiracy asproducing groups of socially associated individuals, who engage primarily in thegeneral basic activities of the Conspiracy and adhere to and promote the sevenbroad principles summarized at the end of Chapter Fourteen, but who work alsowith the larger part of their energies, through international and cosmopolitansocieties and in a multitude of special ways, for the establishment of anenduring and progressive world organization of pure research. They will havecome to this special work because their distinctive gifts, their inclinations,their positions and opportunities have indicated it as theirs.Now a very parallel system of Open Conspiracy groups is conceivable, in relationto business and industrial life. It would necessarily be a vastly bulkier andmore heterogeneous system of groups, but otherwise the analogy is complete. Herewe imagine those people whose gifts, inclinations, positions and opportunitiesas directors, workers, or associates give them an exceptional insight into andinfluence in the processes of producing and distributing commodities, can alsobe drawn together into groups within the Open Conspiracy. But these groups willbe concerned with the huge and more complicated problems of the processes bywhich even now the small isolated individual adventures in production andtrading that constituted the economic life of former civilizations, are givingplace to larger, better instructed, better planned industrial organizations,whose operations and combinations become at last world wide.The amalgamations and combinations, the substitution of large-scale business formultitudes of small-scale businesses, which are going on now, go on with all thecruelty and disregards of a natural process. If a man is to profit and survive,these unconscious blunderings—which now stagger towards but which may neverattain world organization—much be watched, controlled, mastered, and directed.As uncertainty diminishes, the quality of adventure and the amount of wastediminish also, and large speculative profits are no longer possible orjustifiable. The transition from speculative adventure to organized foresight inthe common interest, in the whole world of economic life, is the substantialtask of the Open Conspiracy. And it is these specially interested and equippedgroups, and not the movement as a whole, which may best begin the attack uponthese fundamental readjustments.The various Socialist movements of the nineteenth and earlier twentiethcenturies had this in common, that they sought to replace the \"private owner\" inmost or all economic interests by some vaguely apprehended \"public owner.\" This,following the democratic disposition of the times, was commonly conceived of asan elected body, a municipality, the parliamentary state or what not. There weremunicipal socialists, \"nationalizing\" socialists, imperial socialists. In themystic teachings of the Marxist, the collective owner was to be \"thedictatorship of the proletariat.\" Production for profit was denounced. Thecontemporary mind realizes the evils of production for profit and of theindiscriminate scrambling of private ownership more fully than ever before, butit has a completer realization and a certain accumulation of experience in thedifficulties of organizing that larger ownership we desire. Private ownershipmay not be altogether evil as a provisional stage, even if it has no more in itsfavour than the ability to transcend political boundaries.Moreover—and here again the democratic prepossessions of the nineteenth centurycome in—the Socialist movements sought to make every single adherent a reformerand a propagandist of economic methods. In order to do so, it was necessary tosimplify economic processes to the crudity of nursery toys, and the intricateinterplay of will and desire in enterprise, normal employment, and direction, inquestions of ownership, wages, credit, and money, was reduced to a childishfable of surplus value wickedly appropriated. The Open Conspiracy is not so mucha socialism as a more comprehensive offspring which has eaten and assimilatedwhatever was digestible of its socialist forbears. It turns to biology forguidance towards the regulation of quantity and a controlled distribution of thehuman population of the world, and it judges all the subsidiary aspects ofproperty and pay by the criterion of most efficient production and distributionin relation to the indications thus obtained.These economic groups, then, of the Open Conspiracy, which may come indeed to bea large part of the Open Conspiracy, will be working in that vast task ofeconomic reconstruction—which from the point of view of the older socialism wasthe sole task before mankind. They will be conducting experiments and observingprocesses according to their opportunities. Through ad hoc societies andjournals they will be comparing and examining their methods and preparingreports and clear information for the movement at large. The whole question ofmoney and monetary methods in our modern communities, so extraordinarilydisregarded in socialist literature, will be examined under the assumption thatmoney is the token of the community's obligation, direct or indirect, to anindividual, and credit its permission to deal freely with material.The whole psychology of industry and industrial relationship needs to be revisedand restated in terms of the collective efficiency and welfare of mankind. Andjust as far as can be contrived, the counsel and the confidences of those whonow direct great industrial and financial operations will be invoked. The firstspecial task of a banker, or a bank clerk for that matter, who joins the OpenConspiracy, will be to answer the questions: \"What is a bank?\" \"What are yougoing to do about it?\" \"What have we to do about it?\" The first questions to amanufacturer will be: \"What are you making and why?\" and \"What are you and we todo about it?\" Instead of the crude proposals to \"expropriate\" and \"take over bythe State\" of the primitive socialism, the Open Conspiracy will build up anencyclopædic conception of the modern economic complex as a labyrinthinepseudo-system progressively eliminating waste and working its way alongmultitudinous channels towards unity, towards clarity of purpose and method,towards abundant productivity and efficient social service.Let us come back now for a paragraph or so to the ordinary adherent to the OpenConspiracy, the adherent considered not in relation to his special aptitudes andservices, but in relation to the movement as a whole and to those specialconstructive organizations outside his own field. It will be his duty to keephis mind in touch with the progressing concepts of the scientific work so far ashe is able and with the larger issues of the economic reconstruction that isafoot, to take his cues from the special groups and organizations engaged uponthat work, and to help where he finds his opportunity and when there is a callupon him. But no adherent of the Open Conspiracy can remain merely andcompletely an ordinary adherent. There can be no pawns in the game of the OpenConspiracy, no \"cannon fodder\" in its war. A special activity, quite as much asa general understanding, is demanded from everyone who looks creatively towardsthe future of mankind.We have instanced first the fine and distinctive world organization of purescience, and then the huge massive movement towards co-operating unity of aim inthe economic life, until at last the production and distribution of staplenecessities is apprehended as one world business, and we have suggested thatthis latter movement may gradually pervade and incorporate a very great bulk ofhuman activities. But besides this fine current and this great torrent ofevolving activities and relationships there are also a very considerable varietyof other great functions in the community towards which Open Conspiracy groupsmust direct their organizing enquiries and suggestions in their common intentionof ultimately assimilating all the confused processes of to-day into a worldcommunity.For example, there must be a series of groups in close touch at one end withbiological science and at the other with the complex of economic activity, whowill be concerned specially with the practical administration of the biologicalinterests of the race, from food plants and industrial products to pestilencesand population. And another series of groups will gather together attention andenergy to focus them upon the educational process. We have already pointed outthat there is a strong disposition towards conservatism in normal educationalinstitutions. They preserve traditions rather than develop them. They are likelyto set up a considerable resistance to the reconstruction of the world outlookupon the threefold basis defined in Chapter Fourteen. This resistance must beattacked by special societies, by the establishment of competing schools, byhelp and promotion for enlightened teachers, and, wherever the attack isincompletely successful, it must be supplemented by the energetic diffusion ofeducational literature for adults, upon modern lines. The forces of the entiremovement may be mobilized in a variety of ways to bring pressure uponreactionary schools and institutions.A set of activities correlated with most of the directly creative ones will liethrough existing political and administrative bodies. The political work of theOpen Conspiracy must be conducted upon two levels and by entirely differentmethods. Its main political idea, its political strategy, is to weaken, efface,incorporate, or supersede existing governments. But there is also a tacticaldiversion of administrative powers and resources to economic and educationalarrangements of a modern type. Because a country or a district is inconvenientas a division and destined to ultimate absorption in some more comprehensive andeconomical system of government, that is no reason why its administration shouldnot be brought meanwhile into working co-operation with the development of theOpen Conspiracy. Free Trade nationalism in power is better than high tariffnationalism, and pacificist party liberalism better than aggressive partypatriotism.This evokes the anticipation of another series of groups, a group in everypossible political division, whose task it will be to organize the wholestrength of the Open Conspiracy in that division as an effective voting oragitating force. In many divisions this might soon become a sufficientlyconsiderable block to affect the attitudes and pledges of the nationalpoliticians. The organization of these political groups into provincial ornational conferences and systems would follow hard upon their appearance. Intheir programmes they would be guided by meetings and discussions with thespecifically economic, educational, biological, scientific and cultural groups,but they would also form their own special research bodies to work out theincessant problems of transition between the old type of locally centredadministrations and a developing world system of political controls.In the preceding chapter we sketched the first practicable first phase of theOpen Conspiracy as the propaganda of a group of interlocking ideas, a propagandaassociated with pacificist action. In the present chapter we have given a schemeof branching and amplifying development. In this scheme. this scheme of thesecond phase, we conceive of the Open Conspiracy as consisting of a greatmultitude and variety of overlapping groups, but now all organized forcollective political, social, and educational as well as propagandist action.They will recognize each other much more clearly than they did at first, andthey will have acquired a common name.The groups, however, almost all of them, will still have specific work also.Some will be organizing a sounder setting for scientific progress, someexploring new social and educational possibilities, many concentrated upon thisor that phase in the reorganization of the world's economic life, and so forth.The individual Open Conspirator may belong to one or more groups and in additionto the ad hoc societies and organizations which the movement will sustain, oftenin co-operation with partially sympathetic people still outside its ranks.The character of the Open Conspiracy will now be plainly displayed. It will havebecome a great world movement as wide-spread and evident as socialism orcommunism. It will have taken the place of these movements very largely. It willbe more than they were, it will be frankly a world religion. This large, looseassimilatory mass of movements, groups, and societies will be definitely andobviously attempting to swallow up the entire population of the world and becomethe new human community."},{"pageContent":"XVI. — EXISTING AND DEVELOPING MOVEMENTS WHICH ARE CONTRIBUTORY TO THE OPENCONSPIRACY AND WHICH MUST DEVELOP A COMMON CONSCIOUSNESS. THE PARABLE OFPROVINDER ISLANDA SUGGESTION has already been made in an earlier chapter of this essay which mayperhaps be expanded here a little more. It is that there already exist in theworld a considerable number of movements in industry, in political life, insocial matters, in education, which point in the same direction as the OpenConspiracy and are inspired by the same spirit. It will be interesting todiscuss how far some of these movements may not become confluent with others andby a mere process of logical completion identify themselves consciously with theOpen Conspiracy in its entirety.Consider, for example, the movement for a scientific study and control ofpopulation pressure, known popularly as the Birth Control movement. By itself,assuming existing political and economic conditions, this movement lays itselfopen to the charge of being no better than a scheme of \"race suicide.\" If apopulation in some area of high civilization attempts to restrict increase,organize its economic life upon methods of maximum individual productivity, andimpose order and beauty upon its entire territory, that region will becomeirresistibly attractive to any adjacent festering mass of low-grade, highlyreproductive population. The cheap humanity of the one community will make aconstant attack upon the other, affording facile servility, prostitutes,toilers, hand labour. Tariffs against sweated products, restriction ofimmigration, tensions leading at last to a war of defensive massacre areinevitable. The conquest of an illiterate, hungry, and incontinent multitude maybe almost as disastrous as defeat for the selecter race. Indeed, one finds thatin discussion the propagandists of Birth Control admit that their project mustbe universal or dysgenic. But yet quite a number of them do not follow up theseadmissions to their logical consequences, produce the lines and continue thecurves until the complete form of the Open Conspiracy appears. It will be thebusiness of the early Open Conspiracy propagandists to make them do so, and toinstall groups and representatives at every possible point of vantage in thismovement.And similarly the now very numerous associations for world peace halt in alarmon the edge of their own implications. World Peace remains a vast aspirationuntil there is some substitute for the present competition of states for marketsand raw material, and some restraint upon population pressure. League of NationsSocieties and all forms of pacificist organization are either futile orinsincere until they come into line with the complementary propositions of theOpen Conspiracy.The various Socialist movements again are partial projects professing at presentto be self-sufficient schemes. Most of them involve a pretence that national andpolitical forces are intangible phantoms, and that the primary issue ofpopulation pressure can be ignored. They produce one woolly scheme after anotherfor transferring the property in this, that, or the other economic plant andinterest from bodies of shareholders and company promoters to gangs ofpoliticians or syndicates of workers—to be steered to efficiency, it would seem,by pillars of cloud by day and pillars of fire by night. The communist party hastrained a whole generation of disciples to believe that the overthrow of avaguely apprehended \"Capitalism\" is the simple solution of all humandifficulties. No movement ever succeeded so completely in substituting phrasesfor thought. In Moscow communism has trampled \"Capitalism\" underfoot for teneventful years, and still finds all the problems of social and politicalconstruction before it.But as soon as the Socialist or Communist can be got to realize that hisrepudiation of private monopolization is not a complete programme but just apreliminary principle, he is ripe for the ampler concepts of the modern outlook.The Open Conspiracy is the natural inheritor of socialist and communistenthusiasms; it may be in control of Moscow before it is in control of New York.The Open Conspiracy may achieve the more or less complete amalgamation of allthe radical impulses in the Atlantic community of to-day. But its scope is notconfined to the variety of sympathetic movements which are brought to mind bythat loose word radical. In the past fifty years or so, while Socialists andCommunists have been denouncing the current processes of economic life in thesame invariable phrases and with the same undiscriminating animosity, theseprocesses have been undergoing the profoundest and most interesting changes.While socialist thought has recited its phrases, with witty rather thansubstantial variations, a thousand times as many clever people have been busyupon industrial, mercantile and financial processes. The Socialist stillreiterates that this greater body of intelligence has been merely seekingprivate gain, which has just as much truth in it as is necessary to make it anintoxicating lie. Everywhere competitive businesses have been giving way toamalgamated enterprises, marching towards monopoly, and personally ownedbusinesses to organizations so large as to acquire more and more the characterof publicly responsible bodies. In theory in Great Britain, banks are privatelyowned, and railway transport is privately owned, and they are run entirely forprofit—in practice their profit making is austerely restrained and theirproceedings are all the more sensitive to public welfare because they areoutside the direct control of party politicians.Now this transformation of business, trading, and finance has been somultitudinous and so rapid as to be still largely unconscious of itself.Intelligent men have gone from combination to combination and extended theirrange, year by year, without realizing how their activities were enlarging themto conspicuousness and responsibility. Economic organization is even now onlydiscovering itself for what it is. It has accepted incompatible existinginstitutions to its own great injury. It has been patriotic and broken its shinsagainst the tariff walls its patriotism has raised to hamper its own movementsit has been imperial and found itself taxed to the limits of its endurance,\"controlled\" by antiquated military and naval experts, and crippled altogether.The younger, more vigorous intelligences in the great business directorates ofto-day are beginning to realize the uncompleted implications of theirenterprise. A day will come when the gentlemen who are trying to control the oilsupplies of the world without reference to anything else except as a subsidiaryfactor in their game will be considered to be quaint characters. The ends of BigBusiness must carry Big Business into the Open Conspiracy just as surely asevery other creative and broadly organizing movement is carried.Now I know that to all this urging towards a unification of constructive effort,a great number of people will be disposed to a reply which will, I hope, be lesspopular in the future than it is at the present time. They will assume first anexpression of great sagacity, an elderly air. Then, smiling gently, they willask whether there is not something preposterously ambitious in looking at theproblem of life as one whole. Is it not wiser to concentrate our forces on morepracticable things, to attempt one thing at a time, not to antagonize the wholeorder of established things against our poor desires, to begin tentatively, torefrain from putting too great a strain upon people, to trust to the growingcommon sense of the world to adjust this or that line of progress to the generalscheme of things. Far better accomplish something definite here and there thanchallenge a general failure. That is, they declare, how reformers and creativethings have gone on in the past; that is how they are going on now; muddlingforward in a mild and confused and partially successful way. Why not trust themto go on like that? Let each man do his bit with a complete disregard of thelogical interlocking of progressive effort to which I have been drawingattention.Now I must confess that, popular as this style of argument is, it gives me sotedious a feeling that rather than argue against it in general terms I willresort to a parable. I will relate the story of the pig on Provinder Island.There was, you must understand, only one pig on Provinder Island, and Heavenknows how it got there, whether it escaped and swam ashore or was put ashorefrom some vessel suddenly converted to vegetarianism, I cannot imagine. At firstit was the only mammal there. But later on three sailors and a very small butobservant cabin boy were wrecked there, and after subsisting for a time on shellfish and roots they became aware of this pig. And simultaneously they becameaware of a nearly intolerable craving for bacon. The eldest of the three sailorsbegan to think of a ham he had met in his boyhood, a beautiful ham for which hisfather had had the caving knife specially sharpened; the second of the threesailors dreamed repeatedly of a roast loin of pork he had eaten at his sister'swedding, and the third's mind ran on chitterlings—I know not why. They sat abouttheir meagre fire and conferred and expatiated upon these things until theirmouths watered and the shell fish turned to water within them. What dreams cameto the cabin boy are unknown, for it was their custom to discourage hisconfidences. But he sat apart brooding and was at last moved to speech. \"Let ushunt that old pig,\" he said, \"and kill it.\"Now it may have been because it was the habit of these sailors to discourage thecabin boy and keep him in his place, but anyhow, for whatever reason it was, allthree sailors set themselves with one accord to oppose that proposal.\"Who spoke of killing the pig?\" said the eldest sailor loudly, looking round tosee if by any chance the pig was within hearing. \"Who spoke of killing the pig?You're the sort of silly young devil who jumps at ideas and hasn't no sense ofdifficulties. What I said was AM. All I want is just a Am to go with my rootsand sea salt. One Am. The Left Am. I don't want the right one, and I don'tpropose to get it. I've got a sense of proportion and a proper share of humour,and I know my limitations. I'm a sound, clear-headed, practical man. Am is whatI'm after, and if I can get that, I'm prepared to say Quits and let the rest ofthe pig alone. Who's for joining me in a Left Am Unt—a simple reasonable Left AmUnt—just to get One Left Am?Nobody answered him directly, but when his voice died away, the next sailor inorder of seniority took up the tale. \"That Boy,\" he said, \"will die of SwelledEd, and I pity him. My idea is to follow up the pig and get hold of a loin chop.Just simply a loin chop. A loin chop is good enough for me. It's—feasible. Muchmore feasible than a great Am. Here we are, we've got no gun, we've got no woodof a sort to make bows and arrows, we've got nothing but our clasp knives, andthat pig can run like Ell. It's ridiculous to think of killing that pig. But ifone didn't trouble him, if one kind of got into his confidence and crept nearhim and just quietly and insidiously went for his loin—just sort of as if onewas tickling him-one might get a loin chop almost before he knew of it.\"The third sailor sat crumpled up and downcast with his lean fingers tangled inhis shock of hair. \"Chitterlings,\" he murmured, \"chitterlings. I don't even wantto think of the pig.\"And the cabin boy pursued his own ideas in silence, for he deemed it unwise toprovoke his elders further.On these lines it was the three sailors set about the gratifying of their tastefor pork, each in his own way, separately and sanely and modestly. And each hadhis reward. The first sailor, after weeks of patience, got within arm's lengthof the pig and smacked that coveted left ham loud and good, and felt success wasnear. The other two heard the smack and the grunt of dismay half a mile away.But the pig, in a state of astonishment, carried the ham off out of reach, thereand then, and that was as close as the first sailor ever got to his objective.The roast loin hunter did no better. He came upon the pig asleep under a rockone day, and jumped upon the very loin he desired, but the pig bit him deeplyand septically, and displayed so much resentment that the question of a chop wasdropped forthwith and never again broached between them. And thereafter the armof the second sailor was bandaged and swelled up and went from bad to worse. Andas for the third sailor, it is doubtful whether he even got wind of achitterling from the start to the finish of this parable. The cabin boy,pursuing notions of his own, made a pitfall for the whole pig, but as the othersdid not help him, and as he was an excessively small—though shrewd—cabin boy, itwas a feeble and insufficient pitfall, and all it caught was the hunter ofchitterlings, who was wandering distraught. After which the hunter ofchitterlings, became a hunter of cabin boys, and the cabin boy's life, for allhis shrewdness, was precarious and unpleasant. He slept only in snatches andlearned the full bitterness of insight misunderstood.When at last a ship came to Provinder Island and took off the three men and thecabin boy, the pig was still bacon intact and quite gay and cheerful, and allfour castaways were in a very emaciated condition because at that season of theyear shell fish were rare, and edible roots were hard to find, and the pig wasvery much cleverer than they were in finding them and digging them up—let alonedigesting them.From which parable it may be gathered that a partial enterprise is not alwayswiser or more hopeful than a comprehensive one.And in the same manner, with myself in the röle of that minute but observantcabin boy, I would sustain the proposition that none of these movements ofpartial reconstruction has the sound common sense quality its supporterssuppose. All these movements are worth while if they can be taken into theworld-wide movement; all in isolation are futile. They will be overlaid and lostin the general drift. The policy of the whole hog is the best one, the sanestone, the easiest, and the most hopeful. If sufficient men and women ofintelligence can realize that simple truth and give up their lives to it,mankind may yet achieve a civilization and power and fullness of life beyond ourpresent dreams. If they do not, frustration will triumph, and war, violence, anda drivelling waste of time and strength and desire, more disgusting even thanwar, will be the lot of our race down through the ages to its emaciated andmiserable end.For this little planet of ours is quite off the course of any rescue ships, ifthe will in our species fails."},{"pageContent":"XVII. — THE CREATIVE HOME, SOCIALGROUP, AND SCHOOL: THE PRESENTWASTE OF IDEALISTIC WILLHUMAN society began with the family. The natural history of gregariousness is ahistory of the establishment of mutual toleration among human animals, so that alitter or a herd keeps together instead of breaking up. It is in the familygroup that the restraints, disciplines, and self-sacrifices which make humansociety possible were worked out and our fundamental prejudices established, andit is in the family group, enlarged perhaps in many respects, and more and moreresponsive to collective social influences, that our social life must berelearnt, generation after generation.Now in each generation the Open Conspiracy, until it can develop its ownreproductive methods, must remain a minority movement of intelligent converts. Aunified progressive world community demands its own type of home and training.It needs to have its fundamental concepts firmly established in as many minds aspossible and to guard its children from the infection of the old racial andnational hatreds and jealousies, old superstitions and bad mental habits, andbase interpretations of life. From its outset the Open Conspiracy will besetting itself to influence the existing educational machinery, but for a longtime it will find itself confronted in school and college by powerful religiousand political authorities determined to set back the children at the point oreven behind the point from which their patents made their escape. At best, theliberalism of the state-controlled schools will be a compromise. Originallyschools and colleges were transmitters of tradition and conservative forces. Sothey remain in essence to this day.Organized teaching has always aimed, and will always tend to guide, train, anddirect, the mind. The problem of reconstructing education so as to make it areleasing instead of a binding process has still to be solved. During the earlyphases of its struggle, therefore, the Open Conspiracy will be obliged to adopta certain sectarianism of domestic and social life in the interests of itschildren, to experiment in novel educational methods and educationalatmospheres, and it may even in many cases have to consider the grouping of itsfamilies and the establishment of its own schools. In many modern communities,the English-speaking states, for example, there is still liberty to establisheducational companies, running schools of a special type. In every country wherethat right does not exist it has to be fought for.There lies a great work for various groups of the Open Conspiracy. Successfulschools would become laboratories of educational methods and patterns for newstate schools. Necessarily for a time, but we may hope unconsciously, the OpenConspiracy children will become a social élite; from their first consciousmoments they will begin to think and talk among clear-headed people speakingdistinctly and behaving frankly, and it will be a waste and loss to put themback for the scholastic stage among their mentally indistinct and morallymuddled contemporaries. A phase when there will be a special educational systemfor the Open Conspiracy seems, therefore, to be indicated. Its children willlearn to speak, draw, think, compute lucidly and subtly, and into their vigorousminds they will take the broad concepts of history, biology, and mechanicalprogress, the basis of the new world, naturally and easily. Meanwhile, those whogrow up outside the advancing educational frontier of the Open Conspiracy willnever come under the full influence of its ideas, or they will get hold of themonly after a severe struggle against a mass of misrepresentations andelaborately instilled prejudices. An adolescent and adult educational campaign,to undo the fixations and suggestions of the normal conservative and reactionaryschools and colleges, is and will long remain an important part of the work ofthe Open Conspiracy.Always, as long as I can remember, there have been a dispute and invidiouscomparisons between the old and the young. The young find the old prey upon andrestrain them, and the old find the young shallow, disappointing, and aimless invivid contrast to their revised memories of their own early days. The presenttime is one in which these perennial accusations flower with exceptional vigour.But there does seem to be some truth in the statement that the facilities tolive frivolously are greater now than they have ever been for old and youngalike. For example, in the great modern communities that emerge now fromChristendom, there is a widespread disposition to regard Sunday as merely aholiday. But that was certainly not the original intention of Sunday. As we havenoted already in an earlier chapter, it was a day dedicated to the greaterissues of life. Now great multitudes of people do not even pretend to set asideany time at all to the greater issues of life. The greater issues are neglectedaltogether. The churches are neglected, and nothing of a unifying or exaltingsort takes their place.What the contemporary senior tells his junior to-day is perfectly correct. Inhis own youth, no serious impulse of his went to waste. He was not distracted bya thousand gay but petty temptations, and the local religious powers, whateverthey happened to be, seemed to believe in themselves more and made a morecomprehensive attack upon his conscience and imagination. Now the old faiths aredamaged and discredited, and the new and greater one, which is the OpenConspiracy, takes shape only gradually. A decade or so ago, socialism preachedits confident hopes, and patriotism and imperial pride shared its attraction forthe ever grave and passionate will of emergent youth. Now socialism anddemocracy are \"under revision\" and the flags that once waved so bravely reek ofpoison gas, are stiff with blood and mud and shameful with exposed dishonesties.Youth is what youth has always been, eager for fine interpretations of life,capable of splendid resolves. It has no natural disposition towards the shallowand confused life. Its demand as ever is, \"What am I to do with myself?\" But itcomes up out of its childhood to-day into a world of ruthless exposures andcynical pretensions. We are all a little ashamed of \"earnestness.\" The past tenyears have seen the shy and powerful idealism of youth at a loss and dismayedand ashamed as perhaps it has never been before. It is in the world still, butmasked, hiding even from itself in a whirl of small excitements and futile,defiant depravities.The old flags and faiths have lost their magic for the intelligence of theyoung; they can command it no more; it is in the mighty revolution to which theOpen Conspiracy directs itself that the youth of mankind must find its soul, ifever it is to find its soul again."},{"pageContent":"XVIII. — PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE OPEN CONSPIRACY INTO AWORLD CONTROL AND COMMONWEAL: THE HAZARDS OF THE ATTEMPTWE have now sketched out in these Blue Prints the methods by which the confusedradicalism and constructive forces of the present time may, can, and probablywill be drawn together about a core of modernized religious feeling into onegreat and multifarious creative effort. A way has been shown by which thiseffort may be developed from a mere propagandist campaign and a merely resistantprotest against contemporary militarism into an organized foreshadowing inresearch, publicity, and experiment in educational, economic, and politicalreconstructions, of that Pax Mundi which has become already the tantaliseddesire of great multitudes throughout the world. These foreshadowings andreconstructions will ignore and transcend the political boundaries of to-day.They will continually become more substantial as project passes into attempt andperformance. In phase after phase and at point after point, therefore, the OpenConspiracy will come to grips with the powers that sustain these boundaries.And it will not be merely topographical boundaries that will be passed. The OpenConspiracy will also be dissolving and repudiating many existing restrictionsupon conduct and many social prejudices. The Open Conspiracy proposes to end andshows how an end may be put to that huge substratum of underdeveloped,undereducated, subjugated, exploited, and frustrated lives upon which suchcivilization as the world has known hitherto has rested, and upon which most ofour social systems still rest.Whenever possible, the Open Conspiracy will advance by illumination andpersuasion. But it has to advance, and even from the outset, where it is notallowed to illuminate and persuade, it must fight. Its first fights willprobably be for the right to spread its system of ideas plainly and clearlythroughout the world.There is, I suppose, a flavour of treason about the assumption that anyestablished government is provisional, and a quality of immorality in anycriticism of accepted moral standards. Still more is the proposal, made even intimes of peace, to resist war levies and conscription an offence againstabsolute conceptions of loyalty. But the ampler wisdom of the modern Atlanticcommunities, already touched by premonitions of change and futurity, hascontinually enlarged the common liberties of thought for some generations, andit is doubtful if there will be any serious resistance to the dissemination ofthese views and the early organization of the Open Conspiracy in any of theEnglish-speaking communities or throughout the British Empire, in theScandinavian countries, or in such liberal-minded countries as Holland,Switzerland, republican Germany or France. France, in the hasty years after thewar, submitted to some repressive legislation against the discussion of birthcontrol or hostile criticism of the militarist attitude; but such a check uponmental freedom is altogether contrary to the clear and open quality of theFrench mind; in practice it has already been effectively repudiated by suchwriters as Victor Margueritte, and it is unlikely that there will be anyeffective suppression of the opening phases of the Open Conspiracy in France.This gives us a large portion of the existing civilized world in which men'sminds may be readjusted to the idea that their existing governments are in theposition of trustees for the greater government of the coming age. Throughoutthese communities it is conceivable that the structural lines of the worldcommunity may be materialized and established with only minor struggles, localboycotts, vigorous public controversies, normal legislative obstruction, socialpressure, and overt political activities. Police, jail, expulsions, and soforth, let alone outlawry and warfare, may scarcely be brought into thisstruggle upon the high civilized level of the Atlantic communities. But wherethey are brought in, the Open Conspiracy, to the best of its ability and thefull extent of its resources, must become a fighting force and organize itselfupon resistant lines.Non-resistance, the restriction of activities to moral suasion is no part of theprogramme of the Open Conspiracy. In the face of unscrupulous oppositioncreative ideas must become aggressive, must define their enemies and attackthem. By its own organizations or through the police and military strength ofgovernments amenable to its ideas, the movement is bound to find itself fightingfor open roads, open frontiers, freedom of speech, and the realities of peace inregions of oppression. The Open Conspiracy rests upon a disrespect fornationality, and there is no reason why it should tolerate noxious orobstructive governments because they hold their own in this or that patch ofhuman territory. It lies within the power of the Atlantic communities to imposepeace upon the world and secure unimpeded movement and free speech from end toend of the earth. This is a fact on which the Open Conspiracy must insist. TheEnglish-speaking states, France, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, the Scandinaviancountries, and Russia, given only a not very extravagant frankness ofunderstanding between them, and a common disposition towards the ideas of theOpen Conspiracy, could cease to arm against each other and still exert enoughstrength to impose disarmament and a respect for human freedom in every cornerof the planet. It is fantastic pedantry to wait for all the world to accedebefore all the world is pacified and policed.The most inconsistent factor in the liberal and radical thought of to-day is itsprejudice against the interference of highly developed modern states in theaffairs of less stable and less advanced regions. This is denounced as\"imperialism,\" and regarded as criminal. It may have assumed grotesque anddangerous forms under the now decaying traditions of national competition, butas the merger of the Atlantic states proceeds, the possibility and necessity ofbringing areas of misgovernment and disorder under world control increase. Agreat war like the war of 1914-1918 may never happen again. The common sense ofmankind may suffice to avert that. But there is still much actual warfare beforemankind, on the frontiers everywhere, against brigands, against ancientloyalties and traditions which will become at last no better than excuses forbrigandage and obstructive exaction. All the weight of the Open Conspiracy willbe on the side of the world order and against that sort of local independencewhich holds back its subject people from the citizenship of the world.But in this broad prospect of far-reaching political amalgamations under theimpulses of the Open Conspiracy lurk a thousand antagonisms and adverse chances,like the unsuspected gulleys and ravines and thickets in a wide and distantlandscape. We know not what unexpected chasms may presently be discovered. TheOpen Conspirator may realize that he is one of an advancing and victorious forceand still find himself outnumbered and outfought in his own particular corner ofthe battlefield. No one can yet estimate the possible strength of reactionagainst world unification; no one can foresee the extent of the divisions andconfusions that may arise among ourselves. The ideas in this book may spreadabout without any serious resistance in most civilized countries, but there arestill governments under which the persistent expression of such thoughts will bedealt with as crimes and bring men and women to prison, torment, and death.Nevertheless, they must be expressed.While the Open Conspiracy is no more than a discussion it may spread unopposedbecause it is disregarded. As a mainly passive resistance to militarism it maystill be tolerable. But as its knowledge and experience accumulate and itsorganization become more effective and aggressive, as it begins to lay handsupon education, upon social habits, upon business developments, as it proceedsto take over the organization of the community, it will marshal not only its ownforces but its enemies. A complex of interests will find themselves restrainedand threatened by it, and it may easily evoke that most dangerous of human massfeelings, fear. In ways quite unpredictable it may raise a storm against itselfbeyond all our present imaginings. Our conception of an almost bloodlessdomination of the Atlantic communities may be merely the confident dream of athinker whose thoughts have yet to be squarely challenged.We are not even sure of the common peace. Across the path of mankind the stormof another Great War may break, bringing with it for a time more brutalrepressions and vaster injuries even than its predecessor. The scaffoldings andwork sheds of the Open Conspiracy may fare violently in that tornado. Therestoration of progress may seem an almost hopeless struggle.It is no part of modern religion to incur needless hardship or go out of the wayto seek martyrdom. If we can do our work easily and happily, so it should bedone. But the work is not to be shirked because it cannot be done easily andhappily. The vision of a world at peace and liberated for an unending growth ofknowledge and power is worth every danger of the way. And since in this age ofconfusion we must live imperfectly and anyhow die, we may as well suffer, ifneed be, and die for a great end as for none. Never has the translation ofvision into realities been easy since the beginning of human effort. Theestablishment of the world community will surely exact a price --and who cantell what that price may be?—in toil, suffering, and blood."},{"pageContent":"XIX. — HUMAN LIFE IN THECOMING WORLD COMMUNITYTHE new life that the Open Conspiracy struggles to achieve through us for ourrace is first a life of liberations.The oppression of incessant toil can surely be lifted from everyone, and themiseries due to a great multitude of infections and disorders of nutrition andgrowth cease to be a part of human experience. Few people are perfectly healthynowadays except for brief periods of happiness, but the elation of physicalwell-being will some day be the common lot of mankind.And not only from natural evils will man be largely free. He will not be leftwith his soul tangled, haunted by monstrous and irrational fears and a prey tomalicious impulse. From his birth he will breathe sweetness and generosity anduse his mind and hands cleanly and exactly. He will feel better, will better,think better, see, taste, and hear better than men do now. His undersoul will nolonger be a mutinous cavern of ill-treated suppressions and of impulsesrepressed without understanding. All these releases are plainly possible forhim. They pass out of his tormented desire now, they elude and mock him, becausechance, confusion, and squalor rule his life. All the gifts of destiny areoverlaid and lost to him. He must still suspect and fear. Not one of us is yetas clear and free and happy within himself as most men will some day be. Beforemankind lies the prospect not only of health but of magnanimity.Within the peace and freedom that the Open Conspiracy is winning for us, allthese good things that escape us now may be ensured. A graver humanity,stronger, more lovely, longer lived, will learn and develop the ever enlargingpossibilities of its destiny. For the first time, the full beauty of this worldwill be revealed to its unhurried eyes. Its thoughts will be to our thoughts asthe thoughts of a man to the troubled mental experimenting of a child. And allthe best of us will be living on in that ampler life, as the child and thethings it tried and learnt still live in the man. When we were children, wecould not think or feel as we think and feel to-day, but to-day we can peer backand still recall something of the ignorances and guesses and wild hopes of thesenigh forgotten years.And so mankind, ourselves still living, but dispersed and reconstructed again inthe future, will recall with affection and understanding the desperate wishesand troubled efforts of our present state.How far can we anticipate the habitations and ways, the usages and adventures,the mighty employments, the ever increasing knowledge and power of the days tocome? No more than a child with its scribbling paper and its box of bricks canpicture or model the undertakings of its adult years. Our battle is withcruelties and frustrations, stupid, heavy and hateful things from which we shallescape at last, less like victors conquering a world than like sleepers awakingfrom a nightmare in the dawn. From any dream, however dismal and horrible, onecan escape by realizing that it is a dream; by saying, \"I will awake.\"The Open Conspiracy is the awaking of mankind from a nightmare, an infantilenightmare, of the struggle for existence and the inevitability of war. The lightof day thrusts between our eyelids, and the multitudinous sounds of morningclamour in our ears. A time will come when men will sit with history before themor with some old newspaper before them and ask incredulously, \"Was there eversuch a world?\"THE END"}]
