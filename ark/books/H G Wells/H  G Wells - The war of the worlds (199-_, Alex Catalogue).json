Called \"Bertie\" in the family, he was thefourth and last child of Joseph Wells (a former domestic gardener, and at thetime a shopkeeper and professional cricketer) and his wife Sarah Neal (a formerdomestic servant). The family was of the impoverished lower middle class. Aninheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold chinaand sporting goods, although it failed to prosper: the stock was old and wornout, and the location was poor. Joseph Wells managed to earn a meager income,but little of it came from the shop; Joseph received an unsteady amount of moneyfrom playing professional cricket for the Kent county team. Payment for skilledbowlers and batsmen came from voluntary donations afterwards, or from smallpayments from the clubs where matches were played.A defining incident of young Wells's life was an accident he had in 1874, whichleft him bedridden with a broken leg. To pass the time he started reading booksfrom the local library, brought to him by his father. He soon became devoted tothe other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulatedhis desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's CommercialAcademy, a private school founded in 1849 following the bankruptcy of Morley'searlier school. The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wellslater said, on producing copperplate handwriting and doing the sort of sumsuseful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877,his father, Joseph Wells, fractured his thigh. The accident effectively put anend to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as ashopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source offamily income.No longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought toplace their sons as apprentices in various occupations. From 1880 to 1883, Wellshad an unhappy apprenticeship as a draper at the Southsea Drapery Emporium,Hyde's. His experiences at Hyde's were later used as inspiration for some of hisnovel material The Wheels of Chance and Kipps, which delve into the life of adraper's apprentice as well as providing a critique of the world's distributionof wealth.Herbert's parents' marriage was a turbulent relationship: due primarily to hismother being a Protestant and his father a self-confessed freethinker. When hismother returned to work as a lady's maid (at Uppark, a country house in Sussex),one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have livingspace for her husband and children. Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separatelives: though they never divorced and neither ever developed extramaritalliaisons. As a consequence, Herbert's personal troubles increased as hesubsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist's assistant. Aftereach failure, he would arrive at Uppark – \"the bad shilling back again!\" as hesaid – and stay there until a fresh start could be arranged for him. Fortunatelyfor Herbert, Uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself,reading many classic works, including Plato's Republic, and More's Utopia. Thiswould be the beginning of Herbert George Wells's venture into literature.In October 1879 Wells's mother arranged through a distant relative, ArthurWilliams, for him to join the National School at Wookey in Somerset as apupil-teacher, a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children. InDecember that year, however, Williams was dismissed for irregularities in hisqualifications and Wells was returned to Uppark. After a short apprenticeship ata chemist in nearby Midhurst, and an even shorter stay as a boarder at MidhurstGrammar School, he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde's. In 1883 Wellspersuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship, taking anopportunity offered by Midhurst Grammar School again to become a pupil-teacher;his proficiency in Latin and Science during his previous, short stay had beenremembered.The years he spent in Southsea had been the most miserable of his life to thatpoint, but his good fortune at securing a position at Midhurst Grammar Schoolmeant that Wells could continue his self-education in earnest. The followingyear, Wells won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science (later the RoyalCollege of Science in South Kensington, now part of Imperial College London) inLondon, studying biology under Thomas Henry Huxley. As an alumnus, he laterhelped to set up the Royal College of Science Association, of which he becamethe first president in 1909. Wells studied in his new school until 1887 with aweekly allowance of twenty-one shillings (a guinea) thanks to his scholarship.This ought to have been a comfortable sum of money (at the time many workingclass families had \"round about a pound a week\" as their entire householdincome) yet in his Experiment in Autobiography, Wells speaks of constantly beinghungry, and indeed, photographs of him at the time show a youth very thin andmalnourished.He soon entered the Debating Society of the school. These years mark thebeginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society. At firstapproaching the subject through The Republic by Plato, he soon turned tocontemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed FabianSociety and free lectures delivered at Kelmscott House, the home of WilliamMorris. He was also among the founders of The Science School Journal, a schoolmagazine which allowed him to express his views on literature and society, aswell as trying his hand at fiction: the first version of his novel The TimeMachine was published in the journal under the title, The Chronic Argonauts. Theschool year 1886–1887 was the last year of his studies. In spite of havingpreviously successfully passed his exams in both Biology and Physics, his lackof interest in Geology resulted in his failure to pass and the subsequent lossof his scholarship.It was not until 1890 that Wells earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Zoologyfrom the University of London External Programme. In 1889–90 he managed to finda post as a teacher at Henley House School where he taught and admired A. A.Milne.Upon leaving the Normal School of Science, Wells was left without a source ofincome. His aunt Mary—his father's sister-in-law—invited him to stay with herfor a while, which solved his immediate problem of accommodation. During hisstay at his aunt's residence, he grew increasingly interested in her daughter,Isabel. He would later go on to court her.In 1891 Wells, married his cousin Isabel Mary Wells, but left her in 1894 forone of his students, Amy Catherine Robbins (known as Jane), whom he married in1895. Poor health took him to Sandgate, near Folkestone, where in 1901 heconstructed a large family home - Spade House. He had two sons with AmyCatherine: George Philip (known as \"Gip\") in 1901 (d.1985) and Frank Richard in1903.During his marriage to Amy Robbins, Wells had affairs with a number of women,including the American birth-control activist Margaret Sanger and novelistElizabeth von Arnim. In 1909 he had a daughter, Anna-Jane, with the writer AmberReeves, whose parents, William and Maud Pember Reeves, he had met through theFabian Society; and in 1914, a son, Anthony West (1914–1987), by the novelistand feminist Rebecca West, twenty-six years his junior. Despite Amy Catherine'sknowledge of some of these affairs, she remained married to Wells until herdeath in 1927. Wells also had affairs with Odette Keun and Moura Budberg.As one method of self-expression, Wells tended to sketch a lot. One commonlocation for these sketches was the endpapers and title pages of his owndiaries, and they covered a wide variety of topics, from political commentary tohis feelings toward his literary contemporaries and his current romanticinterests. During his marriage to Amy Catherine, whom he nicknamed Jane, hesketched a considerable number of pictures, many of them being overt comments ontheir marriage. It was during this period, and this period only, that he calledhis sketches \"picshuas.\" These picshuas have been the topic of study by Wellsscholars for many years, and recently a book was published on the subject.Wells's first non-fiction bestseller was Anticipations of the Reaction ofMechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought (1901). Whenoriginally serialised in a magazine it was subtitled, \"An Experiment inProphecy\", and is considered his most explicitly futuristic work. Anticipatingwhat the world would be like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both forits hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of population from citiesto suburbs; moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexualfreedom; the defeat of German militarism, and the existence of a European Union)and its misses (he did not expect successful aircraft before 1950, and averredthat \"my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything butsuffocate its crew and founder at sea\").His early novels, called \"scientific romances\", invented a number of themes nowclassic in science fiction in such works as The Time Machine, The Island ofDoctor Moreau, The Invisible Man, The War of the Worlds, When the Sleeper Wakes,and The First Men in the Moon. He also wrote other, non-fantastic novels thathave received critical acclaim including Kipps and the satire on Edwardianadvertising, Tono-Bungay.Wells wrote several dozen short stories and novellas, the best known of which is\"The Country of the Blind\" (1904). His short story \"The New Accelerator\" was theinspiration for the Star Trek episode Wink of an Eye.Though Tono-Bungay was not a science-fiction novel, radioactive decay plays asmall but consequential role in it. Radioactive decay plays a much larger rolein The World Set Free (1914). This book contains what is surely his biggestprophetic \"hit.\" Scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay ofradium releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years. The rate ofrelease is too slow to have practical utility, but the total amount released ishuge. Wells's novel revolves around an (unspecified) invention that acceleratesthe process of radioactive decay, producing bombs that explode with no more thanthe force of ordinary high explosive—but which \"continue to explode\" for days onend. \"Nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earliertwentieth century,\" he wrote, \"than the rapidity with which war was becomingimpossible... [but] they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in theirfumbling hands.\" Leó Szilárd acknowledged that the book inspired him to theorisethe nuclear chain reaction.Wells also wrote nonfiction. His bestselling three-volume work, The Outline ofHistory (1920), began a new era of popularised world history. It received amixed critical response from professional historians. Many other authorsfollowed with 'Outlines' of their own in other subjects. Wells reprised hisOutline in 1922 with a much shorter popular work, A Short History of the World,and two long efforts, The Science of Life (1930) and The Work, Wealth andHappiness of Mankind (1931). The 'Outlines' became sufficiently common for JamesThurber to parody the trend in his humorous essay, \"An Outline ofScientists\"—indeed, Wells's Outline of History remains in print with a new 2005edition, while A Short History of the World has been recently reedited (2006).From quite early in his career, he sought a better way to organise society, andwrote a number of Utopian novels. The first of these was A Modern Utopia (1905),which shows a worldwide utopia with \"no imports but meteorites, and no exportsat all\"; two travellers from our world fall into its alternate history. Theothers usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realisea better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a comet causing peopleto behave rationally and abandoning a European war (In the Days of the Comet(1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in The Shape of Thingsto Come (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 Alexander Korda film, Thingsto Come). This depicted, all too accurately, the impending World War, withcities being destroyed by aerial bombs. He also portrayed the rise of fascistdictators in The Autocracy of Mr Parham (1930) and The Holy Terror (1939),though in the former novel, the tale is revealed at the end to have been MrParham's dream vision.Wells contemplates the ideas of nature versus nurture and questions humanity inbooks such as The Island of Doctor Moreau. Not all his scientific romances endedin a happy Utopia, and in fact, Wells also wrote the first dystopia novel, Whenthe Sleeper Wakes (1899, rewritten as The Sleeper Awakes, 1910), which picturesa future society where the classes have become more and more separated, leadingto a revolt of the masses against the rulers. The Island of Doctor Moreau iseven darker. The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animalsvivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England;like Gulliver on his return from the Houyhnhnms, he finds himself unable toshake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts,slowly reverting to their animal natures.Wells also wrote the preface for the first edition of W. N. P. Barbellion'sdiaries, The Journal of a Disappointed Man, published in 1919. Since\"Barbellion\" was the real author's pen name, many reviewers believed Wells tohave been the true author of the Journal; Wells always denied this, despitebeing full of praise for the diaries, but the rumours persisted untilBarbellion's death later that year.In 1927, Florence Deeks sued Wells for infringement of copyright, claiming thathe had stolen much of the content of The Outline of History from a work, TheWeb, she had submitted to the Canadian Macmillan Company, but who held onto themanuscript for eight months before rejecting it. Despite numerous similaritiesin phrasing and factual errors, the court found the evidence inadequate anddismissed the case. A Privy Council report added that, as Deek's work had notbeen printed, there were no legal grounds at all for the action.In 1933 Wells predicted in The Shape of Things to Come that the world war hefeared would begin January 1940, a prediction which ultimately came true justfour months early, when the Second World War broke out in September 1939.In 1936, before the Royal Institution, Wells called for the compilation of aconstantly growing and changing World Encyclopedia, to be reviewed byoutstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being. In 1938, hepublished a collection of essays on the future organisation of knowledge andeducation, World Brain, including the essay, \"The Idea of a Permanent WorldEncyclopaedia.\"Near the end of the Second World War, Allied forces discovered that the SS hadcompiled lists of people slated for immediate arrest during the invasion ofBritain in the abandoned Operation Sea Lion, and Wells was included in thealphabetical list on the same page of \"The Black Book\" as Rebecca West. Wells,as president of the International PEN (Poets, Essayists, Novelists), had alreadyangered the Nazis by overseeing the expulsion of the German PEN club from theinternational body in 1934 following the German PEN's refusal to admit non-Aryanwriters to its membership.Seeking a more structured way to play war games, Wells also wrote Floor Games(1911) followed by Little Wars (1913). Little Wars is recognised today as thefirst recreational wargame and Wells is regarded by gamers and hobbyists as \"theFather of Miniature War Gaming\".Wells called his political views socialist. He was for a time a member of thesocialist Fabian Society, but broke with them as his creative politicalimagination, matching the originality shown in his fiction, outran theirs. Helater grew staunchly critical of them as having a poor understanding ofeconomics and educational reform. He ran as a Labour Party candidate for LondonUniversity in the 1922 and 1923 general elections after the death of his friendW. H. R. Rivers, but at that point his faith in the party was weak or uncertain.Social class was a theme in Wells's The Time Machine in which the Time Travellerspeaks of the future world, with its two races, as having evolved fromthe gradual widening of the present (19th century) merely temporary and socialdifference between the Capitalist and the Labourer ... Even now, does not anEast-end worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut offfrom the natural surface of the earth? Again, the exclusive tendency of richerpeople..is already leading to the closing, in their interest, of considerableportions of the surface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps halfthe prettier country is shut in against intrusion.Nevertheless, without irony, Wells has this very same Time Traveller speak interms antithetical to much of socialist thought, referring approvingly and as\"perfect\" and with no social problem unsolved, to an imagined world of starkclass division between the rich assured of their wealth and comfort, and therest of humanity assigned to lifelong toil.Once, life and property must have reached almost absolute safety. The rich hadbeen assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his life and work.No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no socialquestion left unsolved.His most consistent political ideal was the World State. He stated in hisautobiography that from 1900 onward he considered a World State inevitable. Heenvisioned the state to be a planned society that would advance science, endnationalism, and allow people to progress by merit rather than birth.He supported Britain in the First World War, despite his many criticisms ofBritish policy, and opposed, in 1916, moves for an early peace. In an essaypublished that year he acknowledged that he could not understand those Britishpacifists who were reconciled to \"handing over great blocks of the black andcoloured races to the [German Empire] to exploit and experiment upon\" and thatthe extent of his own pacifism depended in the first instance upon an armedpeace, with \"England keep[ing] to England and Germany to Germany\". Stateboundaries would be established according to natural ethnic affinities, ratherthan by planners in distant imperial capitals, and overseen by his envisagedworld alliance of states. In his book In the Fourth Year published in 1918 hesuggested how each nation of the world would elect, \"upon democratic lines\" byproportional representation, an electoral college in the manner of the UnitedStates of America, in turn to select its delegate to the proposed League ofNations. This international body he contrasted with imperialism, not only theimperialism of Germany, against which the war was being fought, but also theimperialism, which he considered more benign, of Britain and France.His values and political thinking came under increasing criticism from the 1920sand afterwards.The leadership of Joseph Stalin led to a change in his view of the Soviet Unioneven though his initial impression of Stalin himself was mixed. He disliked whathe saw as a narrow orthodoxy and obdurance to the facts in Stalin. However, hedid give him some praise saying in an article in the left-leaning New Statesmanmagazine, \"I have never met a man more fair, candid, and honest\" and making itclear that he felt the \"sinister\" image of Stalin was unfair or simply false.Nevertheless he judged Stalin's rule to be far too rigid, restrictive ofindependent thought, and blinkered to lead toward the Cosmopolis he hoped for.In the course of his visit to the Soviet Union in 1934, he debated the merits ofreformist socialism over Marxism-Leninism with Stalin.Wells believed in the theory of eugenics. In 1904 he discussed a survey paper byFrancis Galton, co-founder of eugenics, saying \"I believe ... It is in thesterilisation of failure, and not in the selection of successes for breeding,that the possibility of an improvement of the human stock lies.\" Somecontemporary supporters even suggested connections between the \"degenerate\"man-creatures portrayed in The Time Machine and Wells's eugenic beliefs. Forexample, the economist Irving Fisher said in a 1912 address to the EugenicsResearch Association: \"The Nordic race will ... vanish or lose its dominance if,in fact, the whole human race does not sink so low as to become the prey, as H.G. Wells images, of some less degenerate animal!\"Wells had given some moderate unenthusiastic support for Territorialism beforethe First World War, but later became a bitter opponent of the Zionist movementin general. He saw Zionism as an exclusive and separatist movement whichchallenged the collective solidarity he advocated in his vision of a worldstate. No supporter of Jewish identity in general, Wells had in his utopianwritings predicted the ultimate assimilation of Jewry.Wells brought his interest in Art & Design and politics together when he andother notables signed a memorandum to the Permanent Secretaries of the Board ofTrade, amongst others. The November 1914 memorandum expressed the signatoriesconcerns about British industrial design in the face of foreign competition. Thesuggestions were accepted, leading to the foundation of the Design andIndustries Association.In the end his contemporary political impact was limited. His efforts regardingthe League of Nations became a disappointment as the organisation turned out tobe a weak one unable to prevent World War II. The war itself increased thepessimistic side of his nature. In his last book Mind at the End of its Tether(1945) he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another speciesmight not be a bad idea. He also came to call the era \"The age of frustration.\"Wells wrote in his book God The Invisible King that his idea of God did not drawupon the traditional religions of the world: \"This book sets out as forcibly andexactly as possible the religious belief of the writer. [Which] is a profoundbelief in a personal and intimate God.\" Later in the work he aligns himself witha \"renascent or modern religion ... neither atheist nor Buddhist nor Mohammedannor Christian ... [that] he has found growing up in himself\".Of Christianity he has this to say: \"... it is not now true for me ... Everybelieving Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother ... but if systemicallyI called myself a Christian I feel that to most men I should imply too much andso tell a lie.\" Of other world religions he writes: \"All these religions aretrue for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is atrue thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked.Only they are not true for me to live in them ... They do not work for me\".He spent his final years venting his frustration at various targets whichincluded a neighbour who erected a large sign to a servicemen's club. As hedevoted his final decades toward causes which were largely rejected bycontemporaries, his literary reputation declined. G. K. Chesterton quipped: \"Mr.Wells is a born storyteller who has sold his birthright for a pot of message\".Wells was a diabetic, and a co-founder in 1934 of what is now Diabetes UK, theleading charity for people living with diabetes in the UK.On 28 October 1940 Wells was interviewed by Orson Welles, who two years previoushad performed an infamous radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds, on KTSAradio in San Antonio, Texas. In the interview, Wells admitted his surprise atthe widespread panic that resulted from the broadcast, but acknowledged his debtto Welles for increasing sales of one of his \"more obscure\" titles.He died of unspecified causes on 13 August 1946 at his home at 13 HanoverTerrace, Regent's Park, London. Some reports indicate the cause of death wasdiabetes or liver cancer. In his preface to the 1941 edition of The War in theAir, Wells had stated that his epitaph should be: \"I told you so. You damnedfools.\". He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 16 August 1946 and hisashes were scattered at sea. A commemorative blue plaque in his honour wasinstalled at his home in Regent's Park. As Taken From Wikipedia, May 2011: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.G._Wells"},{"pageContent":"PREFACEThe narrator (who is never named) is at an observatory in Ottershaw whenexplosions are seen on Mars, causing interest among the scientific community.Later a \"meteor\" lands on Horsell Common, southwest of London, near thenarrator's home in Woking, Surrey. He is among the first to discover that theobject is a space-going artificial cylinder. When the cylinder opens, theMartians (bulky, octopus-like creatures the size of a bear) briefly emerge, showdifficulty in coping with the Earth's atmosphere, and rapidly retreat into thecylinder, although a man who falls into the pit is apparently pulled in. A humandeputation (which includes the astronomer Ogilvy) moves towards the cylinderwith a white flag, but the Martians incinerate them with a heat-ray weapon,before beginning to assemble alien machinery.After the attack, the narrator takes his wife to Leatherhead to stay withrelatives until the threat is eliminated. The army has meanwhile set up guns,although the firing stops later. Upon returning home, he discovers the Martianshave assembled towering three-legged \"fighting-machines\" (Tripods), each armedwith a heat-ray and a chemical weapon: the so-called \"black smoke\". TheseTripods easily defeat army units positioned around the crater and proceed toattack surrounding communities. Fleeing the scene, the narrator meets aretreating artilleryman, who tells him that another cylinder has landed betweenWoking and Leatherhead, cutting the narrator off from his wife. The two men tryto escape together via Byfleet, but are separated at the Shepperton to WeybridgeFerry during a Martian attack on Shepperton. One of the Martian fightingmachines is brought down in the River Thames by British artillery, causing itshot heat-ray equipment to almost boil the water as the narrator and countlessothers try to cross the river into Middlesex, while the Martians escape.More cylinders land across southern England, and a panicked flight out of Londonbegins, including the narrator's brother who flees to the Essex coast afterBlack Smoke is used to devastate London. The torpedo ram HMS Thunder Childdestroys two tripods before being sunk by the Martians, though this allows theship carrying the narrator's brother and his two female travelling companions toescape to continental Europe. Shortly after, all organized resistance hasceased, and the Tripods roam the shattered landscape unhindered. Red weed, afast growing Martian form of vegetation, spreads over the landscape,aggressively overcoming the Earth's ecology, in much the same way as theMartians have overcome human civilization. The narrator takes refuge in a ruined building in Sheen shortlybefore a Martian cylinder lands nearby, trapping him with a mentally unstablecurate he had originally met near Shepperton. The curate has been traumatized bythe invasion and believes the Martians to be satanic creatures heralding theadvent of Armageddon. For the next several days, the narrator desperately triesto calm the clergyman, and avoid attracting attention from the patrollingTripods, while witnessing the Martians' daily routine, which includes feeding onhumans by direct blood transfusion and using a handling machine, which acts likea living creature. The curate's evangelical outbursts finally lead the Martiansto their hiding place despite the narrator resorting to violence in order tosilence him, and knocking him out. While the narrator escapes detection byhiding in the coal-cellar, the clergyman's unconscious body is dragged away.The Martians eventually depart from the scene. The Narrator leaves the destroyedbuilding and heads towards Central London. En route, he once again encountersthe artilleryman who entertains grandiose plans to rebuild civilizationunderground, but the artilleryman's quixotic nature is shown by the slowprogress of an unimpressive trench he has been digging. The narrator heads intoa deserted London and finally decides to give up his life by rushing towards theMartians, only to discover they, along with the Red Weed, have succumbed toterrestrial pathogenic bacteria, to which they have no immunity. He sees birdsfeeding of a Martian's rotting remains. He finds a dying martian calling'Ulla-ulla-ulla' at the peak of Primrose Hill, near Regent's Park in NorthLondon, and realizes the invading force is no longer a threat. At theconclusion, society begins to return to normal and the narrator returns to hishome to find himself unexpectedly reunited with his wife, who had thought himdead and vice versa.The War of the Worlds is written in a journalistic style, as if a factualaccount of the invasion, which helps to make the story reasonable. The chapterheadings are also similar to newspaper headlines. The narrator is a middle classscientific journalist living in Woking, south west of London, characteristicswhich make him very similar to Wells himself at the time of writing. TheNarrator describes most of the events from first hand observation, often withprecise and scientific detail, but also reports events later told to him by hisyounger brother, to provide a wider perspective on the invasion. The narrator,his wife, and his brother are not named; neither are the key characters of theartilleryman and the curate.While The War of the Worlds is a work of science fiction, much of its settingand premise was grounded in scientific ideas of the time, actual locations inSouthern England and aspects of Wells's everyday life in the 1890s.Wells trained as a science teacher during the latter half of the 1880s. One ofhis teachers was T. H. Huxley, famous as a major advocate of Darwinism. He latertaught science, and his first book was a biology textbook. He joined thescientific journal Nature as a reviewer in 1894. Much of his work is notable formaking contemporary ideas of science and technology easily understandable toreaders.The scientific fascinations of the novel are established in the opening chapter,where the narrator views Mars through a telescope, and Wells offers the image ofthe superior Martians having observed human affairs, as through watching tinyorganisms through a microscope. Ironically, it is microscopic Earth lifeformsthat finally prove deadly to the invasion force. In 1894 a French astronomerobserved a 'strange light' on Mars, and published his findings in the scientificjournal Nature on 2 August of that year. Wells used this observation to open thenovel, imagining these lights to be the launching of the Martian cylinderstowards Earth. American astronomer Percival Lowell published the book Mars in1895, suggesting features of the planet’s surface observed through telescopesmight be canals. He speculated that these might be irrigation channelsconstructed by a sentient life form to support existence on an arid, dyingworld, similar to that Wells suggests the Martians have left behind. The novelalso presents ideas related to Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection,both in specific ideas discussed by the narrator, and themes explored by thestory.Wells also wrote an essay titled 'Intelligence on Mars', published in 1896 inthe Saturday Review, which sets out many of the ideas for the Martians and theirplanet that are used almost unchanged in The War of the Worlds. In the essay hespeculates about the nature of the Martian inhabitants and how theirevolutionary progress might compare to humans. He also suggests that Mars, beingan older world than the Earth, might have become frozen and desolate, conditionsthat might encourage the Martians to find another planet on which to settle.In 1895, Wells was an established writer and he married his second wife,Catherine Robbins, moving with her to the town of Woking in Surrey. Here hespent his mornings walking or cycling in the surrounding countryside, and hisafternoons writing. The original idea for The War of the Worlds came from hisbrother, during one of these walks, pondering on what it might be like if alienbeings were to suddenly descend on the scene and start attacking itsinhabitants.Much of The War of the Worlds takes place around Woking and nearby suburbs. Theinitial landing site of the Martian invasion force, Horsell Common, was an openarea close to Wells's home. In the preface to the Atlantic edition of the novel,he wrote of his pleasure in riding a bicycle around the area, and imagining thedestruction of cottages and houses he saw, by the Martian heat-ray or the redweed. While writing the novel, Wells enjoyed shocking his friends by revealingdetails of the story, and how it was bringing total destruction to parts of theSouth London landscape that were familiar to them. The characters of theartilleryman, the curate and the medical student were also based onacquaintances in Woking and Surrey.In the present day, a 7 metre (23 feet) high sculpture of a tripod fightingmachine, entitled 'The Martian', based on the description in The War of theWorlds, stands in Crown Passage, close to the local railway station, in Wokingdesigned and constructed by artist, Michael Condron.His depiction of suburban late Victorian culture in the novel, was an accuratereflection of his own experiences at the time of writing. In the late 19thCentury the British Empire was the predominant colonial and military power onthe globe, making its domestic heart a poignant and terrifying starting pointfor an invasion by aliens with their own imperialist agenda. He also drew upon acommon fear which had emerged in the years approaching the turn of the century,known at the time as Fin de siècle or 'end of the age', which anticipatedapocalypse at midnight on the last day of 1899.In the late 1890s it was common for novels, prior to full volume publication, tobe serialised in magazines or newspapers, with each part of the serialisationending upon a cliff hanger to entice audiences to buy the next edition. This isa practice familiar from the first publication of Charles Dickens' novels in thenineteenth century. The War of the Worlds was first published in serialised formin Pearson's Magazine in 1897. Wells was paid ₤200 and Pearsons demanded to knowthe ending of the piece before committing to publish.The complete volume was published by William Heinemann in 1898 and has been inprint ever since. An unauthorised serialisation of the novel was published inthe United States prior to this, in New York in 1897. A pirated versioninvolving the Martians landing in New England was published by the Boston Postin 1898, which Wells protested against.The War of the Worlds was generally received very favourably by both readers andcritics upon its publication. There was however some criticism of the brutalnature of the events in the narrative.Between 1871 and 1914 over 60 works of fiction for adult readers describinginvasions of Great Britain were published. The seminal work was The Battle ofDorking (1871) by George Tomkyns Chesney, an army officer. The book portrays asurprise German attack, with a landing on the South coast of England, madepossible by the distraction of the Royal Navy in colonial patrols and the armyin an Irish insurrection. The German army makes short work of English militiaand rapidly marches to London. The story was published in Blackwood's Magazinein May 1871, and so popular that it was reprinted a month later as a pamphletwhich sold 80,000 copies.The appearance of this literature, much of which might be viewed as contemporarypropaganda, reflected the increasing feeling of anxiety and insecurity asinternational tensions between European Imperial powers escalated towards theoutbreak of the First World War. Across the decades, the nationality of theinvaders tended to vary, according to the most acutely perceived threat at thetime. In the 1870s, the Germans were the most common invaders. Towards the endof the nineteenth century, a period of strain on Anglo-French relations, and thesigning of a treaty between France and Russia, the French became the more commonmenace.There are a number of plot similarities between Wells's book and The Battle ofDorking. In both books, a ruthless enemy makes a devastating surprise attack,with the British armed forces helpless to stop its relentless advance and bothinvolve the destruction of the Home Counties of southern England. However, TheWar of the Worlds transcends the typical fascination of Invasion Literature withEuropean politics, the suitability of contemporary military technology to dealwith the armed forces of other nations, and international disputes, with itsintroduction of an alien adversary.Although much of Invasion Literature may have been less sophisticated andvisionary than Wells's novel, it was a useful, familiar genre to support thepublication success of the piece, attracting readers used to such tales. It mayalso have proved an important foundation for Wells's ideas, as he had never seenor fought in a war.Many novels focusing on life on other planets written close to 1900 echoscientific ideas of the time, including Pierre-Simon Laplace's nebularhypothesis, Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, and Gustav Kirchhoff'stheory of Spectroscopy. These scientific ideas combined to present thepossibility that planets are alike in composition and conditions for thedevelopment of species, which would likely lead to the emergence of life at asuitable geological age in a planet's development.By the time Wells came to write The War of the Worlds, there had been threecenturies of observation of Mars through telescopes. Galileo, in 1610, observedthe planet's phases and in 1666 Giovanni Cassini identified the polar ice caps.In 1878, Italian astronomer, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli observed geologicalfeatures which he called canali (Italian for \"channels\"). This was mistranslatedinto English as \"canals\" which, being artificial watercourses, fueled the beliefthat there was some sort of intelligent extraterrestrial life on the planet. Ithas been suggested in recent years, that the canals were actually the result ofa disease that made Giovanni see his own eye structure which he assumed werecanals. This further influenced American astronomer Percival Lowell.In 1895 Lowell published a book entitled Mars which speculated about an arid,dying landscape, whose inhabitants had been forced to build canals thousands ofmiles long to bring water from the polar caps to irrigate the remaining arableland. This formed the most advanced scientific ideas about the conditions on thered planet available to Wells at the time War of the Worlds was written. Theconcept of canals with flowing water was later proved erroneous by more accurateobservation of the planet, and later landings by Russian and American probessuch as the two Viking missions which found a lifeless world too cold for waterto exist in its liquid state.The Martians travel to the Earth in cylinders, apparently fired from a hugespace gun on the surface of Mars. This was a common representation of spacetravel in the nineteenth Century, and had also been used by Jules Verne in Fromthe Earth to the Moon. Modern scientific understanding renders this ideaimpractical, as it would be difficult to control the trajectory of the gunprecisely, and the force of the explosion necessary to propel the cylinder fromthe Martian surface to the Earth would likely kill the occupants.However, the 16 year old Robert H. Goddard was inspired by the story and spentmuch of his life inventing rockets. The research into rockets begun by Goddardeventually culminated in the Apollo program's manned landing on the moon.The Martian invasion proceeds with total disregard for human life; attacks onpeople and their environment are conducted with the heat-ray, with poisonousgas, the Black Smoke, delivered by rockets, and the Red Weed. These weaponsbrought almost total destruction to the capital of the British Empire and itssurrounding counties. It also involves the strategic destruction ofinfrastructure such as armament stores, railways and telegraph lines. It appearsto be intended to cause maximum casualties, terrorising and leaving humanswithout any will to resist. These tactics became more common as the 20th centuryprogressed, particularly from the 1930s with the development of mobile weaponsand technology capable of 'surgical strikes' on key military and civiliantargets.Wells's vision of a war bringing total destruction without moral limitations inThe War of the Worlds were not taken seriously by readers at the time ofpublication. It was seen as one of a number of fictions which proposed thisidea. He later expanded these ideas with more realistic novels such as When theSleeper Wakes (1899), The War in the Air (1908) and The World Set Free (1914).This kind of 'total war' did not become fully realised until the Second WorldWar, with the terrorising and evacuation of entire civilian populations, and theannihilation of cities.Wells's description of chemical weapons - the Black Smoke used by the Martianfighting machines to murder human beings en masse - was later a reality duringthe First World War, with the use of Mustard Gas. The Heat-Ray, used by theMartians to annihilate nineteenth century military technology, and causewidespread devastation, is a precursor to the concept of laser weaponry, nowwidely familiar. Comparison between lasers and the Heat-Ray was made as early asthe later half of the 1950s when lasers were still in development. Prototypes ofmobile laser weapons have been developed and it is now being researched andtested as a possible future weapon in space.Military theorists of the era, including the Royal Navy prior to the First WorldWar, had speculated about building a \"fighting-machine\" or a \"land dreadnought\".Wells later further explored the ideas of an armoured fighting vehicle in hisshort story \"The Land Ironclads\". There is a high level of science-fictionabstraction in Wells's description of Martian automotive technology; he stresseshow Martian machinery is devoid of wheels, using the \"muscle-like\" contractionsof metal discs along an axis to produce movement. However, the electroactivepolymers currently being developed for use in sensors and robotic actuators areactually a close match for Wells' description.Wells's dramatisation of an ecological threat posed by a rapidly growing alienorganism, the Red Weed, which spreads over the English landscape, also hasparallels in more modern times. Non-native species such as rabbits and pricklypear have been introduced into the Australian landscape, with a damaging impact.Another example is the spread of Kudzu in the United States. In the UnitedKingdom and in Ireland, Japanese knotweed has become an invasive species. It wasintroduced in the 19th century. However, these species were not introduced withthe intention of causing deliberate harm. As Taken From Wikipedia, May 2011:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_worlds"},{"pageContent":"BOOK I - THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER I - THE EVE OF THE WARNo one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that thisworld was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man'sand yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their variousconcerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a manwith a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm andmultiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro overthis globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empireover matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same.No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger,or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible orimprobable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departeddays. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars,perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yetacross the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those ofthe beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regardedthis earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at amean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it receives from thesun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebularhypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earthceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course. The factthat it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have acceleratedits cooling to the temperature at which life could begin. It has air and waterand all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to the veryend of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that intelligent life mighthave developed there far, or indeed at all, beyond its earthly level. Nor was itgenerally understood that since Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely aquarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily followsthat it is not only more distant from time's beginning but nearer its end.The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone farindeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is still largely a mystery,but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barelyapproaches that of our coldest winter. Its air is much more attenuated thanours, its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and asits slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole andperiodically inundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, whichto us is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for theinhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened theirintellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And looking acrossspace with instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of,they see, at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, amorning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey withwater, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through itsdrifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow,navy-crowded seas.And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least asalien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The intellectual side ofman already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence, and itwould seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars. Their world isfar gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life, but crowdedonly with what they regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is,indeed, their only escape from the destruction that, generation aftergeneration, creeps upon them.And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utterdestruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as thevanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races. The Tasmanians, inspite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war ofextermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are wesuch apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing subtlety--theirmathematical learning is evidently far in excess of ours--and to have carriedout their preparations with a well-nigh perfect unanimity. Had our instrumentspermitted it, we might have seen the gathering trouble far back in thenineteenth century. Men like Schiaparelli watched the red planet--it is odd,by-the-bye, that for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war--butfailed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped sowell. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated part ofthe disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of Nice, and then byother observers. English readers heard of it first in the issue of Nature datedAugust 2. I am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting ofthe huge gun, in the vast pit sunk into their planet, from which their shotswere fired at us. Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the siteof that outbreak during the next two oppositions.The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached opposition,Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange palpitating with theamazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet. Ithad occurred towards midnight of the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which hehad at once resorted, indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, movingwith an enormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of fire had becomeinvisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared it to a colossal puff offlame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, \"as flaming gasesrushed out of a gun.\"A singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet the next day there was nothing ofthis in the papers except a little note in the Daily Telegraph, and the worldwent in ignorance of one of the gravest dangers that ever threatened the humanrace. I might not have heard of the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, thewell-known astronomer, at Ottershaw. He was immensely excited at the news, andin the excess of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that nightin a scrutiny of the red planet.In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil verydistinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern throwing afeeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking of the clockwork ofthe telescope, the little slit in the roof--an oblong profundity with thestardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible. Lookingthrough the telescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planetswimming in the field. It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small andstill, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from theperfect round. But so little it was, so silvery warm--a pin's-head of light! Itwas as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with theactivity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view.As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance andrecede, but that was simply that my eye was tired. Forty millions of miles itwas from us--more than forty millions of miles of void. Few people realise theimmensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims.Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light, threetelescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the unfathomabledarkness of empty space. You know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlightnight. In a telescope it seems far profounder. And invisible to me because itwas so remote and small, flying swiftly and steadily towards me across thatincredible distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles,came the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that was to bring so muchstruggle and calamity and death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then as Iwatched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring missile.That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet. Isaw it. A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection of the outlinejust as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I told Ogilvy and he tookmy place. The night was warm and I was thirsty, and I went stretching my legsclumsily and feeling my way in the darkness, to the little table where thesiphon stood, while Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came outtowards us.That night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth from Mars,just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first one. I remember howI sat on the table there in the blackness, with patches of green and crimsonswimming before my eyes. I wished I had a light to smoke by, little suspectingthe meaning of the minute gleam I had seen and all that it would presently bringme. Ogilvy watched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern andwalked over to his house. Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertseyand all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and scoffedat the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were signalling us. His ideawas that meteorites might be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet, or thata huge volcanic explosion was in progress. He pointed out to me how unlikely itwas that organic evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacentplanets. \"The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one,\" he said. Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after aboutmidnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a flame each night.Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth has attempted to explain.It may be the gases of the firing caused the Martians inconvenience. Denseclouds of smoke or dust, visible through a powerful telescope on earth as littlegrey, fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness of the planet'satmosphere and obscured its more familiar features.Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular notesappeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon Mars. Theseriocomic periodical Punch, I remember, made a happy use of it in the politicalcartoon. And, all unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired at us drewearthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the empty gulfof space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me nowalmost incredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, mencould go about their petty concerns as they did. I remember how jubilant Markhamwas at securing a new photograph of the planet for the illustrated paper heedited in those days. People in these latter times scarcely realise theabundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers. For my own part, Iwas much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series ofpapers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as civilisationprogressed.One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000 milesaway) I went for a walk with my wife. It was starlight and I explained the Signsof the Zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a bright dot of light creepingzenithward, towards which so many telescopes were pointed. It was a warm night.Coming home, a party of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed ussinging and playing music. There were lights in the upper windows of the housesas the people went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came thesound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody bythe distance. My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red, green, andyellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky. It seemed so safeand tranquil."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER II - THE FALLING STARThen came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the morning,rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere.Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star. Albindescribed it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for someseconds. Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the heightof its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to himthat it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my Frenchwindows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved in those daysto look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet this strangest of allthings that ever came to earth from outer space must have fallen while I wassitting there, visible to me had I only looked up as it passed. Some of thosewho saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound. I myself heard nothingof that. Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fallof it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No oneseems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting star andwho was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common between Horsell,Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of finding it. Find it he did,soon after dawn, and not far from the sand pits. An enormous hole had been madeby the impact of the projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flungviolently in every direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and ahalf away. The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose againstthe dawn.The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the scatteredsplinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its descent. Theuncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder, caked over and its outlinesoftened by a thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation. It had a diameter of aboutthirty yards. He approached the mass, surprised at the size and more so at theshape, since most meteorites are rounded more or less completely. It was,however, still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his nearapproach. A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequalcooling of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that itmight be hollow.He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for itself,staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its unusual shape andcolour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its arrival.The early morning was wonderfully still, and the sun, just clearing the pinetrees towards Weybridge, was already warm. He did not remember hearing any birdsthat morning, there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds werethe faint movements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on thecommon.Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker, the ashyincrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the circular edge ofthe end. It was dropping off in flakes and raining down upon the sand. A largepiece suddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought his heart intohis mouth.For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the heat wasexcessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the Thingmore clearly. He fancied even then that the cooling of the body might accountfor this, but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash was fallingonly from the end of the cylinder.And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the cylinder wasrotating on its body. It was such a gradual movement that he discovered it onlythrough noticing that a black mark that had been near him five minutes ago wasnow at the other side of the circumference. Even then he scarcely understoodwhat this indicated, until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the blackmark jerk forward an inch or so. Then the thing came upon him in a flash. Thecylinder was artificial--hollow--with an end that screwed out! Something withinthe cylinder was unscrewing the top! \"Good heavens!\" said Ogilvy. \"There's a man in it--men in it! Half roasted todeath! Trying to escape!\" At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the flash upon Mars.The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he forgot theheat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn. But luckily the dullradiation arrested him before he could burn his hands on the still-glowingmetal. At that he stood irresolute for a moment, then turned, scrambled out ofthe pit, and set off running wildly into Woking. The time then must have beensomewhere about six o'clock. He met a waggoner and tried to make him understand,but the tale he told and his appearance were so wild--his hat had fallen off inthe pit--that the man simply drove on. He was equally unsuccessful with thepotman who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge.The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt toshut him into the taproom. That sobered him a little; and when he saw Henderson,the London journalist, in his garden, he called over the palings and madehimself understood. \"Henderson,\" he called, \"you saw that shooting star last night?\" \"Well?\" said Henderson. \"It's out on Horsell Common now.\" \"Good Lord!\" said Henderson. \"Fallen meteorite! That's good.\" \"But it's something more than a meteorite. It's a cylinder--an artificialcylinder, man! And there's something inside.\" Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand. \"What's that?\" he said. He was deaf in one ear. Ogilvy told him all that he had seen. Henderson was a minute or so taking it in.Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and came out into the road.The two men hurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder stilllying in the same position. But now the sounds inside had ceased, and a thincircle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder. Airwas either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and, meeting withno response, they both concluded the man or men inside must be insensible ordead.Of course the two were quite unable to do anything. They shouted consolation andpromises, and went off back to the town again to get help. One can imagine them,covered with sand, excited and disordered, running up the little street in thebright sunlight just as the shop folks were taking down their shutters andpeople were opening their bedroom windows. Henderson went into the railwaystation at once, in order to telegraph the news to London. The newspaperarticles had prepared men's minds for the reception of the idea.By eight o'clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already started for thecommon to see the \"dead men from Mars.\" That was the form the story took. Iheard of it first from my newspaper boy about a quarter to nine when I went outto get my Daily Chronicle. I was naturally startled, and lost no time in goingout and across the Ottershaw bridge to the sand pits."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER III - ON HORSELL COMMONI found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge hole inwhich the cylinder lay. I have already described the appearance of that colossalbulk, embedded in the ground. The turf and gravel about it seemed charred as ifby a sudden explosion. No doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire. Hendersonand Ogilvy were not there. I think they perceived that nothing was to be donefor the present, and had gone away to breakfast at Henderson's house.There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their feetdangling, and amusing themselves--until I stopped them--by throwing stones atthe giant mass. After I had spoken to them about it, they began playing at\"touch\" in and out of the group of bystanders.Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed sometimes,a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his little boy, and two or threeloafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to hang about the railway station.There was very little talking. Few of the common people in England had anythingbut the vaguest astronomical ideas in those days. Most of them were staringquietly at the big table like end of the cylinder, which was still as Ogilvy andHenderson had left it. I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charredcorpses was disappointed at this inanimate bulk. Some went away while I wasthere, and other people came. I clambered into the pit and fancied I heard afaint movement under my feet. The top had certainly ceased to rotate.It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this object wasat all evident to me. At the first glance it was really no more exciting than anoverturned carriage or a tree blown across the road. Not so much so, indeed. Itlooked like a rusty gas float. It required a certain amount of scientificeducation to perceive that the grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, thatthe yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and thecylinder had an unfamiliar hue. \"Extra-terrestrial\" had no meaning for most ofthe onlookers.At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come from theplanet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it contained any living creature. Ithought the unscrewing might be automatic. In spite of Ogilvy, I still believedthat there were men in Mars. My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of itscontaining manuscript, on the difficulties in translation that might arise,whether we should find coins and models in it, and so forth. Yet it was a littletoo large for assurance on this idea. I felt an impatience to see it opened.About eleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back, full of such thought,to my home in Maybury. But I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstractinvestigations.In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much. The earlyeditions of the evening papers had startled London with enormous headlines: \"A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.\" \"REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,\" and so forth. In addition, Ogilvy's wire to the Astronomical Exchange had rousedevery observatory in the three kingdoms. There were half a dozen flies or more from the Woking station standing in theroad by the sand pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham, and a rather lordlycarriage. Besides that, there was quite a heap of bicycles. In addition, a largenumber of people must have walked, in spite of the heat of the day, from Wokingand Chertsey, so that there was altogether quite a considerable crowd--one ortwo gaily dressed ladies among the others.It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind, and the onlyshadow was that of the few scattered pine trees. The burning heather had beenextinguished, but the level ground towards Ottershaw was blackened as far as onecould see, and still giving off vertical streamers of smoke. An enterprisingsweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load ofgreen apples and ginger beer.Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of about half adozen men--Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man that I afterwardslearned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with several workmen wielding spadesand pickaxes. Stent was giving directions in a clear, high-pitched voice. He wasstanding on the cylinder, which was now evidently much cooler; his face wascrimson and streaming with perspiration, and something seemed to have irritatedhim.A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its lower end wasstill embedded. As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring crowd on the edge ofthe pit he called to me to come down, and asked me if I would mind going over tosee Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor.The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to theirexcavations, especially the boys. They wanted a light railing put up, and helpto keep the people back. He told me that a faint stirring was occasionally stillaudible within the case, but that the workmen had failed to unscrew the top, asit afforded no grip to them. The case appeared to be enormously thick, and itwas possible that the faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in theinterior.I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the privilegedspectators within the contemplated enclosure. I failed to find Lord Hilton athis house, but I was told he was expected from London by the six o'clock trainfrom Waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter past five, I went home, hadsome tea, and walked up to the station to waylay him."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV - THE CYLINDER OPENSWhen I returned to the common the sun was setting. Scattered groups werehurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons were returning.The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black against the lemonyellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people, perhaps. There were raisedvoices, and some sort of struggle appeared to be going on about the pit. Strangeimaginings passed through my mind. As I drew nearer I heard Stent's voice: \"Keep back! Keep back!\" A boy came running towards me. \"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-screwin' and a-screwin' out. Idon't like it. I'm a-goin' 'ome, I am.\" I went on to the crowd. There were really, I should think, two or three hundredpeople elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two ladies there being byno means the least active. \"He's fallen in the pit!\" cried some one. \"Keep back!\" said several. The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through. Every one seemedgreatly excited. I heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit. \"I say!\" said Ogilvy; \"help keep these idiots back. We don't know what's in theconfounded thing, you know!\" I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was, standing on thecylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again. The crowd had pushed himin.The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within. Nearly two feet ofshining screw projected. Somebody blundered against me, and I narrowly missedbeing pitched onto the top of the screw. I turned, and as I did so the screwmust have come out, for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel with aringing concussion. I stuck my elbow into the person behind me, and turned myhead towards the Thing again. For a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectlyblack. I had the sunset in my eyes.I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly something a littleunlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I did. But,looking, I presently saw something stirring within the shadow: greyish billowymovements, one above another, and then two luminous disks--like eyes. Thensomething resembling a little grey snake, about the thickness of a walkingstick, coiled up out of the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towardsme--and then another.A sudden chill came over me. There was a loud shriek from a woman behind. I halfturned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still, from which othertentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my way back from the edge ofthe pit. I saw astonishment giving place to horror on the faces of the peopleabout me. I heard inarticulate exclamations on all sides. There was a generalmovement backwards. I saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit. Ifound myself alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off,Stent among them. I looked again at the cylinder, and ungovernable terrorgripped me. I stood petrified and staring.A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising slowly andpainfully out of the cylinder. As it bulged up and caught the light, itglistened like wet leather.Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. The mass that framedthem, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one might say, a face. Therewas a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim of which quivered and panted, anddropped saliva. The whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lanktentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in theair.Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the strangehorror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its pointed upperlip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelikelower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth, the Gorgon groups oftentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere, theevident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to the greater gravitationalenergy of the earth--above all, the extraordinary intensity of the immenseeyes--were at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There wassomething fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberationof the tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first encounter, thisfirst glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread.Suddenly the monster vanished. It had toppled over the brim of the cylinder andfallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great mass of leather. Iheard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith another of these creaturesappeared darkly in the deep shadow of the aperture.I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees, perhaps ahundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for I could not avert myface from these things.There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped, panting, andwaited further developments. The common round the sand pits was dotted withpeople, standing like myself in a half-fascinated terror, staring at thesecreatures, or rather at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which theylay. And then, with a renewed horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up anddown on the edge of the pit. It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in,but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun. Now he got hisshoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until only his head wasvisible. Suddenly he vanished, and I could have fancied a faint shriek hadreached me. I had a momentary impulse to go back and help him that my fearsoverruled. Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and theheap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made. Anyone coming along theroad from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the sight--a dwindlingmultitude of perhaps a hundred people or more standing in a great irregularcircle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind gates and hedges, saying little to oneanother and that in short, excited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a fewheaps of sand. The barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black againstthe burning sky, and in the sand pits was a row of deserted vehicles with theirhorses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER V - THE HEAT-RAYAfter the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the cylinder in whichthey had come to the earth from their planet, a kind of fascination paralysed myactions. I remained standing knee-deep in the heather, staring at the mound thathid them. I was a battleground of fear and curiosity.I did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a passionate longing topeer into it. I began walking, therefore, in a big curve, seeking some point ofvantage and continually looking at the sand heaps that hid these new-comers toour earth. Once a leash of thin black whips, like the arms of an octopus,flashed across the sunset and was immediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thinrod rose up, joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun witha wobbling motion. What could be going on there?Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups--one a little crowdtowards Woking, the other a knot of people in the direction of Chobham.Evidently they shared my mental conflict. There were few near me. One man Iapproached--he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine, though I did not know hisname--and accosted. But it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation. \"What ugly brutes!\" he said. \"Good God! What ugly brutes!\" He repeated this overand over again. \"Did you see a man in the pit?\" I said; but he made no answer to that. We becamesilent, and stood watching for a time side by side, deriving, I fancy, a certaincomfort in one another's company. Then I shifted my position to a little knollthat gave me the advantage of a yard or more of elevation and when I looked forhim presently he was walking towards Woking.The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The crowd faraway on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmurfrom it. The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed. There was scarcelyan intimation of movement from the pit.It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose thenew arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence. At any rate, as thedusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movementthat seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinderremained unbroken. Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance,stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregularcrescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I, too, on myside began to move towards the pit.Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, andheard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad trundling offthe barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing fromthe direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost ofwhom was waving a white flag.This was the Deputation. There had been a hasty consultation, and since theMartians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms, intelligentcreatures, it had been resolved to show them, by approaching them with signals,that we too were intelligent.Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the left. It wastoo far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards I learned that Ogilvy,Stent, and Henderson were with others in this attempt at communication. Thislittle group had in its advance dragged inward, so to speak, the circumferenceof the now almost complete circle of people, and a number of dim black figuresfollowed it at discreet distances.Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous greenish smokecame out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove up, one after theother, straight into the still air.This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so brightthat the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown common towardsChertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffsarose, and to remain the darker after their dispersal. At the same time a fainthissing sound became audible.Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at its apex,arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small vertical black shapes uponthe black ground. As the green smoke arose, their faces flashed out pallidgreen, and faded again as it vanished. Then slowly the hissing passed into ahumming, into a long, loud, droning noise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of thepit, and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to another,sprang from the scattered group of men. It was as if some invisible jet impingedupon them and flashed into white flame. It was as if each man were suddenly andmomentarily turned to fire.Then, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering and falling,and their supporters turning to run.I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping from man toman in that little distant crowd. All I felt was that it was something verystrange. An almost noiseless and blinding flash of light, and a man fellheadlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft of heat passed over them, pinetrees burst into fire, and every dry furze bush became with one dull thud a massof flames. And far away towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedgesand wooden buildings suddenly set alight.It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death, this invisible,inevitable sword of heat. I perceived it coming towards me by the flashingbushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied to stir. I heard thecrackle of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was assuddenly stilled. Then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated fingerwere drawn through the heather between me and the Martians, and all along acurving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Somethingfell with a crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opensout on the common. Forth-with the hissing and humming ceased, and the black,dome-like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless,dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept through afull circle, it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise. But it passed andspared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar.The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except where itsroadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early night. It wasdark, and suddenly void of men. Overhead the stars were mustering, and in thewest the sky was still a pale, bright, almost greenish blue. The tops of thepine trees and the roofs of Horsell came out sharp and black against the westernafterglow. The Martians and their appliances were altogether invisible, save forthat thin mast upon which their restless mirror wobbled. Patches of bush andisolated trees here and there smoked and glowed still, and the houses towardsWoking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of the eveningair.Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment. The little groupof black specks with the flag of white had been swept out of existence, and thestillness of the evening, so it seemed to me, had scarcely been broken.It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless, unprotected, andalone. Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from without, came--fear. With aneffort I turned and began a stumbling run through the heather.The fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only of theMartians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me. Such an extraordinaryeffect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping silently as a child might do.Once I had turned, I did not dare to look back.I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being played with, thatpresently, when I was upon the very verge of safety, this mysterious death--asswift as the passage of light--would leap after me from the pit about thecylinder and strike me down."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI - THE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROADIt is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so swiftlyand so silently. Many think that in some way they are able to generate anintense heat in a chamber of practically absolute non-conductivity. This intenseheat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose, by means ofa polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirrorof a lighthouse projects a beam of light. But no one has absolutely proved thesedetails. However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence ofthe matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light. Whatever iscombustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like water, it softensiron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon water, incontinently thatexplodes into steam.That night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit, charredand distorted beyond recognition, and all night long the common from Horsell toMaybury was deserted and brightly ablaze.The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and Ottershaw aboutthe same time. In Woking the shops had closed when the tragedy happened, and anumber of people, shop people and so forth, attracted by the stories they hadheard, were walking over the Horsell Bridge and along the road between thehedges that runs out at last upon the common. You may imagine the young peoplebrushed up after the labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they wouldmake any novelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivialflirtation. You may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road in thegloaming. . . .As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder had opened,though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the post office witha special wire to an evening paper.As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they found littleknots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning mirror over thesand pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt, soon infected by the excitement ofthe occasion.By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there may have been acrowd of three hundred people or more at this place, besides those who had leftthe road to approach the Martians nearer. There were three policemen too, one ofwhom was mounted, doing their best, under instructions from Stent, to keep thepeople back and deter them from approaching the cylinder. There was some booingfrom those more thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always anoccasion for noise and horse-play.Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision, hadtelegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians emerged, forthe help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange creatures fromviolence. After that they returned to lead that ill-fated advance. Thedescription of their death, as it was seen by the crowd, tallies very closelywith my own impressions: the three puffs of green smoke, the deep humming note,and the flashes of flame.But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine. Only the fact thata hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the Heat-Ray savedthem. Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a few yards higher, nonecould have lived to tell the tale. They saw the flashes and the men falling andan invisible hand, as it were, lit the bushes as it hurried towards them throughthe twilight. Then, with a whistling note that rose above the droning of thepit, the beam swung close over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech treesthat line the road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows, firing thewindow frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the gable of thehouse nearest the corner.In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, the panic-strickencrowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some moments. Sparks and burningtwigs began to fall into the road, and single leaves like puffs of flame. Hatsand dresses caught fire. Then came a crying from the common. There were shrieksand shouts, and suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through theconfusion with his hands clasped over his head, screaming.\"They're coming!\" a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone was turning andpushing at those behind, in order to clear their way to Woking again. They musthave bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep. Where the road grows narrow andblack between the high banks the crowd jammed, and a desperate struggleoccurred. All that crowd did not escape; three persons at least, two women and alittle boy, were crushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror andthe darkness."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VII - HOW I REACHED HOMEFor my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blunderingagainst trees and stumbling through the heather. All about me gathered theinvisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirlingto and fro, flourishing overhead before it descended and smote me out of life. Icame into the road between the crossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to thecrossroads.At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence of my emotionand of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside. That was near thebridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks. I fell and lay still. I must have remained there some time. I sat up, strangely perplexed. For a moment, perhaps, I could not clearlyunderstand how I came there. My terror had fallen from me like a garment. My hathad gone, and my collar had burst away from its fastener. A few minutes before,there had only been three real things before me--the immensity of the night andspace and nature, my own feebleness and anguish, and the near approach of death.Now it was as if something turned over, and the point of view altered abruptly.There was no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other. I wasimmediately the self of every day again--a decent, ordinary citizen. The silentcommon, the impulse of my flight, the starting flames, were as if they had beenin a dream. I asked myself had these latter things indeed happened? I could notcredit it.I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge. My mind wasblank wonder. My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their strength. I dare sayI staggered drunkenly. A head rose over the arch, and the figure of a workmancarrying a basket appeared. Beside him ran a little boy. He passed me, wishingme good night. I was minded to speak to him, but did not. I answered hisgreeting with a meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge.Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of white, firelit smoke, and along caterpillar of lighted windows, went flying south--clatter, clatter, clap,rap, and it had gone. A dim group of people talked in the gate of one of thehouses in the pretty little row of gables that was called Oriental Terrace. Itwas all so real and so familiar. And that behind me! It was frantic, fantastic!Such things, I told myself, could not be.Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods. I do not know how far my experience iscommon. At times I suffer from the strangest sense of detachment from myself andthe world about me; I seem to watch it all from the outside, from somewhereinconceivably remote, out of time, out of space, out of the stress and tragedyof it all. This feeling was very strong upon me that night. Here was anotherside to my dream.But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the swift deathflying yonder, not two miles away. There was a noise of business from thegasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight. I stopped at the group ofpeople. \"What news from the common?\" said I. There were two men and a woman at the gate. \"Eh?\" said one of the men, turning. \"What news from the common?\" I said. \"'Ain't yer just been there?\" asked the men. \"People seem fair silly about the common,\" said the woman over the gate. \"What'sit all abart?\" \"Haven't you heard of the men from Mars?\" said I; \"the creatures from Mars?\" \"Quite enough,\" said the woman over the gate. \"Thenks\"; and all three of themlaughed.I felt foolish and angry. I tried and found I could not tell them what I hadseen. They laughed again at my broken sentences. \"You'll hear more yet,\" I said, and went on to my home. I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I. I went into the diningroom, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could collect myselfsufficiently I told her the things I had seen. The dinner, which was a cold one,had already been served, and remained neglected on the table while I told mystory. \"There is one thing,\" I said, to allay the fears I had aroused; \"they are themost sluggish things I ever saw crawl. They may keep the pit and kill people whocome near them, but they cannot get out of it. . . . But the horror of them!\" \"Don't, dear!\" said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her hand on mine. \"Poor Ogilvy!\" I said. \"To think he may be lying dead there!\" My wife at least did not find my experience incredible. When I saw how deadlywhite her face was, I ceased abruptly. \"They may come here,\" she said again and again. I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her. \"They can scarcely move,\" I said. I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had told me ofthe impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves on the earth. Inparticular I laid stress on the gravitational difficulty. On the surface of theearth the force of gravity is three times what it is on the surface of Mars. AMartian, therefore, would weigh three times more than on Mars, albeit hismuscular strength would be the same. His own body would be a cope of lead tohim. That, indeed, was the general opinion. Both The Times and the DailyTelegraph, for instance, insisted on it the next morning, and both overlooked,just as I did, two obvious modifying influences.The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen or far lessargon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars. The invigoratinginfluences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians indisputably did much tocounterbalance the increased weight of their bodies. And, in the second place,we all overlooked the fact that such mechanical intelligence as the Martianpossessed was quite able to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.But I did not consider these points at the time, and so my reasoning was deadagainst the chances of the invaders. With wine and food, the confidence of myown table, and the necessity of reassuring my wife, I grew by insensible degreescourageous and secure.\"They have done a foolish thing,\" said I, fingering my wineglass. \"They aredangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror. Perhaps they expected tofind no living things--certainly no intelligent living things.\" \"A shell in the pit\" said I, \"if the worst comes to the worst will kill themall.\" The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive powers in astate of erethism. I remember that dinner table with extraordinary vividnesseven now. My dear wife's sweet anxious face peering at me from under the pinklamp shade, the white cloth with its silver and glass table furniture--for inthose days even philosophical writers had many little luxuries--thecrimson-purple wine in my glass, are photographically distinct. At the end of itI sat, tempering nuts with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy's rashness, anddenouncing the shortsighted timidity of the Martians.So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in his nest, anddiscussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in want of animalfood. \"We will peck them to death tomorrow, my dear.\"I did not know it, but that was the last civilised dinner I was to eat for verymany strange and terrible days. "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII - FRIDAY NIGHTThe most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and wonderful thingsthat happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing of the commonplace habits ofour social order with the first beginnings of the series of events that was totopple that social order headlong. If on Friday night you had taken a pair ofcompasses and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the Woking sandpits, I doubt if you would have had one human being outside it, unless it weresome relation of Stent or of the three or four cyclists or London people lyingdead on the common, whose emotions or habits were at all affected by thenew-comers. Many people had heard of the cylinder, of course, and talked aboutit in their leisure, but it certainly did not make the sensation that anultimatum to Germany would have done.In London that night poor Henderson's telegram describing the gradual unscrewingof the shot was judged to be a canard, and his evening paper, after wiring forauthentication from him and receiving no reply--the man was killed--decided notto print a special edition.Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were inert. I havealready described the behaviour of the men and women to whom I spoke. All overthe district people were dining and supping; working men were gardening afterthe labours of the day, children were being put to bed, young people werewandering through the lanes love-making, students sat over their books.Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel and dominant topic inthe public-houses, and here and there a messenger, or even an eye-witness of thelater occurrences, caused a whirl of excitement, a shouting, and a running toand fro; but for the most part the daily routine of working, eating, drinking,sleeping, went on as it had done for countless years--as though no planet Marsexisted in the sky. Even at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was thecase.In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping and going on, otherswere shunting on the sidings, passengers were alighting and waiting, andeverything was proceeding in the most ordinary way. A boy from the town,trenching on Smith's monopoly, was selling papers with the afternoon's news. Theringing impact of trucks, the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction,mingled with their shouts of \"Men from Mars!\" Excited men came into the stationabout nine o'clock with incredible tidings, and caused no more disturbance thandrunkards might have done. People rattling Londonwards peered into the darknessoutside the carriage windows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing sparkdance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of smokedriving across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious than a heathfire was happening. It was only round the edge of the common that anydisturbance was perceptible. There were half a dozen villas burning on theWoking border. There were lights in all the houses on the common side of thethree villages, and the people there kept awake till dawn.A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but the crowdremaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges. One or two adventuroussouls, it was afterwards found, went into the darkness and crawled quite nearthe Martians; but they never returned, for now and again a light-ray, like thebeam of a warship's searchlight swept the common, and the Heat-Ray was ready tofollow. Save for such, that big area of common was silent and desolate, and thecharred bodies lay about on it all night under the stars, and all the next day.A noise of hammering from the pit was heard by many people.So you have the state of things on Friday night. In the centre, sticking intothe skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart, was this cylinder. Butthe poison was scarcely working yet. Around it was a patch of silent common,smouldering in places, and with a few dark, dimly seen objects lying incontorted attitudes here and there. Here and there was a burning bush or tree.Beyond was a fringe of excitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammationhad not crept as yet. In the rest of the world the stream of life still flowedas it had flowed for immemorial years. The fever of war that would presentlyclog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain, had still to develop.All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,indefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and ever andagain a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the starlit sky.About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and deployed along theedge of the common to form a cordon. Later a second company marched throughChobham to deploy on the north side of the common. Several officers from theInkerman barracks had been on the common earlier in the day, and one, MajorEden, was reported to be missing. The colonel of the regiment came to theChobham bridge and was busy questioning the crowd at midnight. The militaryauthorities were certainly alive to the seriousness of the business. Abouteleven, the next morning's papers were able to say, a squadron of hussars, twoMaxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan regiment started fromAldershot.A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road, Woking, saw a starfall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest. It had a greenish colour,and caused a silent brightness like summer lightning. This was the secondcylinder."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IX - THE FIGHTING BEGINSSaturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense. It was a day of lassitude too,hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating barometer. I had slept butlittle, though my wife had succeeded in sleeping, and I rose early. I went intomy garden before breakfast and stood listening, but towards the common there wasnothing stirring but a lark.The milkman came as usual. I heard the rattle of his chariot and I went round tothe side gate to ask the latest news. He told me that during the night theMartians had been surrounded by troops, and that guns were expected. Then--afamiliar, reassuring note--I heard a train running towards Woking. \"They aren't to be killed,\" said the milkman, \"if that can possibly be avoided.\" I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then strolled into breakfast. It was a most unexceptional morning. My neighbour was of opinionthat the troops would be able to capture or to destroy the Martians during theday. \"It's a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,\" he said. \"It would becurious to know how they live on another planet; we might learn a thing or two.\" He came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for hisgardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic. At the same time he told me ofthe burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links. \"They say,\" said he, \"that there's another of those blessed things fallenthere--number two. But one's enough, surely. This lot'll cost the insurancepeople a pretty penny before everything's settled.\" He laughed with an air ofthe greatest good humour as he said this. The woods, he said, were stillburning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to me. \"They will be hot under foot fordays, on account of the thick soil of pine needles and turf,\" he said, and thengrew serious over \"poor Ogilvy.\" After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down towards the common.Under the railway bridge I found a group of soldiers--sappers, I think, men insmall round caps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts,dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf. They told me no one was allowedover the canal, and, looking along the road towards the bridge, I saw one of theCardigan men standing sentinel there. I talked with these soldiers for a time; Itold them of my sight of the Martians on the previous evening. None of them hadseen the Martians, and they had but the vaguest ideas of them, so that theyplied me with questions. They said that they did not know who had authorised themovements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute had arisen at the HorseGuards. The ordinary sapper is a great deal better educated than the commonsoldier, and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the possible fight withsome acuteness. I described the Heat-Ray to them, and they began to argue amongthemselves. \"Crawl up under cover and rush 'em, say I,\" said one. \"Get aht!\" said another. \"What's cover against this 'ere 'eat? Sticks to cookyer! What we got to do is to go as near as the ground'll let us, and then drivea trench.\" \"Blow yer trenches! You always want trenches; you ought to ha' been born arabbit Snippy.\" \"Ain't they got any necks, then?\" said a third, abruptly--a little,contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe. I repeated my description. \"Octopuses,\" said he, \"that's what I calls 'em. Talk about fishers ofmen--fighters of fish it is this time!\" \"It ain't no murder killing beasts like that,\" said the first speaker. \"Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish 'em?\" said the littledark man. \"You carn tell what they might do.\" \"Where's your shells?\" said the first speaker. \"There ain't no time. Do it in arush, that's my tip, and do it at once.\" So they discussed it. After a while I left them, and went on to the railwaystation to get as many morning papers as I could. But I will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning and ofthe longer afternoon. I did not succeed in getting a glimpse of the common, foreven Horsell and Chobham church towers were in the hands of the militaryauthorities. The soldiers I addressed didn't know anything; the officers weremysterious as well as busy. I found people in the town quite secure again in thepresence of the military, and I heard for the first time from Marshall, thetobacconist, that his son was among the dead on the common. The soldiers hadmade the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock up and leave their houses.I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the day wasextremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took a cold bath in theafternoon. About half past four I went up to the railway station to get anevening paper, for the morning papers had contained only a very inaccuratedescription of the killing of Stent, Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others. Butthere was little I didn't know. The Martians did not show an inch of themselves.They seemed busy in their pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almostcontinuous streamer of smoke. Apparently they were busy getting ready for astruggle. \"Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without success,\" wasthe stereotyped formula of the papers. A sapper told me it was done by a man ina ditch with a flag on a long pole. The Martians took as much notice of suchadvances as we should of the lowing of a cow.I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this preparation, greatlyexcited me. My imagination became belligerent, and defeated the invaders in adozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism cameback. It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at that time. They seemed veryhelpless in that pit of theirs.About three o'clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals fromChertsey or Addlestone. I learned that the smouldering pine wood into which thesecond cylinder had fallen was being shelled, in the hope of destroying thatobject before it opened. It was only about five, however, that a field gunreached Chobham for use against the first body of Martians.About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the summerhousetalking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon us, I heard a muffleddetonation from the common, and immediately after a gust of firing. Close on theheels of that came a violent rattling crash, quite close to us, that shook theground; and, starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about theOriental College burst into smoky red flame, and the tower of the little churchbeside it slide down into ruin. The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and theroof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been at workupon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a pieceof it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragmentsupon the flower bed by my study window.I and my wife stood amazed. Then I realised that the crest of Maybury Hill mustbe within range of the Martians' Heat-Ray now that the college was cleared outof the way.At that I gripped my wife's arm, and without ceremony ran her out into the road.Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go upstairs myself for thebox she was clamouring for. \"We can't possibly stay here,\" I said; and as I spoke the firing reopened for amoment upon the common. \"But where are we to go?\" said my wife in terror. I thought perplexed. Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead. \"Leatherhead!\" I shouted above the sudden noise. She looked away from me downhill. The people were coming out of their houses,astonished. \"How are we to get to Leatherhead?\" she said. Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge; threegalloped through the open gates of the Oriental College; two others dismounted,and began running from house to house. The sun, shining through the smoke thatdrove up from the tops of the trees, seemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliarlurid light upon everything. \"Stop here,\" said I; \"you are safe here\"; and I started off at once for theSpotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart. I ran, for Iperceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the hill would be moving.I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what was going on behind his house. Aman stood with his back to me, talking to him. \"I must have a pound,\" said the landlord, \"and I've no one to drive it.\" \"I'll give you two,\" said I, over the stranger's shoulder. \"What for?\" \"And I'll bring it back by midnight,\" I said. \"Lord!\" said the landlord; \"what's the hurry? I'm selling my bit of a pig. Twopounds, and you bring it back? What's going on now?\" I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the dog cart. Atthe time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the landlord should leavehis. I took care to have the cart there and then, drove it off down the road,and, leaving it in charge of my wife and servant, rushed into my house andpacked a few valuables, such plate as we had, and so forth. The beech treesbelow the house were burning while I did this, and the palings up the roadglowed red. While I was occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars camerunning up. He was going from house to house, warning people to leave. He wasgoing on as I came out of my front door, lugging my treasures, done up in atablecloth. I shouted after him: \"What news?\" He turned, stared, bawled something about \"crawling out in a thing like a dishcover,\" and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest. A sudden whirl ofblack smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment. I ran to myneighbour's door and rapped to satisfy myself of what I already knew, that hiswife had gone to London with him and had locked up their house. I went in again,according to my promise, to get my servant's box, lugged it out, clapped itbeside her on the tail of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped upinto the driver's seat beside my wife. In another moment we were clear of thesmoke and noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill towardsOld Woking.In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either side of theroad, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign. I saw the doctor's cart aheadof me. At the bottom of the hill I turned my head to look at the hillside I wasleaving. Thick streamers of black smoke shot with threads of red fire weredriving up into the still air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetopseastward. The smoke already extended far away to the east and west--to theByfleet pine woods eastward, and to Woking on the west. The road was dotted withpeople running towards us. And very faint now, but very distinct through thehot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that was presently stilled,and an intermittent cracking of rifles. Apparently the Martians were settingfire to everything within range of their Heat-Ray.I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my attention to thehorse. When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the black smoke. Islashed the horse with the whip, and gave him a loose rein until Woking and Sendlay between us and that quivering tumult. I overtook and passed the doctorbetween Woking and Send."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER X - IN THE STORMLeatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill. The scent of hay was in theair through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the hedges on either side weresweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The heavy firing that had broken outwhile we were driving down Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leavingthe evening very peaceful and still. We got to Leatherhead without misadventureabout nine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supper with mycousins and commended my wife to their care.My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed oppressed withforebodings of evil. I talked to her reassuringly, pointing out that theMartians were tied to the Pit by sheer heaviness, and at the utmost could butcrawl a little out of it; but she answered only in monosyllables. Had it notbeen for my promise to the innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stayin Leatherhead that night. Would that I had! Her face, I remember, was verywhite as we parted.For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day. Something very like thewar fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community had got into myblood, and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I had to return to Mayburythat night. I was even afraid that that last fusillade I had heard might meanthe extermination of our invaders from Mars. I can best express my state of mindby saying that I wanted to be in at the death.It was nearly eleven when I started to return. The night was unexpectedly dark;to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my cousins' house, it seemed indeedblack, and it was as hot and close as the day. Overhead the clouds were drivingfast, albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us. My cousins' man lit bothlamps. Happily, I knew the road intimately. My wife stood in the light of thedoorway, and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart. Then abruptly sheturned and went in, leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good hap.I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife's fears, butvery soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians. At that time I was absolutely inthe dark as to the course of the evening's fighting. I did not know even thecircumstances that had precipitated the conflict. As I came through Ockham (forthat was the way I returned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw alongthe western horizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly upthe sky. The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there withmasses of black and red smoke.Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so the villageshowed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an accident at the corner ofthe road to Pyrford, where a knot of people stood with their backs to me. Theysaid nothing to me as I passed. I do not know what they knew of the thingshappening beyond the hill, nor do I know if the silent houses I passed on my waywere sleeping securely, or deserted and empty, or harassed and watching againstthe terror of the night.From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the Wey, and thered glare was hidden from me. As I ascended the little hill beyond PyrfordChurch the glare came into view again, and the trees about me shivered with thefirst intimation of the storm that was upon me. Then I heard midnight pealingout from Pyrford Church behind me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill,with its tree-tops and roofs black and sharp against the red.Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and showed thedistant woods towards Addlestone. I felt a tug at the reins. I saw that thedriving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread of green fire, suddenlylighting their confusion and falling into the field to my left. It was the thirdfalling star!Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced out the firstlightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst like a rocket overhead.The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted.A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down this weclattered. Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as rapid a succession offlashes as I have ever seen. The thunderclaps, treading one on the heels ofanother and with a strange crackling accompaniment, sounded more like theworking of a gigantic electric machine than the usual detonating reverberations.The flickering light was blinding and confusing, and a thin hail smote gustilyat my face as I drove down the slope.At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then abruptly myattention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the oppositeslope of Maybury Hill. At first I took it for the wet roof of a house, but oneflash following another showed it to be in swift rolling movement. It was anelusive vision--a moment of bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash likedaylight, the red masses of the Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the greentops of the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharpand bright.And this Thing I saw! How can I describe it? A monstrous tripod, higher thanmany houses, striding over the young pine trees, and smashing them aside in itscareer; a walking engine of glittering metal, striding now across the heather;articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the clattering tumult of itspassage mingling with the riot of the thunder. A flash, and it came out vividly,heeling over one way with two feet in the air, to vanish and reappear almostinstantly as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards nearer. Can youimagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That wasthe impression those instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stoolimagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand.Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted, as brittlereeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were snapped off anddriven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared, rushing, as it seemed,headlong towards me. And I was galloping hard to meet it! At the sight of thesecond monster my nerve went altogether. Not stopping to look again, I wrenchedthe horse's head hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart hadheeled over upon the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung sidewaysand fell heavily into a shallow pool of water.I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in the water,under a clump of furze. The horse lay motionless (his neck was broken, poorbrute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk of the overturned dogcart and the silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly. In another momentthe colossal mechanism went striding by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere insensatemachine driving on its way. Machine it was, with a ringing metallic pace, andlong, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which gripped a young pine tree)swinging and rattling about its strange body. It picked its road as it wentstriding along, and the brazen hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with theinevitable suggestion of a head looking about. Behind the main body was a hugemass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman's basket, and puffs of green smokesquirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me. And in aninstant it was gone. So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in blindinghighlights and dense black shadows. As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned thethunder--\"Aloo! Aloo!\"--and in another minute it was with its companion, half amile away, stooping over something in the field. I have no doubt this Thing inthe field was the third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us from Mars.For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, by theintermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the distanceover the hedge tops. A thin hail was now beginning, and as it came and wenttheir figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness again. Now and thencame a gap in the lightning, and the night swallowed them up.I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below. It was some time before myblank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a drier position, orthink at all of my imminent peril.Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter's hut of wood, surrounded by apatch of potato garden. I struggled to my feet at last, and, crouching andmaking use of every chance of cover, I made a run for this. I hammered at thedoor, but I could not make the people hear (if there were any people inside),and after a time I desisted, and, availing myself of a ditch for the greaterpart of the way, succeeded in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines,into the pine woods towards Maybury.Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my own house. Iwalked among the trees trying to find the footpath. It was very dark indeed inthe wood, for the lightning was now becoming infrequent, and the hail, which waspouring down in a torrent, fell in columns through the gaps in the heavyfoliage.If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I should haveimmediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street Cobham, and so goneback to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead. But that night the strangeness of thingsabout me, and my physical wretchedness, prevented me, for I was bruised, weary,wet to the skin, deafened and blinded by the storm.I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as much motive as Ihad. I staggered through the trees, fell into a ditch and bruised my kneesagainst a plank, and finally splashed out into the lane that ran down from theCollege Arms. I say splashed, for the storm water was sweeping the sand down thehill in a muddy torrent. There in the darkness a man blundered into me and sentme reeling back.He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before I could gather mywits sufficiently to speak to him. So heavy was the stress of the storm just atthis place that I had the hardest task to win my way up the hill. I went closeup to the fence on the left and worked my way along its palings.Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of lightning, sawbetween my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of boots. Before I coulddistinguish clearly how the man lay, the flicker of light had passed. I stoodover him waiting for the next flash. When it came, I saw that he was a sturdyman, cheaply but not shabbily dressed; his head was bent under his body, and helay crumpled up close to the fence, as though he had been flung violentlyagainst it.Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a deadbody, I stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart. He was quite dead.Apparently his neck had been broken. The lightning flashed for a third time, andhis face leaped upon me. I sprang to my feet. It was the landlord of the SpottedDog, whose conveyance I had taken.I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill. I made my way by thepolice station and the College Arms towards my own house. Nothing was burning onthe hillside, though from the common there still came a red glare and a rollingtumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the drenching hail. So far as I couldsee by the flashes, the houses about me were mostly uninjured. By the CollegeArms a dark heap lay in the road.Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the sound of feet,but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them. I let myself in with mylatchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door, staggered to the foot of thestaircase, and sat down. My imagination was full of those striding metallicmonsters, and of the dead body smashed against the fence. I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall, shiveringviolently."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI - AT THE WINDOWI have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of exhaustingthemselves. After a time I discovered that I was cold and wet, and with littlepools of water about me on the stair carpet. I got up almost mechanically, wentinto the dining room and drank some whiskey, and then I was moved to change myclothes.After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so I do notknow. The window of my study looks over the trees and the railway towardsHorsell Common. In the hurry of our departure this window had been left open.The passage was dark, and, by contrast with the picture the window frameenclosed, the side of the room seemed impenetrably dark. I stopped short in thedoorway.The thunderstorm had passed. The towers of the Oriental College and the pinetrees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by a vivid red glare, the commonabout the sand pits was visible. Across the light huge black shapes, grotesqueand strange, moved busily to and fro.It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on fire--a broadhillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and writhing with the gustsof the dying storm, and throwing a red reflection upon the cloud-scud above.Every now and then a haze of smoke from some nearer conflagration drove acrossthe window and hid the Martian shapes. I could not see what they were doing, northe clear form of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon.Neither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections of it danced on thewall and ceiling of the study. A sharp, resinous tang of burning was in the air.I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window. As I did so, theview opened out until, on the one hand, it reached to the houses about Wokingstation, and on the other to the charred and blackened pine woods of Byfleet.There was a light down below the hill, on the railway, near the arch, andseveral of the houses along the Maybury road and the streets near the stationwere glowing ruins. The light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were ablack heap and a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs.Then I perceived this was a wrecked train, the fore part smashed and on fire,the hinder carriages still upon the rails.Between these three main centres of light--the houses, the train, and theburning county towards Chobham--stretched irregular patches of dark country,broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and smoking ground. It wasthe strangest spectacle, that black expanse set with fire. It reminded me, morethan anything else, of the Potteries at night. At first I could distinguish nopeople at all, though I peered intently for them. Later I saw against the lightof Woking station a number of black figures hurrying one after the other acrossthe line.And this was the little world in which I had been living securely for years,this fiery chaos! What had happened in the last seven hours I still did notknow; nor did I know, though I was beginning to guess, the relation betweenthese mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps I had seen disgorged from thecylinder. With a queer feeling of impersonal interest I turned my desk chair tothe window, sat down, and stared at the blackened country, and particularly atthe three gigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare aboutthe sand pits.They seemed amazingly busy. I began to ask myself what they could be. Were theyintelligent mechanisms? Such a thing I felt was impossible. Or did a Martian sitwithin each, ruling, directing, using, much as a man's brain sits and rules inhis body? I began to compare the things to human machines, to ask myself for thefirst time in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to anintelligent lower animal.The storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burning land thelittle fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west, when a soldier cameinto my garden. I heard a slight scraping at the fence, and rousing myself fromthe lethargy that had fallen upon me, I looked down and saw him dimly,clambering over the palings. At the sight of another human being my torporpassed, and I leaned out of the window eagerly. \"Hist!\" said I, in a whisper. He stopped astride of the fence in doubt. Then he came over and across the lawnto the corner of the house. He bent down and stepped softly. \"Who's there?\" he said, also whispering, standing under the window and peeringup. \"Where are you going?\" I asked. \"God knows.\" \"Are you trying to hide?\" \"That's it.\" \"Come into the house,\" I said. I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked the door again. Icould not see his face. He was hatless, and his coat was unbuttoned. \"My God!\" he said, as I drew him in. \"What has happened?\" I asked. \"What hasn't?\" In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of despair. \"Theywiped us out--simply wiped us out,\" he repeated again and again. He followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining room. \"Take some whiskey,\" I said, pouring out a stiff dose. He drank it. Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put his head on hisarms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in a perfect passion ofemotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of my own recent despair, stoodbeside him, wondering.It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my questions, andthen he answered perplexingly and brokenly. He was a driver in the artillery,and had only come into action about seven. At that time firing was going onacross the common, and it was said the first party of Martians were crawlingslowly towards their second cylinder under cover of a metal shield.Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of thefighting-machines I had seen. The gun he drove had been unlimbered near Horsell,in order to command the sand pits, and its arrival it was that had precipitatedthe action. As the limber gunners went to the rear, his horse trod in a rabbithole and came down, throwing him into a depression of the ground. At the samemoment the gun exploded behind him, the ammunition blew up, there was fire allabout him, and he found himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and deadhorses.\"I lay still,\" he said, \"scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter of a horseatop of me. We'd been wiped out. And the smell--good God! Like burnt meat! I washurt across the back by the fall of the horse, and there I had to lie until Ifelt better. Just like parade it had been a minute before--then stumble, bang,swish!\" \"Wiped out!\" he said. He had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping out furtively acrossthe common. The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in skirmishing order, at the pit,simply to be swept out of existence. Then the monster had risen to its feet andhad begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the common among the fewfugitives, with its headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of acowled human being. A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case, aboutwhich green flashes scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked theHeat-Ray.In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a living thingleft upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it that was not already ablackened skeleton was burning. The hussars had been on the road beyond thecurvature of the ground, and he saw nothing of them. He heard the Martiansrattle for a time and then become still. The giant saved Woking station and itscluster of houses until the last; then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought tobear, and the town became a heap of fiery ruins. Then the Thing shut off theHeat-Ray, and turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle awaytowards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder. As it didso a second glittering Titan built itself up out of the pit.The second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman began tocrawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards Horsell. He managed toget alive into the ditch by the side of the road, and so escaped to Woking.There his story became ejaculatory. The place was impassable. It seems therewere a few people alive there, frantic for the most part and many burned andscalded. He was turned aside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorchingheaps of broken wall as one of the Martian giants returned. He saw this onepursue a man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knock his headagainst the trunk of a pine tree. At last, after nightfall, the artillerymanmade a rush for it and got over the railway embankment.Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope of gettingout of danger Londonward. People were hiding in trenches and cellars, and manyof the survivors had made off towards Woking village and Send. He had beenconsumed with thirst until he found one of the water mains near the railway archsmashed, and the water bubbling out like a spring upon the road.That was the story I got from him, bit by bit. He grew calmer telling me andtrying to make me see the things he had seen. He had eaten no food since midday,he told me early in his narrative, and I found some mutton and bread in thepantry and brought it into the room. We lit no lamp for fear of attracting theMartians, and ever and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat. As hetalked, things about us came darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled bushesand broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct. It would seem that anumber of men or animals had rushed across the lawn. I began to see his face,blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was also.When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study, and I lookedagain out of the open window. In one night the valley had become a valley ofashes. The fires had dwindled now. Where flames had been there were nowstreamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of shattered and gutted houses andblasted and blackened trees that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt andterrible in the pitiless light of dawn. Yet here and there some object had hadthe luck to escape--a white railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse there,white and fresh amid the wreckage. Never before in the history of warfare haddestruction been so indiscriminate and so universal. And shining with thegrowing light of the east, three of the metallic giants stood about the pit,their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the desolation they had made.It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again puffs ofvivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the brighteningdawn--streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished. Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham. They became pillars of bloodshotsmoke at the first touch of day."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XII - WHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTONAs the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had watchedthe Martians, and went very quietly downstairs.The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in. Heproposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin hisbattery--No. 12, of the Horse Artillery. My plan was to return at once toLeatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the Martians impressed me that Ihad determined to take my wife to Newhaven, and go with her out of the countryforthwith. For I already perceived clearly that the country about London mustinevitably be the scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as thesecould be destroyed.Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, with its guardinggiants. Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my chance and struckacross country. But the artilleryman dissuaded me: \"It's no kindness to theright sort of wife,\" he said, \"to make her a widow\"; and in the end I agreed togo with him, under cover of the woods, northward as far as Street Cobham beforeI parted with him. Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reachLeatherhead.I should have started at once, but my companion had been in active service andhe knew better than that. He made me ransack the house for a flask, which hefilled with whiskey; and we lined every available pocket with packets ofbiscuits and slices of meat. Then we crept out of the house, and ran as quicklyas we could down the ill-made road by which I had come overnight. The housesseemed deserted. In the road lay a group of three charred bodies close together,struck dead by the Heat-Ray; and here and there were things that people haddropped--a clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the like poor valuables. At thecorner turning up towards the post office a little cart, filled with boxes andfurniture, and horseless, heeled over on a broken wheel. A cash box had beenhastily smashed open and thrown under the debris.Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none of the houseshad suffered very greatly here. The Heat-Ray had shaved the chimney tops andpassed. Yet, save ourselves, there did not seem to be a living soul on MayburyHill. The majority of the inhabitants had escaped, I suppose, by way of the OldWoking road--the road I had taken when I drove to Leatherhead--or they hadhidden.We went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden now from theovernight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill. We pushedthrough these towards the railway without meeting a soul. The woods across theline were but the scarred and blackened ruins of woods; for the most part thetrees had fallen, but a certain proportion still stood, dismal grey stems, withdark brown foliage instead of green.On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it hadfailed to secure its footing. In one place the woodmen had been at work onSaturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a clearing, with heaps ofsawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine. Hard by was a temporary hut,deserted. There was not a breath of wind this morning, and everything wasstrangely still. Even the birds were hushed, and as we hurried along I and theartilleryman talked in whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders.Once or twice we stopped to listen.After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the clatter ofhoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers riding slowlytowards Woking. We hailed them, and they halted while we hurried towards them.It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of the 8th Hussars, with a standlike a theodolite, which the artilleryman told me was a heliograph. \"You are the first men I've seen coming this way this morning,\" said thelieutenant. \"What's brewing?\" His voice and face were eager. The men behind him stared curiously. Theartilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted. \"Gun destroyed last night, sir. Have been hiding. Trying to rejoin battery, sir.You'll come in sight of the Martians, I expect, about half a mile along thisroad.\" \"What the dickens are they like?\" asked the lieutenant. \"Giants in armour, sir. Hundred feet high. Three legs and a body like 'luminium,with a mighty great head in a hood, sir.\" \"Get out!\" said the lieutenant. \"What confounded nonsense!\" \"You'll see, sir. They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fire and strikesyou dead.\" \"What d'ye mean--a gun?\" \"No, sir,\" and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray. Halfwaythrough, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me. I was stillstanding on the bank by the side of the road. \"It's perfectly true,\" I said. \"Well,\" said the lieutenant, \"I suppose it's my business to see it too. Lookhere\"--to the artilleryman--\"we're detailed here clearing people out of theirhouses. You'd better go along and report yourself to Brigadier-General Marvin,and tell him all you know. He's at Weybridge. Know the way?\" \"I do,\" I said; and he turned his horse southward again. \"Half a mile, you say?\" said he. \"At most,\" I answered, and pointed over the treetops southward. He thanked meand rode on, and we saw them no more. Farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in the road,busy clearing out a labourer's cottage. They had got hold of a little handtruck, and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture.They were all too assiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed.By Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and found the country calmand peaceful under the morning sunlight. We were far beyond the range of theHeat-Ray there, and had it not been for the silent desertion of some of thehouses, the stirring movement of packing in others, and the knot of soldiersstanding on the bridge over the railway and staring down the line towardsWoking, the day would have seemed very like any other Sunday. Several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the roadto Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw, across a stretchof flat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal distances pointingtowards Woking. The gunners stood by the guns waiting, and the ammunitionwaggons were at a business-like distance. The men stood almost as if underinspection. \"That's good!\" said I. \"They will get one fair shot, at any rate.\"The artilleryman hesitated at the gate. \"I shall go on,\" he said. Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a number of menin white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and more guns behind. \"It's bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,\" said the artilleryman.\"They 'aven't seen that fire-beam yet.\" The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the treetopssouthwestward, and the men digging would stop every now and again to stare inthe same direction.Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars, some of themdismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about. Three or four blackgovernment waggons, with crosses in white circles, and an old omnibus, amongother vehicles, were being loaded in the village street. There were scores ofpeople, most of them sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes.The soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise thegravity of their position. We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box anda score or more of flower pots containing orchids, angrily expostulating withthe corporal who would leave them behind. I stopped and gripped his arm. \"Do you know what's over there?\" I said, pointing at the pine tops that hid theMartians. \"Eh?\" said he, turning. \"I was explainin' these is vallyble.\" \"Death!\" I shouted. \"Death is coming! Death!\" and leaving him to digest that ifhe could, I hurried on after the artillery-man. At the corner I looked back. Thesoldier had left him, and he was still standing by his box, with the pots oforchids on the lid of it, and staring vaguely over the trees.No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were established; thewhole place was in such confusion as I had never seen in any town before. Carts,carriages everywhere, the most astonishing miscellany of conveyances andhorseflesh. The respectable inhabitants of the place, men in golf and boatingcostumes, wives prettily dressed, were packing, river-side loafers energeticallyhelping, children excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at thisastonishing variation of their Sunday experiences. In the midst of it all theworthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration, and his bell wasjangling out above the excitement. I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking fountain, made a verypassable meal upon what we had brought with us. Patrols of soldiers--here nolonger hussars, but grenadiers in white--were warning people to move now or totake refuge in their cellars as soon as the firing began. We saw as we crossedthe railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and about therailway station, and the swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages.The ordinary traffic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow of thepassage of troops and guns to Chertsey, and I have heard since that a savagestruggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at a laterhour.We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found ourselves atthe place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames join. Part of the timewe spent helping two old women to pack a little cart. The Wey has a treblemouth, and at this point boats are to be hired, and there was a ferry across theriver. On the Shepperton side was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the towerof Shepperton Church--it has been replaced by a spire--rose above the trees.Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives. As yet the flight had notgrown to a panic, but there were already far more people than all the boatsgoing to and fro could enable to cross. People came panting along under heavyburdens; one husband and wife were even carrying a small outhouse door betweenthem, with some of their household goods piled thereon. One man told us he meantto try to get away from Shepperton station.There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting. The idea peopleseemed to have here was that the Martians were simply formidable human beings,who might attack and sack the town, to be certainly destroyed in the end. Everynow and then people would glance nervously across the Wey, at the meadowstowards Chertsey, but everything over there was still.Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything was quiet, invivid contrast with the Surrey side. The people who landed there from the boatswent tramping off down the lane. The big ferryboat had just made a journey.Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn, staring and jesting at thefugitives, without offering to help. The inn was closed, as it was now withinprohibited hours. \"What's that?\" cried a boatman, and \"Shut up, you fool!\" said a man near me to ayelping dog. Then the sound came again, this time from the direction ofChertsey, a muffled thud--the sound of a gun. The fighting was beginning. Almost immediately unseen batteries across the riverto our right, unseen because of the trees, took up the chorus, firing heavilyone after the other. A woman screamed. Everyone stood arrested by the suddenstir of battle, near us and yet invisible to us. Nothing was to be seen saveflat meadows, cows feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollardwillows motionless in the warm sunlight. \"The sojers'll stop 'em,\" said a woman beside me, doubtfully. A haziness roseover the treetops. Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff of smoke thatjerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground heaved under foot anda heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or three windows in the housesnear, and leaving us astonished. \"Here they are!\" shouted a man in a blue jersey. \"Yonder! D'yer see them?Yonder!\" Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured Martiansappeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat meadows that stretchedtowards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly towards the river. Little cowledfigures they seemed at first, going with a rolling motion and as fast as flyingbirds.Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth. Their armoured bodiesglittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the guns, growingrapidly larger as they drew nearer. One on the extreme left, the remotest thatis, flourished a huge case high in the air, and the ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray Ihad already seen on Friday night smote towards Chertsey, and struck the town.At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd near thewater's edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck. There was noscreaming or shouting, but a silence. Then a hoarse murmur and a movement offeet--a splashing from the water. A man, too frightened to drop the portmanteauhe carried on his shoulder, swung round and sent me staggering with a blow fromthe corner of his burden. A woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me.I turned with the rush of the people, but I was not too terrified for thought.The terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind. To get under water! That was it! \"Get under water!\" I shouted, unheeded. I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian, rushed rightdown the gravelly beach and headlong into the water. Others did the same. Aboatload of people putting back came leaping out as I rushed past. The stonesunder my feet were muddy and slippery, and the river was so low that I ranperhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep. Then, as the Martian towered overheadscarcely a couple of hundred yards away, I flung myself forward under thesurface. The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the river soundedlike thunderclaps in my ears. People were landing hastily on both sides of theriver. But the Martian machine took no more notice for the moment of the peoplerunning this way and that than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nestagainst which his foot has kicked. When, half suffocated, I raised my head abovewater, the Martian's hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing acrossthe river, and as it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generatorof the Heat-Ray.In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading halfway across. Theknees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank, and in another moment ithad raised itself to its full height again, close to the village of Shepperton.Forthwith the six guns which, unknown to anyone on the right bank, had beenhidden behind the outskirts of that village, fired simultaneously. The suddennear concussion, the last close upon the first, made my heart jump. The monsterwas already raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the first shell burstsix yards above the hood. I gave a cry of astonishment. I saw and thought nothing of the otherfour Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer incident.Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the body as the hoodtwisted round in time to receive, but not in time to dodge, the fourth shell.The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing. The hood bulged, flashed, waswhirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and glittering metal. \"Hit!\" shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer. I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me. I could haveleaped out of the water with that momentary exultation. The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did not fall over.It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer heeding its steps and withthe camera that fired the Heat-Ray now rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly uponShepperton. The living intelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain andsplashed to the four winds of heaven, and the Thing was now but a mere intricatedevice of metal whirling to destruction. It drove along in a straight line,incapable of guidance. It struck the tower of Shepperton Church, smashing itdown as the impact of a battering ram might have done, swerved aside, blunderedon and collapsed with tremendous force into the river out of my sight.A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water, steam, mud, andshattered metal shot far up into the sky. As the camera of the Heat-Ray hit thewater, the latter had immediately flashed into steam. In another moment a hugewave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost scaldingly hot, came sweeping round thebend upstream. I saw people struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming andshouting faintly above the seething and roar of the Martian's collapse.For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need ofself-preservation. I splashed through the tumultuous water, pushing aside a manin black to do so, until I could see round the bend. Half a dozen deserted boatspitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves. The fallen Martian came intosight downstream, lying across the river, and for the most part submerged.Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through thetumultuously whirling wisps I could see, intermittently and vaguely, thegigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray of mud andfroth into the air. The tentacles swayed and struck like living arms, and, savefor the helpless purposelessness of these movements, it was as if some woundedthing were struggling for its life amid the waves. Enormous quantities of aruddy-brown fluid were spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine.My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling, like thatof the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns. A man, knee-deep nearthe towing path, shouted inaudibly to me and pointed. Looking back, I saw theother Martians advancing with gigantic strides down the riverbank from thedirection of Chertsey. The Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly.At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until movement wasan agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as long as I could. Thewater was in a tumult about me, and rapidly growing hotter.When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the hair and waterfrom my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white fog that at first hid theMartians altogether. The noise was deafening. Then I saw them dimly, colossalfigures of grey, magnified by the mist. They had passed by me, and two werestooping over the frothing, tumultuous ruins of their comrade.The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two hundredyards from me, the other towards Laleham. The generators of the Heat-Rays wavedhigh, and the hissing beams smote down this way and that.The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of noises--theclangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling houses, the thud of trees,fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling and roaring of fire. Denseblack smoke was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the river, and as theHeat-Ray went to and fro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes ofincandescent white, that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames.The nearer houses still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint andpallid in the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro.For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almost boiling water,dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape. Through the reek I could see thepeople who had been with me in the river scrambling out of the water through thereeds, like little frogs hurrying through grass from the advance of a man, orrunning to and fro in utter dismay on the towing path.Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping towards me. Thehouses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and darted out flames; the treeschanged to fire with a roar. The Ray flickered up and down the towing path,licking off the people who ran this way and that, and came down to the water'sedge not fifty yards from where I stood. It swept across the river toShepperton, and the water in its track rose in a boiling weal crested withsteam. I turned shoreward.In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had rushed uponme. I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded, agonised, I staggered throughthe leaping, hissing water towards the shore. Had my foot stumbled, it wouldhave been the end. I fell helplessly, in full sight of the Martians, upon thebroad, bare gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the Wey andThames. I expected nothing but death.I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a score of yardsof my head, driving straight into the loose gravel, whirling it this way andthat and lifting again; of a long suspense, and then of the four carrying thedebris of their comrade between them, now clear and then presently faint througha veil of smoke, receding interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast spaceof river and meadow. And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracle I hadescaped."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIII - HOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATEAfter getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons, theMartians retreated to their original position upon Horsell Common; and in theirhaste, and encumbered with the debris of their smashed companion, they no doubtoverlooked many such a stray and negligible victim as myself. Had they lefttheir comrade and pushed on forthwith, there was nothing at that time betweenthem and London but batteries of twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainlyhave reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach; as sudden,dreadful, and destructive their advent would have been as the earthquake thatdestroyed Lisbon a century ago.But they were in no hurry. Cylinder followed cylinder on its interplanetaryflight; every twenty-four hours brought them reinforcement. And meanwhile themilitary and naval authorities, now fully alive to the tremendous power of theirantagonists, worked with furious energy. Every minute a fresh gun came intoposition until, before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas onthe hilly slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black muzzle.And through the charred and desolated area--perhaps twenty square milesaltogether--that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common, throughcharred and ruined villages among the green trees, through the blackened andsmoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine spinneys, crawled the devotedscouts with the heliographs that were presently to warn the gunners of theMartian approach. But the Martians now understood our command of artillery andthe danger of human proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of eithercylinder, save at the price of his life.It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon in goingto and fro, transferring everything from the second and third cylinders--thesecond in Addlestone Golf Links and the third at Pyrford--to their original piton Horsell Common. Over that, above the blackened heather and ruined buildingsthat stretched far and wide, stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandonedtheir vast fighting-machines and descended into the pit. They were hard at workthere far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke that rosetherefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and even, it is said, fromBanstead and Epsom Downs.And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next sally, andin front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my way with infinitepains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning Weybridge towards London.I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down-stream; andthrowing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it, gained it, and soescaped out of that destruction. There were no oars in the boat, but I contrivedto paddle, as well as my parboiled hands would allow, down the river towardsHalliford and Walton, going very tediously and continually looking behind me, asyou may well understand. I followed the river, because I considered that thewater gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return.The hot water from the Martian's overthrow drifted downstream with me, so thatfor the best part of a mile I could see little of either bank. Once, however, Imade out a string of black figures hurrying across the meadows from thedirection of Weybridge. Halliford, it seemed, was deserted, and several of thehouses facing the river were on fire. It was strange to see the place quitetranquil, quite desolate under the hot blue sky, with the smoke and littlethreads of flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon. Never beforehad I seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd. Alittle farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and a lineof fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay.For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after the violence I hadbeen through, and so intense the heat upon the water. Then my fears got thebetter of me again, and I resumed my paddling. The sun scorched my bare back. Atlast, as the bridge at Walton was coming into sight round the bend, my fever andfaintness overcame my fears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down,deadly sick, amid the long grass. I suppose the time was then about four or fiveo'clock. I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without meeting a soul,and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge. I seem to remember talking,wanderingly, to myself during that last spurt. I was also very thirsty, andbitterly regretful I had drunk no more water. It is a curious thing that I feltangry with my wife; I cannot account for it, but my impotent desire to reachLeatherhead worried me excessively.I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably I dozed. Ibecame aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged shirt sleeves, and withhis upturned, clean-shaven face staring at a faint flickering that danced overthe sky. The sky was what is called a mackerel sky--rows and rows of faintdown-plumes of cloud, just tinted with the midsummer sunset. I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly. \"Have you any water?\" I asked abruptly. He shook his head. \"You have been asking for water for the last hour,\" he said. For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other. I dare say he found mea strange enough figure, naked, save for my water-soaked trousers and socks,scalded, and my face and shoulders blackened by the smoke. His face was a fairweakness, his chin retreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls onhis low forehead; his eyes were rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring. Hespoke abruptly, looking vacantly away from me. \"What does it mean?\" he said. \"What do these things mean?\" I stared at him and made no answer. He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone.\"Why are these things permitted? What sins have we done? The morning service wasover, I was walking through the roads to clear my brain for the afternoon, andthen--fire, earthquake, death! As if it were Sodom and Gomorrah! All our workundone, all the work---- What are these Martians?\" \"What are we?\" I answered, clearing my throat. He gripped his knees and turned to look at me again. For half a minute, perhaps,he stared silently. \"I was walking through the roads to clear my brain,\" he said. \"Andsuddenly--fire, earthquake, death!\" He relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost to his knees. Presently he began waving his hand. \"All the work--all the Sunday schools--What have we done--what has Weybridgedone? Everything gone--everything destroyed. The church! We rebuilt it onlythree years ago. Gone! Swept out of existence! Why?\" Another pause, and he broke out again like one demented. \"The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!\" he shouted. His eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of Weybridge. By this time I was beginning to take his measure. The tremendous tragedy inwhich he had been involved--it was evident he was a fugitive from Weybridge--haddriven him to the very verge of his reason. \"Are we far from Sunbury?\" I said, in a matter-of-fact tone. \"What are we to do?\" he asked. \"Are these creatures everywhere? Has the earthbeen given over to them?\" \"Are we far from Sunbury?\" \"Only this morning I officiated at early celebration----\" \"Things have changed,\" I said, quietly. \"You must keep your head. There is stillhope.\" \"Hope!\" \"Yes. Plentiful hope--for all this destruction!\" I began to explain my view of our position. He listened at first, but as I wenton the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their former stare, and hisregard wandered from me. \"This must be the beginning of the end,\" he said, interrupting me. \"The end! Thegreat and terrible day of the Lord! When men shall call upon the mountains andthe rocks to fall upon them and hide them--hide them from the face of Him thatsitteth upon the throne!\" I began to understand the position. I ceased my laboured reasoning, struggled tomy feet, and, standing over him, laid my hand on his shoulder. \"Be a man!\" said I. \"You are scared out of your wits! What good is religion ifit collapses under calamity? Think of what earthquakes and floods, wars andvolcanoes, have done before to men! Did you think God had exempted Weybridge? Heis not an insurance agent.\" For a time he sat in blank silence. \"But how can we escape?\" he asked, suddenly. \"They are invulnerable, they arepitiless.\" \"Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,\" I answered. \"And the mightier theyare the more sane and wary should we be. One of them was killed yonder not threehours ago.\" \"Killed!\" he said, staring about him. \"How can God's ministers be killed?\" \"I saw it happen.\" I proceeded to tell him. \"We have chanced to come in for thethick of it,\" said I, \"and that is all.\" \"What is that flicker in the sky?\" he asked abruptly. I told him it was the heliograph signalling--that it was the sign of human helpand effort in the sky. \"We are in the midst of it,\" I said, \"quiet as it is. That flicker in the skytells of the gathering storm. Yonder, I take it are the Martians, andLondonward, where those hills rise about Richmond and Kingston and the treesgive cover, earthworks are being thrown up and guns are being placed. Presentlythe Martians will be coming this way again.\" And even as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture. \"Listen!\" he said. From beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance of distantguns and a remote weird crying. Then everything was still. A cockchafer camedroning over the hedge and past us. High in the west the crescent moon hungfaint and pale above the smoke of Weybridge and Shepperton and the hot, stillsplendour of the sunset. \"We had better follow this path,\" I said, \"northward.\" "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIV - IN LONDONMy younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking. He was amedical student working for an imminent examination, and he heard nothing of thearrival until Saturday morning. The morning papers on Saturday contained, inaddition to lengthy special articles on the planet Mars, on life in the planets,and so forth, a brief and vaguely worded telegram, all the more striking for itsbrevity.The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number of peoplewith a quick-firing gun, so the story ran. The telegram concluded with thewords: \"Formidable as they seem to be, the Martians have not moved from the pitinto which they have fallen, and, indeed, seem incapable of doing so. Probablythis is due to the relative strength of the earth's gravitational energy.\" Onthat last text their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly.Of course all the students in the crammer's biology class, to which my brotherwent that day, were intensely interested, but there were no signs of any unusualexcitement in the streets. The afternoon papers puffed scraps of news under bigheadlines. They had nothing to tell beyond the movements of troops about thecommon, and the burning of the pine woods between Woking and Weybridge, untileight. Then the St. James's Gazette, in an extra-special edition, announced thebare fact of the interruption of telegraphic communication. This was thought tobe due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line. Nothing more of thefighting was known that night, the night of my drive to Leatherhead and back.My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from the description in thepapers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house. He made up his mindto run down that night to me, in order, as he says, to see the Things beforethey were killed. He dispatched a telegram, which never reached me, about fouro'clock, and spent the evening at a music hall.In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm, and my brotherreached Waterloo in a cab. On the platform from which the midnight train usuallystarts he learned, after some waiting, that an accident prevented trains fromreaching Woking that night. The nature of the accident he could not ascertain;indeed, the railway authorities did not clearly know at that time. There wasvery little excitement in the station, as the officials, failing to realise thatanything further than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction hadoccurred, were running the theatre trains which usually passed through Wokinground by Virginia Water or Guildford. They were busy making the necessaryarrangements to alter the route of the Southampton and Portsmouth Sunday Leagueexcursions. A nocturnal newspaper reporter, mistaking my brother for the trafficmanager, to whom he bears a slight resemblance, waylaid and tried to interviewhim. Few people, excepting the railway officials, connected the breakdown withthe Martians.I have read, in another account of these events, that on Sunday morning \"allLondon was electrified by the news from Woking.\" As a matter of fact, there wasnothing to justify that very extravagant phrase. Plenty of Londoners did nothear of the Martians until the panic of Monday morning. Those who did took sometime to realise all that the hastily worded telegrams in the Sunday papersconveyed. The majority of people in London do not read Sunday papers.The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the Londoner'smind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of course in the papers, thatthey could read without any personal tremors: \"About seven o'clock last nightthe Martians came out of the cylinder, and, moving about under an armour ofmetallic shields, have completely wrecked Woking station with the adjacenthouses, and massacred an entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment. No detailsare known. Maxims have been absolutely useless against their armour; the fieldguns have been disabled by them. Flying hussars have been galloping intoChertsey. The Martians appear to be moving slowly towards Chertsey or Windsor.Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, and earthworks are being thrown up tocheck the advance Londonward.\" That was how the Sunday Sun put it, and a cleverand remarkably prompt \"handbook\" article in the Referee compared the affair to amenagerie suddenly let loose in a village.No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured Martians, andthere was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be sluggish: \"crawling,\"\"creeping painfully\"--such expressions occurred in almost all the earlierreports. None of the telegrams could have been written by an eyewitness of theiradvance. The Sunday papers printed separate editions as further news came tohand, some even in default of it. But there was practically nothing more to tellpeople until late in the afternoon, when the authorities gave the press agenciesthe news in their possession. It was stated that the people of Walton andWeybridge, and all the district were pouring along the roads Londonward, andthat was all.My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning, still inignorance of what had happened on the previous night. There he heard allusionsmade to the invasion, and a special prayer for peace. Coming out, he boughta Referee. He became alarmed at the news in this, and went again to Waterloostation to find out if communication were restored. The omnibuses, carriages,cyclists, and innumerable people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcelyaffected by the strange intelligence that the news venders were disseminating.People were interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed only on account of the localresidents. At the station he heard for the first time that the Windsor andChertsey lines were now interrupted. The porters told him that severalremarkable telegrams had been received in the morning from Byfleet and Chertseystations, but that these had abruptly ceased. My brother could get very littleprecise detail out of them. \"There's fighting going on about Weybridge\" was the extent of their information. The train service was now very much disorganised. Quite a number of people whohad been expecting friends from places on the South-Western network werestanding about the station. One grey-headed old gentleman came and abused theSouth-Western Company bitterly to my brother. \"It wants showing up,\" he said.One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston, containing peoplewho had gone out for a day's boating and found the locks closed and a feeling ofpanic in the air. A man in a blue and white blazer addressed my brother, full ofstrange tidings. \"There's hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts and things,with boxes of valuables and all that,\" he said. \"They come from Molesey andWeybridge and Walton, and they say there's been guns heard at Chertsey, heavyfiring, and that mounted soldiers have told them to get off at once because theMartians are coming. We heard guns firing at Hampton Court station, but wethought it was thunder. What the dickens does it all mean? The Martians can'tget out of their pit, can they?\" My brother could not tell him. Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the clients ofthe underground railway, and that the Sunday excursionists began to return fromall over the South-Western \"lung\"--Barnes, Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and soforth--at unnaturally early hours; but not a soul had anything more than vaguehearsay to tell of. Everyone connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered.About five o'clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely excited bythe opening of the line of communication, which is almost invariably closed,between the South-Eastern and the South-Western stations, and the passage ofcarriage trucks bearing huge guns and carriages crammed with soldiers. Thesewere the guns that were brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston.There was an exchange of pleasantries: \"You'll get eaten!\" \"We're thebeast-tamers!\" and so forth. A little while after that a squad of police cameinto the station and began to clear the public off the platforms, and my brotherwent out into the street again.The church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad of Salvation Armylassies came singing down Waterloo Road. On the bridge a number of loafers werewatching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the stream in patches. Thesun was just setting, and the Clock Tower and the Houses of Parliament roseagainst one of the most peaceful skies it is possible to imagine, a sky of gold,barred with long transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud. There was talk of afloating body. One of the men there, a reservist he said he was, told my brotherhe had seen the heliograph flickering in the west.In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had just beenrushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and staring placards.\"Dreadful catastrophe!\" they bawled one to the other down Wellington Street.\"Fighting at Weybridge! Full description! Repulse of the Martians! London inDanger!\" He had to give threepence for a copy of that paper.Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full power andterror of these monsters. He learned that they were not merely a handful ofsmall sluggish creatures, but that they were minds swaying vast mechanicalbodies; and that they could move swiftly and smite with such power that even themightiest guns could not stand against them.They were described as \"vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred feet high,capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot out a beam ofintense heat.\" Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns, had been planted in thecountry about Horsell Common, and especially between the Woking district andLondon. Five of the machines had been seen moving towards the Thames, and one,by a happy chance, had been destroyed. In the other cases the shells had missed,and the batteries had been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays. Heavy losses ofsoldiers were mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic.The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable. They had retreatedto their triangle of cylinders again, in the circle about Woking. Signallerswith heliographs were pushing forward upon them from all sides. Guns were inrapid transit from Windsor, Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich--even from thenorth; among others, long wire-guns of ninety-five tons from Woolwich.Altogether one hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed,chiefly covering London. Never before in England had there been such a vast orrapid concentration of military material.Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyed at once byhigh explosives, which were being rapidly manufactured and distributed. Nodoubt, ran the report, the situation was of the strangest and gravestdescription, but the public was exhorted to avoid and discourage panic. No doubtthe Martians were strange and terrible in the extreme, but at the outside therecould not be more than twenty of them against our millions.The authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of the cylinders, that atthe outside there could not be more than five in each cylinder--fifteenaltogether. And one at least was disposed of--perhaps more. The public would befairly warned of the approach of danger, and elaborate measures were being takenfor the protection of the people in the threatened southwestern suburbs. And so,with reiterated assurances of the safety of London and the ability of theauthorities to cope with the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation closed.This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was still wet, andthere had been no time to add a word of comment. It was curious, my brothersaid, to see how ruthlessly the usual contents of the paper had been hacked andtaken out to give this place.All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out the pink sheetsand reading, and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the voices of an army ofhawkers following these pioneers. Men came scrambling off buses to securecopies. Certainly this news excited people intensely, whatever their previousapathy. The shutters of a map shop in the Strand were being taken down, mybrother said, and a man in his Sunday raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, wasvisible inside the window hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass.Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his hand, my brothersaw some of the fugitives from West Surrey. There was a man with his wife andtwo boys and some articles of furniture in a cart such as greengrocers use. Hewas driving from the direction of Westminster Bridge; and close behind him camea hay waggon with five or six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxesand bundles. The faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearancecontrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the people on theomnibuses. People in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of cabs. Theystopped at the Square as if undecided which way to take, and finally turnedeastward along the Strand. Some way behind these came a man in workday clothes,riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles with a small front wheel. He wasdirty and white in the face.My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a number of such people. He hada vague idea that he might see something of me. He noticed an unusual number ofpolice regulating the traffic. Some of the refugees were exchanging news withthe people on the omnibuses. One was professing to have seen the Martians.\"Boilers on stilts, I tell you, striding along like men.\" Most of them wereexcited and animated by their strange experience.Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with these arrivals.At all the street corners groups of people were reading papers, talkingexcitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday visitors. They seemed to increaseas night drew on, until at last the roads, my brother said, were like Epsom HighStreet on a Derby Day. My brother addressed several of these fugitives and gotunsatisfactory answers from most. None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man, who assured himthat Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous night. \"I come from Byfleet,\" he said; \"man on a bicycle came through the place in theearly morning, and ran from door to door warning us to come away. Then camesoldiers. We went out to look, and there were clouds of smoke to thesouth--nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming that way. Then we heard the gunsat Chertsey, and folks coming from Weybridge. So I've locked up my house andcome on.\" At the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the authorities wereto blame for their incapacity to dispose of the invaders without all thisinconvenience.About eight o'clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all over thesouth of London. My brother could not hear it for the traffic in the mainthoroughfares, but by striking through the quiet back streets to the river hewas able to distinguish it quite plainly.He walked from Westminster to his apartments near Regent's Park, about two. Hewas now very anxious on my account, and disturbed at the evident magnitude ofthe trouble. His mind was inclined to run, even as mine had run on Saturday, onmilitary details. He thought of all those silent, expectant guns, of thesuddenly nomadic countryside; he tried to imagine \"boilers on stilts\" a hundredfeet high.There were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along Oxford Street, andseveral in the Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the news spreading that RegentStreet and Portland Place were full of their usual Sunday-night promenaders,albeit they talked in groups, and along the edge of Regent's Park there were asmany silent couples \"walking out\" together under the scattered gas lamps as everthere had been. The night was warm and still, and a little oppressive; the soundof guns continued intermittently, and after midnight there seemed to be sheetlightning in the south.He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst had happened to me. He wasrestless, and after supper prowled out again aimlessly. He returned and tried invain to divert his attention to his examination notes. He went to bed a littleafter midnight, and was awakened from lurid dreams in the small hours of Mondayby the sound of door knockers, feet running in the street, distant drumming, anda clamour of bells. Red reflections danced on the ceiling. For a moment he layastonished, wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad. Then he jumpedout of bed and ran to the window.His room was an attic and as he thrust his head out, up and down the streetthere were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash, and heads in everykind of night disarray appeared. Enquiries were being shouted. \"They arecoming!\" bawled a policeman, hammering at the door; \"the Martians are coming!\"and hurried to the next door.The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street Barracks, andevery church within earshot was hard at work killing sleep with a vehementdisorderly tocsin. There was a noise of doors opening, and window after windowin the houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow illumination.Up the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptly into noise atthe corner, rising to a clattering climax under the window, and dying awayslowly in the distance. Close on the rear of this came a couple of cabs, theforerunners of a long procession of flying vehicles, going for the most part toChalk Farm station, where the North-Western special trains were loading up,instead of coming down the gradient into Euston.For a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank astonishment,watching the policemen hammering at door after door, and delivering theirincomprehensible message. Then the door behind him opened, and the man wholodged across the landing came in, dressed only in shirt, trousers, andslippers, his braces loose about his waist, his hair disordered from his pillow. \"What the devil is it?\" he asked. \"A fire? What a devil of a row!\" They both craned their heads out of the window, straining to hear what thepolicemen were shouting. People were coming out of the side streets, andstanding in groups at the corners talking. \"What the devil is it all about?\" said my brother's fellow lodger. My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running with each garment tothe window in order to miss nothing of the growing excitement. And presently menselling unnaturally early newspapers came bawling into the street: \"London in danger of suffocation! The Kingston and Richmond defences forced!Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!\" And all about him--in the rooms below, in the houses on each side and across theroad, and behind in the Park Terraces and in the hundred other streets of thatpart of Marylebone, and the Westbourne Park district and St. Pancras, andwestward and northward in Kilburn and St. John's Wood and Hampstead, andeastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed,through all the vastness of London from Ealing to East Ham--people were rubbingtheir eyes, and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions, dressinghastily as the first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through thestreets. It was the dawn of the great panic. London, which had gone to bed onSunday night oblivious and inert, was awakened, in the small hours of Mondaymorning, to a vivid sense of danger.Unable from his window to learn what was happening, my brother went down and outinto the street, just as the sky between the parapets of the houses grew pinkwith the early dawn. The flying people on foot and in vehicles grew morenumerous every moment. \"Black Smoke!\" he heard people crying, and again \"BlackSmoke!\" The contagion of such a unanimous fear was inevitable. As my brotherhesitated on the door-step, he saw another news vender approaching, and got apaper forthwith. The man was running away with the rest, and selling his papersfor a shilling each as he ran--a grotesque mingling of profit and panic. And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of theCommander-in-Chief: \"The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and poisonousvapour by means of rockets. They have smothered our batteries, destroyedRichmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and are advancing slowly towards London,destroying everything on the way. It is impossible to stop them. There is nosafety from the Black Smoke but in instant flight.\" That was all, but it was enough. The whole population of the great six-millioncity was stirring, slipping, running; presently it would be pouring enmassenorthward. \"Black Smoke!\" the voices cried. \"Fire!\" The bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult, a cart carelesslydriven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water trough up the street.Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the houses, and some of the passing cabsflaunted unextinguished lamps. And overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clearand steady and calm.He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down stairsbehind him. His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in dressing gown andshawl; her husband followed ejaculating.As my brother began to realise the import of all these things, he turned hastilyto his own room, put all his available money--some ten pounds altogether--intohis pockets, and went out again into the streets."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XV - WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SURREYIt was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the hedge inthe flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was watching the fugitivesstream over Westminster Bridge, that the Martians had resumed the offensive. Sofar as one can ascertain from the conflicting accounts that have been put forth,the majority of them remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit untilnine that night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes ofgreen smoke.But three certainly came out about eight o'clock and, advancing slowly andcautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Pyrford towards Ripley andWeybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant batteries against the settingsun. These Martians did not advance in a body, but in a line, each perhaps amile and a half from his nearest fellow. They communicated with one another bymeans of sirenlike howls, running up and down the scale from one note toanother.It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St. George's Hill thatwe had heard at Upper Halliford. The Ripley gunners, unseasoned artilleryvolunteers who ought never to have been placed in such a position, fired onewild, premature, ineffectual volley, and bolted on horse and foot through thedeserted village, while the Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenelyover their guns, stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and socame unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he destroyed.The St. George's Hill men, however, were better led or of a better mettle.Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they seem to have been quite unsuspected bythe Martian nearest to them. They laid their guns as deliberately as if they hadbeen on parade, and fired at about a thousand yards' range.The shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance a few paces,stagger, and go down. Everybody yelled together, and the guns were reloaded infrantic haste. The overthrown Martian set up a prolonged ululation, andimmediately a second glittering giant, answering him, appeared over the trees tothe south. It would seem that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of theshells. The whole of the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground,and, simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays to bear on thebattery. The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all about the guns flashed intofire, and only one or two of the men who were already running over the crest ofthe hill escaped.After this it would seem that the three took counsel together and halted, andthe scouts who were watching them report that they remained absolutelystationary for the next half hour. The Martian who had been overthrown crawledtediously out of his hood, a small brown figure, oddly suggestive from thatdistance of a speck of blight, and apparently engaged in the repair of hissupport. About nine he had finished, for his cowl was then seen above the treesagain.It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels were joinedby four other Martians, each carrying a thick black tube. A similar tube washanded to each of the three, and the seven proceeded to distribute themselves atequal distances along a curved line between St. George's Hill, Weybridge, andthe village of Send, southwest of Ripley.A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they began tomove, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and Esher. At the same timefour of their fighting machines, similarly armed with tubes, crossed the river,and two of them, black against the western sky, came into sight of myself andthe curate as we hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runsnorthward out of Halliford. They moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for amilky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height.At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began running; but Iknew it was no good running from a Martian, and I turned aside and crawledthrough dewy nettles and brambles into the broad ditch by the side of the road.He looked back, saw what I was doing, and turned to join me.The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, the remoter beinga grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away towards Staines.The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up their positionsin the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute silence. It was acrescent with twelve miles between its horns. Never since the devising ofgunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still. To us and to an observer aboutRipley it would have had precisely the same effect--the Martians seemed insolitary possession of the darkling night, lit only as it was by the slendermoon, the stars, the afterglow of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St.George's Hill and the woods of Painshill.But facing that crescent everywhere--at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton, Esher,Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across the flat grassmeadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees or village houses gavesufficient cover--the guns were waiting. The signal rockets burst and rainedtheir sparks through the night and vanished, and the spirit of all thosewatching batteries rose to a tense expectation. The Martians had but to advanceinto the line of fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, thoseguns glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a thunderousfury of battle.No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant minds,even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle--how much they understood ofus. Did they grasp that we in our millions were organized, disciplined, workingtogether? Or did they interpret our spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of ourshells, our steady investment of their encampment, as we should the furiousunanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees? Did they dream they mightexterminate us? (At that time no one knew what food they needed.) A hundred suchquestions struggled together in my mind as I watched that vast sentinel shape.And in the back of my mind was the sense of all the huge unknown and hiddenforces Londonward. Had they prepared pitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslowready as a snare? Would the Londoners have the heart and courage to make agreater Moscow of their mighty province of houses?Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and peeringthrough the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of a gun. Anothernearer, and then another. And then the Martian beside us raised his tube on highand discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report that made the ground heave. Theone towards Staines answered him. There was no flash, no smoke, simply thatloaded detonation.I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that I so farforgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up into the hedgeand stare towards Sunbury. As I did so a second report followed, and a bigprojectile hurtled overhead towards Hounslow. I expected at least to see smokeor fire, or some such evidence of its work. But all I saw was the deep blue skyabove, with one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and lowbeneath. And there had been no crash, no answering explosion. The silence wasrestored; the minute lengthened to three. \"What has happened?\" said the curate, standing up beside me. \"Heaven knows!\" said I. A bat flickered by and vanished. A distant tumult of shouting began and ceased.I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now moving eastward along theriverbank, with a swift, rolling motion. Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon him; butthe evening calm was unbroken. The figure of the Martian grew smaller as hereceded, and presently the mist and the gathering night had swallowed him up. Bya common impulse we clambered higher. Towards Sunbury was a dark appearance, asthough a conical hill had suddenly come into being there, hiding our view of thefarther country; and then, remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw anothersuch summit. These hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared. Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I perceived a third ofthese cloudy black kopjes had risen. Everything had suddenly become very still. Far away to the southeast, markingthe quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one another, and then the airquivered again with the distant thud of their guns. But the earthly artillerymade no reply.Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later I was to learnthe meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the twilight. Each of theMartians, standing in the great crescent I have described, had discharged, bymeans of the gunlike tube he carried, a huge canister over whatever hill, copse,cluster of houses, or other possible cover for guns, chanced to be in front ofhim. Some fired only one of these, some two--as in the case of the one we hadseen; the one at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at thattime. These canisters smashed on striking the ground--they did not explode--andincontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour, coiling andpouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous hill that sank andspread itself slowly over the surrounding country. And the touch of that vapour,the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was death to all that breathes.It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that, after thefirst tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank down through the airand poured over the ground in a manner rather liquid than gaseous, abandoningthe hills, and streaming into the valleys and ditches and watercourses even as Ihave heard the carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do.And where it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the surfacewould be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and made way formore. The scum was absolutely insoluble, and it is a strange thing, seeing theinstant effect of the gas, that one could drink without hurt the water fromwhich it had been strained. The vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do.It hung together in banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land anddriving reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mistand moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust. Save that anunknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue of the spectrum isconcerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the nature of this substance.Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black smoke clungso closely to the ground, even before its precipitation, that fifty feet up inthe air, on the roofs and upper stories of high houses and on great trees, therewas a chance of escaping its poison altogether, as was proved even that night atStreet Cobham and Ditton.The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of thestrangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the church spireand saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its inkynothingness. For a day and a half he remained there, weary, starving andsun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the prospect of thedistant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs, green trees, and, later,black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns, outhouses, and walls, rising here andthere into the sunlight.But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed to remainuntil it sank of its own accord into the ground. As a rule the Martians, when ithad served its purpose, cleared the air of it again by wading into it anddirecting a jet of steam upon it.This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the starlight from thewindow of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had returned. Fromthere we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going toand fro, and about eleven the windows rattled, and we heard the sound of thehuge siege guns that had been put in position there. These continuedintermittently for the space of a quarter of an hour, sending chance shots atthe invisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of theelectric light vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow.Then the fourth cylinder fell--a brilliant green meteor--as I learnedafterwards, in Bushey Park. Before the guns on the Richmond and Kingston line ofhills began, there was a fitful cannonade far away in the southwest, due, Ibelieve, to guns being fired haphazard before the black vapour could overwhelmthe gunners.So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps' nest, theMartians spread this strange stifling vapour over the Londonward country. Thehorns of the crescent slowly moved apart, until at last they formed a line fromHanwell to Coombe and Malden. All night through their destructive tubesadvanced. Never once, after the Martian at St. George's Hill was brought down,did they give the artillery the ghost of a chance against them. Wherever therewas a possibility of guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of theblack vapour was discharged, and where the guns were openly displayed theHeat-Ray was brought to bear.By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and the glare ofKingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke, blotting out thewhole valley of the Thames and extending as far as the eye could reach. Andthrough this two Martians slowly waded, and turned their hissing steam jets thisway and that.They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because they had but alimited supply of material for its production or because they did not wish todestroy the country but only to crush and overawe the opposition they hadaroused. In the latter aim they certainly succeeded. Sunday night was the end ofthe organised opposition to their movements. After that no body of men wouldstand against them, so hopeless was the enterprise. Even the crews of thetorpedo-boats and destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the Thamesrefused to stop, mutinied, and went down again. The only offensive operation menventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines and pitfalls, andeven in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic.One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteries towardsEsher, waiting so tensely in the twilight. Survivors there were none. One maypicture the orderly expectation, the officers alert and watchful, the gunnersready, the ammunition piled to hand, the limber gunners with their horses andwaggons, the groups of civilian spectators standing as near as they werepermitted, the evening stillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with theburned and wounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots theMartians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and houses andsmashing amid the neighbouring fields.One may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention, the swiftlyspreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong, toweringheavenward, turning the twilight to a palpable darkness, a strange and horribleantagonist of vapour striding upon its victims, men and horses near it seendimly, running, shrieking, falling headlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenlyabandoned, men choking and writhing on the ground, and the swift broadening-outof the opaque cone of smoke. And then night and extinction--nothing but a silentmass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead.Before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of Richmond, andthe disintegrating organism of government was, with a last expiring effort,rousing the population of London to the necessity of flight."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVI - THE EXODUS FROM LONDONSo you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the greatest cityin the world just as Monday was dawning--the stream of flight rising swiftly toa torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult round the railway stations, banked upinto a horrible struggle about the shipping in the Thames, and hurrying by everyavailable channel northward and eastward. By ten o'clock the policeorganisation, and by midday even the railway organisations, were losingcoherency, losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last inthat swift liquefaction of the social body.All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern people at CannonStreet had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and trains were being filled.People were fighting savagely for standing-room in the carriages even at twoo'clock. By three, people were being trampled and crushed even in BishopsgateStreet, a couple of hundred yards or more from Liverpool Street station;revolvers were fired, people stabbed, and the policemen who had been sent todirect the traffic, exhausted and infuriated, were breaking the heads of thepeople they were called out to protect.And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to return toLondon, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an ever-thickeningmultitude away from the stations and along the northward-running roads. Bymidday a Martian had been seen at Barnes, and a cloud of slowly sinking blackvapour drove along the Thames and across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off allescape over the bridges in its sluggish advance. Another bank drove over Ealing,and surrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but unable toescape.After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train at ChalkFarm--the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yardthere ploughed through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart men fought to keepthe crowd from crushing the driver against his furnace--my brother emerged uponthe Chalk Farm road, dodged across through a hurrying swarm of vehicles, and hadthe luck to be foremost in the sack of a cycle shop. The front tire of themachine he got was punctured in dragging it through the window, but he got upand off, notwithstanding, with no further injury than a cut wrist. The steepfoot of Haverstock Hill was impassable owing to several overturned horses, andmy brother struck into Belsize Road.So he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the Edgware Road, reachedEdgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well ahead of the crowd. Along theroad people were standing in the roadway, curious, wondering. He was passed by anumber of cyclists, some horsemen, and two motor cars. A mile from Edgware therim of the wheel broke, and the machine became unridable. He left it by theroadside and trudged through the village. There were shops half opened in themain street of the place, and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorwaysand windows, staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of fugitivesthat was beginning. He succeeded in getting some food at an inn.For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do. The flying peopleincreased in number. Many of them, like my brother, seemed inclined to loiter inthe place. There was no fresh news of the invaders from Mars.At that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from congested. Most of thefugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles, but there were soon motor cars,hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, and the dust hung in heavy cloudsalong the road to St. Albans.It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where some friendsof his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike into a quiet lanerunning eastward. Presently he came upon a stile, and, crossing it, followed afootpath northeastward. He passed near several farmhouses and some little placeswhose names he did not learn. He saw few fugitives until, in a grass lanetowards High Barnet, he happened upon two ladies who became his fellowtravellers. He came upon them just in time to save them.He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a couple of menstruggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which they had beendriving, while a third with difficulty held the frightened pony's head. One ofthe ladies, a short woman dressed in white, was simply screaming; the other, adark, slender figure, slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip sheheld in her disengaged hand.My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried towards thestruggle. One of the men desisted and turned towards him, and my brother,realising from his antagonist's face that a fight was unavoidable, and being anexpert boxer, went into him forthwith and sent him down against the wheel of thechaise.It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with akick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender lady's arm. Heheard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung across his face, a third antagoniststruck him between the eyes, and the man he held wrenched himself free and madeoff down the lane in the direction from which he had come.Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the horse's head,and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the lane, swaying fromside to side, and with the women in it looking back. The man before him, a burlyrough, tried to close, and he stopped him with a blow in the face. Then,realising that he was deserted, he dodged round and made off down the lane afterthe chaise, with the sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who hadturned now, following remotely.Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong, and he roseto his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again. He would havehad little chance against them had not the slender lady very pluckily pulled upand returned to his help. It seems she had had a revolver all this time, but ithad been under the seat when she and her companion were attacked. She fired atsix yards' distance, narrowly missing my brother. The less courageous of therobbers made off, and his companion followed him, cursing his cowardice. Theyboth stopped in sight down the lane, where the third man lay insensible. \"Take this!\" said the slender lady, and she gave my brother her revolver. \"Go back to the chaise,\" said my brother, wiping the blood from his split lip. She turned without a word--they were both panting--and they went back to wherethe lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony. The robbers had evidently had enough of it. When my brother looked again theywere retreating. \"I'll sit here,\" said my brother, \"if I may\"; and he got upon the empty frontseat. The lady looked over her shoulder. \"Give me the reins,\" she said, and laid the whip along the pony's side. Inanother moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my brother's eyes. So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with a cut mouth, abruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an unknown lane with thesetwo women. He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon living atStanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous case at Pinner, andheard at some railway station on his way of the Martian advance. He had hurriedhome, roused the women--their servant had left them two days before--packed someprovisions, put his revolver under the seat--luckily for my brother--and toldthem to drive on to Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there. He stoppedbehind to tell the neighbours. He would overtake them, he said, at about halfpast four in the morning, and now it was nearly nine and they had seen nothingof him. They could not stop in Edgware because of the growing traffic throughthe place, and so they had come into this side lane.That was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently they stoppedagain, nearer to New Barnet. He promised to stay with them, at least until theycould determine what to do, or until the missing man arrived, and professed tobe an expert shot with the revolver--a weapon strange to him--in order to givethem confidence.They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became happy in thehedge. He told them of his own escape out of London, and all that he knew ofthese Martians and their ways. The sun crept higher in the sky, and after a timetheir talk died out and gave place to an uneasy state of anticipation. Severalwayfarers came along the lane, and of these my brother gathered such news as hecould. Every broken answer he had deepened his impression of the great disasterthat had come on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessityfor prosecuting this flight. He urged the matter upon them. \"We have money,\" said the slender woman, and hesitated. Her eyes met my brother's, and her hesitation ended. \"So have I,\" said my brother. She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold, besides afive-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get upon a train at St.Albans or New Barnet. My brother thought that was hopeless, seeing the fury ofthe Londoners to crowd upon the trains, and broached his own idea of strikingacross Essex towards Harwich and thence escaping from the country altogether.Mrs. Elphinstone--that was the name of the woman in white--would listen to noreasoning, and kept calling upon \"George\"; but her sister-in-law wasastonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at last agreed to my brother'ssuggestion. So, designing to cross the Great North Road, they went on towardsBarnet, my brother leading the pony to save it as much as possible. As the suncrept up the sky the day became excessively hot, and under foot a thick, whitishsand grew burning and blinding, so that they travelled only very slowly. Thehedges were grey with dust. And as they advanced towards Barnet a tumultuousmurmuring grew stronger.They began to meet more people. For the most part these were staring beforethem, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard, unclean. One man inevening dress passed them on foot, his eyes on the ground. They heard his voice,and, looking back at him, saw one hand clutched in his hair and the otherbeating invisible things. His paroxysm of rage over, he went on his way withoutonce looking back.As my brother's party went on towards the crossroads to the south of Barnet theysaw a woman approaching the road across some fields on their left, carrying achild and with two other children; and then passed a man in dirty black, with athick stick in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other. Then round thecorner of the lane, from between the villas that guarded it at its confluencewith the high road, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and drivenby a sallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust. There were three girls, EastEnd factory girls, and a couple of little children crowded in the cart. \"This'll tike us rahnd Edgware?\" asked the driver, wild-eyed, white-faced; andwhen my brother told him it would if he turned to the left, he whipped up atonce without the formality of thanks. My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the houses in front ofthem, and veiling the white facade of a terrace beyond the road that appearedbetween the backs of the villas. Mrs. Elphinstone suddenly cried out at a numberof tongues of smoky red flame leaping up above the houses in front of themagainst the hot, blue sky. The tumultuous noise resolved itself now into thedisorderly mingling of many voices, the gride of many wheels, the creaking ofwaggons, and the staccato of hoofs. The lane came round sharply not fifty yardsfrom the crossroads. \"Good heavens!\" cried Mrs. Elphinstone. \"What is this you are driving us into?\" My brother stopped. For the main road was a boiling stream of people, a torrent of human beingsrushing northward, one pressing on another. A great bank of dust, white andluminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything within twenty feet of theground grey and indistinct and was perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of adense crowd of horses and of men and women on foot, and by the wheels ofvehicles of every description. \"Way!\" my brother heard voices crying. \"Make way!\" It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting point of thelane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust was hot and pungent.And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa was burning and sending rollingmasses of black smoke across the road to add to the confusion.Two men came past them. Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy bundle and weeping.A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue, circled dubiously round them, scaredand wretched, and fled at my brother's threat.So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses to the rightwas a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent in between the villas oneither side; the black heads, the crowded forms, grew into distinctness as theyrushed towards the corner, hurried past, and merged their individuality again ina receding multitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust. \"Go on! Go on!\" cried the voices. \"Way! Way!\" One man's hands pressed on the back of another. My brother stood at the pony'shead. Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace by pace, down the lane. Edgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult, but this wasa whole population in movement. It is hard to imagine that host. It had nocharacter of its own. The figures poured out past the corner, and receded withtheir backs to the group in the lane. Along the margin came those who were onfoot threatened by the wheels, stumbling in the ditches, blundering into oneanother.The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making little way forthose swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted forward every now and thenwhen an opportunity showed itself of doing so, sending the people scatteringagainst the fences and gates of the villas. \"Push on!\" was the cry. \"Push on! They are coming!\" In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army,gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, \"Eternity! Eternity!\" Hisvoice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother could hear him long after hewas lost to sight in the dust. Some of the people who crowded in the cartswhipped stupidly at their horses and quarrelled with other drivers; some satmotionless, staring at nothing with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands withthirst, or lay prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances. The horses' bitswere covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot.There were cabs, carriages, shop cars, waggons, beyond counting; a mail cart, aroad-cleaner's cart marked \"Vestry of St. Pancras,\" a huge timber waggon crowdedwith roughs. A brewer's dray rumbled by with its two near wheels splashed withfresh blood. \"Clear the way!\" cried the voices. \"Clear the way!\" \"Eter-nity! Eter-nity!\" came echoing down the road. There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with children thatcried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in dust, their weary facessmeared with tears. With many of these came men, sometimes helpful, sometimeslowering and savage. Fighting side by side with them pushed some weary streetoutcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed, loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed. Therewere sturdy workmen thrusting their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothedlike clerks or shopmen, struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brothernoticed, men dressed in the clothes of railway porters, one wretched creature ina nightshirt with a coat thrown over it.But varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had in common.There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind them. A tumult up theroad, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent the whole host of them quickeningtheir pace; even a man so scared and broken that his knees bent under him wasgalvanised for a moment into renewed activity. The heat and dust had alreadybeen at work upon this multitude. Their skins were dry, their lips black andcracked. They were all thirsty, weary, and footsore. And amid the various criesone heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue; the voices ofmost of them were hoarse and weak. Through it all ran a refrain: \"Way! Way! The Martians are coming!\" Few stopped and came aside from that flood. The lane opened slantingly into themain road with a narrow opening, and had a delusive appearance of coming fromthe direction of London. Yet a kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth;weaklings elbowed out of the stream, who for the most part rested but a momentbefore plunging into it again. A little way down the lane, with two friendsbending over him, lay a man with a bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags. Hewas a lucky man to have friends.A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black frock coat,limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his boot--his sock wasblood-stained--shook out a pebble, and hobbled on again; and then a little girlof eight or nine, all alone, threw herself under the hedge close by my brother,weeping. \"I can't go on! I can't go on!\" My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up, speakinggently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphinstone. So soon as my brothertouched her she became quite still, as if frightened. \"Ellen!\" shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in her voice--\"Ellen!\" Andthe child suddenly darted away from my brother, crying \"Mother!\" \"They are coming,\" said a man on horseback, riding past along the lane. \"Out of the way, there!\" bawled a coachman, towering high; and my brother saw aclosed carriage turning into the lane. The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse. My brother pushed thepony and chaise back into the hedge, and the man drove by and stopped at theturn of the way. It was a carriage, with a pole for a pair of horses, but onlyone was in the traces. My brother saw dimly through the dust that two men liftedout something on a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath theprivet hedge. One of the men came running to my brother. \"Where is there any water?\" he said. \"He is dying fast, and very thirsty. It isLord Garrick.\" \"Lord Garrick!\" said my brother; \"the Chief Justice?\" \"The water?\" he said. \"There may be a tap,\" said my brother, \"in some of the houses. We have no water.I dare not leave my people.\" The man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house. \"Go on!\" said the people, thrusting at him. \"They are coming! Go on!\" Then my brother's attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-faced man lugginga small handbag, which split even as my brother's eyes rested on it anddisgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up into separate coins as itstruck the ground. They rolled hither and thither among the struggling feet ofmen and horses. The man stopped and looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaftof a cab struck his shoulder and sent him reeling. He gave a shriek and dodgedback, and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly. \"Way!\" cried the men all about him. \"Make way!\" So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands open, upon theheap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket. A horse rose closeupon him, and in another moment, half rising, he had been borne down under thehorse's hoofs. \"Stop!\" screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way, tried to clutchthe bit of the horse. Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and saw throughthe dust the rim passing over the poor wretch's back. The driver of the cartslashed his whip at my brother, who ran round behind the cart. The multitudinousshouting confused his ears. The man was writhing in the dust among his scatteredmoney, unable to rise, for the wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbslay limp and dead. My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a manon a black horse came to his assistance. \"Get him out of the road,\" said he; and, clutching the man's collar with hisfree hand, my brother lugged him sideways. But he still clutched after hismoney, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering at his arm with a handful ofgold. \"Go on! Go on!\" shouted angry voices behind. \"Way! Way!\" There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that the manon horseback stopped. My brother looked up, and the man with the gold twistedhis head round and bit the wrist that held his collar. There was a concussion,and the black horse came staggering sideways, and the carthorse pushed besideit. A hoof missed my brother's foot by a hair's breadth. He released his grip onthe fallen man and jumped back. He saw anger change to terror on the face of thepoor wretch on the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my brother wasborne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane, and had to fight hardin the torrent to recover it.He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with all achild's want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated eyes at a dustysomething that lay black and still, ground and crushed under the rolling wheels.\"Let us go back!\" he shouted, and began turning the pony round. \"We cannot crossthis--hell,\" he said and they went back a hundred yards the way they had come,until the fighting crowd was hidden. As they passed the bend in the lane mybrother saw the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadlywhite and drawn, and shining with perspiration. The two women sat silent,crouching in their seat and shivering.Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again. Miss Elphinstone was white andpale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched even to call upon\"George.\" My brother was horrified and perplexed. So soon as they had retreatedhe realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to attempt this crossing. Heturned to Miss Elphinstone, suddenly resolute. \"We must go that way,\" he said, and led the pony round again. For the second time that day this girl proved her quality. To force their wayinto the torrent of people, my brother plunged into the traffic and held back acab horse, while she drove the pony across its head. A waggon locked wheels fora moment and ripped a long splinter from the chaise. In another moment they werecaught and swept forward by the stream. My brother, with the cabman's whip marksred across his face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins fromher. \"Point the revolver at the man behind,\" he said, giving it to her, \"if hepresses us too hard. No!--point it at his horse.\" Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across the road.But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition, to become a part of thatdusty rout. They swept through Chipping Barnet with the torrent; they werenearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before they had fought across to theopposite side of the way. It was din and confusion indescribable; but in andbeyond the town the road forks repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved thestress.They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of the road, andat another place farther on they came upon a great multitude of people drinkingat the stream, some fighting to come at the water. And farther on, from a lullnear East Barnet, they saw two trains running slowly one after the other withoutsignal or order--trains swarming with people, with men even among the coalsbehind the engines--going northward along the Great Northern Railway. My brothersupposes they must have filled outside London, for at that time the furiousterror of the people had rendered the central termini impossible.Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the violence ofthe day had already utterly exhausted all three of them. They began to sufferthe beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and none of them dared to sleep.And in the evening many people came hurrying along the road nearby theirstopping place, fleeing from unknown dangers before them, and going in thedirection from which my brother had come."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVII -THE \"THUNDER CHILD\"Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Monday haveannihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself slowly throughthe home counties. Not only along the road through Barnet, but also throughEdgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the roads eastward to Southend andShoeburyness, and south of the Thames to Deal and Broadstairs, poured the samefrantic rout. If one could have hung that June morning in a balloon in theblazing blue above London every northward and eastward road running out of thetangled maze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streamingfugitives, each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress. I have setforth at length in the last chapter my brother's account of the road throughChipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise how that swarming of blackdots appeared to one of those concerned. Never before in the history of theworld had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. The legendaryhosts of Goths and Huns, the hugest armies Asia has ever seen, would have beenbut a drop in that current. And this was no disciplined march; it was astampede--a stampede gigantic and terrible--without order and without a goal,six million people unarmed and unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was thebeginning of the rout of civilisation, of the massacre of mankind.Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of streets far andwide, houses, churches, squares, crescents, gardens--already derelict--spreadout like a huge map, and in the southward blotted. Over Ealing, Richmond,Wimbledon, it would have seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon thechart. Steadily, incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting outramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising ground, nowpouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley, exactly as a gout of inkwould spread itself upon blotting paper.And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river, the glitteringMartians went to and fro, calmly and methodically spreading their poison cloudover this patch of country and then over that, laying it again with their steamjets when it had served its purpose, and taking possession of the conqueredcountry. They do not seem to have aimed at extermination so much as at completedemoralisation and the destruction of any opposition. They exploded any storesof powder they came upon, cut every telegraph, and wrecked the railways here andthere. They were hamstringing mankind. They seemed in no hurry to extend thefield of their operations, and did not come beyond the central part of Londonall that day. It is possible that a very considerable number of people in Londonstuck to their houses through Monday morning. Certain it is that many died athome suffocated by the Black Smoke.Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene. Steamboats andshipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the enormous sums of money offeredby fugitives, and it is said that many who swam out to these vessels were thrustoff with boathooks and drowned. About one o'clock in the afternoon the thinningremnant of a cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches ofBlackfriars Bridge. At that the Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting,and collision, and for some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in thenorthern arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and lightermen had to fightsavagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront. Peoplewere actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from above.When, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower and waded downthe river, nothing but wreckage floated above Limehouse.Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell. The sixth starfell at Wimbledon. My brother, keeping watch beside the women in the chaise in ameadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond the hills. On Tuesday the littleparty, still set upon getting across the sea, made its way through the swarmingcountry towards Colchester. The news that the Martians were now in possession ofthe whole of London was confirmed. They had been seen at Highgate, and even, itwas said, at Neasden. But they did not come into my brother's view until themorrow.That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need ofprovisions. As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to be regarded.Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds, granaries, and ripening rootcrops with arms in their hands. A number of people now, like my brother, hadtheir faces eastward, and there were some desperate souls even going backtowards London to get food. These were chiefly people from the northern suburbs,whose knowledge of the Black Smoke came by hearsay. He heard that about half themembers of the government had gathered at Birmingham, and that enormousquantities of high explosives were being prepared to be used in automatic minesacross the Midland counties.He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the desertions ofthe first day's panic, had resumed traffic, and was running northward trainsfrom St. Albans to relieve the congestion of the home counties. There was also aplacard in Chipping Ongar announcing that large stores of flour were availablein the northern towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would bedistributed among the starving people in the neighbourhood. But thisintelligence did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and thethree pressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distribution thanthis promise. Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hear more of it. Thatnight fell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose Hill. It fell while MissElphinstone was watching, for she took that duty alternately with my brother.She saw it.On Wednesday the three fugitives--they had passed the night in a field of unripewheat--reached Chelmsford, and there a body of the inhabitants, calling itselfthe Committee of Public Supply, seized the pony as provisions, and would givenothing in exchange for it but the promise of a share in it the next day. Herethere were rumours of Martians at Epping, and news of the destruction of WalthamAbbey Powder Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders.People were watching for Martians here from the church towers. My brother, veryluckily for him as it chanced, preferred to push on at once to the coast ratherthan wait for food, although all three of them were very hungry. By midday theypassed through Tillingham, which, strangely enough, seemed to be quite silentand deserted, save for a few furtive plunderers hunting for food. NearTillingham they suddenly came in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd ofshipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine.For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came on to theEssex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and afterwards to Foulness andShoebury, to bring off the people. They lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve thatvanished into mist at last towards the Naze. Close inshore was a multitude offishing smacks--English, Scotch, French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches fromthe Thames, yachts, electric boats; and beyond were ships of large burden, amultitude of filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships, passenger boats,petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport even, neat white and greyliners from Southampton and Hamburg; and along the blue coast across theBlackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of boats chafferingwith the people on the beach, a swarm which also extended up the Blackwateralmost to Maldon.About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water, almost, tomy brother's perception, like a water-logged ship. This was the ram ThunderChild. It was the only warship in sight, but far away to the right over thesmooth surface of the sea--for that day there was a dead calm--lay a serpent ofblack smoke to mark the next ironclads of the Channel Fleet, which hovered in anextended line, steam up and ready for action, across the Thames estuary duringthe course of the Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it.At the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the assurances of hersister-in-law, gave way to panic. She had never been out of England before, shewould rather die than trust herself friendless in a foreign country, and soforth. She seemed, poor woman, to imagine that the French and the Martians mightprove very similar. She had been growing increasingly hysterical, fearful, anddepressed during the two days' journeyings. Her great idea was to return toStanmore. Things had been always well and safe at Stanmore. They would findGeorge at Stanmore.It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the beach, wherepresently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention of some men on apaddle steamer from the Thames. They sent a boat and drove a bargain forthirty-six pounds for the three. The steamer was going, these men said, toOstend.It was about two o'clock when my brother, having paid their fares at thegangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his charges. There wasfood aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and the three of them contrived to eata meal on one of the seats forward.There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some of whom hadexpended their last money in securing a passage, but the captain lay off theBlackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up passengers until the seateddecks were even dangerously crowded. He would probably have remained longer hadit not been for the sound of guns that began about that hour in the south. As ifin answer, the ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags.A jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels.Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from Shoeburyness,until it was noticed that it was growing louder. At the same time, far away inthe southeast the masts and upperworks of three ironclads rose one after theother out of the sea, beneath clouds of black smoke. But my brother's attentionspeedily reverted to the distant firing in the south. He fancied he saw a columnof smoke rising out of the distant grey haze.The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big crescent ofshipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and hazy, when a Martianappeared, small and faint in the remote distance, advancing along the muddycoast from the direction of Foulness. At that the captain on the bridge swore atthe top of his voice with fear and anger at his own delay, and the paddlesseemed infected with his terror. Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or onthe seats of the steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the treesor church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a humanstride.It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more amazed thanterrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately towards the shipping,wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell away. Then, far awaybeyond the Crouch, came another, striding over some stunted trees, and then yetanother, still farther off, wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed tohang halfway up between sea and sky. They were all stalking seaward, as if tointercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded betweenFoulness and the Naze. In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of thelittle paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind her, shereceded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance.Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of shipping alreadywrithing with the approaching terror; one ship passing behind another, anothercoming round from broadside to end on, steamships whistling and giving offvolumes of steam, sails being let out, launches rushing hither and thither. Hewas so fascinated by this and by the creeping danger away to the left that hehad no eyes for anything seaward. And then a swift movement of the steamboat(she had suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong fromthe seat upon which he was standing. There was a shouting all about him, atrampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered faintly. The steamboatlurched and rolled him over upon his hands.He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards from theirheeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of a plough tearingthrough the water, tossing it on either side in huge waves of foam that leapedtowards the steamer, flinging her paddles helplessly in the air, and thensucking her deck down almost to the waterline.A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment. When his eyes were clearagain he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward. Big ironupperworks rose out of this headlong structure, and from that twin funnelsprojected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire. It was the torpedoram, Thunder Child, steaming headlong, coming to the rescue of the threatenedshipping.Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks, my brotherlooked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again, and he saw the threeof them now close together, and standing so far out to sea that their tripodsupports were almost entirely submerged. Thus sunken, and seen in remoteperspective, they appeared far less formidable than the huge iron bulk in whosewake the steamer was pitching so helplessly. It would seem they were regardingthis new antagonist with astonishment. To their intelligence, it may be, thegiant was even such another as themselves. The Thunder Child fired no gun, butsimply drove full speed towards them. It was probably her not firing thatenabled her to get so near the enemy as she did. They did not know what to makeof her. One shell, and they would have sent her to the bottom forthwith with theHeat-Ray.She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway between thesteamboat and the Martians--a diminishing black bulk against the recedinghorizontal expanse of the Essex coast.Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a canister of theblack gas at the ironclad. It hit her larboard side and glanced off in an inkyjet that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding torrent of Black Smoke, from whichthe ironclad drove clear. To the watchers from the steamer, low in the water andwith the sun in their eyes, it seemed as though she were already among theMartians.They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as theyretreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like generator of theHeat-Ray. He held it pointing obliquely downward, and a bank of steam sprangfrom the water at its touch. It must have driven through the iron of the ship'sside like a white-hot iron rod through paper.A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the Martian reeledand staggered. In another moment he was cut down, and a great body of water andsteam shot high in the air. The guns of the Thunder Child sounded through thereek, going off one after the other, and one shot splashed the water high closeby the steamer, ricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north, andsmashed a smack to matchwood.But no one heeded that very much. At the sight of the Martian's collapse thecaptain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the crowding passengers onthe steamer's stern shouted together. And then they yelled again. For, surgingout beyond the white tumult, drove something long and black, the flamesstreaming from its middle parts, its ventilators and funnels spouting fire.She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and her enginesworking. She headed straight for a second Martian, and was within a hundredyards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear. Then with a violent thud, ablinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped upward. The Martian staggeredwith the violence of her explosion, and in another moment the flaming wreckage,still driving forward with the impetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpledhim up like a thing of cardboard. My brother shouted involuntarily. A boilingtumult of steam hid everything again.\"Two!\" yelled the captain.Everyone was shouting. The whole steamer from end to end rang with franticcheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the crowdingmultitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea.The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third Martian and thecoast altogether. And all this time the boat was paddling steadily out to seaand away from the fight; and when at last the confusion cleared, the driftingbank of black vapour intervened, and nothing of the Thunder Child could be madeout, nor could the third Martian be seen. But the ironclads to seaward were nowquite close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat.The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the ironclads recededslowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by a marbled bank of vapour,part steam, part black gas, eddying and combining in the strangest way. Thefleet of refugees was scattering to the northeast; several smacks were sailingbetween the ironclads and the steamboat. After a time, and before they reachedthe sinking cloud bank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly wentabout and passed into the thickening haze of evening southward. The coast grewfaint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that weregathering about the sinking sun.Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration of guns,and a form of black shadows moving. Everyone struggled to the rail of thesteamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west, but nothing was to bedistinguished clearly. A mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of thesun. The steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense.The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the evening startrembled into sight. It was deep twilight when the captain cried out andpointed. My brother strained his eyes. Something rushed up into the sky out ofthe greyness--rushed slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminousclearness above the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, andvery large, that swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, andvanished again into the grey mystery of the night. And as it flew it rained downdarkness upon the land."},{"pageContent":"BOOK TWO - THE EARTH UNDER THE MARTIANS"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER I - UNDER FOOTIn the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to tell of theexperiences of my brother that all through the last two chapters I and thecurate have been lurking in the empty house at Halliford whither we fled toescape the Black Smoke. There I will resume. We stopped there all Sunday nightand all the next day--the day of the panic--in a little island of daylight, cutoff by the Black Smoke from the rest of the world. We could do nothing but waitin aching inactivity during those two weary days.My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife. I figured her at Leatherhead,terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man. I paced the rooms andcried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off from her, of all that mighthappen to her in my absence. My cousin I knew was brave enough for anyemergency, but he was not the sort of man to realise danger quickly, to risepromptly. What was needed now was not bravery, but circumspection. My onlyconsolation was to believe that the Martians were moving London-ward and awayfrom her. Such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful. I grew veryweary and irritable with the curate's perpetual ejaculations; I tired of thesight of his selfish despair. After some ineffectual remonstrance I kept awayfrom him, staying in a room--evidently a children's schoolroom--containingglobes, forms, and copybooks. When he followed me thither, I went to a box roomat the top of the house and, in order to be alone with my aching miseries,locked myself in.We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and the morning ofthe next. There were signs of people in the next house on Sunday evening--a faceat a window and moving lights, and later the slamming of a door. But I do notknow who these people were, nor what became of them. We saw nothing of them nextday. The Black Smoke drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning,creeping nearer and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside thehouse that hid us.A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff with a jet ofsuperheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the windows ittouched, and scalded the curate's hand as he fled out of the front room. When atlast we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again, the countrynorthward was as though a black snowstorm had passed over it. Looking towardsthe river, we were astonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling with theblack of the scorched meadows.For a time we did not see how this change affected our position, save that wewere relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke. But later I perceived that we wereno longer hemmed in, that now we might get away. So soon as I realised that theway of escape was open, my dream of action returned. But the curate waslethargic, unreasonable. \"We are safe here,\" he repeated; \"safe here.\" I resolved to leave him--would that I had! Wiser now for the artilleryman'steaching, I sought out food and drink. I had found oil and rags for my burns,and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that I found in one of the bedrooms.When it was clear to him that I meant to go alone--had reconciled myself togoing alone--he suddenly roused himself to come. And all being quiet throughoutthe afternoon, we started about five o'clock, as I should judge, along theblackened road to Sunbury.In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in contortedattitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and luggage, all coveredthickly with black dust. That pall of cindery powder made me think of what I hadread of the destruction of Pompeii. We got to Hampton Court withoutmisadventure, our minds full of strange and unfamiliar appearances, and atHampton Court our eyes were relieved to find a patch of green that had escapedthe suffocating drift. We went through Bushey Park, with its deer going to andfro under the chestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distance towardsHampton, and so we came to Twickenham. These were the first people we saw.Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still afire.Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke, and there were morepeople about here, though none could give us news. For the most part they werelike ourselves, taking advantage of a lull to shift their quarters. I have animpression that many of the houses here were still occupied by scaredinhabitants, too frightened even for flight. Here too the evidence of a hastyrout was abundant along the road. I remember most vividly three smashed bicyclesin a heap, pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts. We crossedRichmond Bridge about half past eight. We hurried across the exposed bridge, ofcourse, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses, some manyfeet across. I did not know what these were--there was no time for scrutiny--andI put a more horrible interpretation on them than they deserved. Here again onthe Surrey side were black dust that had once been smoke, and dead bodies--aheap near the approach to the station; but we had no glimpse of the Martiansuntil we were some way towards Barnes.We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a sidestreet towards the river, but otherwise it seemed deserted. Up the hill Richmondtown was burning briskly; outside the town of Richmond there was no trace of theBlack Smoke.Then suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of people running, and theupperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in sight over the housetops, nota hundred yards away from us. We stood aghast at our danger, and had the Martianlooked down we must immediately have perished. We were so terrified that wedared not go on, but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden. There thecurate crouched, weeping silently, and refusing to stir again.But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest, and in thetwilight I ventured out again. I went through a shrubbery, and along a passagebeside a big house standing in its own grounds, and so emerged upon the roadtowards Kew. The curate I left in the shed, but he came hurrying after me.That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did. For it was manifestthe Martians were about us. No sooner had the curate overtaken me than we saweither the fighting-machine we had seen before or another, far away across themeadows in the direction of Kew Lodge. Four or five little black figures hurriedbefore it across the green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evidentthis Martian pursued them. In three strides he was among them, and they ranradiating from his feet in all directions. He used no Heat-Ray to destroy them,but picked them up one by one. Apparently he tossed them into the great metalliccarrier which projected behind him, much as a workman's basket hangs over hisshoulder.It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any other purposethan destruction with defeated humanity. We stood for a moment petrified, thenturned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled garden, fell into, ratherthan found, a fortunate ditch, and lay there, scarce daring to whisper to eachother until the stars were out.I suppose it was nearly eleven o'clock before we gathered courage to startagain, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along hedgerows andthrough plantations, and watching keenly through the darkness, he on the rightand I on the left, for the Martians, who seemed to be all about us. In one placewe blundered upon a scorched and blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and anumber of scattered dead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads andtrunks but with their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fiftyfeet, perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages.Sheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent anddeserted. Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too dark for us tosee into the side roads of the place. In Sheen my companion suddenly complainedof faintness and thirst, and we decided to try one of the houses.The first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the window, was asmall semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable left in the place butsome mouldy cheese. There was, however, water to drink; and I took a hatchet,which promised to be useful in our next house-breaking.We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake. Here therestood a white house within a walled garden, and in the pantry of this domicilewe found a store of food--two loaves of bread in a pan, an uncooked steak, andthe half of a ham. I give this catalogue so precisely because, as it happened,we were destined to subsist upon this store for the next fortnight. Bottled beerstood under a shelf, and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limplettuces. This pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in this wasfirewood; there was also a cupboard, in which we found nearly a dozen ofburgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of biscuits.We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark--for we dared not strike a light--andate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle. The curate, who wasstill timorous and restless, was now, oddly enough, for pushing on, and I wasurging him to keep up his strength by eating when the thing happened that was toimprison us.\"It can't be midnight yet,\" I said, and then came a blinding glare of vividgreen light. Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly visible in green andblack, and vanished again. And then followed such a concussion as I have neverheard before or since. So close on the heels of this as to seem instantaneouscame a thud behind me, a clash of glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonryall about us, and the plaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into amultitude of fragments upon our heads. I was knocked headlong across the flooragainst the oven handle and stunned. I was insensible for a long time, thecurate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness again, and he, with aface wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from a cut forehead, was dabbingwater over me.For some time I could not recollect what had happened. Then things came to meslowly. A bruise on my temple asserted itself. \"Are you better?\" asked the curate in a whisper. At last I answered him. I sat up. \"Don't move,\" he said. \"The floor is covered with smashed crockery from thedresser. You can't possibly move without making a noise, and I fancy they areoutside.\" We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other breathing.Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near us, some plaster orbroken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound. Outside and very near was anintermittent, metallic rattle. \"That!\" said the curate, when presently it happened again. \"Yes,\" I said. \"But what is it?\" \"A Martian!\" said the curate. I listened again. \"It was not like the Heat-Ray,\" I said, and for a time I was inclined to thinkone of the great fighting-machines had stumbled against the house, as I had seenone stumble against the tower of Shepperton Church. Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or four hours,until the dawn came, we scarcely moved. And then the light filtered in, notthrough the window, which remained black, but through a triangular aperturebetween a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the wall behind us. The interiorof the kitchen we now saw greyly for the first time.The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which flowed over thetable upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet. Outside, the soilwas banked high against the house. At the top of the window frame we could seean uprooted drainpipe. The floor was littered with smashed hardware; the end ofthe kitchen towards the house was broken into, and since the daylight shone inthere, it was evident the greater part of the house had collapsed. Contrastingvividly with this ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale green,and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitatingblue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering from thewalls above the kitchen range.As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the body of aMartian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still glowing cylinder. At thesight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible out of the twilight of thekitchen into the darkness of the scullery. Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind. \"The fifth cylinder,\" I whispered, \"the fifth shot from Mars, has struck thishouse and buried us under the ruins!\" For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered: \"God have mercy upon us!\" I heard him presently whimpering to himself. Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my part scarcedared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of the kitchendoor. I could just see the curate's face, a dim, oval shape, and his collar andcuffs. Outside there began a metallic hammering, then a violent hooting, andthen again, after a quiet interval, a hissing like the hissing of an engine.These noises, for the most part problematical, continued intermittently, andseemed if anything to increase in number as time wore on. Presently a measuredthudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the vessels inthe pantry ring and shift, began and continued. Once the light was eclipsed, andthe ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely dark. For many hours we must havecrouched there, silent and shivering, until our tired attention failed. . . .At last I found myself awake and very hungry. I am inclined to believe we musthave spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening. My hunger was ata stride so insistent that it moved me to action. I told the curate I was goingto seek food, and felt my way towards the pantry. He made me no answer, but sosoon as I began eating the faint noise I made stirred him up and I heard himcrawling after me."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER II - WHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSEAfter eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have dozed again,for when presently I looked round I was alone. The thudding vibration continuedwith wearisome persistence. I whispered for the curate several times, and atlast felt my way to the door of the kitchen. It was still daylight, and Iperceived him across the room, lying against the triangular hole that looked outupon the Martians. His shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden fromme.I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed; and theplace rocked with that beating thud. Through the aperture in the wall I couldsee the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm blue of a tranquil eveningsky. For a minute or so I remained watching the curate, and then I advanced,crouching and stepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that litteredthe floor.I touched the curate's leg, and he started so violently that a mass of plasterwent sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact. I gripped his arm,fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we crouched motionless. Then Iturned to see how much of our rampart remained. The detachment of the plasterhad left a vertical slit open in the debris, and by raising myself cautiouslyacross a beam I was able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight aquiet suburban roadway. Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld.The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house we hadfirst visited. The building had vanished, completely smashed, pulverised, anddispersed by the blow. The cylinder lay now far beneath the originalfoundations--deep in a hole, already vastly larger than the pit I had lookedinto at Woking. The earth all round it had splashed under that tremendousimpact--\"splashed\" is the only word--and lay in heaped piles that hid the massesof the adjacent houses. It had behaved exactly like mud under the violent blowof a hammer. Our house had collapsed backward; the front portion, even on theground floor, had been destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen andscullery had escaped, and stood buried now under soil and ruins, closed in bytons of earth on every side save towards the cylinder. Over that aspect we hungnow on the very edge of the great circular pit the Martians were engaged inmaking. The heavy beating sound was evidently just behind us, and ever and againa bright green vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole.The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on the fartheredge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery, one of the greatfighting-machines, deserted by its occupant, stood stiff and tall against theevening sky. At first I scarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder, although ithas been convenient to describe them first, on account of the extraordinaryglittering mechanism I saw busy in the excavation, and on account of the strangecreatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould nearit.The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first. It was one of thosecomplicated fabrics that have since been called handling-machines, and the studyof which has already given such an enormous impetus to terrestrial invention. Asit dawned upon me first, it presented a sort of metallic spider with fivejointed, agile legs, and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars,and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body. Most of its arms wereretracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of rods,plates, and bars which lined the covering and apparently strengthened the wallsof the cylinder. These, as it extracted them, were lifted out and deposited upona level surface of earth behind it.Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did not see it asa machine, in spite of its metallic glitter. The fighting-machines werecoordinated and animated to an extraordinary pitch, but nothing to compare withthis. People who have never seen these structures, and have only theill-imagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions of sucheye-witnesses as myself to go upon, scarcely realise that living quality.I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to give aconsecutive account of the war. The artist had evidently made a hasty study ofone of the fighting-machines, and there his knowledge ended. He presented themas tilted, stiff tripods, without either flexibility or subtlety, and with analtogether misleading monotony of effect. The pamphlet containing theserenderings had a considerable vogue, and I mention them here simply to warn thereader against the impression they may have created. They were no more like theMartians I saw in action than a Dutch doll is like a human being. To my mind,the pamphlet would have been much better without them.At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine, but as acrablike creature with a glittering integument, the controlling Martian whosedelicate tentacles actuated its movements seeming to be simply the equivalent ofthe crab's cerebral portion. But then I perceived the resemblance of itsgrey-brown, shiny, leathery integument to that of the other sprawling bodiesbeyond, and the true nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me. With thatrealisation my interest shifted to those other creatures, the real Martians.Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the first nausea nolonger obscured my observation. Moreover, I was concealed and motionless, andunder no urgency of action.They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible to conceive.They were huge round bodies--or, rather, heads--about four feet in diameter,each body having in front of it a face. This face had no nostrils--indeed, theMartians do not seem to have had any sense of smell, but it had a pair of verylarge dark-coloured eyes, and just beneath this a kind of fleshy beak. In theback of this head or body--I scarcely know how to speak of it--was the singletight tympanic surface, since known to be anatomically an ear, though it musthave been almost useless in our dense air. In a group round the mouth weresixteen slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eighteach. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by that distinguishedanatomist, Professor Howes, the hands. Even as I saw these Martians for thefirst time they seemed to be endeavouring to raise themselves on these hands,but of course, with the increased weight of terrestrial conditions, this wasimpossible. There is reason to suppose that on Mars they may have progressedupon them with some facility.The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since shown, wasalmost equally simple. The greater part of the structure was the brain, sendingenormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles. Besides this were thebulky lungs, into which the mouth opened, and the heart and its vessels. Thepulmonary distress caused by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitationalattraction was only too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin.And this was the sum of the Martian organs. Strange as it may seem to a humanbeing, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes up the bulk of ourbodies, did not exist in the Martians. They were heads--merely heads. Entrailsthey had none. They did not eat, much less digest. Instead, they took the fresh,living blood of other creatures, and injected it into their own veins. I havemyself seen this being done, as I shall mention in its place. But, squeamish asI may seem, I cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure even tocontinue watching. Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from a still livinganimal, in most cases from a human being, was run directly by means of a littlepipette into the recipient canal. . . .The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at the same timeI think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seemto an intelligent rabbit.The physiological advantages of the practice of injection are undeniable, if onethinks of the tremendous waste of human time and energy occasioned by eating andthe digestive process. Our bodies are half made up of glands and tubes andorgans, occupied in turning heterogeneous food into blood. The digestiveprocesses and their reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colourour minds. Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers,or sound gastric glands. But the Martians were lifted above all these organicfluctuations of mood and emotion.Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is partlyexplained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had brought with themas provisions from Mars. These creatures, to judge from the shrivelled remainsthat have fallen into human hands, were bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons(almost like those of the silicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standingabout six feet high and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flintysockets. Two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, andall were killed before earth was reached. It was just as well for them, for themere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every bone intheir bodies.And while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place certainfurther details which, although they were not all evident to us at the time,will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to form a clearer pictureof these offensive creatures.In three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours. Theirorganisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of man sleeps. Since they hadno extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate, that periodical extinction wasunknown to them. They had little or no sense of fatigue, it would seem. On earththey could never have moved without effort, yet even to the last they kept inaction. In twenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours of work, as even onearth is perhaps the case with the ants.In the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world, the Martians wereabsolutely without sex, and therefore without any of the tumultuous emotionsthat arise from that difference among men. A young Martian, there can now be nodispute, was really born upon earth during the war, and it was found attached toits parent, partially budded off, just as young lilybulbs bud off, or like theyoung animals in the fresh-water polyp.In man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method of increase hasdisappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the primitive method. Amongthe lower animals, up even to those first cousins of the vertebrated animals,the Tunicates, the two processes occur side by side, but finally the sexualmethod superseded its competitor altogether. On Mars, however, just the reversehas apparently been the case.It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of quasi-scientificrepute, writing long before the Martian invasion, did forecast for man a finalstructure not unlike the actual Martian condition. His prophecy, I remember,appeared in November or December, 1893, in a long-defunct publication, the PallMall Budget, and I recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodicalcalled Punch. He pointed out--writing in a foolish, facetious tone--that theperfection of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; theperfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as hair, externalnose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential parts of the human being,and that the tendency of natural selection would lie in the direction of theirsteady diminution through the coming ages. The brain alone remained a cardinalnecessity. Only one other part of the body had a strong case for survival, andthat was the hand, \"teacher and agent of the brain.\" While the rest of the bodydwindled, the hands would grow larger.There is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians we havebeyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of the animalside of the organism by the intelligence. To me it is quite credible that theMartians may be descended from beings not unlike ourselves, by a gradualdevelopment of brain and hands (the latter giving rise to the two bunches ofdelicate tentacles at last) at the expense of the rest of the body. Without thebody the brain would, of course, become a mere selfish intelligence, without anyof the emotional substratum of the human being.The last salient point in which the systems of these creatures differed fromours was in what one might have thought a very trivial particular.Micro-organisms, which cause so much disease and pain on earth, have eithernever appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary science eliminated them ages ago. Ahundred diseases, all the fevers and contagions of human life, consumption,cancers, tumours and such morbidities, never enter the scheme of their life. Andspeaking of the differences between the life on Mars and terrestrial life, I mayallude here to the curious suggestions of the red weed.Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green for a dominantcolour, is of a vivid blood-red tint. At any rate, the seeds which the Martians(intentionally or accidentally) brought with them gave rise in all cases tored-coloured growths. Only that known popularly as the red weed, however, gainedany footing in competition with terrestrial forms. The red creeper was quite atransitory growth, and few people have seen it growing. For a time, however, thered weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance. It spread up the sides ofthe pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment, and its cactus-likebranches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our triangular window. Andafterwards I found it broadcast throughout the country, and especially whereverthere was a stream of water.The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a single rounddrum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual range not verydifferent from ours except that, according to Philips, blue and violet were asblack to them. It is commonly supposed that they communicated by sounds andtentacular gesticulations; this is asserted, for instance, in the able buthastily compiled pamphlet (written evidently by someone not an eye-witness ofMartian actions) to which I have already alluded, and which, so far, has beenthe chief source of information concerning them. Now no surviving human beingsaw so much of the Martians in action as I did. I take no credit to myself foran accident, but the fact is so. And I assert that I watched them closely timeafter time, and that I have seen four, five, and (once) six of them sluggishlyperforming the most elaborately complicated operations together without eithersound or gesture. Their peculiar hooting invariably preceded feeding; it had nomodulation, and was, I believe, in no sense a signal, but merely the expirationof air preparatory to the suctional operation. I have a certain claim to atleast an elementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I amconvinced--as firmly as I am convinced of anything--that the Martiansinterchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation. And I have beenconvinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions. Before the Martianinvasion, as an occasional reader here or there may remember, I had written withsome little vehemence against the telepathic theory.The Martians wore no clothing. Their conceptions of ornament and decorum werenecessarily different from ours; and not only were they evidently much lesssensible of changes of temperature than we are, but changes of pressure do notseem to have affected their health at all seriously. Yet though they wore noclothing, it was in the other artificial additions to their bodily resourcesthat their great superiority over man lay. We men, with our bicycles androad-skates, our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth,are just in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked out.They have become practically mere brains, wearing different bodies according totheir needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a bicycle in a hurry oran umbrella in the wet. And of their appliances, perhaps nothing is morewonderful to a man than the curious fact that what is the dominant feature ofalmost all human devices in mechanism is absent--the wheel is absent; among allthe things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use ofwheels. One would have at least expected it in locomotion. And in thisconnection it is curious to remark that even on this earth Nature has never hitupon the wheel, or has preferred other expedients to its development. And notonly did the Martians either not know of (which is incredible), or abstain from,the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly little use is made of the fixedpivot or relatively fixed pivot, with circular motions thereabout confined toone plane. Almost all the joints of the machinery present a complicated systemof sliding parts moving over small but beautifully curved friction bearings. Andwhile upon this matter of detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages oftheir machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of thedisks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn closely andpowerfully together when traversed by a current of electricity. In this way thecurious parallelism to animal motions, which was so striking and disturbing tothe human beholder, was attained. Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablikehandling-machine which, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched unpackingthe cylinder. It seemed infinitely more alive than the actual Martians lyingbeyond it in the sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual tentacles, andmoving feebly after their vast journey across space.While I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight, and notingeach strange detail of their form, the curate reminded me of his presence bypulling violently at my arm. I turned to a scowling face, and silent, eloquentlips. He wanted the slit, which permitted only one of us to peep through; and soI had to forego watching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege.When I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already put together severalof the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder into a shape havingan unmistakable likeness to its own; and down on the left a busy little diggingmechanism had come into view, emitting jets of green vapour and working its wayround the pit, excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminatingmanner. This it was which had caused the regular beating noise, and the rhythmicshocks that had kept our ruinous refuge quivering. It piped and whistled as itworked. So far as I could see, the thing was without a directing Martian at all."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER III - THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENTThe arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole into thescullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martian might see down uponus behind our barrier. At a later date we began to feel less in danger of theireyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of the sunlight outside our refuge must havebeen blank blackness, but at first the slightest suggestion of approach drove usinto the scullery in heart-throbbing retreat. Yet terrible as was the danger weincurred, the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible. And Irecall now with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinite danger in whichwe were between starvation and a still more terrible death, we could yetstruggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight. We would race across thekitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and the dread of making a noise,and strike each other, and thrust and kick, within a few inches of exposure.The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits ofthought and action, and our danger and isolation only accentuated theincompatibility. At Halliford I had already come to hate the curate's trick ofhelpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity of mind. His endless mutteringmonologue vitiated every effort I made to think out a line of action, and droveme at times, thus pent up and intensified, almost to the verge of craziness. Hewas as lacking in restraint as a silly woman. He would weep for hours together,and I verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought hisweak tears in some way efficacious. And I would sit in the darkness unable tokeep my mind off him by reason of his importunities. He ate more than I did, andit was in vain I pointed out that our only chance of life was to stop in thehouse until the Martians had done with their pit, that in that long patience atime might presently come when we should need food. He ate and drank impulsivelyin heavy meals at long intervals. He slept little.As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so intensifiedour distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed doing it, to resort tothreats, and at last to blows. That brought him to reason for a time. But he wasone of those weak creatures, void of pride, timorous, anaemic, hateful souls,full of shifty cunning, who face neither God nor man, who face not eventhemselves.It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but I set them downthat my story may lack nothing. Those who have escaped the dark and terribleaspects of life will find my brutality, my flash of rage in our final tragedy,easy enough to blame; for they know what is wrong as well as any, but not whatis possible to tortured men. But those who have been under the shadow, who havegone down at last to elemental things, will have a wider charity.And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers, snatched foodand drink, and gripping hands and blows, without, in the pitiless sunlight ofthat terrible June, was the strange wonder, the unfamiliar routine of theMartians in the pit. Let me return to those first new experiences of mine. Aftera long time I ventured back to the peephole, to find that the new-comers hadbeen reinforced by the occupants of no fewer than three of thefighting-machines. These last had brought with them certain fresh appliancesthat stood in an orderly manner about the cylinder. The second handling-machinewas now completed, and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances thebig machine had brought. This was a body resembling a milk can in its generalform, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and from which a streamof white powder flowed into a circular basin below.The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of thehandling-machine. With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was digging outand flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle above, while withanother arm it periodically opened a door and removed rusty and blackenedclinkers from the middle part of the machine. Another steely tentacle directedthe powder from the basin along a ribbed channel towards some receiver that washidden from me by the mound of bluish dust. From this unseen receiver a littlethread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air. As I looked, thehandling-machine, with a faint and musical clinking, extended, telescopicfashion, a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere blunt projection, untilits end was hidden behind the mound of clay. In another second it had lifted abar of white aluminium into sight, untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly,and deposited it in a growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit.Between sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than ahundred such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound of bluish dust rosesteadily until it topped the side of the pit.The contrast between the swift and complex movements of these contrivances andthe inert panting clumsiness of their masters was acute, and for days I had totell myself repeatedly that these latter were indeed the living of the twothings.The curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought to thepit. I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with all my ears. He made asudden movement backward, and I, fearful that we were observed, crouched in aspasm of terror. He came sliding down the rubbish and crept beside me in thedarkness, inarticulate, gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic. Hisgesture suggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while mycuriosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and clambered upto it. At first I could see no reason for his frantic behaviour. The twilighthad now come, the stars were little and faint, but the pit was illuminated bythe flickering green fire that came from the aluminium-making. The whole picturewas a flickering scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows,strangely trying to the eyes. Over and through it all went the bats, heeding itnot at all. The sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the mound ofblue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a fighting-machine,with its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated, stood across the corner ofthe pit. And then, amid the clangour of the machinery, came a drifting suspicionof human voices, that I entertained at first only to dismiss.I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfying myself now forthe first time that the hood did indeed contain a Martian. As the green flameslifted I could see the oily gleam of his integument and the brightness of hiseyes. And suddenly I heard a yell, and saw a long tentacle reaching over theshoulder of the machine to the little cage that hunched upon its back. Thensomething--something struggling violently--was lifted high against the sky, ablack, vague enigma against the starlight; and as this black object came downagain, I saw by the green brightness that it was a man. For an instant he wasclearly visible. He was a stout, ruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed; threedays before, he must have been walking the world, a man of considerableconsequence. I could see his staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs andwatch chain. He vanished behind the mound, and for a moment there was silence.And then began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from theMartians.I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands over my ears,and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching silently withhis arms over his head, looked up as I passed, cried out quite loudly at mydesertion of him, and came running after me.That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our horror and theterrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt an urgent need of actionI tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape; but afterwards, during thesecond day, I was able to consider our position with great clearness. Thecurate, I found, was quite incapable of discussion; this new and culminatingatrocity had robbed him of all vestiges of reason or forethought. Practically hehad already sunk to the level of an animal. But as the saying goes, I grippedmyself with both hands. It grew upon my mind, once I could face the facts, thatterrible as our position was, there was as yet no justification for absolutedespair. Our chief chance lay in the possibility of the Martians making the pitnothing more than a temporary encampment. Or even if they kept it permanently,they might not consider it necessary to guard it, and a chance of escape mightbe afforded us. I also weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging away out in a direction away from the pit, but the chances of our emerging withinsight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great. And I shouldhave had to do all the digging myself. The curate would certainly have failedme.It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw the ladkilled. It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the Martians feed.After that experience I avoided the hole in the wall for the better part of aday. I went into the scullery, removed the door, and spent some hours diggingwith my hatchet as silently as possible; but when I had made a hole about acouple of feet deep the loose earth collapsed noisily, and I did not darecontinue. I lost heart, and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time,having no spirit even to move. And after that I abandoned altogether the idea ofescaping by excavation.It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that at first Ientertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about by theiroverthrow through any human effort. But on the fourth or fifth night I heard asound like heavy guns.It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining brightly. The Martianshad taken away the excavating-machine, and, save for a fighting-machine thatstood in the remoter bank of the pit and a handling-machine that was buried outof my sight in a corner of the pit immediately beneath my peephole, the placewas deserted by them. Except for the pale glow from the handling-machine and thebars and patches of white moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for theclinking of the handling-machine, quite still. That night was a beautifulserenity; save for one planet, the moon seemed to have the sky to herself. Iheard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was that made me listen. Then Iheard quite distinctly a booming exactly like the sound of great guns. Sixdistinct reports I counted, and after a long interval six again. And that wasall."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV - THE DEATH OF THE CURATEIt was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for the last time, andpresently found myself alone. Instead of keeping close to me and trying to oustme from the slit, the curate had gone back into the scullery. I was struck by asudden thought. I went back quickly and quietly into the scullery. In thedarkness I heard the curate drinking. I snatched in the darkness, and my fingerscaught a bottle of burgundy.For a few minutes there was a tussle. The bottle struck the floor and broke, andI desisted and rose. We stood panting and threatening each other. In the end Iplanted myself between him and the food, and told him of my determination tobegin a discipline. I divided the food in the pantry, into rations to last usten days. I would not let him eat any more that day. In the afternoon he made afeeble effort to get at the food. I had been dozing, but in an instant I wasawake. All day and all night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, and heweeping and complaining of his immediate hunger. It was, I know, a night and aday, but to me it seemed--it seems now--an interminable length of time.And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict. For two vastdays we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests. There were times when Ibeat and kicked him madly, times when I cajoled and persuaded him, and once Itried to bribe him with the last bottle of burgundy, for there was a rain-waterpump from which I could get water. But neither force nor kindness availed; hewas indeed beyond reason. He would neither desist from his attacks on the foodnor from his noisy babbling to himself. The rudimentary precautions to keep ourimprisonment endurable he would not observe. Slowly I began to realise thecomplete overthrow of his intelligence, to perceive that my sole companion inthis close and sickly darkness was a man insane.From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind wandered attimes. I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept. It sounds paradoxical,but I am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity of the curate warnedme, braced me, and kept me a sane man.On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering, and nothing Icould do would moderate his speech.\"It is just, O God!\" he would say, over and over again. \"It is just. On me andmine be the punishment laid. We have sinned, we have fallen short. There waspoverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust, and I held my peace. Ipreached acceptable folly--my God, what folly!--when I should have stood up,though I died for it, and called upon them to repent—repent! . . . Oppressors ofthe poor and needy . . . ! The wine press of God!\"Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld from him,praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening. He began to raise his voice--Iprayed him not to. He perceived a hold on me--he threatened he would shout andbring the Martians upon us. For a time that scared me; but any concession wouldhave shortened our chance of escape beyond estimating. I defied him, although Ifelt no assurance that he might not do this thing. But that day, at any rate, hedid not. He talked with his voice rising slowly, through the greater part of theeighth and ninth days--threats, entreaties, mingled with a torrent of half-saneand always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of God's service, such as mademe pity him. Then he slept awhile, and began again with renewed strength, soloudly that I must needs make him desist. \"Be still!\" I implored. He rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the darkness near the copper. \"I have been still too long,\" he said, in a tone that must have reached the pit,\"and now I must bear my witness. Woe unto this unfaithful city! Woe! Woe! Woe!Woe! Woe! To the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of thetrumpet----\" \"Shut up!\" I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the Martians shouldhear us. \"For God's sake----\" \"Nay,\" shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, standing likewise andextending his arms. \"Speak! The word of the Lord is upon me!\" In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen. \"I must bear my witness! I go! It has already been too long delayed.\" I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall. In a flash Iwas after him. I was fierce with fear. Before he was halfway across the kitchenI had overtaken him. With one last touch of humanity I turned the blade back andstruck him with the butt. He went headlong forward and lay stretched on theground. I stumbled over him and stood panting. He lay still.Suddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of slipping plaster, and thetriangular aperture in the wall was darkened. I looked up and saw the lowersurface of a handling-machine coming slowly across the hole. One of its grippinglimbs curled amid the debris; another limb appeared, feeling its way over thefallen beams. I stood petrified, staring. Then I saw through a sort of glassplate near the edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large darkeyes of a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake of tentacle camefeeling slowly through the hole.I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the scullerydoor. The tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, in the room, andtwisting and turning, with queer sudden movements, this way and that. For awhile I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful advance. Then, with a faint,hoarse cry, I forced myself across the scullery. I trembled violently; I couldscarcely stand upright. I opened the door of the coal cellar, and stood there inthe darkness staring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listening.Had the Martian seen me? What was it doing now?Something was moving to and fro there, very quietly; every now and then ittapped against the wall, or started on its movements with a faint metallicringing, like the movements of keys on a split-ring. Then a heavy body--I knewtoo well what--was dragged across the floor of the kitchen towards the opening.Irresistibly attracted, I crept to the door and peeped into the kitchen. In thetriangle of bright outer sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of ahandling-machine, scrutinizing the curate's head. I thought at once that itwould infer my presence from the mark of the blow I had given him.I crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover myself up asmuch as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in the darkness, among thefirewood and coal therein. Every now and then I paused, rigid, to hear if theMartian had thrust its tentacles through the opening again.Then the faint metallic jingle returned. I traced it slowly feeling over thekitchen. Presently I heard it nearer--in the scullery, as I judged. I thoughtthat its length might be insufficient to reach me. I prayed copiously. Itpassed, scraping faintly across the cellar door. An age of almost intolerablesuspense intervened; then I heard it fumbling at the latch! It had found thedoor! The Martians understood doors! It worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then the door opened. In the darkness I could just see the thing--like an elephant's trunk more thananything else--waving towards me and touching and examining the wall, coals,wood and ceiling. It was like a black worm swaying its blind head to and fro.Once, even, it touched the heel of my boot. I was on the verge of screaming; Ibit my hand. For a time the tentacle was silent. I could have fancied it hadbeen withdrawn. Presently, with an abrupt click, it gripped something--I thoughtit had me!--and seemed to go out of the cellar again. For a minute I was notsure. Apparently it had taken a lump of coal to examine.I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position, which had becomecramped, and then listened. I whispered passionate prayers for safety.Then I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards me again. Slowly,slowly it drew near, scratching against the walls and tapping the furniture.While I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the cellar door and closedit. I heard it go into the pantry, and the biscuit-tins rattled and a bottlesmashed, and then came a heavy bump against the cellar door. Then silence thatpassed into an infinity of suspense. Had it gone? At last I decided that it had. It came into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth day in the closedarkness, buried among coals and firewood, not daring even to crawl out for thedrink for which I craved. It was the eleventh day before I ventured so far frommy security."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER V - THE STILLNESSMy first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten the door between thekitchen and the scullery. But the pantry was empty; every scrap of food hadgone. Apparently, the Martian had taken it all on the previous day. At thatdiscovery I despaired for the first time. I took no food, or no drink either, onthe eleventh or the twelfth day.At first my mouth and throat were parched, and my strength ebbed sensibly. I satabout in the darkness of the scullery, in a state of despondent wretchedness. Mymind ran on eating. I thought I had become deaf, for the noises of movement Ihad been accustomed to hear from the pit had ceased absolutely. I did not feelstrong enough to crawl noiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there.On the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chance of alarmingthe Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump that stood by the sink,and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and tainted rain water. I was greatlyrefreshed by this, and emboldened by the fact that no enquiring tentaclefollowed the noise of my pumping.During these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much of the curateand of the manner of his death.On the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and dozed and thoughtdisjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape. Whenever I dozedI dreamt of horrible phantasms, of the death of the curate, or of sumptuousdinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt a keen pain that urged me to drink againand again. The light that came into the scullery was no longer grey, but red. Tomy disordered imagination it seemed the colour of blood.On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was surprised to find thatthe fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in the wall, turningthe half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured obscurity.It was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious, familiar sequence ofsounds in the kitchen, and, listening, identified it as the snuffing andscratching of a dog. Going into the kitchen, I saw a dog's nose peering inthrough a break among the ruddy fronds. This greatly surprised me. At the scentof me he barked shortly.I thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly I should be able,perhaps, to kill and eat him; and in any case, it would be advisable to killhim, lest his actions attracted the attention of the Martians. I crept forward, saying \"Good dog!\" very softly; but he suddenly withdrew hishead and disappeared. I listened--I was not deaf--but certainly the pit was still. I heard a soundlike the flutter of a bird's wings, and a hoarse croaking, but that was all. For a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring to move aside thered plants that obscured it. Once or twice I heard a faint pitter-patter likethe feet of the dog going hither and thither on the sand far below me, and therewere more birdlike sounds, but that was all. At length, encouraged by thesilence, I looked out.Except in the corner, where a multitude of crows hopped and fought over theskeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed, there was not a living thing inthe pit.I stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes. All the machinery had gone. Savefor the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one corner, certain bars ofaluminium in another, the black birds, and the skeletons of the killed, theplace was merely an empty circular pit in the sand.Slowly I thrust myself out through the red weed, and stood upon the mound ofrubble. I could see in any direction save behind me, to the north, and neitherMartians nor sign of Martians were to be seen. The pit dropped sheerly from myfeet, but a little way along the rubbish afforded a practicable slope to thesummit of the ruins. My chance of escape had come. I began to tremble.I hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of desperate resolution, and witha heart that throbbed violently, I scrambled to the top of the mound in which Ihad been buried so long. I looked about again. To the northward, too, no Martian was visible. When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had been a stragglingstreet of comfortable white and red houses, interspersed with abundant shadytrees. Now I stood on a mound of smashed brickwork, clay, and gravel, over whichspread a multitude of red cactus-shaped plants, knee-high, without a solitaryterrestrial growth to dispute their footing. The trees near me were dead andbrown, but further a network of red thread scaled the still living stems.The neighbouring houses had all been wrecked, but none had been burned; theirwalls stood, sometimes to the second story, with smashed windows and shattereddoors. The red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless rooms. Below me was thegreat pit, with the crows struggling for its refuse. A number of other birdshopped about among the ruins. Far away I saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly alonga wall, but traces of men there were none.The day seemed, by contrast with my recent confinement, dazzlingly bright, thesky a glowing blue. A gentle breeze kept the red weed that covered every scrapof unoccupied ground gently swaying. And oh! the sweetness of the air!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI - THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYSFor some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety. Withinthat noisome den from which I had emerged I had thought with a narrow intensityonly of our immediate security. I had not realised what had been happening tothe world, had not anticipated this startling vision of unfamiliar things. I hadexpected to see Sheen in ruins I found about me the landscape, weird and lurid,of another planet.For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range of men, yet onethat the poor brutes we dominate know only too well. I felt as a rabbit mightfeel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by the work of a dozen busynavvies digging the foundations of a house. I felt the first inkling of a thingthat presently grew quite clear in my mind, that oppressed me for many days, asense of dethronement, a persuasion that I was no longer a master, but an animalamong the animals, under the Martian heel. With us it would be as with them, tolurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire of man had passed away.But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and my dominantmotive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast. In the direction away fromthe pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch of garden ground unburied.This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep, and sometimes neck-deep, in the redweed. The density of the weed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding. The wall wassome six feet high, and when I attempted to clamber it I found I could not liftmy feet to the crest. So I went along by the side of it, and came to a cornerand a rockwork that enabled me to get to the top, and tumble into the garden Icoveted. Here I found some young onions, a couple of gladiolus bulbs, and aquantity of immature carrots, all of which I secured, and, scrambling over aruined wall, went on my way through scarlet and crimson trees towards Kew--itwas like walking through an avenue of gigantic blood drops--possessed with twoideas: to get more food, and to limp, as soon and as far as my strengthpermitted, out of this accursed unearthly region of the pit.Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mushrooms which also Idevoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow water, wheremeadows used to be. These fragments of nourishment served only to whet myhunger. At first I was surprised at this flood in a hot, dry summer, butafterwards I discovered that it was caused by the tropical exuberance of the redweed. Directly this extraordinary growth encountered water it straightway becamegigantic and of unparalleled fecundity. Its seeds were simply poured down intothe water of the Wey and Thames, and its swiftly growing and Titanic waterfronds speedily choked both those rivers.At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in a tangle of thisweed, and at Richmond, too, the Thames water poured in a broad and shallowstream across the meadows of Hampton and Twickenham. As the water spread theweed followed them, until the ruined villas of the Thames valley were for a timelost in this red swamp, whose margin I explored, and much of the desolation theMartians had caused was concealed.In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread. Acankering disease, due, it is believed, to the action of certain bacteria,presently seized upon it. Now by the action of natural selection, allterrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power against bacterialdiseases--they never succumb without a severe struggle, but the red weed rottedlike a thing already dead. The fronds became bleached, and then shrivelled andbrittle. They broke off at the least touch, and the waters that had stimulatedtheir early growth carried their last vestiges out to sea.My first act on coming to this water was, of course, to slake my thirst. I dranka great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawed some fronds of red weed; butthey were watery, and had a sickly, metallic taste. I found the water wassufficiently shallow for me to wade securely, although the red weed impeded myfeet a little; but the flood evidently got deeper towards the river, and Iturned back to Mortlake. I managed to make out the road by means of occasionalruins of its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of thisspate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton and came out onPutney Common.Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the wreckage of thefamiliar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation of a cyclone, and in a fewscore yards I would come upon perfectly undisturbed spaces, houses with theirblinds trimly drawn and doors closed, as if they had been left for a day by theowners, or as if their inhabitants slept within. The red weed was less abundant;the tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper. I hunted for foodamong the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple of silent houses,but they had already been broken into and ransacked. I rested for the remainderof the daylight in a shrubbery, being, in my enfeebled condition, too fatiguedto push on.All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians. I encountereda couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried circuitously away from theadvances I made them. Near Roehampton I had seen two human skeletons--notbodies, but skeletons, picked clean--and in the wood by me I found the crushedand scattered bones of several cats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep. Butthough I gnawed parts of these in my mouth, there was nothing to be got fromthem.After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I think theHeat-Ray must have been used for some reason. And in the garden beyondRoehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes, sufficient to stay my hunger.From this garden one looked down upon Putney and the river. The aspect of theplace in the dusk was singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolateruins, and down the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with theweed. And over all--silence. It filled me with indescribable terror to think howswiftly that desolating change had come.For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence, and that Istood there alone, the last man left alive. Hard by the top of Putney Hill Icame upon another skeleton, with the arms dislocated and removed several yardsfrom the rest of the body. As I proceeded I became more and more convinced thatthe extermination of mankind was, save for such stragglers as myself, alreadyaccomplished in this part of the world. The Martians, I thought, had gone on andleft the country desolated, seeking food elsewhere. Perhaps even now they weredestroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone northward."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VII - THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILLI spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney Hill, sleeping ina made bed for the first time since my flight to Leatherhead. I will not tellthe needless trouble I had breaking into that house--afterwards I found thefront door was on the latch--nor how I ransacked every room for food, until juston the verge of despair, in what seemed to me to be a servant's bedroom, I founda rat-gnawed crust and two tins of pineapple. The place had been alreadysearched and emptied. In the bar I afterwards found some biscuits and sandwichesthat had been overlooked. The latter I could not eat, they were too rotten, butthe former not only stayed my hunger, but filled my pockets. I lit no lamps,fearing some Martian might come beating that part of London for food in thenight. Before I went to bed I had an interval of restlessness, and prowled fromwindow to window, peering out for some sign of these monsters. I slept little.As I lay in bed I found myself thinking consecutively--a thing I do not rememberto have done since my last argument with the curate. During all the interveningtime my mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague emotionalstates or a sort of stupid receptivity. But in the night my brain, reinforced, Isuppose, by the food I had eaten, grew clear again, and I thought.Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of the curate, thewhereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of my wife. The former gaveme no sensation of horror or remorse to recall; I saw it simply as a thing done,a memory infinitely disagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse. I sawmyself then as I see myself now, driven step by step towards that hasty blow,the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that. I felt nocondemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted me. In the silenceof the night, with that sense of the nearness of God that sometimes comes intothe stillness and the darkness, I stood my trial, my only trial, for that momentof wrath and fear. I retraced every step of our conversation from the momentwhen I had found him crouching beside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing tothe fire and smoke that streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge. We had beenincapable of co-operation--grim chance had taken no heed of that. Had Iforeseen, I should have left him at Halliford. But I did not foresee; and crimeis to foresee and do. And I set this down as I have set all this story down, asit was. There were no witnesses--all these things I might have concealed. But Iset it down, and the reader must form his judgment as he will.And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate body, Ifaced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife. For the former I hadno data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so, unhappily, I could for thelatter. And suddenly that night became terrible. I found myself sitting up inbed, staring at the dark. I found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might havesuddenly and painlessly struck her out of being. Since the night of my returnfrom Leatherhead I had not prayed. I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers, hadprayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now I prayedindeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with the darkness of God.Strange night! Strangest in this, that so soon as dawn had come, I, who hadtalked with God, crept out of the house like a rat leaving its hiding place--acreature scarcely larger, an inferior animal, a thing that for any passing whimof our masters might be hunted and killed. Perhaps they also prayed confidentlyto God. Surely, if we have learned nothing else, this war has taught uspity--pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion.The morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink, and wasfretted with little golden clouds. In the road that runs from the top of PutneyHill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the panic torrent that musthave poured Londonward on the Sunday night after the fighting began. There was alittle two-wheeled cart inscribed with the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, NewMalden, with a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hattrampled into the now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot ofblood-stained glass about the overturned water trough. My movements werelanguid, my plans of the vaguest. I had an idea of going to Leatherhead, thoughI knew that there I had the poorest chance of finding my wife. Certainly, unlessdeath had overtaken them suddenly, my cousins and she would have fled thence;but it seemed to me I might find or learn there whither the Surrey people hadfled. I knew I wanted to find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the worldof men, but I had no clear idea how the finding might be done. I was alsosharply aware now of my intense loneliness. From the corner I went, under coverof a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of Wimbledon Common, stretchingwide and far.That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom; there was no redweed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the verge of the open, the sunrose, flooding it all with light and vitality. I came upon a busy swarm oflittle frogs in a swampy place among the trees. I stopped to look at them,drawing a lesson from their stout resolve to live. And presently, turningsuddenly, with an odd feeling of being watched, I beheld something crouchingamid a clump of bushes. I stood regarding this. I made a step towards it, and itrose up and became a man armed with a cutlass. I approached him slowly. He stoodsilent and motionless, regarding me.As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and filthy as myown; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged through a culvert. Nearer,I distinguished the green slime of ditches mixing with the pale drab of driedclay and shiny, coaly patches. His black hair fell over his eyes, and his facewas dark and dirty and sunken, so that at first I did not recognise him. Therewas a red cut across the lower part of his face. \"Stop!\" he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and I stopped. His voicewas hoarse. \"Where do you come from?\" he said. I thought, surveying him. \"I come from Mortlake,\" I said. \"I was buried near the pit the Martians madeabout their cylinder. I have worked my way out and escaped.\" \"There is no food about here,\" he said. \"This is my country. All this hill downto the river, and back to Clapham, and up to the edge of the common. There isonly food for one. Which way are you going?\" I answered slowly. \"I don't know,\" I said. \"I have been buried in the ruins of a house thirteen orfourteen days. I don't know what has happened.\" He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with a changed expression. \"I've no wish to stop about here,\" said I. \"I think I shall go to Leatherhead,for my wife was there.\" He shot out a pointing finger. \"It is you,\" said he; \"the man from Woking. And you weren't killed atWeybridge?\" I recognised him at the same moment. \"You are the artilleryman who came into my garden.\" \"Good luck!\" he said. \"We are lucky ones! Fancy you!\" He put out a hand, and Itook it. \"I crawled up a drain,\" he said. \"But they didn't kill everyone. Andafter they went away I got off towards Walton across the fields. But---- It'snot sixteen days altogether--and your hair is grey.\" He looked over his shouldersuddenly. \"Only a rook,\" he said. \"One gets to know that birds have shadowsthese days. This is a bit open. Let us crawl under those bushes and talk.\" \"Have you seen any Martians?\" I said. \"Since I crawled out----\" \"They've gone away across London,\" he said. \"I guess they've got a bigger campthere. Of a night, all over there, Hampstead way, the sky is alive with theirlights. It's like a great city, and in the glare you can just see them moving.By daylight you can't. But nearer--I haven't seen them--\" (he counted on hisfingers) \"five days. Then I saw a couple across Hammersmith way carryingsomething big. And the night before last\"--he stopped and spokeimpressively--\"it was just a matter of lights, but it was something up in theair. I believe they've built a flying-machine, and are learning to fly.\" I stopped, on hands and knees, for we had come to the bushes. \"Fly!\" \"Yes,\" he said, \"fly.\" I went on into a little bower, and sat down. \"It is all over with humanity,\" I said. \"If they can do that they will simply goround the world.\" He nodded. \"They will. But---- It will relieve things over here a bit. And besides----\" Helooked at me. \"Aren't you satisfied it is up with humanity? I am. We're down;we're beat.\" I stared. Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this fact--a factperfectly obvious so soon as he spoke. I had still held a vague hope; rather, Ihad kept a lifelong habit of mind. He repeated his words, \"We're beat.\" Theycarried absolute conviction. \"It's all over,\" he said. \"They've lost one--just one. And they've made theirfooting good and crippled the greatest power in the world. They've walked overus. The death of that one at Weybridge was an accident. And these are onlypioneers. They kept on coming. These green stars--I've seen none these five orsix days, but I've no doubt they're falling somewhere every night. Nothing's tobe done. We're under! We're beat!\" I made him no answer. I sat staring before me, trying in vain to devise somecountervailing thought. \"This isn't a war,\" said the artilleryman. \"It never was a war, any more thanthere's war between man and ants.\" Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory. \"After the tenth shot they fired no more--at least, until the first cylindercame.\" \"How do you know?\" said the artilleryman. I explained. He thought. \"Somethingwrong with the gun,\" he said. \"But what if there is? They'll get it right again.And even if there's a delay, how can it alter the end? It's just men and ants.There's the ants builds their cities, live their lives, have wars, revolutions,until the men want them out of the way, and then they go out of the way. That'swhat we are now--just ants. Only----\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"We're eatable ants.\" We sat looking at each other. \"And what will they do with us?\" I said. \"That's what I've been thinking,\" he said; \"that's what I've been thinking.After Weybridge I went south--thinking. I saw what was up. Most of the peoplewere hard at it squealing and exciting themselves. But I'm not so fond ofsquealing. I've been in sight of death once or twice; I'm not an ornamentalsoldier, and at the best and worst, death--it's just death. And it's the manthat keeps on thinking comes through. I saw everyone tracking away south. SaysI, 'Food won't last this way,' and I turned right back. I went for the Martianslike a sparrow goes for man. All round\"--he waved a hand to thehorizon--\"they're starving in heaps, bolting, treading on each other. . . .\" He saw my face, and halted awkwardly. \"No doubt lots who had money have gone away to France,\" he said. He seemed tohesitate whether to apologise, met my eyes, and went on: \"There's food all abouthere. Canned things in shops; wines, spirits, mineral waters; and the watermains and drains are empty. Well, I was telling you what I was thinking. 'Here'sintelligent things,' I said, 'and it seems they want us for food. First, they'llsmash us up--ships, machines, guns, cities, all the order and organisation. Allthat will go. If we were the size of ants we might pull through. But we're not.It's all too bulky to stop. That's the first certainty.' Eh?\" I assented. \"It is; I've thought it out. Very well, then--next; at present we're caught aswe're wanted. A Martian has only to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run.And I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth, picking houses to pieces and routingamong the wreckage. But they won't keep on doing that. So soon as they'vesettled all our guns and ships, and smashed our railways, and done all thethings they are doing over there, they will begin catching us systematic,picking the best and storing us in cages and things. That's what they will startdoing in a bit. Lord! They haven't begun on us yet. Don't you see that?\" \"Not begun!\" I exclaimed. \"Not begun. All that's happened so far is through our not having the sense tokeep quiet--worrying them with guns and such foolery. And losing our heads, andrushing off in crowds to where there wasn't any more safety than where we were.They don't want to bother us yet. They're making their things--making all thethings they couldn't bring with them, getting things ready for the rest of theirpeople. Very likely that's why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear ofhitting those who are here. And instead of our rushing about blind, on the howl,or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up, we've got to fix ourselvesup according to the new state of affairs. That's how I figure it out. It isn'tquite according to what a man wants for his species, but it's about what thefacts point to. And that's the principle I acted upon. Cities, nations,civilisation, progress--it's all over. That game's up. We're beat.\" \"But if that is so, what is there to live for?\" The artilleryman looked at me for a moment. \"There won't be any more blessed concerts for a million years or so; there won'tbe any Royal Academy of Arts, and no nice little feeds at restaurants. If it'samusement you're after, I reckon the game is up. If you've got any drawing-roommanners or a dislike to eating peas with a knife or dropping aitches, you'dbetter chuck 'em away. They ain't no further use.\" \"You mean----\" \"I mean that men like me are going on living--for the sake of the breed. I tellyou, I'm grim set on living. And if I'm not mistaken, you'll show whatinsidesyou've got, too, before long. We aren't going to be exterminated. And Idon't mean to be caught either, and tamed and fattened and bred like athundering ox. Ugh! Fancy those brown creepers!\" \"You don't mean to say----\" \"I do. I'm going on, under their feet. I've got it planned; I've thought it out.We men are beat. We don't know enough. We've got to learn before we've got achance. And we've got to live and keep independent while we learn. See! That'swhat has to be done.\" I stared, astonished, and stirred profoundly by the man's resolution. \"Great God!\" cried I. \"But you are a man indeed!\" And suddenly I gripped hishand. \"Eh!\" he said, with his eyes shining. \"I've thought it out, eh?\" \"Go on,\" I said. \"Well, those who mean to escape their catching must get ready. I'm gettingready. Mind you, it isn't all of us that are made for wild beasts; and that'swhat it's got to be. That's why I watched you. I had my doubts. You're slender.I didn't know that it was you, you see, or just how you'd been buried. Allthese--the sort of people that lived in these houses, and all those damn littleclerks that used to live down that way--they'd be no good. They haven't anyspirit in them--no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn't one orthe other--Lord! What is he but funk and precautions? They just used toskedaddle off to work--I've seen hundreds of 'em, bit of breakfast in hand,running wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket train, for fearthey'd get dismissed if they didn't; working at businesses they were afraid totake the trouble to understand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldn't be intime for dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the back streets, andsleeping with the wives they married, not because they wanted them, but becausethey had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little miserableskedaddle through the world. Lives insured and a bit invested for fear ofaccidents. And on Sundays--fear of the hereafter. As if hell was built forrabbits! Well, the Martians will just be a godsend to these. Nice roomy cages,fattening food, careful breeding, no worry. After a week or so chasing about thefields and lands on empty stomachs, they'll come and be caught cheerful. They'llbe quite glad after a bit. They'll wonder what people did before there wereMartians to take care of them. And the bar loafers, and mashers, and singers--Ican imagine them. I can imagine them,\" he said, with a sort of sombregratification. \"There'll be any amount of sentiment and religion loose amongthem. There's hundreds of things I saw with my eyes that I've only begun to seeclearly these last few days. There's lots will take things as they are--fat andstupid; and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it's all wrong, andthat they ought to be doing something. Now whenever things are so that a lot ofpeople feel they ought to be doing something, the weak, and those who go weakwith a lot of complicated thinking, always make for a sort of do-nothingreligion, very pious and superior, and submit to persecution and the will of theLord. Very likely you've seen the same thing. It's energy in a gale of funk, andturned clean inside out. These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety.And those of a less simple sort will work in a bit of--what is it?--eroticism.\" He paused. \"Very likely these Martians will make pets of some of them; train them to dotricks--who knows?--get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to bekilled. And some, maybe, they will train to hunt us.\" \"No,\" I cried, \"that's impossible! No human being----\" \"What's the good of going on with such lies?\" said the artilleryman. \"There'smen who'd do it cheerful. What nonsense to pretend there isn't!\" And I succumbed to his conviction. \"If they come after me,\" he said; \"Lord, if they come after me!\" and subsidedinto a grim meditation. I sat contemplating these things. I could find nothing to bring against thisman's reasoning. In the days before the invasion no one would have questioned myintellectual superiority to his--I, a professed and recognised writer onphilosophical themes, and he, a common soldier; and yet he had alreadyformulated a situation that I had scarcely realised. \"What are you doing?\" I said presently. \"What plans have you made?\" He hesitated. \"Well, it's like this,\" he said. \"What have we to do? We have to invent a sortof life where men can live and breed, and be sufficiently secure to bring thechildren up. Yes--wait a bit, and I'll make it clearer what I think ought to bedone. The tame ones will go like all tame beasts; in a few generations they'llbe big, beautiful, rich-blooded, stupid--rubbish! The risk is that we who keepwild will go savage--degenerate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . . You see,how I mean to live is underground. I've been thinking about the drains. Ofcourse those who don't know drains think horrible things; but under this Londonare miles and miles--hundreds of miles--and a few days rain and London emptywill leave them sweet and clean. The main drains are big enough and airy enoughfor anyone. Then there's cellars, vaults, stores, from which bolting passagesmay be made to the drains. And the railway tunnels and subways. Eh? You begin tosee? And we form a band--able-bodied, clean-minded men. We're not going to pickup any rubbish that drifts in. Weaklings go out again.\" \"As you meant me to go?\" \"Well--I parleyed, didn't I?\" \"We won't quarrel about that. Go on.\" \"Those who stop obey orders. Able-bodied, clean-minded women we wantalso--mothers and teachers. No lackadaisical ladies--no blasted rolling eyes. Wecan't have any weak or silly. Life is real again, and the useless and cumbersomeand mischievous have to die. They ought to die. They ought to be willing to die.It's a sort of disloyalty, after all, to live and taint the race. And they can'tbe happy. Moreover, dying's none so dreadful; it's the funking makes it bad. Andin all those places we shall gather. Our district will be London. And we mayeven be able to keep a watch, and run about in the open when the Martians keepaway. Play cricket, perhaps. That's how we shall save the race. Eh? It's apossible thing? But saving the race is nothing in itself. As I say, that's onlybeing rats. It's saving our knowledge and adding to it is the thing. There menlike you come in. There's books, there's models. We must make great safe placesdown deep, and get all the books we can; not novels and poetry swipes, butideas, science books. That's where men like you come in. We must go to theBritish Museum and pick all those books through. Especially we must keep up ourscience--learn more. We must watch these Martians. Some of us must go as spies.When it's all working, perhaps I will. Get caught, I mean. And the great thingis, we must leave the Martians alone. We mustn't even steal. If we get in theirway, we clear out. We must show them we mean no harm. Yes, I know. But they'reintelligent things, and they won't hunt us down if they have all they want, andthink we're just harmless vermin.\" The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm. \"After all, it may not be so much we may have to learn before--Just imaginethis: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly starting off--Heat-Raysright and left, and not a Martian in 'em. Not a Martian in 'em, but men--men whohave learned the way how. It may be in my time, even--those men. Fancy havingone of them lovely things, with its Heat-Ray wide and free! Fancy having it incontrol! What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of therun, after a bust like that? I reckon the Martians'll open their beautiful eyes!Can't you see them, man? Can't you see them hurrying, hurrying--puffing andblowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs? Something out of gear inevery case. And swish, bang, rattle, swish! Just as they are fumbling overit,swish comes the Heat-Ray, and, behold! man has come back to his own.\"For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and the tone ofassurance and courage he assumed, completely dominated my mind. I believedunhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in the practicabilityof his astonishing scheme, and the reader who thinks me susceptible and foolishmust contrast his position, reading steadily with all his thoughts about hissubject, and mine, crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening, distractedby apprehension. We talked in this manner through the early morning time, andlater crept out of the bushes, and, after scanning the sky for Martians, hurriedprecipitately to the house on Putney Hill where he had made his lair. It was thecoal cellar of the place, and when I saw the work he had spent a week upon--itwas a burrow scarcely ten yards long, which he designed to reach to the maindrain on Putney Hill--I had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams andhis powers. Such a hole I could have dug in a day. But I believed in himsufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday at his digging.We had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range.We refreshed ourselves with a tin of mock-turtle soup and wine from theneighbouring pantry. I found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of theworld in this steady labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in my mind,and presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I worked there all themorning, so glad was I to find myself with a purpose again. After working anhour I began to speculate on the distance one had to go before the cloaca wasreached, the chances we had of missing it altogether. My immediate trouble waswhy we should dig this long tunnel, when it was possible to get into the drainat once down one of the manholes, and work back to the house. It seemed to me,too, that the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a needless length oftunnel. And just as I was beginning to face these things, the artillerymanstopped digging, and looked at me. \"We're working well,\" he said. He put down his spade. \"Let us knock off a bit\"he said. \"I think it's time we reconnoitred from the roof of the house.\" I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade; and thensuddenly I was struck by a thought. I stopped, and so did he at once. \"Why were you walking about the common,\" I said, \"instead of being here?\" \"Taking the air,\" he said. \"I was coming back. It's safer by night.\" \"But the work?\" \"Oh, one can't always work,\" he said, and in a flash I saw the man plain. Hehesitated, holding his spade. \"We ought to reconnoitre now,\" he said, \"becauseif any come near they may hear the spades and drop upon us unawares.\"I was no longer disposed to object. We went together to the roof and stood on aladder peeping out of the roof door. No Martians were to be seen, and weventured out on the tiles, and slipped down under shelter of the parapet.From this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of Putney, but we couldsee the river below, a bubbly mass of red weed, and the low parts of Lambethflooded and red. The red creeper swarmed up the trees about the old palace, andtheir branches stretched gaunt and dead, and set with shrivelled leaves, fromamid its clusters. It was strange how entirely dependent both these things wereupon flowing water for their propagation. About us neither had gained a footing;laburnums, pink mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of laurelsand hydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight. Beyond Kensington densesmoke was rising, and that and a blue haze hid the northward hills. The artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still remained inLondon. \"One night last week,\" he said, \"some fools got the electric light in order, andthere was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze, crowded with painted andragged drunkards, men and women, dancing and shouting till dawn. A man who wasthere told me. And as the day came they became aware of a fighting-machinestanding near by the Langham and looking down at them. Heaven knows how long hehad been there. It must have given some of them a nasty turn. He came down theroad towards them, and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened to runaway.\" Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe! From that, in answer to my questions, he came round to his grandiose plansagain. He grew enthusiastic. He talked so eloquently of the possibility ofcapturing a fighting-machine that I more than half believed in him again. Butnow that I was beginning to understand something of his quality, I could divinethe stress he laid on doing nothing precipitately. And I noted that now therewas no question that he personally was to capture and fight the great machine. After a time we went down to the cellar. Neither of us seemed disposed to resumedigging, and when he suggested a meal, I was nothing loath. He became suddenlyvery generous, and when we had eaten he went away and returned with someexcellent cigars. We lit these, and his optimism glowed. He was inclined toregard my coming as a great occasion. \"There's some champagne in the cellar,\" he said. \"We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy,\" said I. \"No,\" said he; \"I am host today. Champagne! Great God! We've a heavy enough taskbefore us! Let us take a rest and gather strength while we may. Look at theseblistered hands!\"And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon playing cards after wehad eaten. He taught me euchre, and after dividing London between us, I takingthe northern side and he the southern, we played for parish points. Grotesqueand foolish as this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true, andwhat is more remarkable, I found the card game and several others we playedextremely interesting.Strange mind of man! that, with our species upon the edge of extermination orappalling degradation, with no clear prospect before us but the chance of ahorrible death, we could sit following the chance of this painted pasteboard,and playing the \"joker\" with vivid delight. Afterwards he taught me poker, and Ibeat him at three tough chess games. When dark came we decided to take the risk,and lit a lamp.After an interminable string of games, we supped, and the artilleryman finishedthe champagne. We went on smoking the cigars. He was no longer the energeticregenerator of his species I had encountered in the morning. He was stilloptimistic, but it was a less kinetic, a more thoughtful optimism. I remember hewound up with my health, proposed in a speech of small variety and considerableintermittence. I took a cigar, and went upstairs to look at the lights of whichhe had spoken that blazed so greenly along the Highgate hills.At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley. The northern hillswere shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington glowed redly, and now andthen an orange-red tongue of flame flashed up and vanished in the deep bluenight. All the rest of London was black. Then, nearer, I perceived a strangelight, a pale, violet-purple fluorescent glow, quivering under the night breeze.For a space I could not understand it, and then I knew that it must be the redweed from which this faint irradiation proceeded. With that realisation mydormant sense of wonder, my sense of the proportion of things, awoke again. Iglanced from that to Mars, red and clear, glowing high in the west, and thengazed long and earnestly at the darkness of Hampstead and Highgate.I remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at the grotesque changes ofthe day. I recalled my mental states from the midnight prayer to the foolishcard-playing. I had a violent revulsion of feeling. I remember I flung away thecigar with a certain wasteful symbolism. My folly came to me with glaringexaggeration. I seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind; I was filled withremorse. I resolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great thingsto his drink and gluttony, and to go on into London. There, it seemed to me, Ihad the best chance of learning what the Martians and my fellowmen were doing. Iwas still upon the roof when the late moon rose."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII - DEAD LONDONAfter I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and by the HighStreet across the bridge to Fulham. The red weed was tumultuous at that time,and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its fronds were already whitened inpatches by the spreading disease that presently removed it so swiftly.At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I found a manlying. He was as black as a sweep with the black dust, alive, but helplessly andspeechlessly drunk. I could get nothing from him but curses and furious lungesat my head. I think I should have stayed by him but for the brutal expression ofhis face.There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, and it grewthicker in Fulham. The streets were horribly quiet. I got food--sour, hard, andmouldy, but quite eatable--in a baker's shop here. Some way towards Walham Greenthe streets became clear of powder, and I passed a white terrace of houses onfire; the noise of the burning was an absolute relief. Going on towardsBrompton, the streets were quiet again.Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon dead bodies.I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the Fulham Road. They had beendead many days, so that I hurried quickly past them. The black powder coveredthem over, and softened their outlines. One or two had been disturbed by dogs.Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday in the City,with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds drawn, the desertion,and the stillness. In some places plunderers had been at work, but rarely atother than the provision and wine shops. A jeweller's window had been brokenopen in one place, but apparently the thief had been disturbed, and a number ofgold chains and a watch lay scattered on the pavement. I did not trouble totouch them. Farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the handthat hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress, and asmashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement. She seemedasleep, but she was dead.The farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the stillness. But itwas not so much the stillness of death--it was the stillness of suspense, ofexpectation. At any time the destruction that had already singed thenorthwestern borders of the metropolis, and had annihilated Ealing and Kilburn,might strike among these houses and leave them smoking ruins. It was a citycondemned and derelict. . . .In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder. It wasnear South Kensington that I first heard the howling. It crept almostimperceptibly upon my senses. It was a sobbing alternation of two notes, \"Ulla,ulla, ulla, ulla,\" keeping on perpetually. When I passed streets that rannorthward it grew in volume, and houses and buildings seemed to deaden and cutit off again. It came in a full tide down Exhibition Road. I stopped, staringtowards Kensington Gardens, wondering at this strange, remote wailing. It was asif that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude.\"Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,\" wailed that superhuman note--great waves of soundsweeping down the broad, sunlit roadway, between the tall buildings on eachside. I turned northwards, marvelling, towards the iron gates of Hyde Park. Ihad half a mind to break into the Natural History Museum and find my way up tothe summits of the towers, in order to see across the park. But I decided tokeep to the ground, where quick hiding was possible, and so went on up theExhibition Road. All the large mansions on each side of the road were empty andstill, and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses. At the top, nearthe park gate, I came upon a strange sight--a bus overturned, and the skeletonof a horse picked clean. I puzzled over this for a time, and then went on to thebridge over the Serpentine. The voice grew stronger and stronger, though I couldsee nothing above the housetops on the north side of the park, save a haze ofsmoke to the northwest.\"Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,\" cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to me, from thedistrict about Regent's Park. The desolating cry worked upon my mind. The moodthat had sustained me passed. The wailing took possession of me. I found I wasintensely weary, footsore, and now again hungry and thirsty.It was already past noon. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the dead?Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and in its black shroud? Ifelt intolerably lonely. My mind ran on old friends that I had forgotten foryears. I thought of the poisons in the chemists' shops, of the liquors the winemerchants stored; I recalled the two sodden creatures of despair, who so far asI knew, shared the city with myself. . . .I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were black powderand several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the gratings of the cellarsof some of the houses. I grew very thirsty after the heat of my long walk. Withinfinite trouble I managed to break into a public-house and get food and drink.I was weary after eating, and went into the parlour behind the bar, and slept ona black horsehair sofa I found there.I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, \"Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla.\"It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some biscuits and a cheese in thebar--there was a meat safe, but it contained nothing but maggots--I wandered onthrough the silent residential squares to Baker Street--Portman Square is theonly one I can name--and so came out at last upon Regent's Park. And as Iemerged from the top of Baker Street, I saw far away over the trees in theclearness of the sunset the hood of the Martian giant from which this howlingproceeded. I was not terrified. I came upon him as if it were a matter ofcourse. I watched him for some time, but he did not move. He appeared to bestanding and yelling, for no reason that I could discover.I tried to formulate a plan of action. That perpetual sound of \"Ulla, ulla,ulla, ulla,\" confused my mind. Perhaps I was too tired to be very fearful.Certainly I was more curious to know the reason of this monotonous crying thanafraid. I turned back away from the park and struck into Park Road, intending toskirt the park, went along under the shelter of the terraces, and got a view ofthis stationary, howling Martian from the direction of St. John's Wood. A coupleof hundred yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus, and saw, first adog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong towards me,and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him. He made a wide curve toavoid me, as though he feared I might prove a fresh competitor. As the yelpingdied away down the silent road, the wailing sound of \"Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,\"reasserted itself.I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John's Wood station. Atfirst I thought a house had fallen across the road. It was only as I clamberedamong the ruins that I saw, with a start, this mechanical Samson lying, with itstentacles bent and smashed and twisted, among the ruins it had made. Theforepart was shattered. It seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at thehouse, and had been overwhelmed in its overthrow. It seemed to me then that thismight have happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of itsMartian. I could not clamber among the ruins to see it, and the twilight was nowso far advanced that the blood with which its seat was smeared, and the gnawedgristle of the Martian that the dogs had left, were invisible to me.Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on towards Primrose Hill.Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a second Martian, as motionless asthe first, standing in the park towards the Zoological Gardens, and silent. Alittle beyond the ruins about the smashed handling-machine I came upon the redweed again, and found the Regent's Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation. As I crossed the bridge, the sound of \"Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,\" ceased. It was,as it were, cut off. The silence came like a thunderclap. The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees towards thepark were growing black. All about me the red weed clambered among the ruins,writhing to get above me in the dimness. Night, the mother of fear and mystery,was coming upon me. But while that voice sounded the solitude, the desolation,had been endurable; by virtue of it London had still seemed alive, and the senseof life about me had upheld me. Then suddenly a change, the passing ofsomething--I knew not what--and then a stillness that could be felt. Nothing butthis gaunt quiet. London about me gazed at me spectrally. The windows in the whitehouses were like the eye sockets of skulls. About me my imagination found athousand noiseless enemies moving. Terror seized me, a horror of my temerity. Infront of me the road became pitchy black as though it was tarred, and I saw acontorted shape lying across the pathway. I could not bring myself to go on. Iturned down St. John's Wood Road, and ran headlong from this unendurablestillness towards Kilburn. I hid from the night and the silence, until longafter midnight, in a cabmen's shelter in Harrow Road. But before the dawn mycourage returned, and while the stars were still in the sky I turned once moretowards Regent's Park. I missed my way among the streets, and presently saw downa long avenue, in the half-light of the early dawn, the curve of Primrose Hill.On the summit, towering up to the fading stars, was a third Martian, erect andmotionless like the others.An insane resolve possessed me. I would die and end it. And I would save myselfeven the trouble of killing myself. I marched on recklessly towards this Titan,and then, as I drew nearer and the light grew, I saw that a multitude of blackbirds was circling and clustering about the hood. At that my heart gave a bound,and I began running along the road.I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund's Terrace (I wadedbreast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from the waterworkstowards the Albert Road), and emerged upon the grass before the rising of thesun. Great mounds had been heaped about the crest of the hill, making a hugeredoubt of it--it was the final and largest place the Martians had made--andfrom behind these heaps there rose a thin smoke against the sky. Against the skyline an eager dog ran and disappeared. The thought that had flashed into my mindgrew real, grew credible. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation, asI ran up the hill towards the motionless monster. Out of the hood hung lankshreds of brown, at which the hungry birds pecked and tore.In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood upon itscrest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me. A mighty space it was, withgigantic machines here and there within it, huge mounds of material and strangeshelter places. And scattered about it, some in their overturned war-machines,some in the now rigid handling-machines, and a dozen of them stark and silentand laid in a row, were the Martians--dead!--slain by the putrefactive anddisease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as the redweed was being slain; slain, after all man's devices had failed, by the humblestthings that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have foreseen had notterror and disaster blinded our minds. These germs of disease have taken toll ofhumanity since the beginning of things--taken toll of our prehuman ancestorssince life began here. But by virtue of this natural selection of our kind wehave developed resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle,and to many--those that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance--ourliving frames are altogether immune. But there are no bacteria in Mars, anddirectly these invaders arrived, directly they drank and fed, our microscopicallies began to work their overthrow. Already when I watched them they wereirrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to and fro. It wasinevitable. By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of theearth, and it is his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martiansten times as mighty as they are. For neither do men live nor die in vain.Here and there they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in that great gulfthey had made, overtaken by a death that must have seemed to them asincomprehensible as any death could be. To me also at that time this death wasincomprehensible. All I knew was that these things that had been alive and soterrible to men were dead. For a moment I believed that the destruction ofSennacherib had been repeated, that God had repented, that the Angel of Deathhad slain them in the night.I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened gloriously, even as therising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays. The pit was still indarkness; the mighty engines, so great and wonderful in their power andcomplexity, so unearthly in their tortuous forms, rose weird and vague andstrange out of the shadows towards the light. A multitude of dogs, I could hear,fought over the bodies that lay darkly in the depth of the pit, far below me.Across the pit on its farther lip, flat and vast and strange, lay the greatflying-machine with which they had been experimenting upon our denser atmospherewhen decay and death arrested them. Death had come not a day too soon. At thesound of a cawing overhead I looked up at the huge fighting-machine that wouldfight no more for ever, at the tattered red shreds of flesh that dripped downupon the overturned seats on the summit of Primrose Hill.I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where, enhaloed now in birds,stood those other two Martians that I had seen overnight, just as death hadovertaken them. The one had died, even as it had been crying to its companions;perhaps it was the last to die, and its voice had gone on perpetually until theforce of its machinery was exhausted. They glittered now, harmless tripod towersof shining metal, in the brightness of the rising sun.All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from everlasting destruction,stretched the great Mother of Cities. Those who have only seen London veiled inher sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine the naked clearness and beauty ofthe silent wilderness of houses.Eastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and the splinteredspire of the church, the sun blazed dazzling in a clear sky, and here and theresome facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught the light and glared with awhite intensity.Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses; westward thegreat city was dimmed; and southward, beyond the Martians, the green waves ofRegent's Park, the Langham Hotel, the dome of the Albert Hall, the ImperialInstitute, and the giant mansions of the Brompton Road came out clear and littlein the sunrise, the jagged ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond. Far awayand blue were the Surrey hills, and the towers of the Crystal Palace glitteredlike two silver rods. The dome of St. Paul's was dark against the sunrise, andinjured, I saw for the first time, by a huge gaping cavity on its western side.And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and churches,silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous hopes and efforts, theinnumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this human reef, and of theswift and ruthless destruction that had hung over it all; when I realised thatthe shadow had been rolled back, and that men might still live in the streets,and this dear vast dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt awave of emotion that was near akin to tears.The torment was over. Even that day the healing would begin. The survivors ofthe people scattered over the country--leaderless, lawless, foodless, like sheepwithout a shepherd--the thousands who had fled by sea, would begin to return;the pulse of life, growing stronger and stronger, would beat again in the emptystreets and pour across the vacant squares. Whatever destruction was done, thehand of the destroyer was stayed. All the gaunt wrecks, the blackened skeletonsof houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the hill, wouldpresently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and ringing with thetapping of their trowels. At the thought I extended my hands towards the sky andbegan thanking God. In a year, thought I--in a year. . .With overwhelming force came the thought of myself, of my wife, and the old lifeof hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IX - WRECKAGEAnd now comes the strangest thing in my story. Yet, perhaps, it is notaltogether strange. I remember, clearly and coldly and vividly, all that I didthat day until the time that I stood weeping and praising God upon the summit ofPrimrose Hill. And then I forget.Of the next three days I know nothing. I have learned since that, so far from mybeing the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow, several such wanderers asmyself had already discovered this on the previous night. One man--thefirst--had gone to St. Martin's-le-Grand, and, while I sheltered in the cabmen'shut, had contrived to telegraph to Paris. Thence the joyful news had flashed allover the world; a thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenlyflashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin, Edinburgh,Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the verge of the pit.Already men, weeping with joy, as I have heard, shouting and staying their workto shake hands and shout, were making up trains, even as near as Crewe, todescend upon London. The church bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenlycaught the news, until all England was bell-ringing. Men on cycles, lean-faced,unkempt, scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance,shouting to gaunt, staring figures of despair. And for the food! Across theChannel, across the Irish Sea, across the Atlantic, corn, bread, and meat weretearing to our relief. All the shipping in the world seemed going Londonward inthose days. But of all this I have no memory. I drifted--a demented man. I foundmyself in a house of kindly people, who had found me on the third day wandering,weeping, and raving through the streets of St. John's Wood. They have told mesince that I was singing some insane doggerel about \"The Last Man Left Alive!Hurrah! The Last Man Left Alive!\" Troubled as they were with their own affairs,these people, whose name, much as I would like to express my gratitude to them,I may not even give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves with me, shelteredme, and protected me from myself. Apparently they had learned something of mystory from me during the days of my lapse.Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me what they hadlearned of the fate of Leatherhead. Two days after I was imprisoned it had beendestroyed, with every soul in it, by a Martian. He had swept it out ofexistence, as it seemed, without any provocation, as a boy might crush an anthill, in the mere wantonness of power.I was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me. I was a lonely man and a sadone, and they bore with me. I remained with them four days after my recovery.All that time I felt a vague, a growing craving to look once more on whateverremained of the little life that seemed so happy and bright in my past. It was amere hopeless desire to feast upon my misery. They dissuaded me. They did allthey could to divert me from this morbidity. But at last I could resist theimpulse no longer, and, promising faithfully to return to them, and parting, asI will confess, from these four-day friends with tears, I went out again intothe streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty.Already they were busy with returning people; in places even there were shopsopen, and I saw a drinking fountain running water.I remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on my melancholypilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy the streets and vivid themoving life about me. So many people were abroad everywhere, busied in athousand activities, that it seemed incredible that any great proportion of thepopulation could have been slain. But then I noticed how yellow were the skinsof the people I met, how shaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright theireyes, and that every other man still wore his dirty rags. Their faces seemed allwith one of two expressions--a leaping exultation and energy or a grimresolution. Save for the expression of the faces, London seemed a city oftramps. The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sent us by theFrench government. The ribs of the few horses showed dismally. Haggard specialconstables with white badges stood at the corners of every street. I saw littleof the mischief wrought by the Martians until I reached Wellington Street, andthere I saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses of Waterloo Bridge.At the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts of thatgrotesque time--a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of the red weed,transfixed by a stick that kept it in place. It was the placard of the firstnewspaper to resume publication--the Daily Mail. I bought a copy for a blackenedshilling I found in my pocket. Most of it was in blank, but the solitarycompositor who did the thing had amused himself by making a grotesque scheme ofadvertisement stereo on the back page. The matter he printed was emotional; thenews organisation had not as yet found its way back. I learned nothing freshexcept that already in one week the examination of the Martian mechanisms hadyielded astonishing results. Among other things, the article assured me what Idid not believe at the time, that the \"Secret of Flying,\" was discovered. AtWaterloo I found the free trains that were taking people to their homes. Thefirst rush was already over. There were few people in the train, and I was in nomood for casual conversation. I got a compartment to myself, and sat with foldedarms, looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows. Andjust outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails, and on eitherside of the railway the houses were blackened ruins. To Clapham Junction theface of London was grimy with powder of the Black Smoke, in spite of two days ofthunderstorms and rain, and at Clapham Junction the line had been wrecked again;there were hundreds of out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side withthe customary navvies, and we were jolted over a hasty relaying.All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and unfamiliar;Wimbledon particularly had suffered. Walton, by virtue of its unburned pinewoods, seemed the least hurt of any place along the line. The Wandle, the Mole,every little stream, was a heaped mass of red weed, in appearance betweenbutcher's meat and pickled cabbage. The Surrey pine woods were too dry, however,for the festoons of the red climber. Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line,in certain nursery grounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the sixthcylinder. A number of people were standing about it, and some sappers were busyin the midst of it. Over it flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully in themorning breeze. The nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with the weed, awide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows, and very painful to theeye. One's gaze went with infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullenreds of the foreground to the blue-green softness of the eastward hills.The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing repair, so Idescended at Byfleet station and took the road to Maybury, past the place whereI and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars, and on by the spot where theMartian had appeared to me in the thunderstorm. Here, moved by curiosity, Iturned aside to find, among a tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dogcart with the whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed. For a time Istood regarding these vestiges. . . .Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here and there,to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found burial, and so camehome past the College Arms. A man standing at an open cottage door greeted me byname as I passed.I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately. The doorhad been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I approached.It slammed again. The curtains of my study fluttered out of the open window fromwhich I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn. No one had closed it since.The smashed bushes were just as I had left them nearly four weeks ago. Istumbled into the hall, and the house felt empty. The stair carpet was ruffledand discoloured where I had crouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstormthe night of the catastrophe. Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up thestairs.I followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-table still, with theselenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I had left on the afternoon ofthe opening of the cylinder. For a space I stood reading over my abandonedarguments. It was a paper on the probable development of Moral Ideas with thedevelopment of the civilising process; and the last sentence was the opening ofa prophecy: \"In about two hundred years,\" I had written, \"we may expect----\" Thesentence ended abruptly. I remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning,scarcely a month gone by, and how I had broken off to get my DailyChronicle from the newsboy. I remembered how I went down to the garden gate ashe came along, and how I had listened to his odd story of \"Men from Mars.\"I came down and went into the dining room. There were the mutton and the bread,both far gone now in decay, and a beer bottle overturned, just as I and theartilleryman had left them. My home was desolate. I perceived the folly of thefaint hope I had cherished so long. And then a strange thing occurred. \"It is nouse,\" said a voice. \"The house is deserted. No one has been here these ten days.Do not stay here to torment yourself. No one escaped but you.\"I was startled. Had I spoken my thought aloud? I turned, and the French windowwas open behind me. I made a step to it, and stood looking out.And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid, were my cousinand my wife--my wife white and tearless. She gave a faint cry. \"I came,\" she said. \"I knew--knew----\" She put her hand to her throat--swayed. I made a step forward, and caught her inmy arms."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER X - THE EPILOGUEI cannot but regret, now that I am concluding my story, how little I am able tocontribute to the discussion of the many debatable questions which are stillunsettled. In one respect I shall certainly provoke criticism. My particularprovince is speculative philosophy. My knowledge of comparative physiology isconfined to a book or two, but it seems to me that Carver's suggestions as tothe reason of the rapid death of the Martians is so probable as to be regardedalmost as a proven conclusion. I have assumed that in the body of my narrative.At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined after the war,no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species were found. Thatthey did not bury any of their dead, and the reckless slaughter theyperpetrated, point also to an entire ignorance of the putrefactive process. Butprobable as this seems, it is by no means a proven conclusion.Neither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which the Martians usedwith such deadly effect, and the generator of the Heat-Rays remains a puzzle.The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South Kensington laboratories havedisinclined analysts for further investigations upon the latter. Spectrumanalysis of the black powder points unmistakably to the presence of an unknownelement with a brilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possiblethat it combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadlyeffect upon some constituent in the blood. But such unproven speculations willscarcely be of interest to the general reader, to whom this story is addressed.None of the brown scum that drifted down the Thames after the destruction ofShepperton was examined at the time, and now none is forthcoming.The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far as the prowlingdogs had left such an examination possible, I have already given. But everyoneis familiar with the magnificent and almost complete specimen in spirits at theNatural History Museum, and the countless drawings that have been made from it;and beyond that the interest of their physiology and structure is purelyscientific.A question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of another attackfrom the Martians. I do not think that nearly enough attention is being given tothis aspect of the matter. At present the planet Mars is in conjunction, butwith every return to opposition I, for one, anticipate a renewal of theiradventure. In any case, we should be prepared. It seems to me that it should bepossible to define the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged,to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate thearrival of the next attack.In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery beforeit was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge, or they might be butcheredby means of guns so soon as the screw opened. It seems to me that they have losta vast advantage in the failure of their first surprise. Possibly they see it inthe same light.Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martians haveactually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus. Seven months agonow, Venus and Mars were in alignment with the sun; that is to say, Mars was inopposition from the point of view of an observer on Venus. Subsequently apeculiar luminous and sinuous marking appeared on the unillumined half of theinner planet, and almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuouscharacter was detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk. One needs to seethe drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their remarkableresemblance in character.At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views of the humanfuture must be greatly modified by these events. We have learned now that wecannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a secure abiding place for Man;we can never anticipate the unseen good or evil that may come upon us suddenlyout of space. It may be that in the larger design of the universe this invasionfrom Mars is not without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of thatserene confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of decadence,the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and it has done much topromote the conception of the commonweal of mankind. It may be that across theimmensity of space the Martians have watched the fate of these pioneers oftheirs and learned their lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found asecurer settlement. Be that as it may, for many years yet there will certainlybe no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fierydarts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with them as they fall anunavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.The broadening of men's views that has resulted can scarcely be exaggerated.Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion that through all thedeep of space no life existed beyond the petty surface of our minute sphere. Nowwe see further. If the Martians can reach Venus, there is no reason to supposethat the thing is impossible for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makesthis earth uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread oflife that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planetwithin its toils.Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life spreadingslowly from this little seed bed of the solar system throughout the inanimatevastness of sidereal space. But that is a remote dream. It may be, on the otherhand, that the destruction of the Martians is only a reprieve. To them, and notto us, perhaps, is the future ordained.I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense ofdoubt and insecurity in my mind. I sit in my study writing by lamplight, andsuddenly I see again the healing valley below set with writhing flames, and feelthe house behind and about me empty and desolate. I go out into the ByfleetRoad, and vehicles pass me, a butcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, aworkman on a bicycle, children going to school, and suddenly they become vagueand unreal, and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot, broodingsilence. Of a night I see the black powder darkening the silent streets, and thecontorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise upon me tattered anddog-bitten. They gibber and grow fiercer, paler, uglier, mad distortions ofhumanity at last, and I wake, cold and wretched, in the darkness of the night.I go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the Strand, andit comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the past, haunting thestreets that I have seen silent and wretched, going to and fro, phantasms in adead city, the mockery of life in a galvanised body. And strange, too, it is tostand on Primrose Hill, as I did but a day before writing this last chapter, tosee the great province of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke andmist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people walking toand fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the sight-seers about theMartian machine that stands there still, to hear the tumult of playing children,and to recall the time when I saw it all bright and clear-cut, hard and silent,under the dawn of that last great day. . . .And strangest of all is it to hold my wife's hand again, and to think that Ihave counted her, and that she has counted me, among the dead."}]
