The Political and Social Reconstruction of the World[H%20G%20Wells%20-%20A%20Short%20History%20of%20the%20World_split_002.htm#1_0_68]I. THE WORLD IN SPACETHE STORY of our world is a story that is still very imperfectly known. A coupleof hundred years ago men possessed the history of little more than the lastthree thousand years. What happened before that time was a matter of legend andspeculation. Over a large part of the civilized world it was believed and taughtthat the world had been created suddenly in 4004 B.C., though authoritiesdiffered as to whether this had occurred in the spring or autumn of that year.This fantastically precise misconception was based upon a too literalinterpretation of the Hebrew Bible, and upon rather arbitrary theologicalassumptions connected therewith. Such ideas have long since been abandoned byreligious teachers, and it is universally recognized that the universe in whichwe live has to all appearances existed for an enormous period of time andpossibly for endless time. Of course there may be deception in theseappearances, as a room may be made to seem endless by putting mirrors facingeach other at either end. But that the universe in which we live has existedonly for six or seven thousand years may be regarded as an altogether explodedidea.The earth, as everybody knows nowadays, is a spheroid, a sphere slightlycompressed, orange fashion, with a diameter of nearly 8,000 miles. Its sphericalshape has been known at least to a limited number of intelligent people fornearly 2,500 years, but before that time it was supposed to be flat, and variousideas which now seem fantastic were entertained about its relations to the skyand the stars and planets. We know now that it rotates upon its axis (which isabout 24 miles shorter than its equatorial diameter) every twenty-four hours,and that this is the cause of the alternations of day and night, that it circlesabout the sun in a slightly distorted and slowly variable oval path in a year.Its distance from the sun varies between ninety-one and a half millions at itsnearest and ninety-four and a half million miles.About the earth circles a smaller sphere, the moon, at an average distance of239,000 miles. Earth and moon are not the only bodies to travel round the sun.There are also the planets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of thirty-six andsixty-seven millions of miles; and beyond the circle of the earth anddisregarding a belt of numerous smaller bodies, the planetoids, there are Mars,Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune at mean distances of 141, 483, 886, 1,782,and 1,793 millions of miles respectively. These figures in millions of miles arevery difficult for the mind to grasp. It may help the reader's imagination if wereduce the sun and planets to a smaller, more conceivable scale.If, then, we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch diameter, the sunwould be a big globe nine feet across and 323 yards away, that is about a fifthof a mile, four or five minutes' walking. The moon would be a small pea two feetand a half from the world. Between earth and sun there would be the two innerplanets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of one hundred and twenty-five and twohundred and fifty yards from the sun. All round and about these bodies therewould be emptiness until you came to Mars, a hundred and seventy-five feetbeyond the earth; Jupiter nearly a mile away, a foot in diameter; Saturn, alittle smaller, two miles off; Uranus four miles off and Neptune six miles off.Then nothingness and nothingness except for small particles and drifting scrapsof attenuated vapour for thousands of miles. The nearest star to earth on thisscale would be 40,000 miles away.These figures will serve perhaps to give one some conception of the immenseemptiness of space in which the drama of life goes on.For in all this enormous vacancy of space we know certainly of life only uponthe surface of our earth. It does not penetrate much more than three miles downinto the 4,000 miles that separate us from the centre of our globe, and it doesnot reach more than five miles above its surface. Apparently all thelimitlessness of space is otherwise empty and dead.The deepest ocean dredgings go down to five miles. The highest recorded flightof an aeroplane is little more than four miles. Men have reached to seven milesup in balloons, but at a cost of great suffering. No bird can fly so high asfive miles, and small birds and insects which have been carried up by aeroplanesdrop off insensible far below that level.II. THE WORLD IN TIMEIN the last fifty years there has been much very fine and interestingspeculation on the part of scientific men upon the age and origin of our earth.Here we cannot pretend to give even a summary of such speculations because theyinvolve the most subtle mathematical and physical considerations. The truth isthat the physical and astronomical sciences are still too undeveloped as yet tomake anything of the sort more than an illustrative guesswork. The generaltendency has been to make the estimated age of our globe longer and longer. Itnow seems probable that the earth has had an independent existence as a spinningplanet flying round and round the sun for a longer period than 2,000,000,000years. It may have been much longer than that. This is a length of time thatabsolutely overpowers the imagination.Before that vast period of separate existence, the sun and earth and the otherplanets that circulate round the sun may have been a great swirl of diffusedmatter in space. The telescope reveals to us in various parts of the heavensluminous spiral clouds of matter, the spiral nebulae, which appear to be inrotation about a centre. It is supposed by many astronomers that the sun and itsplanets were once such a spiral, and that their matter has undergoneconcentration into its present form. Through majestic aeons that concentrationwent on until in that vast remoteness of the past for which we have givenfigures, the world and its moon were distinguishable. They were spinning thenmuch faster than they are spinning now; they were at a lesser distance from thesun; they travelled round it very much faster, and they were probablyincandescent or molten at the surface. The sun itself was a much greater blazein the heavens.If we could go back through that infinitude of time and see the earth in thisearlier stage of its history, we should behold a scene more like the interior ofa blast furnace or the surface of a lava flow before it cools and cakes overthan any other contemporary scene. No water would be visible because all thewater there was would still be superheated steam in a stormy atmosphere ofsulphurous and metallic vapours. Beneath this would swirl and boil an ocean ofmolten rock substance. Across a sky of fiery clouds the glare of the hurryingsun and moon would sweep swiftly like hot breaths of flame.Slowly by degrees as one million of years followed another, this fiery scenewould lose its eruptive incandescence. The vapours in the sky would rain downand become less dense overhead; great slaggy cakes of solidifying rock wouldappear upon the surface of the molten sea, and sink under it, to be replaced byother floating masses. The sun and moon growing now each more distant and eachsmaller, would rush with diminishing swiftness across the heavens. The moon now,because of its smaller size, would be already cooled far below incandescence,and would be alternately obstructing and reflecting the sunlight in a series ofeclipses and full moons.And so with a tremendous slowness through the vastness of time, the earth wouldgrow more and more like the earth on which we live, until at last an age wouldcome when, in the cooling air, steam would begin to condense into clouds, andthe first rain would fall hissing upon the first rocks below. For endlessmillenia the greater part of the earth's water would still be vaporized in theatmosphere, but there would now be hot streams running over the crystallizingrocks below and pools and lakes into which these streams would be carryingdetritus and depositing sediment.At last a condition of things must have been attained in which a man might havestood up on earth and looked about him and lived. If we could have visited theearth at that time we should have stood on great lava-like masses of rockwithout a trace of soil or touch of living vegetation, under a storm-rent sky.Hot and violent winds, exceeding the fiercest tornado that ever blows, anddownpours of rain such as our milder, slower earth to-day knows nothing of,might have assailed us. The water of the downpour would have rushed by us, muddywith the spoils of the rocks, coming together into torrents, cutting deep gorgesand canyons as they hurried past to deposit their sediment in the earliest seas.Through the clouds we should have glimpsed a great sun moving visibly across thesky, and in its wake and in the wake of the moon would have come a diurnal tideof earthquake and upheaval. And the moon, which nowadays keeps one constant faceto earth, would then have been rotating visibly and showing the side it nowhides so inexorably.The earth aged. One million years followed another, and the day lengthened, thesun grew more distant and milder, the moon's pace in the sky slackened; theintensity of rain and storm diminished and the water in the first seas increasedand ran together into the ocean garment our planet henceforth wore.But there was no life as yet upon the earth; the seas were lifeless, and therocks were barren.III. THE BEGINNINGS OF LIFEAS everybody knows nowadays, the knowledge we possess of life before thebeginnings of human memory and tradition is derived from the markings andfossils of living things in the stratified rocks. We find preserved in shale andslate, limestone, and sandstone, bones, shells, fibres, stems, fruits,footmarks, scratchings and the like, side by side with the ripple marks of theearliest tides and the pittings of the earliest rain-falls. It is by thesedulous examination of this Record of the Rocks that the past history of theearth's life has been pieced together. That much nearly everybody knows to-day.The sedimentary rocks do not lie neatly stratum above stratum; they have beencrumpled, bent, thrust about, distorted and mixed together like the leaves of alibrary that has been repeatedly looted and burnt, and it is only as a result ofmany devoted lifetimes of work that the record has been put into order and read.The whole compass of time represented by the record of the rocks is nowestimated as 1,600,000,000 years.The earliest rocks in the record are called by geologists the Azoic rocks,because they show no traces of life. Great areas of these Azoic rocks lieuncovered in North America, and they are of such a thickness that geologistsconsider that they represent a period of at least half of the 1,600,000,000which they assign to the whole geological record. Let me repeat this profoundlysignificant fact. Half the great interval of time since land and sea were firstdistinguishable on earth has left us no traces of life. There are ripplings andrain marks still to be found in these rocks, but no marks nor vestiges of anyliving thing.Then, as we come up the record, signs of past life appear and increase. The ageof the world's history in which we find these past traces is called bygeologists the Lower Palaeozoic age. The first indications that life was astirare vestiges of comparatively simple and lowly things: the shells of smallshellfish, the stems and flowerlike heads of zoophytes, seaweeds and the tracksand remains of sea worms and crustacea. Very early appear certain creaturesrather like plant-lice, crawling creatures which could roll themselves up intoballs as the plant-lice do, the trilobites. Later by a few million years or socome certain sea scorpions, more mobile and powerful creatures than the worldhad ever seen before.None of these creatures were of very great size. Among the largest were certainof the sea scorpions, which measured nine feet in length. There are no signswhatever of land life of any sort, plant or animal; there are no fishes nor anyvertebrated creatures in this part of the record. Essentially all the plants andcreatures which have left us their traces from this period of the earth'shistory are shallow-water and intertidal beings. If we wished to parallel theflora and fauna of the Lower Palaeozoic rocks on the earth to-day, we should doit best, except in the matter of size, by taking a drop of water from a rockpool or scummy ditch and examining it under a microscope. The little crustacea,the small shellfish, the zoophytes and algae we should find there would displaya quite striking resemblance to these clumsier, larger prototypes that once werethe crown of life upon our planet.It is well, however, to bear in mind that the Lower Palaeozoic rocks probably donot give us anything at all representative of the first beginnings of life onour planet. Unless a creature has bones or other hard parts, unless it wears ashell or is big enough and heavy enough to make characteristic footprints andtrails in mud, it is unlikely to leave any fossilized traces of its existencebehind. To-day there are hundreds of thousands of species of small softbodiedcreatures in our world which it is inconceivable can ever leave any mark forfuture geologists to discover. In the world's past, millions of millions ofspecies of such creatures may have lived and multiplied and flourished andpassed away without a trace remaining. The waters of the warm and shallow lakesand seas of the so-called Azoic period may have teemed with an infinite varietyof lowly, jelly-like, shell-less and boneless creatures, and a multitude ofgreen scummy plants may have spread over the sunlit intertidal rocks andbeaches. The Record of the Rocks is no more a complete record of life in thepast than the books of a bank are a record of the existence of everybody in theneighbourhood. It is only when a species begins to secrete a shell or a spiculeor a carapace or a lime-supported stem, and so put by something for the future,that it goes upon the Record. But in rocks of an age prior to those which bearany fossil traces, graphite, a form of uncombined carbon, is sometimes found,and some authorities consider that it may have been separated out fromcombination through the vital activities of unknown living things.IV. THE AGE OF FISHESIN the days when the world was supposed to have endured for only a few thousandyears, it was supposed that the different species of plants and animals werefixed and final; they had all been created exactly as they are to-day, eachspecies by itself. But as men began to discover and study the Record of theRocks this belief gave place to the suspicion that many species had changed anddeveloped slowly through the course of ages, and this again expanded into abelief in what is called Organic Evolution, a belief that all species of lifeupon earth, animal and vegetable alike, are descended by slow continuousprocesses of change from some very simple ancestral form of life, some almoststructureless living substance, far back in the so-called Azoic seas.This question of Organic Evolution, like the question of the age of the earth,has in the past been the subject of much bitter controversy. There was a timewhen a belief in organic evolution was for rather obscure reasons supposed to beincompatible with sound Christian, Jewish and Moslem doctrine. That time haspassed, and the men of the most orthodox Catholic, Protestant, Jewish andMohammedan belief are now free to accept this newer and broader view of a commonorigin of all living things. No life seems to have happened suddenly upon earth.Life grew and grows. Age by age through gulfs of time at which imaginationreels, life has been growing from a mere stirring in the intertidal slimetowards freedom, power and consciousness.Life consists of individuals. These individuals are definite things, they arenot like the lumps and masses, nor even the limitless and motionless crystals,of non-living matter, and they have two characteristics no dead matterpossesses. They can assimilate other matter into themselves and make it part ofthemselves, and they can reproduce themselves. They eat and they breed. They cangive rise to other individuals, for the most part like themselves, but alwaysalso a little different from themselves. There is a specific and familyresemblance between an individual and its offspring, and there is an individualdifference between every parent and every offspring it produces, and this istrue in every species and at every stage of life.Now scientific men are not able to explain to us either why offspring shouldresemble nor why they should differ from their parents. But seeing thatoffspring do at once resemble and differ, it is a matter rather of common sensethan of scientific knowledge that, if the conditions under which a species liveare changed, the species should undergo some correlated changes. Because in anygeneration of the species there must be a number of individuals whose individualdifferences make them better adapted to the new conditions under which thespecies has to live, and a number whose individual differences make it ratherharder for them to live. And on the whole the former sort will live longer, bearmore offspring, and reproduce themselves more abundantly than the latter, and sogeneration by generation the average of the species will change in thefavourable direction. This process, which is called Natural Selection, is not somuch a scientific theory as a necessary deduction from the facts of reproductionand individual difference. There may be many forces at work varying, destroyingand preserving species, about which science may still be unaware or undecided,but the man who can deny the operation of this process of natural selection uponlife since its beginning must be either ignorant of the elementary facts of lifeor incapable of ordinary thought.Many scientific men have speculated about the first beginning of life and theirspeculations are often of great interest, but there is absolutely no definiteknowledge and no convincing guess yet of the way in which life began. But nearlyall authorities are agreed that it probably began upon mud or sand in warmsunlit shallow brackish water, and that it spread up the beaches to theintertidal lines and out to the open waters.That early world was a world of strong tides and currents. An incessantdestruction of individuals must have been going on through their being swept upthe beaches and dried, or by their being swept out to sea and sinking down outof reach of air and sun. Early conditions favoured the development of everytendency to root and hold on, every tendency to form an outer skin and casing toprotect the stranded individual from immediate desiccation. From the veryearliest any tendency to sensitiveness to taste would turn the individual in thedirection of food, and any sensitiveness to light would assist it to struggleback out of the darkness of the sea deeps and caverns or to wriggle back out ofthe excessive glare of the dangerous shallows.Probably the first shells and body armour of living things were protectionsagainst drying rather than against active enemies. But tooth and claw come earlyinto our earthly history.We have already noted the size of the earlier water scorpions. For long agessuch creatures were the supreme lords of life. Then in a division of thesePalaeozoic rocks called the Silurian division, which many geologists now supposeto be as old as five hundred million years, there appears a new type of being,equipped with eyes and teeth and swimming powers of an altogether more powerfulkind. These were the first known backboned animals, the earliest fishes, thefirst known Vertebrata.These fishes increase greatly in the next division of rocks, the rocks known asthe Devonian system. They are so prevalent that this period of the Record of theRocks has been called the Age of Fishes. Fishes of a pattern now gone from theearth, and fishes allied to the sharks and sturgeons of to-day, rushed throughthe waters, leapt in the air, browsed among the seaweeds, pursued and preyedupon one another, and gave a new liveliness to the waters of the world. None ofthese were excessively big by our present standards. Few of them were more thantwo or three feet long, but there were exceptional forms which were as long astwenty feet.We know nothing from geology of the ancestors of these fishes. They do notappear to be related to any of the forms that preceded them. Zoologists have themost interesting views of their ancestry, but these they derive from the studyof the development of the eggs of their still living relations, and from othersources. Apparently the ancestors of the vertebrata were soft-bodied and perhapsquite small swimming creatures who began first to develop hard parts as teethround and about their mouths. The teeth of a skate or dog-fish cover the roofand floor of its mouth and pass at the lip into the flattened toothlike scalesthat encase most of its body. As the fishes develop these teeth scales in thegeological record, they swim out of the hidden darkness of the past into thelight, the first vertebrated animals visible in the record.V. THE AGE OF THE COAL SWAMPSTHE LAND during this Age of Fishes was apparently quite lifeless. Crags anduplands of barren rock lay under the sun and rain. There was no real soil-for asyet there were no earthworms which help to make a soil, and no plants to breakup the rock particles into mould; there was no trace of moss or lichen. Life wasstill only in the sea.Over this world of barren rock played great changes of climate. The causes ofthese changes of climate were very complex and they have still to be properlyestimated. The changing shape of the earth's orbit, the gradual shifting of thepoles of rotation, changes in the shapes of the continents, probably evenfluctuations in the warmth of the sun, now conspired to plunge great areas ofthe earth's surface into long periods of cold and ice and now again for millionsof years spread a warm or equable climate over this planet. There seem to havebeen phases of great internal activity in the world's history, when in thecourse of a few million years accumulated upthrusts would break out in lines ofvolcanic eruption and upheaval and rearrange the mountain and continentaloutlines of the globe, increasing the depth of the sea and the height of themountains and exaggerating the extremes of climate. And these would be followedby vast ages of comparative quiescence, when frost, rain and river would weardown the mountain heights and carry great masses of silt to fill and raise thesea bottoms and spread the seas, ever shallower and wider, over more and more ofthe land. There have been \"high and deep\" ages in the world's history and \"lowand level\" ages. The reader must dismiss from his mind any idea that the surfaceof the earth has been growing steadily cooler since its crust grew solid. Afterthat much cooling had been achieved, the internal temperature ceased to affectsurface conditions. There are traces of periods of superabundant ice and snow,of \"Glacial Ages,\" that is, even in the Azoic period.It was only towards the close of the Age of Fishes, in a period of extensiveshallow seas and lagoons, that life spread itself out in any effectual way fromthe waters on to the land. No doubt the earlier types of the forms that nowbegin to appear in great abundance had already been developing in a rare andobscure manner for many scores of millions of years. But now came theiropportunity.Plants no doubt preceded animal forms in this invasion of the land, but theanimals probably followed up the plant emigration very closely. The firstproblem that the plant had to solve was the problem of some sustaining stiffsupport to hold up its fronds to the sunlight when the buoyant water waswithdrawn; the second was the problem of getting water from the swampy groundbelow to the tissues of the plant, now that it was no longer close at hand. Thetwo problems were solved by the development of woody tissue which both sustainedthe plant and acted as water carrier to the leaves. The Record of the Rocks issuddenly crowded by a vast variety of woody swamp plants, many of them of greatsize, big tree mosses, tree ferns, gigantic horsetails and the like. And withthese, age by age, there crawled out of the water a great variety of animalforms. There were centipedes and millipedes; there were the first primitiveinsects; there were creatures related to the ancient king crabs and seascorpions which became the earliest spiders and land scorpions, and presentlythere were vertebrated animals.Some of the earlier insects were very large. There were dragon flies in thisperiod with wings that spread out to twenty-nine inches.In various ways these new orders and genera had adapted themselves to breathingair. Hitherto all animals had breathed air dissolved in water, and that indeedis what all animals still have to do. But now in divers fashions the animalkingdom was acquiring the power of supplying its own moisture where it wasneeded. A man with a perfectly dry lung would suffocate to-day; his lungsurfaces must be moist in order that air may pass through them into his blood.The adaptation to air breathing consists in all cases either in the developmentof a cover to the old-fashioned gills to stop evaporation, or in the developmentof tubes or other new breathing organs lying deep inside the body and moistenedby a watery secretion. The old gills with which the ancestral fish of thevertebrated line had breathed were inadaptable to breathing upon land, and inthe case of this division of the animal kingdom it is the swimming bladder ofthe fish which becomes a new, deep-seated breathing organ, the lung. The kind ofanimals known as amphibia, the frogs and newts of to-day, begin their lives inthe water and breathe by gills; and subsequently the lung, developing in thesame way as the swimming bladder of many fishes do, as a baglike outgrowth fromthe throat, takes over the business of breathing, the animal comes out on land,and the gills dwindle and the gill slits disappear. (All except an outgrowth ofone gill slit, which becomes the passage of the ear and ear-drum.) The animalcan now live only in the air, but it must return at least to the edge of thewater to lay its eggs and reproduce its kind.All the air-breathing vertebrata of this age of swamps and plants belonged tothe class amphibia. They were nearly all of them forms related to the newts ofto-day, and some of them attained a considerable size. They were land animals,it is true, but they were land animals needing to live in and near moist andswampy places, and all the great trees of this period were equally amphibious intheir habits. None of them had yet developed fruits and seeds of a kind thatcould fall on land and develop with the help only of such moisture as dew andrain could bring. They all had to shed their spores in water, it would seem, ifthey were to germinate.It is one of the most beautiful interests of that beautiful science, comparativeanatomy, to trace the complex and wonderful adaptations of living things to thenecessities of existence in air. All living things, plants and animals alike,are primarily water things. For example all the higher vertebrated animals abovethe fishes, up to and including man, pass through a stage in their developmentin the egg or before birth in which they have gill slits which are obliteratedbefore the young emerge. The bare, water-washed eye of the fish is protected inthe higher forms from drying up by eyelids and glands which secrete moisture.The weaker sound vibrations of air necessitate an ear-drum. In nearly everyorgan of the body similar modifications and adaptations are to be detected,similar patchings-up to meet aerial conditions.This Carboniferous age, this age of the amphibia, was an age of life in theswamps and lagoons and on the low banks among these waters. Thus far life hadnow extended. The hills and high lands were still quite barren and lifeless.Life had learnt to breathe air indeed, but it still had its roots in its nativewater; it still had to return to the water to reproduce its kind.VI. THE AGE OF REPTILESTHE ABUNDANT life of the Carboniferous period was succeeded by a vast cycle ofdry and bitter ages. They are represented in the Record of the Rocks by thickdeposits of sandstones and the like, in which fossils are comparatively few. Thetemperature of the world fluctuated widely, and there were long periods ofglacial cold. Over great areas the former profusion of swamp vegetation ceased,and, overlaid by these newer deposits, it began that process of compression andmineralization that gave the world most of the coal deposits of to-day.But it is during periods of change that life undergoes its most rapidmodifications, and under hardship that it learns its hardest lessons. Asconditions revert towards warmth and moisture again we find a new series ofanimal and plant forms established. We find in the record the remains ofvertebrated animals that laid eggs which, instead of hatching out tadpoles whichneeded to live for a time in water, carried on their development before hatchingto a stage so nearly like the adult form that the young could live in air fromthe first moment of independent existence. Gills had been cut out altogether,and the gill slits only appeared as an embryonic phase.These new creatures without a tadpole stage were the Reptiles. Concurrentlythere had been a development of seed-bearing trees, which could spread theirseed, independently of swamp or lakes. There were now palmlike cycads and manytropical conifers, though as yet there were no flowering plants and no grasses.There was a great number of ferns. And there was now also an increased varietyof insects. There were beetles, though bees and butterflies had yet to come. Butall the fundamental forms of a new real land fauna and flora had been laid downduring these vast ages of severity. This new land life needed only theopportunity of favourable conditions to flourish and prevail.Age by age and with abundant fluctuations that mitigation came. The stillincalculable movements of the earth's crust, the changes in its orbit, theincrease and diminution of the mutual inclination of orbit and pole, workedtogether to produce a great spell of widely diffused warm conditions. The periodlasted altogether, it is now supposed, upwards of two hundred million years. Itis called the Mesozoic period, to distinguish it from the altogether vasterPalaeozoic and Azoic periods (together fourteen hundred millions) that precededit, and from the Cainozoic or new life period that intervened between its closeand the present time, and it is also called the Age of Reptiles because of theastonishing predominance and variety of this form of life. It came to an endsome eighty million years ago.In the world to-day the genera of Reptiles are comparatively few and theirdistribution is very limited. They are more various, it is true, than are thefew surviving members of the order of the amphibia which once in theCarboniferous period ruled the world. We still have the snakes, the turtles andtortoises (the Chelonia), the alligators and crocodiles, and the lizards.Without exception they are creatures requiring warmth all the year round; theycannot stand exposure to cold, and it is probable that all the reptilian beingsof the Mesozoic suffered under the same limitation. It was a hothouse fauna,living amidst a hothouse flora. It endured no frosts. But the world had at leastattained a real dry land fauna and flora as distinguished from the mud and swampfauna and flora of the previous heyday of life upon earth.All the sorts of reptile we know now were much more abundantly represented then,great turtles and tortoises, big crocodiles and many lizards and snakes, but inaddition there was a number of series of wonderful creatures that have nowvanished altogether from the earth. There was a vast variety of beings calledthe Dinosaurs. Vegetation was now spreading over the lower levels of the world,reeds, brakes of fern and the like; and browsing upon this abundance came amultitude of herbivorous reptiles, which increased in size as the Mesozoicperiod rose to its climax. Some of these beasts exceeded in size any other landanimals that have ever lived; they were as large as whales. The DiplodocusCarnegii for example measured eighty-four feet from snout to tail; theGigantosaurus was even greater; it measured a hundred feet. Living upon thesemonsters was a swarm of carnivorous Dinosaurs of a corresponding size. One ofthese, the Tyrannosaurus, is figured and described in many books as the lastword in reptilian frightfulness.While these great creatures pastured and pursued amidst the fronds andevergreens of the Mesozoic jungles, another now vanished tribe of reptiles, witha bat-like development of the fore limbs, pursued insects and one another, firstleapt and parachuted and presently flew amidst the fronds and branches of theforest trees. These were the Pterodactyls. These were the first flying creatureswith backbones; they mark a new achievement in the growing powers of vertebratedlife.Moreover some of the reptiles were returning to the sea waters. Three groups ofbig swimming beings had invaded the sea from which their ancestors had come: theMososaurs, the Plesiosaurs, and Ichthyosaurs. Some of these again approached theproportions of our present whales. The Ichthyosaurs seem to have been quiteseagoing creatures, but the Plesiosaurs were a type of animal that has nocognate form to-day. The body was stout and big with paddles, adapted either forswimming or crawling through marshes, or along the bottom of shallow waters. Thecomparatively small head was poised on a vast snake of neck, altogether outdoingthe neck of the swan. Either the Plesiosaur swam and searched for food under thewater and fed as the swan will do, or it lurked under water and snatched atpassing fish or beast.Such was the predominant land life throughout the Mesozoic age. It was by ourhuman standards an advance upon anything that had preceded it. It had producedland animals greater in size, range, power and activity, more \"vital\" as peoplesay, than anything the world had seen before. In the seas there had been no suchadvance but a great proliferation of new forms of life. An enormous variety ofsquid-like creatures with chambered shells, for the most part coiled, hadappeared in the shallow seas, the Ammonites. They had had predecessors in thePalaeozoic seas, but now was their age of glory. To-day they have left nosurvivors at all; their nearest relation is the pearly Nautilus, an inhabitantof tropical waters. And a new and more prolific type of fish with lighter, finerscales than the plate-like and tooth-like coverings that had hitherto prevailed,became and has since remained predominant in the seas and rivers.VII. THE FIRST BIRDS AND THE FIRST MAMMALSIN a few paragraphs a picture of the lush vegetation and swarming reptiles ofthat first great summer of life, the Mesozoic period, has been sketched. Butwhile the Dinosaurs lorded it over the hot selvas and marshy plains and thePterodactyls filled the forests with their flutterings and possibly with shrieksand croakings as they pursued the humming insect life of the still flowerlessshrubs and trees, some less conspicuous and less abundant forms upon the marginsof this abounding life were acquiring certain powers and learning certainlessons of endurance, that were to be of the utmost value to their race when atlast the smiling generosity of sun and earth began to fade.A group of tribes and genera of hopping reptiles, small creatures of thedinosaur type, seem to have been pushed by competition and the pursuit of theirenemies towards the alternatives of extinction or adaptation to colderconditions in the higher hills or by the sea. Among these distressed tribesthere was developed a new type of scale-scales that were elongated intoquill-like forms and that presently branched into the crude beginnings offeathers. These quill-like scales lay over one another and formed aheat-retaining covering more efficient than any reptilian covering that hadhitherto existed. So they permitted an invasion of colder regions that wereotherwise uninhabited. Perhaps simultaneously with these changes there arose inthese creatures a greater solicitude for their eggs. Most reptiles areapparently quite careless about their eggs, which are left for sun and season tohatch. But some of the varieties upon this new branch of the tree of life wereacquiring a habit of guarding their eggs and keeping them warm with the warmthof their bodies.With these adaptations to cold other internal modifications were going on thatmade these creatures, the primitive birds, warm-blooded and independent ofbasking. The very earliest birds seem to have been seabirds living upon fish,and their fore limbs were not wings but paddles rather after the penguin type.That peculiarly primitive bird, the New Zealand Ki-wi, has feathers of a verysimple sort, and neither flies nor appears to be descended from flyingancestors. In the development of the birds, feathers came before wings. But oncethe feather was developed the possibility of making a light spread of feathersled inevitably to the wing. We know of the fossil remains of one bird at leastwhich had reptilian teeth in its jaw and a long reptilian tail, but which alsohad a true bird's wing and which certainly flew and held its own among thepterodactyls of the Mesozoic time. Nevertheless birds were neither varied norabundant in Mesozoic times. If a man could go back to typical Mesozoic country,he might walk for days and never see or hear such a thing as a bird, though hewould see a great abundance of pterodactyls and insects among the fronds andreeds.And another thing he would probably never see, and that would be any sign of amammal. Probably the first mammals were in existence millions of years beforethe first thing one could call a bird, but they were altogether too small andobscure and remote for attention.The earliest mammals, like the earliest birds, were creatures driven bycompetition and pursuit into a life of hardship and adaptation to cold. Withthem also the scale became quill-like, and was developed into a heat-retainingcovering; and they too underwent modifications, similar in kind though differentin detail, to become warm-blooded and independent of basking. Instead offeathers they developed hairs, and instead of guarding and incubating their eggsthey kept them warm and safe by retaining them inside their bodies until theywere almost mature. Most of them became altogether vivaparous and brought theiryoung into the world alive. And even after their young were born they tended tomaintain a protective and nutritive association with them. Most but not allmammals to-day have mammae and suckle their young. Two mammals still live whichlay eggs and which have not proper mammae, though they nourish their young by anutritive secretion of the under skin; these are the duck-billed platypus andthe echidna. The echidna lays leathery eggs and then puts them into a pouchunder its belly, and so carries them about warm and safe until they hatch.But just as a visitor to the Mesozoic world might have searched for days andweeks before finding a bird, so, unless he knew exactly where to go and look, hemight have searched in vain for any traces of a mammal. Both birds and mammalswould have seemed very eccentric and secondary and unimportant creatures inMesozoic times.The Age of Reptiles lasted, it is now guessed, eighty million years. Had anyquasi-human intelligence been watching the world through that inconceivablelength of time, how safe and eternal the sunshine and abundance must haveseemed, how assured the wallowing prosperity of the dinosaurs and the flappingabundance of the flying lizards! And then the mysterious rhythms andaccumulating forces of the universe began to turn against that quasi-eternalstability. That run of luck for life was running out. Age by age, myriad ofyears after myriad of years, with halts no doubt and retrogressions, came achange towards hardship and extreme conditions, came great alterations of leveland great redistributions of mountain and sea. We find one thing in the Recordof the Rocks during the decadence of the long Mesozoic age of prosperity that isvery significant of steadily sustained changes of condition, and that is aviolent fluctuation of living forms and the appearance of new and strangespecies. Under the gathering threat of extinction the older orders and generaare displaying their utmost capacity for variation and adaptation. The Ammonitesfor example in these last pages of the Mesozoic chapter exhibit a multitude offantastic forms. Under settled conditions there is no encouragement fornovelties; they do not develop, they are suppressed; what is best adapted isalready there. Under novel conditions it is the ordinary type that suffers, andthe novelty that may have a better chance to survive and establish itself.There comes a break in the Record of the Rocks that may represent severalmillion years. There is a veil here still, over even the outline of the historyof life. When it lifts again, the Age of Reptiles is at an end; the Dinosaurs,the Plesiosaurs and Ichthyosaurs, the Pterodactyls, the innumerable genera andspecies of Ammonite have all gone absolutely. In all their stupendous varietythey have died out and left no descendants. The cold has killed them. All theirfinal variations were insufficient; they had never hit upon survival conditions.The world had passed through a phase of extreme conditions beyond their powersof endurance, a slow and complete massacre of Mesozoic life has occurred, and wefind now a new scene, a new and hardier flora, and a new and hardier fauna inpossession of the world.It is still a bleak and impoverished scene with which this new volume of thebook of life begins. The cycads and tropical conifers have given place verylargely to trees that shed their leaves to avoid destruction by the snows ofwinter and to flowering plants and shrubs, and where there was formerly aprofusion of reptiles, an increasing variety of birds and mammals is enteringinto their inheritance.VIII. THE AGE OF MAMMALSTHE OPENING of the next great period in the life of the earth, the Cainozoicperiod, was a period of upheaval and extreme volcanic activity. Now it was thatthe vast masses of the Alps and Himalayas and the mountain backbone of theRockies and Andes were thrust up, and that the rude outlines of our presentoceans and continents appeared. The map of the world begins to display a firstdim resemblance to the map of to-day. It is estimated now that between forty andeighty million years have elapsed from the beginnings of the Cainozoic period tothe present time.At the outset of the Cainozoic period the climate of the world was austere. Itgrew generally warmer until a fresh phase of great abundance was reached, afterwhich conditions grew hard again and the earth passed into a series of extremelycold cycles, the Glacial Ages, from which apparently it is now slowly emerging.But we do not know sufficient of the causes of climatic change at present toforecast the possible fluctuations of climatic conditions that lie before us. Wemay be moving towards increasing sunshine or lapsing towards another glacialage; volcanic activity and the upheaval of mountain masses may be increasing ordiminishing; we do not know; we lack sufficient science.With the opening of this period the grasses appear; for the first time there ispasture in the world; and with the full development of the once obscuremammalian type, appear a number of interesting grazing animals and ofcarnivorous types which prey upon these.At first these early mammals seem to differ only in a few characters from thegreat herbivorous and carnivorous reptiles that ages before had flourished andthen vanished from the earth. A careless observer might suppose that in thissecond long age of warmth and plenty that was now beginning, nature was merelyrepeating the first, with herbivorous and carnivorous mammals to parallel theherbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs, with birds replacing pterodactyls and soon. But this would be an altogether superficial comparison. The variety of theuniverse is infinite and incessant; it progresses eternally; history neverrepeats itself and no parallels are precisely true. The differences between thelife of the Cainozoic and Mesozoic periods are far profounder than theresemblances.The most fundamental of all these differences lies in the mental life of the twoperiods. It arises essentially out of the continuing contact of parent andoffspring which distinguishes mammalian and in a lesser degree bird life, fromthe life of the reptile. With very few exceptions the reptile abandons its eggto hatch alone. The young reptile has no knowledge whatever of its parent; itsmental life, such as it is, begins and ends with its own experiences. It maytolerate the existence of its fellows but it has no communication with them; itnever imitates, never learns from them, is incapable of concerted action withthem. Its life is that of an isolated individual. But with the suckling andcherishing of young which was distinctive of the new mammalian and avian strainsarose the possibility of learning by imitation, of communication, by warningcries and other concerted action, of mutual control and instruction. A teachabletype of life had come into the world.The earliest mammals of the Cainozoic period are but little superior in brainsize to the more active carnivorous dinosaurs, but as we read on through therecord towards modern times we find, in every tribe and race of the mammaliananimals, a steady universal increase in brain capacity. For instance we find ata comparatively early stage that rhinoceros-like beasts appear. There is acreature, the Titanotherium, which lived in the earliest division of thisperiod. It was probably very like a modern rhinoceros in its habits and needs.But its brain capacity was not one tenth that of its living successor.The earlier mammals probably parted from their offspring as soon as suckling wasover, but, once the capacity for mutual understanding has arisen, the advantagesof continuing the association are very great; and we presently find a number ofmammalian species displaying the beginnings of a true social life and keepingtogether in herds, packs and flocks, watching each other, imitating each other,taking warning from each other's acts and cries. This is something that theworld had not seen before among vertebrated animals. Reptiles and fish may nodoubt be found in swarms and shoals; they have been hatched in quantities andsimilar conditions have kept them together, but in the case of the social andgregarious mammals the association arises not simply from a community ofexternal forces, it is sustained by an inner impulse. They are not merely likeone another and so found in the same places at the same times; they like oneanother and so they keep together.This difference between the reptile world and the world of our human minds isone our sympathies seem unable to pass. We cannot conceive in ourselves theswift uncomplicated urgency of a reptile's instinctive motives, its appetites,fears and hates. We cannot understand them in their simplicity because all ourmotives are complicated; ours are balances and resultants and not simpleurgencies. But the mammals and birds have self-restraint and consideration forother individuals, a social appeal, a self-control that is, at its lower level,after our own fashion. We can in consequence establish relations with almost allsorts of them. When they suffer they utter cries and make movements that rouseour feelings. We can make understanding pets of them with a mutual recognition.They can be tamed to self-restraint towards us, domesticated and taught.That unusual growth of brain which is the central fact of Cainozoic times marksa new communication and interdependence of individuals. It foreshadows thedevelopment of human societies of which we shall soon be telling.As the Cainozoic period unrolled, the resemblance of its flora and fauna to theplants and animals that inhabit the world to-day increased. The big clumsyUintatheres and Titanotheres, the Entelodonts and Hyracodons, big clumsy bruteslike nothing living, disappeared. On the other hand a series of forms led up bysteady degrees from grotesque and clumsy predecessors to the giraffes, camels,horses, elephants, deer, dogs and lions and tigers of the existing world. Theevolution of the horse is particularly legible upon the geological record. Wehave a fairly complete series of forms from a small tapir-like ancestor in theearly Cainozoic. Another line of development that has now been pieced togetherwith some precision is that of the llamas and camels.IX. MONKEYS, APES AND SUB-MENNATURALISTS divide the class Mammalia into a number of orders. At the head ofthese is the order Primates, which includes the lemurs, the monkeys, apes andman. Their classification was based originally upon anatomical resemblances andtook no account of any mental qualities.Now the past history of the Primates is one very difficult to decipher in thegeological record. They are for the most part animals which live in forests likethe lemurs and monkeys or in bare rocky places like the baboons. They are rarelydrowned and covered up by sediment, nor are most of them very numerous species,and so they do not figure so largely among the fossils as the ancestors of thehorses, camels and so forth do. But we know that quite early in the Cainozoicperiod, that is to say some forty million years ago or so, primitive monkeys andlemuroid creatures had appeared, poorer in brain and not so specialized as theirlater successors.The great world summer of the middle Cainozoic period drew at last to an end. Itwas to follow those other two great summers in the history of life, the summerof the Coal Swamps and the vast summer of the Age of Reptiles. Once more theearth spun towards an ice age. The world chilled, grew milder for a time andchilled again. In the warm past hippopotami had wallowed through a lushsub-tropical vegetation, and a tremendous tiger with fangs like sabres, thesabre-toothed tiger, had hunted its prey where now the journalists of FleetStreet go to and fro. Now came a bleaker age and still bleaker ages. A greatweeding and extinction of species occurred. A woolly rhinoceros, adapted to acold climate, and the mammoth, a big woolly cousin of the elephants, the Arcticmusk ox and the reindeer passed across the scene. Then century by century theArctic ice cap, the wintry death of the great Ice Age, crept southward. InEngland it came almost down to the Thames, in America it reached Ohio. Therewould be warmer spells of a few thousand years and relapses towards a bitterercold.Geologists talk of these wintry phases as the First, Second, Third and FourthGlacial Ages, and of the interludes as Interglacial periods. We live to-day in aworld that is still impoverished and scarred by that terrible winter. The FirstGlacial Age was coming on 600,000 years ago; the Fourth Glacial Age reached itsbitterest some fifty thousand years ago. And it was amidst the snows of thislong universal winter that the first man-like beings lived upon our planet.By the middle Cainozoic period there have appeared various apes with manyquasi-human attributes of the jaws and leg bones, but it is only as we approachthese Glacial Ages that we find traces of creatures that we can speak of as\"almost human.\" These traces are not bones but implements. In Europe, indeposits of this period, between half a million and a million years old, we findflints and stones that have evidently been chipped intentionally by some handycreature desirous of hammering, scraping or fighting with the sharpened edge.These things have been called \"Eoliths\" (dawn stones). In Europe there are nobones nor other remains of the creature which made these objects, simply theobjects themselves. For all the certainty we have it may have been some entirelyunhuman but intelligent monkey. But at Trinil in Java, in accumulations of thisage, a piece of a skull and various teeth and bones have been found of a sort ofape man, with a brain case bigger than that of any living apes, which seems tohave walked erect. This creature is now called Pithecanthropus erectus, thewalking ape man, and the little trayful of its bones is the only help ourimaginations have as yet in figuring to ourselves the makers of the Eoliths.It is not until we come to sands that are almost a quarter of a million yearsold that we find any other particle of a sub-human being. But there are plentyof implements, and they are steadily improving in quality as we read on throughthe record. They are no longer clumsy Eoliths; they are now shapely instrumentsmade with considerable skill. And they are much bigger than the similarimplements afterwards made by true man. Then, in a sandpit at Heidelberg,appears a single quasi-human jaw-bone, a clumsy jaw-bone, absolutely chinless,far heavier than a true human jaw-bone and narrower, so that it is improbablethe creature's tongue could have moved about for articulate speech. On thestrength of this jaw-bone, scientific men suppose this creature to have been aheavy, almost human monster, possibly with huge limbs and hands, possibly with athick felt of hair, and they call it the Heidelberg Man.This jaw-bone is, I think, one of the most tormenting objects in the world toour human curiosity. To see it is like looking through a defective glass intothe past and catching just one blurred and tantalizing glimpse of this Thing,shambling through the bleak wilderness, clambering to avoid the sabre-toothedtiger, watching the woolly rhinoceros in the woods. Then before we canscrutinize the monster, he vanishes. Yet the soil is littered abundantly withthe indestructible implements he chipped out for his uses.Still more fascinatingly enigmatical are the remains of a creature found atPiltdown in Sussex in a deposit that may indicate an age between a hundred and ahundred and fifty thousand years ago, though some authorities would put theseparticular remains back in time to before the Heidelberg jaw-bone. Here thereare the remains of a thick sub-human skull much larger than any existing ape's,and a chimpanzee-like jaw-bone which may or may not belong to it, and, inaddition, a bat-shaped piece of elephant bone evidently carefully manufactured,through which a hole had apparently been bored. There is also the thigh-bone ofa deer with cuts upon it like a tally. That is all.What sort of beast was this creature which sat and bored holes in bones?Scientific men have named him Eoanthropus, the Dawn Man. He stands apart fromhis kindred; a very different being either from the Heidelberg creature or fromany living ape. No other vestige like him is known. But the gravels and depositsof from one hundred thousand years onward are increasingly rich in implements offlint and similar stone. And these implements are no longer rude \"Eoliths.\" Thearchaeologists are presently able to distinguish scrapers, borers, knives,darts, throwing stones and hand axes.We are drawing very near to man. In our next section we shall have to describethe strangest of all these precursors of humanity, the Neanderthalers, the menwho were almost, but not quite, true men.But it may be well perhaps to state quite clearly here that no scientific mansupposes either of these creatures, the Heidelberg Man or Eoanthropus, to bedirect ancestors of the men of to-day. These are, at the closest, related forms.X. THE NEANDERTHALER AND THE RHODESIAN MANABOUT fifty or sixty thousand years ago, before the climax of the Fourth GlacialAge, there lived a creature on earth so like a man that until a few years agoits remains were considered to be altogether human. We have skulls and bones ofit and a great accumulation of the large implements it made and used. It madefires. It sheltered in caves from the cold. It probably dressed skins roughlyand wore them. It was right-handed as men are.Yet now the ethnologists tell us these creatures were not true men. They were ofa different species of the same genus. They had heavy protruding jaws and greatbrow ridges above the eyes and very low foreheads. Their thumbs were notopposable to the fingers as men's are; their necks were so poised that theycould not turn back their heads and look up to the sky. They probably slouchedalong, head down and forward. Their chinless jaw-bones resemble the Heidelbergjaw-bone and are markedly unlike human jaw-bones. And there were greatdifferences from the human pattern in their teeth. Their cheek teeth were morecomplicated in structure than ours, more complicated and not less so; they hadnot the long fangs of our cheek teeth; and also these quasi-men had not themarked canines (dog teeth) of an ordinary human being. The capacity of theirskulls was quite human, but the brain was bigger behind and lower in front thanthe human brain. Their intellectual faculties were differently arranged. Theywere not ancestral to the human line. Mentally and physically they were upon adifferent line from the human line.Skulls and bones of this extinct species of man were found at Neanderthal amongother places, and from that place these strange proto-men have been christenedNeanderthal Men, or Neanderthalers. They must have endured in Europe for manyhundreds or even thousands of years.At that time the climate and geography of our world was very different from whatthey are at the present time. Europe for example was covered with ice reachingas far south as the Thames and into Central Germany and Russia; there was noChannel separating Britain from France; the Mediterranean and the Red Sea weregreat valleys, with perhaps a chain of lakes in their deeper portions, and agreat inland sea spread from the present Black Sea across South Russia and farinto Central Asia. Spain and all of Europe not actually under ice consisted ofbleak uplands under a harder climate than that of Labrador, and it was only whenNorth Africa was reached that one would have found a temperate climate. Acrossthe cold steppes of Southern Europe with its sparse arctic vegetation, driftedsuch hardy creatures as the woolly mammoth, and woolly rhinoceros, great oxenand reindeer, no doubt following the vegetation northward in spring andsouthward in autumn.Such was the scene through which the Neanderthaler wandered, gathering suchsubsistence as he could from small game or fruits and berries and roots.Possibly he was mainly a vegetarian, chewing twigs and roots. His levelelaborate teeth suggest a largely vegetarian dietary. But we also find the longmarrow bones of great animals in his caves, cracked to extract the marrow. Hisweapons could not have been of much avail in open conflict with great beasts,but it is supposed that he attacked them with spears at difficult rivercrossings and even constructed pitfalls for them. Possibly he followed the herdsand preyed upon any dead that were killed in fights, and perhaps he played thepart of jackal to the sabre-toothed tiger which still survived in his day.Possibly in the bitter hardships of the Glacial Ages this creature had taken toattacking animals after long ages of vegetarian adaptation.We cannot guess what this Neanderthal man looked like. He may have been veryhairy and very inhuman-looking indeed. It is even doubtful if he went erect. Hemay have used his knuckles as well as his feet to hold himself up. Probably hewent about alone or in small family groups. It is inferred from the structure ofhis jaw that he was incapable of speech as we understand it.For thousands of years these Neanderthalers were the highest animals that theEuropean area had ever seen; and then some thirty or thirty-five thousand yearsago as the climate grew warmer a race of kindred beings, more intelligent,knowing more, talking and co-operating together, came drifting into theNeanderthaler's world from the south. They ousted the Neanderthalers from theircaves and squatting places; they hunted the same food; they probably made warupon their grisly predecessors and killed them off. These newcomers from thesouth or the east-for at present we do not know their region of origin-who atlast drove the Neanderthalers out of existence altogether, were beings of ourown blood and kin, the first True Men. Their brain-cases and thumbs and necksand teeth were anatomically the same as our own. In a cave at Cro-Magnon and inanother at Grimaldi, a number of skeletons have been found, the earliest trulyhuman remains that are so far known.So it is our race comes into the Record of the Rocks, and the story of mankindbegins.The world was growing liker our own in those days though the climate was stillaustere. The glaciers of the Ice Age were receding in Europe; the reindeer ofFrance and Spain presently gave way to great herds of horses as grass increasedupon the steppes, and the mammoth became more and more rare in southern Europeand finally receded northward altogether.We do not know where the True Men first originated. But in the summer of 1921,an extremely interesting skull was found together with pieces of a skeleton atBroken Hill in South Africa, which seems to be a relic of a third sort of man,intermediate in its characteristics between the Neanderthaler and the humanbeing. The brain-case indicates a brain bigger in front and smaller behind thanthe Neanderthaler's, and the skull was poised erect upon the backbone in a quitehuman way. The teeth also and the bones are quite human. But the face must havebeen ape-like with enormous brow ridges and a ridge along the middle of theskull. The creature was indeed a true man, so to speak, with an ape-like,Neanderthaler face. This Rhodesian Man is evidently still closer to real menthan the Neanderthal Man.This Rhodesian skull is probably only the second of what in the end may prove tobe a long list of finds of sub-human species which lived on the earth in thevast interval of time between the beginnings of the Ice Age and the appearanceof their common heir, and perhaps their common exterminator, the True Man. TheRhodesian skull itself may not be very ancient. Up to the time of publishingthis book there has been no exact determination of its probable age. It may bethat this sub-human creature survived in South Africa until quite recent times.XI. THE FIRST TRUE MENTHE EARLIEST signs and traces at present known to science, of a humanity whichis indisputably kindred with ourselves, have been found in western Europe andparticularly in France and Spain. Bones, weapons, scratchings upon bone androck, carved fragments of bone, and paintings in caves and upon rock surfacesdating, it is supposed, from 30,000 years ago or more, have been discovered inboth these countries. Spain is at present the richest country in the world inthese first relics of our real human ancestors.Of course our present collections of these things are the merest beginnings ofthe accumulations we may hope for in the future, when there are searchers enoughto make a thorough examination of all possible sources and when other countriesin the world, now inaccessible to archaeologists, have been explored in somedetail. The greater part of Africa and Asia has never even been traversed yet bya trained observer interested in these matters and free to explore, and we mustbe very careful therefore not to conclude that the early true men weredistinctively inhabitants of western Europe or that they first appeared in thatregion.In Asia or Africa or submerged beneath the sea of to-day there may be richer andmuch earlier deposits of real human remains than anything that has yet come tolight. I write in Asia or Africa, and I do not mention America because so farthere have been no finds at all of any of the higher Primates, either of greatapes, sub-men, Neanderthalers nor early true men. This development of life seemsto have been an exclusively old world development, and it was only apparently atthe end of the Old Stone Age that human beings first made their way across theland connexion that is now cut by Behring Straits, into the American continent.These first real human beings we know of in Europe appear already to havebelonged to one or other of at least two very distinct races. One of these raceswas of a very high type indeed; it was tall and big brained. One of the women'sskulls found exceeds in capacity that of the average man of to-day. One of themen's skeletons is over six feet in height. The physical type resembled that ofthe North American Indian. From the Cro-Magnon cave in which the first skeletonswere found these people have been called Cro-Magnards. They were savages, butsavages of a high order. The second race, the race of the Grimaldi cave remains,was distinctly negroid in its characters. Its nearest living affinities are theBushmen and Hottentots of South Africa. It is interesting to find at the veryoutset of the known human story, that mankind was already racially divided intoat least two main varieties; and one is tempted to such unwarrantable guesses asthat the former race was probably brownish rather than black and that it camefrom the East or North, and that the latter was blackish rather than brown andcame from the equatorial south.And these savages of perhaps forty thousand years ago were so human that theypierced shells to make necklaces, painted themselves, carved images of bone andstone, scratched figures on rocks and bones, and painted rude but often veryable sketches of beasts and the like upon the smooth walls of caves and uponinviting rock surfaces. They made a great variety of implements, much smaller inscale and finer than those of the Neanderthal men. We have now in our museumsgreat quantities of their implements, their statuettes, their rock drawings andthe like.The earliest of them were hunters. Their chief pursuit was the wild horse, thelittle bearded pony of that time. They followed it as it moved after pasture.And also they followed the bison. They knew the mammoth, because they have leftus strikingly effective pictures of that creature. To judge by one ratherambiguous drawing they trapped and killed it.They hunted with spears and throwing stones. They do not seem to have had thebow, and it is doubtful if they had yet learnt to tame any animals. They had nodogs. There is one carving of a horse's head and one or two drawings thatsuggest a bridled horse, with a twisted skin or tendon round it. But the littlehorses of that age and region could not have carried a man, and if the horse wasdomesticated it was used as a led horse. It is doubtful and improbable that theyhad yet learnt the rather unnatural use of animal's milk as food.They do not seem to have erected any buildings though they may have had tents ofskins, and though they made clay figures they never rose to the making ofpottery. Since they had no cooking implements their cookery must have beenrudimentary or nonexistent. They knew nothing of cultivation and nothing of anysort of basket work or woven cloth. Except for their robes of skin or fur theywere naked painted savages.These earliest known men hunted the open steppes of Europe for a hundredcenturies perhaps, and then slowly drifted and changed before a change ofclimate. Europe, century by century, was growing milder and damper. Reindeerreceded northward and eastward, and bison and horse followed. The steppes gaveway to forests, and red deer took the place of horse and bison. There is achange in the character of the implements with this change in their application.River and lake fishing becomes of great importance to men, and fine implementsof bone increased. \"The bone needles of this age,\" says de Mortillet, \"are muchsuperior to those of later, even historical times, down to the Renaissance. TheRomans, for example, never had needles comparable to those of this epoch.\"Almost fifteen or twelve thousand years ago a fresh people drifted into thesouth of Spain, and left very remarkable drawings of themselves upon exposedrock faces there. These were the Azilians (named from the Mas d'Azil cave). Theyhad the bow; they seem to have worn feather headdresses; they drew vividly; butalso they had reduced their drawings to a sort of symbolism-a man for instancewould be represented by a vertical dab with two or three horizontal dabs-thatsuggest the dawn of the writing idea. Against hunting sketches there are oftenmarks like tallies. One drawing shows two men smoking out a bees' nest.These are the latest of the men that we call Palaeolithic (Old Stone Age)because they had only chipped implements. By ten or twelve thousand years a newsort of life has dawned in Europe, men have learnt not only to chip but topolish and grind stone implements, and they have begun cultivation. TheNeolithic Age (New Stone Age) was beginning.It is interesting to note that less than a century ago there still survived in aremote part of the world, in Tasmania, a race of human beings at a lower levelof physical and intellectual development than any of these earliest races ofmankind who have left traces in Europe. These people had long ago been cut offby geographical changes from the rest of the species, and from stimulation andimprovement. They seem to have degenerated rather than developed. They lived abase life subsisting upon shellfish and small game. They had no habitations butonly squatting places. They were real men of our species, but they had neitherthe manual dexterity nor the artistic powers of the first true men.XII. PRIMITIVE THOUGHTAND now let us indulge in a very interesting speculation; how did it feel to bea man in those early days of the human adventure? How did men think and what didthey think in those remote days of hunting and wandering four hundred centuriesago before seed time and harvest began. Those were days long before the writtenrecord of any human impressions, and we are left almost entirely to inferenceand guesswork in our answers to these questions.The sources to which scientific men have gone in their attempts to reconstructthat primitive mentality are very various. Recently the science ofpsycho-analysis, which analyzes the way in which the egotistic and passionateimpulses of the child are restrained, suppressed, modified or overlaid, to adaptthem to the needs of social life, seems to have thrown a considerable amount oflight upon the history of primitive society; and another fruitful source ofsuggestion has been the study of the ideas and customs of such contemporarysavages as still survive. Again there is a sort of mental fossilization which wefind in folk-lore and the deep-lying irrational superstitions and prejudicesthat still survive among modern civilized people. And finally we have in theincreasingly numerous pictures, statues, carvings, symbols and the like, as wedraw near to our own time, clearer and clearer indications of what man foundinteresting and worthy of record and representation.Primitive man probably thought very much as a child thinks, that is to say in aseries of imaginative pictures. He conjured up images or images presentedthemselves to his mind, and he acted in accordance with the emotions theyaroused. So a child or an uneducated person does to-day. Systematic thinking isapparently a comparatively late development in human experience; it has notplayed any great part in human life until within the last three thousand years.And even to-day those who really control and order their thoughts are but asmall minority of mankind. Most of the world still lives by imagination andpassion.Probably the earliest human societies, in the opening stages of the true humanstory, were small family groups. Just as the flocks and herds of the earliermammals arose out of families which remained together and multiplied, soprobably did the earliest tribes. But before this could happen a certainrestraint upon the primitive egotisms of the individual had to be established.The fear of the father and respect for the mother had to be extended into adultlife, and the natural jealousy of the old man of the group for the younger malesas they grew up had to be mitigated. The mother on the other hand was thenatural adviser and protector of the young. Human social life grew up out of thereaction between the crude instinct of the young to go off and pair bythemselves as they grew up, on the one hand, and the dangers and disadvantagesof separation on the other. An anthropological writer of great genius, J. J.Atkinson, in his Primal Law, has shown how much of the customary law of savages,the Tabus, that are so remarkable a fact in tribal life, can be ascribed to sucha mental adjustment of the needs of the primitive human animal to a developingsocial life, and the later work of the psycho-analysts has done much to confirmhis interpretation of these possibilities.Some speculative writers would have us believe that respect and fear of the OldMan and the emotional reaction of the primitive savage to older protectivewomen, exaggerated in dreams and enriched by fanciful mental play, played alarge part in the beginnings of primitive religion and in the conception of godsand goddesses. Associated with this respect for powerful or helpfulpersonalities was a dread and exaltation of such personages after their deaths,due to their reappearance in dreams. It was easy to believe they were not trulydead but only fantastically transferred to a remoteness of greater power.The dreams, imaginations and fears of a child are far more vivid and real thanthose of a modern adult, and primitive man was always something of a child. Hewas nearer to the animals also, and he could suppose them to have motives andreactions like his own. He could imagine animal helpers, animal enemies, animalgods. One needs to have been an imaginative child oneself to realize again howimportant, significant, portentous or friendly, strangely shaped rocks, lumps ofwood, exceptional trees or the like may have appeared to the men of the OldStone Age, and how dream and fancy would create stories and legends about suchthings that would become credible as they told them. Some of these stories wouldbe good enough to remember and tell again. The women would tell them to thechildren and so establish a tradition. To this day most imaginative childreninvent long stories in which some favourite doll or animal or some fantasticsemihuman being figures as the hero, and primitive man probably did thesame-with a much stronger disposition to believe his hero real.For the very earliest of the true men that we know of were probably quitetalkative beings. In that way they have differed from the Neanderthalers and hadan advantage over them. The Neanderthaler may have been a dumb animal. Of coursethe primitive human speech was probably a very scanty collection of names, andmay have been eked out with gestures and signs.There is no sort of savage so low as not to have a kind of science of cause andeffect. But primitive man was not very critical in his associations of causewith effect; he very easily connected an effect with something quite wrong asits cause. \"You do so and so,\" he said, \"and so and so happens.\" You give achild a poisonous berry and it dies. You eat the heart of a valiant enemy andyou become strong. There we have two bits of cause and effect association, onetrue one false. We call the system of cause and effect in the mind of a savage,Fetish; but Fetish is simply savage science. It differs from modern science inthat it is totally unsystematic and uncritical and so more frequently wrong.In many cases it is not difficult to link cause and effect, in many otherserroneous ideas were soon corrected by experience; but there was a large seriesof issues of very great importance to primitive man, where he soughtpersistently for causes and found explanations that were wrong but notsufficiently wrong nor so obviously wrong as to be detected. It was a matter ofgreat importance to him that game should be abundant or fish plentiful andeasily caught, and no doubt he tried and believed in a thousand charms,incantations and omens to determine these desirable results. Another greatconcern of his was illness and death. Occasionally infections crept through theland and men died of them. Occasionally men were stricken by illness and died orwere enfeebled without any manifest cause. This too must have given the hasty,emotional mind of primitive man much feverish exercise. Dreams and fantasticguesses made him blame this, or appeal for help to that man or beast or thing.He had the child's aptitude for fear and panic.Quite early in the little human tribe, older, steadier minds sharing the fears,sharing the imaginations, but a little more forceful than the others, must haveasserted themselves, to advise, to prescribe, to command. This they declaredunpropitious and that imperative, this an omen of good and that an omen of evil.The expert in Fetish, the Medicine Man, was the first priest. He exhorted, heinterpreted dreams, he warned, he performed the complicated hocus pocus thatbrought luck or averted calamity. Primitive religion was not so much what we nowcall religion as practice and observance, and the early priest dictated what wasindeed an arbitrary primitive practical science.XIII. THE BEGINNINGS OF CULTIVATIONWE are still very ignorant about the beginnings of cultivation and settlement inthe world although a vast amount of research and speculation has been given tothese matters in the last fifty years. All that we can say with any confidenceat present is that somewhen about 15,000 and 12,000 B.C. while the Azilianpeople were in the south of Spain and while the remnants of the earlier hunterswere drifting northward and eastward, somewhere in North Africa or Western Asiaor in that great Mediterranean valley that is now submerged under the waters ofthe Mediterranean sea, there were people who, age by age, were working out twovitally important things: they were beginning cultivation and they weredomesticating animals. They were also beginning to make, in addition to thechipped implements of their hunter forebears, implements of polished stone. Theyhad discovered the possibility of basketwork and roughly woven textiles of plantfibre, and they were beginning to make a rudely modelled pottery.They were entering upon a new phase in human culture, the Neolithic phase (NewStone Age) as distinguished from the Palaeolithic (Old Stone) phase of theCro-Magnards, the Grimaldi people, the Azilians and their like. Slowly theseNeolithic people spread over the warmer parts of the world; and the arts theyhad mastered, the plants and animals they had learnt to use, spread by imitationand acquisition even more widely than they did. By 10,000 B.C., most of mankindwas at the Neolithic level.Now the ploughing of land, the sowing of seed, the reaping of harvest, threshingand grinding, may seem the most obviously reasonable steps to a modern mind justas to a modern mind it is a commonplace that the world is round. What else couldyou do? people will ask. What else can it be? But to the primitive man of twentythousand years ago neither of the systems of action and reasoning that seem sosure and manifest to us to-day were at all obvious. He felt his way to effectualpractice through a multitude of trials and misconceptions, with fantastic andunnecessary elaborations and false interpretations at every turn. Somewhere inthe Mediterranean region, wheat grew wild; and man way have learnt to pound andthen grind up its seeds for food long before he learnt to sow. He reaped beforehe sowed.And it is a very remarkable thing that throughout the world wherever there issowing and harvesting there is still traceable the vestiges of a strongprimitive association of the idea of sowing with the idea of a blood sacrifice,and primarily of the sacrifice of a human being. The study of the originalentanglement of these two things is a profoundly attractive one to the curiousmind; the interested reader will find it very fully developed in that monumentalwork, Sir J. G. Frazer's Golden Bough. It was an entanglement, we must remember,in the childish, dreaming, myth-making primitive mind; no reasoned process willexplain it. But in that world of 12,000 to 20,000 years ago, it would seem thatwhenever seed time came round to the Neolithic peoples there was a humansacrifice. And it was not the sacrifice of any mean or outcast person; it wasthe sacrifice usually of a chosen youth or maiden, a youth more often who wastreated with profound deference and even worship up to the moment of hisimmolation. He was a sort of sacrificial god-king, and all the details of hiskilling had become a ritual directed by the old, knowing men and sanctioned bythe accumulated usage of ages.At first primitive men, with only a very rough idea of the seasons, must havefound great difficulty in determining when was the propitious moment for theseed-time sacrifice and the sowing. There is some reason for supposing thatthere was an early stage in human experience when men had no idea of a year. Thefirst chronology was in lunar months; it is supposed that the years of theBiblical patriarchs are really moons, and the Babylonian calendar shows distincttraces of an attempt to reckon seed time by taking thirteen lunar months to seeit round. This lunar influence upon the calendar reaches down to our own days.If usage did not dull our sense of its strangeness we should think it a veryremarkable thing indeed that the Christian Church does not commemorate theCrucifixion and Resurrection of Christ on the proper anniversaries but on datesthat vary year by year with the phases of the moon.It may be doubted whether the first agriculturalists made any observation of thestars. It is more likely that stars were first observed by migratory herdsmen,who found them a convenient mark of direction. But once their use in determiningseasons was realized, their importance to agriculture became very great. Theseed-time sacrifice was linked up with the southing or northing of someprominent star. A myth and worship of that star was for primitive man an almostinevitable consequence.It is easy to see how important the man of knowledge and experience, the man whoknew about the blood sacrifice and the stars, became in this early Neolithicworld.The fear of uncleanness and pollution, and the methods of cleansing that wereadvisable, constituted another source of power for the knowledgeable men andwomen. For there have always been witches as well as wizards, and priestesses aswell as priests. The early priest was really not so much a religious man as aman of applied science. His science was generally empirical and often bad; hekept it secret from the generality of men very jealously; but that does notalter the fact that his primary function was knowledge and that his primary usewas a practical use.Twelve or fifteen thousand years ago, in all the warm and fairly well-wateredparts of the Old World these Neolithic human communities, with their class andtradition of priests and priestesses and their cultivated fields and theirdevelopment of villages and little walled cities, were spreading. Age by age adrift and exchange of ideas went on between these communities. Eliot Smith andRivers have used the term \"Heliolithic culture\" for the culture of these firstagricultural peoples. \"Heliolithic\" (Sun and Stone) is not perhaps the bestpossible word to use for this, but until scientific men give us a better one weshall have to use it. Originating somewhere in the Mediterranean and westernAsiatic area, it spread age by age eastward and from island to island across thePacific until it may even have reached America and mingled with the moreprimitive ways of living of the Mongoloid immigrants coming down from the North.Wherever the brownish people with the Heliolithic culture went they took withthem all or most of a certain group of curious ideas and practices. Some of themare such queer ideas that they call for the explanation of the mental expert.They made pyramids and great mounds, and set up great circles of big stones,perhaps to facilitate the astronomical observation of the priests; they mademummies of some or all of their dead; they tattooed and circumcized; they hadthe old custom, known as the couvade, of sending the father to bed and rest whena child was born, and they had as a luck symbol the well-known Swastika.If we were to make a map of the world with dots to show how far these grouppractices have left their traces, we should make a belt along the temperate andsub-tropical coasts of the world from Stonehenge and Spain across the world toMexico and Peru. But Africa below the equator, north central Europe, and northAsia would show none of these dottings; there lived races who were developingalong practically independent lines.The term Palaeolithic we may note is alsoused to cover the Neanderthaler and even the Eolithic implements. The pre-humanage is called the \"Older Palaeolithic,\" the age of true men using unpolishedstones in the \"Newer Palaeolithic.\"XIV. PRIMITIVE NEOLITHIC CIVILIZATIONSABOUT 10,000 B.C. the geography of the world was very similar in its generaloutline to that of the world to-day. It is probable that by that time the greatbarrier across the Straits of Gibraltar that had hitherto banked back the oceanwaters from the Mediterranean valley had been eaten through, and that theMediterranean was a sea following much the same coastlines as it does now. TheCaspian Sea was probably still far more extensive than it is at present, and itmay have been continuous with the Black Sea to the north of the CaucasusMountains. About this great Central Asian sea lands that are now steppes anddeserts were fertile and habitable. Generally it was a moister and more fertileworld. European Russia was much more a land of swamp and lake than it is now,and there may still have been a land connexion between Asia and America atBehring Straits.It would have been already possible at that time to have distinguished the mainracial divisions of mankind as we know them to-day. Across the warm temperateregions of this rather warmer and better-wooded world, and along the coasts,stretched the brownish peoples of the Heliolithic culture, the ancestors of thebulk of the living inhabitants of the Mediterranean world, of the Berbers, theEgyptians and of much of the population of South and Eastern Asia. This greatrace had of course a number of varieties. The Iberian or Mediterranean or\"dark-white\" race of the Atlantic and Mediterranean coast, the \"Hamitic\" peopleswhich include the Berbers and Egyptians, the Dravidians, the darker people ofIndia, a multitude of East Indian people, many Polynesian races and the Maorisare all divisions of various value of this great main mass of humanity. Itswestern varieties are whiter than its eastern. In the forests of central andnorthern Europe a more blonde variety of men with blue eyes was becomingdistinguishable, branching off from the main mass of brownish people, a varietywhich many people now speak of as the Nordic race. In the more open regions ofnortheastern Asia was another differentiation of this brownish humanity in thedirection of a type with more oblique eyes, high cheek-bones, a yellowish skin,and very straight black hair, the Mongolian peoples. In South Africa, Australia,in many tropical islands in the south of Asia were remains of the early negroidpeoples. The central parts of Africa were already a region of racialintermixture. Nearly all the coloured races of Africa to-day seem to be blendsof the brownish peoples of the north with a negroid substratum.We have to remember that human races can all interbreed freely and that theyseparate, mingle and reunite as clouds do. Human races do not branch out liketrees with branches that never come together again. It is a thing we need tobear constantly in mind, this remingling of races at any opportunity. It willsave us from many cruel delusions and prejudices if we do so. People will usesuch a word as race in the loosest manner, and base the most preposterousgeneralizations upon it. They will speak of a \"British\" race or of a \"European\"race. But nearly all the European nations are confused mixtures of brownish,dark-white, white and Mongolian elements.It was at the Neolithic phase of human development that peoples of the Mongolianbreed first made their way into America. Apparently they came by way of BehringStraits and spread southward. They found caribou, the American reindeer, in thenorth and great herds of bison in the south. When they reached South Americathere were still living the Glyptodon, a gigantic armadillo, and theMegatherium, a monstrous clumsy sloth as high as an elephant. They probablyexterminated the latter beast, which was as helpless as it was big.The greater portion of these American tribes never rose above a hunting nomadicNeolithic life. They never discovered the use of iron, and their chief metalpossessions were native gold and copper. But in Mexico, Yucatan and Peruconditions existed favourable to settled cultivation, and here about 1000 B.C.or so arose very interesting civilizations of a parallel but different type fromthe old-world civilization. Like the much earlier primitive civilizations of theold world these communities displayed a great development of human sacrificeabout the processes of seed time and harvest; but while in the old world, as weshall see, these primary ideas were ultimately mitigated, complicated andoverlaid by others, in America they developed and were elaborated to a very highdegree of intensity. These American civilized countries were essentiallypriest-ruled countries; their war chiefs and rulers were under a rigorous ruleof law and omen.These priests carried astronomical science to a high level of accuracy. Theyknew their year better than the Babylonians of whom we shall presently tell. InYucatan they had a kind of writing, the Maya writing, of the most curious andelaborate character. So far as we have been able to decipher it, it was usedmainly for keeping the exact and complicated calendars upon which the priestsexpended their intelligence. The art of the Maya civilization came to a climaxabout 700 or 800 A.D. The sculptured work of these people amazes the modernobserver by its great plastic power and its frequent beauty, and perplexes himby a grotesqueness and by a sort of insane conventionality and intricacy outsidethe circle of his ideas. There is nothing quite like it in the old world. Thenearest approach, and that is a remote one, is found in archaic Indian carvings.Everywhere there are woven feathers and serpents twine in and out. Many Mayainscriptions resemble a certain sort of elaborate drawing made by lunatics inEuropean asylums, more than any other old-world work. It is as if the Maya mindhad developed upon a different line from the old-world mind, had a differenttwist to its ideas, was not, by old-world standards, a rational mind at all.This linking of these aberrant American civilizations to the idea of a generalmental aberration finds support in their extraordinary obsession by the sheddingof human blood. The Mexican civilization in particular ran blood; it offeredthousands of human victims yearly. The cutting open of living victims, thetearing out of the still beating heart, was an act that dominated the minds andlives of these strange priesthoods. The public life, the national festivitiesall turned on this fantastically horrible act.The ordinary existence of the common people in these communities was very likethe ordinary existence of any other barbaric peasantry. Their pottery, weavingand dyeing was very good. The Maya writing was not only carven on stone butwritten and painted upon skins and the like. The European and American museumscontain many enigmatical Maya manuscripts of which at present little has beendeciphered except the dates. In Peru there were beginnings of a similar writingbut they were superseded by a method of keeping records by knotting cords. Asimilar method of mnemonics was in use in China thousands of years ago.In the old world before 4000 or 5000 B.C., that is to say three or four thousandyears earlier, there were primitive civilizations not unlike these Americancivilizations; civilizations based upon a temple, having a vast quantity ofblood sacrifices and with an intensely astronomical priesthood. But in the oldworld the primitive civilizations reacted upon one another and developed towardsthe conditions of our own world. In America these primitive civilizations neverprogressed beyond this primitive stage. Each of them was in a little world ofits own. Mexico it seems knew little or nothing of Peru, until the Europeanscame to America. The potato, which was the principal food stuff in Peru, wasunknown in Mexico.Age by age these peoples lived and marvelled at their gods and made theirsacrifices and died. Maya art rose to high levels of decorative beauty. Men madelove and tribes made war. Drought and plenty, pestilence and health, followedone another. The priests elaborated their calendar and their sacrificial ritualthrough long centuries, but made little progress in other directions.XV. SUMERIA, EARLY EGYPT AND WRITINGTHE OLD world is a wider, more varied stage than the new. By 6000 or 7000 B.C.there were already quasi-civilized communities almost at the Peruvian level,appearing in various fertile regions of Asia and in the Nile valley. At thattime north Persia and western Turkestan and south Arabia were all more fertilethan they are now, and there are traces of very early communities in theseregions. It is in lower Mesopotamia however and in Egypt that there first appearcities, temples, systematic irrigation, and evidences of a social organizationrising above the level of a mere barbaric village-town. In those days theEuphrates and Tigris flowed by separate mouths into the Persian Gulf, and it wasin the country between them that the Sumerians built their first cities. Aboutthe same time, for chronology is still vague, the great history of Egypt wasbeginning.These Sumerians appear to have been a brownish people with prominent noses. Theyemployed a sort of writing that has been deciphered, and their language is nowknown. They had discovered the use of bronze and they built great tower-liketemples of sun-dried brick. The clay of this country is very fine; they used itto write upon, and so it is that their inscriptions have been preserved to us.They had cattle, sheep, goats and asses, but no horses. They fought on foot, inclose formation, carrying spears and shields of skin. Their clothing was of wooland they shaved their heads.Each of the Sumerian cities seems generally to have been an independent statewith a god of its own and priests of its own. But sometimes one city wouldestablish an ascendancy over others and exact tribute from their population. Avery ancient inscription at Nippur records the \"empire,\" the first recordedempire, of the Sumerian city of Erech. Its god and its priest-king claimed anauthority from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea.At first writing was merely an abbreviated method of pictorial record. Evenbefore Neolithic times men were beginning to write. The Azilian rock pictures towhich we have already referred show the beginning of the process. Many of themrecord hunts and expeditions, and in most of these the human figures are plainlydrawn. But in some the painter would not bother with head and limbs; he justindicated men by a vertical and one or two transverse strokes. From this to aconventional condensed picture writing was an easy transition. In Sumeria, wherethe writing was done on clay with a stick, the dabs of the characters soonbecame unrecognizably unlike the things they stood for, but in Egypt where menpainted on walls and on strips of the papyrus reed (the first paper) thelikeness to the thing imitated remained. From the fact that the wooden stylesused in Sumeria made wedge-shaped marks, the Sumerian writing is calledcuneiform ([fig] = wedge-shaped).An important step towards writing was made when pictures were used to indicatenot the thing represented but some similar thing. In the rebus dear to childrenof a suitable age, this is still done to-day. We draw a camp with tents and abell, and the child is delighted to guess that this is the Scotch name Campbell.The Sumerian language was a language made up of accumulated syllables ratherlike some contemporary Amerindian languages, and it lent itself very readily tothis syllabic method of writing words expressing ideas that could not beconveyed by pictures directly. Egyptian writing underwent parallel developments.Later on, when foreign peoples with less distinctly syllabled methods of speechwere to learn and use these picture scripts they were to make those furthermodifications and simplifications that developed at last into alphabeticalwriting. All the true alphabets of the later world derived from a mixture of theSumerian cuneiform and the Egyptian hieroglyphic (priest writing). Later inChina there was to develop a conventionalized picture writing, but in China itnever got to the alphabetical stage.The invention of writing was of very great importance in the development ofhuman societies. It put agreements, laws, commandments on record. It made thegrowth of states larger than the old city states possible. It made a continuoushistorical consciousness possible. The command of the priest or king and hisseal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death. It isinteresting to note that in ancient Sumeria seals were greatly used. A king or anobleman or a merchant would have his seal often very artistically carved, andwould impress it on any clay document he wished to authorize. So close hadcivilization got to printing six thousand years ago. Then the clay was driedhard and became permanent. For the reader must remember that in the land ofMesopotamia for countless years, letters, records and accounts were all writtenon comparatively indestructible tiles. To that fact we owe a great wealth ofrecovered knowledge.Bronze, copper, gold, silver and, as a precious rarity, meteoric iron were knownin both Sumeria and Egypt at a very early stage.Daily life in those first city lands of the old world must have been verysimilar in both Egypt and Sumeria. And except for the asses and cattle in thestreets it must have been not unlike the life in the Maya cities of Americathree or four thousand years later. Most of the people in peace time were busywith irrigation and cultivation-except on days of religious festivity. They hadno money and no need for it. They managed their small occasional trades bybarter. The princes and rulers who alone had more than a few possessions usedgold and silver bars and precious stones for any incidental act of trade. Thetemple dominated life; in Sumeria it was a great towering temple that went up toa roof from which the stars were observed; in Egypt it was a massive buildingwith only a ground floor. In Sumeria the priest ruler was the greatest, mostsplendid of beings. In Egypt however there was one who was raised above thepriests; he was the living incarnation of the chief god of the land, thePharaoh, the god king.There were few changes in the world in those days; men's days were sunny,toilsome and conventional. Few strangers came into the land and such as didfared uncomfortably. The priest directed life according to immemorial rules andwatched the stars for seed time and marked the omens of the sacrifices andinterpreted the warnings of dreams. Men worked and loved and died, notunhappily, forgetful of the savage past of their race and heedless of itsfuture. Sometimes the ruler was benign. Such was Pepi II, who reigned in Egyptfor ninety years. Sometimes he was ambitious and took men's sons to be soldiersand sent them against neighbouring city states to war and plunder, or he madethem toil to build great buildings. Such were Cheops and Chephren and Mycerinus,who built those vast sepulchral piles, the pyramids at Gizeh. The largest ofthese is 450 feet high and the weight of stone in it is 4,883,000 tons. All thiswas brought down the Nile in boats and lugged into place chiefly by humanmuscle. Its erection must have exhausted Egypt more than a great war would havedone.XVI. PRIMITIVE NOMADIC PEOPLESIT was not only in Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley that men were settling downto agriculture and the formation of city states in the centuries between 6000and 3000 B.C. Wherever there were possibilities of irrigation and a steadyall-the-year-round food supply men were exchanging the uncertainties andhardships of hunting and wandering for the routines of settlement. On the upperTigris a people called the Assyrians were founding cities; in the valleys ofAsia Minor and on the Mediterranean shores and islands, there were smallcommunities growing up to civilization. Possibly parallel developments of humanlife were already going on in favourable regions of India and China. In manyparts of Europe where there were lakes well stocked with fish, littlecommunities of men had long settled in dwellings built on piles over the water,and were eking out agriculture by fishing and hunting. But over much largerareas of the old world no such settlement was possible. The land was too harsh,too thickly wooded or too arid, or the seasons too uncertain for mankind, withonly the implements and science of that age to take root.For settlement under the conditions of the primitive civilizations men needed aconstant water supply and warmth and sunshine. Where these needs were notsatisfied, man could live as a transient, as a hunter following his game, as aherdsman following the seasonal grass, but he could not settle. The transitionfrom the hunting to the herding life may have been very gradual. From followingherds of wild cattle or (in Asia) wild horses, men may have come to an idea ofproperty in them, have learnt to pen them into valleys, have fought for themagainst wolves, wild dogs and other predatory beasts.So while the primitive civilizations of the cultivators were growing up chieflyin the great river valleys, a different way of living, the nomadic life, a lifein constant movement to and fro from winter pasture to summer pasture, was alsogrowing up. The nomadic peoples were on the whole hardier than theagriculturalists; they were less prolific and numerous, they had no permanenttemples and no highly organized priesthood; they had less gear; but the readermust not suppose that theirs was necessarily a less highly developed way ofliving on that account. In many ways this free life was a fuller life than thatof the tillers of the soil. The individual was more self-reliant; less of a unitin a crowd. The leader was more important; the medicine man perhaps less so.Moving over large stretches of country the nomad took a wider view of life. Hetouched on the confines of this settled land and that. He was used to the sightof strange faces. He had to scheme and treat for pasture with competing tribes.He knew more of minerals than the folk upon the plough lands because he wentover mountain passes and into rocky places. He may have been a bettermetallurgist. Possibly bronze and much more probably iron smelting were nomadicdiscoveries. Some of the earliest implements of iron reduced from its ores havebeen found in Central Europe far away from the early civilizations.On the other hand the settled folk had their textiles and their pottery and mademany desirable things. It was inevitable that as the two sorts of life, theagricultural and the nomadic differentiated, a certain amount of looting andtrading should develop between the two. In Sumeria particularly which haddeserts and seasonal country on either hand it must have been usual to have thenomads camping close to the cultivated fields, trading and stealing and perhapstinkering, as gipsies do to this day. (But hens they would not steal, becausethe domestic fowl-an Indian jungle fowl originally-was not domesticated by manuntil about 1000 B.C. They would bring precious stones and things of metal andleather. If they were hunters they would bring skins. They would get in exchangepottery and beads and glass, garments and suchlike manufactured things.Three main regions and three main kinds of wandering and imperfectly settledpeople there were in those remote days of the first civilizations in Sumeria andearly Egypt. Away in the forests of Europe were the blonde Nordic peoples,hunters and herdsmen, a lowly race. The primitive civilizations saw very littleof this race before 1500 B.C. Away on the steppes of eastern Asia variousMongolian tribes, the Hunnish peoples, were domesticating the horse anddeveloping a very wide sweeping habit of seasonal movement between their summerand winter camping places. Possibly the Nordic and Hunnish peoples were stillseparated from one another by the swamps of Russia and the greater Caspian Seaof that time. For very much of Russia there was swamp and lake. In the deserts,which were growing more arid now, of Syria and Arabia, tribes of a dark white orbrownish people, the Semitic tribes, were driving flocks of sheep and goats andasses from pasture to pasture. It was these Semitic shepherds and certain morenegroid people from southern Persia, the Elamites, who were the first nomads tocome into close contact with the early civilizations. They came as traders andas raiders. Finally there arose leaders among them with bolder imaginations, andthey became conquerors.About 2750 B.C. a great Semitic leader, Sargon, had conquered the whole Sumerianland and was master of all the world from the Persian Gulf to the MediterraneanSea. He was an illiterate barbarian and his people, the Akkadians, learnt theSumerian writing and adopted the Sumerian language as the speech of theofficials and the learned. The empire he founded decayed after two centuries,and after one inundation of Elamites a fresh Semitic people, the Amorites, bydegrees established their rule over Sumeria. They made their capital in what hadhitherto been a small up-river town, Babylon, and their empire is called thefirst Babylonian Empire. It was consolidated by a great king called Hammurabi(circa 2100 B.C.) who made the earliest code of laws yet known to history.The narrow valley of the Nile lies less open to nomadic invasion thanMesopotamia, but about the time of Hammurabi occurred a successful Semiticinvasion of Egypt and a line of Pharaohs was set up, the Hyksos or \"shepherdkings,\" which lasted for several centuries. These Semitic conquerors neverassimilated themselves with the Egyptians; they were always regarded withhostility as foreigners and barbarians; and they were at last expelled by apopular uprising about 1600 B.C.But the Semites had come into Sumeria for good and all, the two racesassimilated and the Babylonian Empire became Semitic in its language andcharacter.XVII. THE FIRST SEA-GOING PEOPLESTHE EARLIEST boats and ships must have come into use some twenty-five or thirtythousand years ago. Man was probably paddling about on the water with a log ofwood or an inflated skin to assist him, at latest in the beginnings of theNeolithic period. A basketwork boat covered with skin and caulked was used inEgypt and Sumeria from the beginnings of our knowledge. Such boats are stillused there. They are used to this day in Ireland and Wales and in Alaska;sealskin boats still make the crossing of Behring Straits. The hollow logfollowed as tools improved. The building of boats and then ships came in anatural succession.Perhaps the legend of Noah's Ark preserves the memory of some early exploit inshipbuilding, just as the story of the Flood, so widely distributed among thepeoples of the world, may be the tradition of the flooding of the Mediterraneanbasin.There were ships upon the Red Sea long before the pyramids were built, and therewere ships on the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf by 7000 B.C. Mostly these werethe ships of fishermen, but some were already trading and pirate ships-forknowing what we do of mankind we may guess pretty safely that the first sailorsplundered where they could and traded where they had to do so.The seas on which these first ships adventured were inland seas on which thewind blew fitfully and which were often at a dead calm for days together, sothat sailing did not develop beyond an accessory use. It is only in the lastfour hundred years that the well-rigged, ocean-going, sailing ship hasdeveloped. The ships of the ancient world were essentially rowing ships whichhugged the shore and went into harbour at the first sign of rough weather. Asships grew into big galleys they caused a demand for war captives as galleyslaves.We have already noted the appearance of the Semitic people as wanderers andnomads in the region of Syria and Arabia, and how they conquered Sumeria and setup first the Akkadian and then the first Babylonian Empire. In the west thesesame Semitic peoples were taking to the sea. They set up a string of harbourtowns along the Eastern coast of the Mediterranean, of which Type and Sidon werethe chief; and by the time of Hammurabi in Babylon, they had spread as traders,wanderers and colonizers over the whole Mediterranean basin. These sea Semiteswere called the Phoenicians. They settled largely in Spain, pushing back the oldIberian Basque population and sending coasting expeditions through the straitsof Gibraltar; and they set up colonies upon the north coast of Africa. OfCarthage, one of these Phoenicians cities, we shall have much more to telllater.But the Phoenicians were not the first people to have galleys in theMediterranean waters. There was already a series of towns and cities among theislands and coasts of that sea belonging to a race or races apparently connectedby blood and language with the Basques to the west and the Berbers and Egyptiansto the south, the aegean peoples. These peoples must not be confused with theGreeks, who come much later into our story; they were pre-Greek, but they hadcities in Greece and Asia Minor, Mycenae and Troy for example, and they had agreat and prosperous establishment at Cnossos in Crete.It is only in the last half century that the industry of excavatingarchaeologists has brought the extent and civilization of the aegean peoples toour knowledge. Cnossos has been most thoroughly explored; it was happily notsucceeded by any city big enough to destroy its ruins, and so it is our chiefsource of information about this once almost forgotten civilization.The history of Cnossos goes back as far as the history of Egypt; the twocountries were trading actively across the sea by 4000 B.C. By 2500 B.C., thatis between the time of Sargon I and Hammurabi, Cretan civilization was at itszenith.Cnossos was not so much a town as a great palace for the Cretan monarch and hispeople. It was not even fortified. It was only fortified later as thePhoenicians grew strong, and as a new and more terrible breed of pirates, theGreeks, came upon the sea from the north.The monarch was called Minos, as the Egyptian monarch was called Pharaoh; and hekept his state in a palace fitted with running water, with bathrooms and thelike conveniences such as we know of in no other ancient remains. There he heldgreat festivals and shows. There was bull-fighting, singularly like thebull-fighting that still survives in Spain; there was resemblance even in thecostumes of the bull-fighters; and there were gymnastic displays. The women'sclothes were remarkably modern in spirit; they wore corsets and flounceddresses. The pottery, the textile manufactures, the sculpture, painting,jewellery, ivory, metal and inlay work of these Cretans was often astonishinglybeautiful. And they had a system of writing, but that still remains to bedeciphered.This happy and sunny and civilized life lasted for some score of centuries.About 2000 B.C. Cnossos and Babylon abounded in comfortable and cultivatedpeople who probably led very pleasant lives. They had shows and they hadreligious festivals, they had domestic slaves to look after them and industrialslaves to make a profit for them. Life must have seemed very secure in Cnossosfor such people, sunlit and girdled by the blue sea. Egypt of course must haveappeared rather a declining country in those days under the rule of herhalf-barbaric shepherd kings, and if one took an interest in politics one musthave noticed how the Semitic people seemed to be getting everywhere, rulingEgypt, ruling distant Babylon, building Nineveh on the upper Tigris, sailingwest to the Pillars of Hercules (the straits of Gibraltar) and setting up theircolonies on those distant coasts.There were some active and curious minds in Cnossos, because later on the Greekstold legends of a certain skilful Cretan artificer, Daedalus, who attempted tomake some sort of flying machine, perhaps a glider, which collapsed and fellinto the sea.It is interesting to note some of the differences as well as the resemblancesbetween the life of Cnossos and our own. To a Cretan gentleman of 2500 B.C. ironwas a rare metal which fell out of the sky and was curious rather thanuseful-for as yet only meteoric iron was known, iron had not been obtained fromits ores. Compare that with our modern state of affairs pervaded by ironeverywhere. The horse again would be a quite legendary creature to our Cretan, asort of super-ass which lived in the bleak northern lands far away beyond theBlack Sea. Civilization for him dwelt chiefly in aegean Greece and Asia Minor,where Lydians and Carians and Trojans lived a life and probably spoke languageslike his own. There were Phoenicians and aegeans settled in Spain and NorthAfrica, but those were very remote regions to his imagination. Italy was still adesolate land covered with dense forests; the brown-skinned Etruscans had notyet gone there from Asia Minor. And one day perhaps this Cretan gentleman wentdown to the harbour and saw a captive who attracted his attention because he wasvery fair-complexioned and had blue eyes. Perhaps our Cretan tried to talk tohim and was answered in an unintelligible gibberish. This creature came fromsomewhere beyond the Black Sea and seemed to be an altogether benighted savage.But indeed he was an Aryan tribesman, of a race and culture of which we shallsoon have much to tell, and the strange gibberish he spoke was to differentiatesome day into Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, German, English and most of thechief languages of the world.Such was Cnossos at its zenith, intelligent, enterprising, bright and happy. Butabout 1400 B.C. disaster came perhaps very suddenly upon its prosperity. Thepalace of Minos was destroyed, and its ruins have never been rebuilt orinhabited from that day to this. We do not know how this disaster occurred. Theexcavators note what appears to be scattered plunder and the marks of the fire.But the traces of a very destructive earthquake have also been found. Naturealone may have destroyed Cnossos, or the Greeks may have finished what theearthquake began.XVIII. EGYPT, BABYLON AND ASSYRIATHE EGYPTIANS had never submitted very willingly to the rule of their Semiticshepherd kings and about 1600 A.D. a vigorous patriotic movement expelled theseforeigners. Followed a new phase or revival for Egypt, a period known toEgyptologists as the New Empire. Egypt, which had not been closely consolidatedbefore the Hyksos invasion, was now a united country; and the phase ofsubjugation and insurrection left her full of military spirit. The Pharaohsbecame aggressive conquerors. They had now acquired the war horse and the warchariot, which the Hyksos had brought to them. Under Thothmes III and AmenophisIII Egypt had extended her rule into Asia as far as the Euphrates.We are entering now upon a thousand years of warfare between the once quiteseparated civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Nile. At first Egypt wasascendant. The great dynasties, the Seventeenth Dynasty, which included ThothmesIII and Amenophis III and IV and a great queen Hatasu, and the Nineteenth, whenRameses II, supposed by some to have been the Pharaoh of Moses, reigned forsixty-seven years, raised Egypt to high levels of prosperity. In between therewere phases of depression for Egypt, conquest by the Syrians and later conquestby the Ethiopians from the South. In Mesopotamia Babylon ruled, then theHittites and the Syrians of Damascus rose to a transitory predominance; at onetime the Syrians conquered Egypt; the fortunes of the Assyrians of Nineveh ebbedand flowed; sometimes the city was a conquered city; sometimes the Assyriansruled in Babylon and assailed Egypt. Our space is too limited here to tell ofthe comings and goings of the armies of the Egyptians and of the various Semiticpowers of Asia Minor, Syria and Mesopotamia. They were armies now provided withvast droves of war chariots, for the horse-still used only for war and glory-hadspread by this time into the old civilizations from Central Asia.Great conquerors appear in the dim light of that distant time and pass,Tushratta, King of Mitanni, who captured Nineveh, Tiglath Pileser I of Assyriawho conquered Babylon. At last the Assyrians became the greatest military powerof the time. Tiglath Pileser III conquered Babylon in 745 B.C. and founded whathistorians call the New Assyrian Empire. Iron had also come now intocivilization out of the north; the Hittites, the precursors of the Armenians,had it first and communicated its use to the Assyrians, and an Assyrian usurper,Sargon II, armed his troops with it. Assyria became the first power to expoundthe doctrine of blood and iron. Sargon's son Sennacherib led an army to theborders of Egypt, and was defeated not by military strength but by the plague.Sennacherib's grandson Assurbanipal (who is also known in history by his Greekname of Sardanapalus) did actually conquer Egypt in 670 B.C. But Egypt wasalready a conquered country then under an Ethiopian dynasty. Sardanapalus simplyreplaced one conqueror by another.If one had a series of political maps of this long period of history, thisinterval of ten centuries, we should have Egypt expanding and contracting likean amoeba under a microscope, and we should see these various Semitic states ofthe Babylonians, the Assyrians, the Hittites and the Syrians coming and going,eating each other up and disgorging each other again. To the west of Asia Minorthere would be little aegean states like Lydia, whose capital was Sardis, andCaria. But after about 1200 B.C. and perhaps earlier, a new set of names wouldcome into the map of the ancient world from the north-east and from thenorth-west. These would be the names of certain barbaric tribes, armed with ironweapons and using horsechariots, who were becoming a great affliction to theaegean and Semitic civilizations on the northern borders. They all spokevariants of what once must have been the same language, Aryan.Round the north-east of the Black and Caspian Seas were coming the Medes andPersians. Confused with these in the records of the time were Scythians andSamatians. From north-east or north-west came the Armenians, from the north-westof the sea-barrier through the Balkan peninsula came Cimmerians, Phrygians andthe Hellenic tribes whom now we call the Greeks. They were raiders and robbersand plunderers of cities, these Ayrans, east and west alike. They were allkindred and similar peoples, hardy herdsmen who had taken to plunder. In theeast they were still only borderers and raiders, but in the west they weretaking cities and driving out the civilized aegean populations. The aegeanpeoples were so pressed that they were seeking new homes in lands beyond theAryan range. Some were seeking a settlement in the delta of the Nile and beingrepulsed by the Egyptians; some, the Etruscans, seem to have sailed from AsiaMinor to found a state in the forest wildernesses of middle Italy; some builtthemselves cities upon the south-east coasts of the Mediterranean and becamelater that people known in history as the Philistines.Of these Aryans who came thus rudely upon the scene of the ancient civilizationswe will tell more fully in a later section. Here we note simply all this stirand emigration amidst the area of the ancient civilizations, that was set up bythe swirl of the gradual and continuous advance of these Aryan barbarians out ofthe northern forests and wildernesses between 1600 and 600 B.C.And in a section to follow we must tell also of a little Semitic people, theHebrews, in the hills behind the Phoenician and Philistine coasts, who began tobe of significance in the world towards the end of this period. They produced aliterature of very great importance in subsequent history, a collection ofbooks, histories, poems, books of wisdom and prophetic works, the Hebrew Bible.In Mesopotamia and Egypt the coming of the Aryans did not cause fundamentalchanges until after 600 B.C. The flight of the aegeans before the Greeks andeven the destruction of Cnossos must have seemed a very remote disturbance toboth the citizens of Egypt and of Babylon. Dynasties came and went in thesecradle states of civilization, but the main tenor of human life went on, with aslow increase in refinement and complexity age by age. In Egypt the accumulatedmonuments of more ancient times-the pyramids were already in their thirdthousand of years and a show for visitors just as they are to-day-weresupplemented by fresh and splendid buildings, more particularly in the time ofthe seventeenth and nineteenth dynasties. The great temples at Karnak and Luxordate from this time. All the chief monuments of Nineveh, the great temples, thewinged bulls with human heads, the reliefs of kings and chariots and lion hunts,were done in these centuries between 1600 and 600 B.C., and this period alsocovers most of the splendours of Babylon.Both from Mesopotamia and Egypt we now have abundant public records, businessaccounts, stories, poetry and private correspondence. We know that life, forprosperous and influential people in such cities as Babylon and the EgyptianThebes, was already almost as refined and as luxurious as that of comfortableand prosperous people to-day. Such people lived an orderly and ceremonious lifein beautiful and beautifully furnished and decorated houses, wore richlydecorated clothing and lovely jewels; they had feasts and festivals, entertainedone another with music and dancing, were waited upon by highly trained servants,were cared for by doctors and dentists. They did not travel very much or veryfar, but boating excursions were a common summer pleasure both on the Nile andon the Euphrates. The beast of burthen was the ass; the horse was still usedonly in chariots for war and upon occasions of state. The mule was still noveland the camel, though it was known in Mesopotamia, had not been brought intoEgypt. And there were few utensils of iron; copper and bronze remained theprevailing metals. Fine linen and cotton fabrics were known as well as wool. Butthere was no silk yet. Glass was known and beautifully coloured, but glassthings were usually small. There was no clear glass and no optical use of glass.People had gold stoppings in their teeth but no spectacles on their noses.One odd contrast between the life of old Thebes or Babylon and modern life wasthe absence of coined money. Most trade was still done by barter. Babylon wasfinancially far ahead of Egypt. Gold and silver were used for exchange and keptin ingots; and there were bankers, before coinage, who stamped their names andthe weight on these lumps of precious metal. A merchant or traveller would carryprecious stones to sell to pay for his necessities. Most servants and workerswere slaves who were paid not money but in kind. As money came in slaverydeclined.A modern visitor to these crowning cities of the ancient world would have missedtwo very important articles of diet: there were no hens and no eggs. A Frenchcook would have found small joy in Babylon. These things came from the Eastsomewhere about the time of the last Assyrian empire.Religion like everything else had undergone great refinement. Human sacrificefor instance had long since disappeared; animals or bread dummies had beensubstituted for the victim. (But the Phoenicians and especially the citizens ofCarthage, their greatest settlement in Africa, were accused later of immolatinghuman beings.) When a great chief had died in the ancient days it had beencustomary to sacrifice his wives and slaves and break spear and bow at his tombso that he should not go unattended and unarmed in the spirit world. In Egyptthere survived of this dark tradition the pleasant custom of burying smallmodels of house and shop and servants and cattle with the dead, models that giveus to-day the liveliest realization of the safe and cultivated life of theseancient people, three thousand years and more ago.Such was the ancient world before the coming of the Aryans out of the northernforests and plains. In India and China there were parallel developments. In thegreat valleys of both these regions agricultural city states of brownish peopleswere growing up, but in India they do not seem to have advanced or coalesced sorapidly as the city states of Mesopotamia or Egypt. They were nearer the levelof the ancient Sumerians or of the Maya civilization of America. Chinese historyhas still to be modernized by Chinese scholars and cleared of much legendarymatter. Probably China at this time was in advance of India. Contemporary withthe seventeenth dynasty in Egypt, there was a dynasty of emperors in China, theShang dynasty, priest emperors over a loose-knit empire of subordinate kings.The chief duty of these early emperors was to perform the seasonal sacrifices.Beautiful bronze vessels from the time of the Shang dynasty still exist, andtheir beauty and workmanship compel us to recognize that many centuries ofcivilization must have preceded their manufacture.XIX. THE PRIMITIVE ARYANSFOUR thousand years ago, that is to say about 2000 B.C., central andsouth-eastern Europe and central Asia were probably warmer, moister and betterwooded than they are now. In these regions of the earth wandered a group oftribes mainly of the fair and blue-eyed Nordic race, sufficiently in touch withone another to speak merely variations of one common language from the Rhine tothe Caspian Sea. At that time they may not have been a very numerous people, andtheir existence was unsuspected by the Babylonians to whom Hammurabi was givinglaws, or by the already ancient and cultivated land of Egypt which was tastingin those days for the first time the bitterness of foreign conquest.These Nordic people were destined to play a very important part indeed in theworld's history. They were a people of the parklands and the forest clearings;they had no horses at first but they had cattle; when they wandered they puttheir tents and other gear on rough ox waggons; when they settled for a timethey may have made huts of wattle and mud. They burnt their important dead; theydid not bury them ceremoniously as the brunette peoples did. They put the ashesof their greater leaders in urns and then made a great circular mound aboutthem. These mounds are the \"round barrows\" that occur all over north Europe. Thebrunette people, their predecessors, did not burn their dead but buried them ina sitting position in elongated mounds; the \"long barrows.\"The Aryans raised crops of wheat, ploughing with oxen, but they did not settledown by their crops; they would reap and move on. They had bronze, and somewhenabout 1500 B.C. they acquired iron. They may have been the discoverers of ironsmelting. And somewhen vaguely about that time they also got the horse-which tobegin with they used only for draught purposes. Their social life did not centreupon a temple like that of the more settled people round the Mediterranean, andtheir chief men were leaders rather than priests. They had an aristocraticsocial order rather than a divine and regal order; from a very early stage theydistinguished certain families as leaderly and noble.They were a very vocal people. They enlivened their wanderings by feasts, atwhich there was much drunkenness and at which a special sort of man, the bards,would sing and recite. They had no writing until they had come into contact withcivilization, and the memories of these bards were their living literature. Thisuse of recited language as an entertainment did much to make it a fine andbeautiful instrument of expression, and to that no doubt the subsequentpredominance of the languages derived from Aryan is, in part, to be ascribed.Every Aryan people had its legendary history crystallized in bardic recitations,epics, sagas and vedas, as they were variously called.The social life of these people centred about the households of their leadingmen. The hall of the chief where they settled for a time was often a verycapacious timber building. There were no doubt huts for herds and outlying farmbuildings; but with most of the Aryan peoples this hall was the general centre,everyone went there to feast and hear the bards and take part in games anddiscussions. Cowsheds and stabling surrounded it. The chief and his wife and soforth would sleep on a dais or in an upper gallery; the commoner sort sleptabout anywhere, as people still do in Indian households. Except for weapons,ornaments, tools and suchlike personal possessions there was a sort ofpatriarchal communism in the tribe. The chief owned the cattle and grazing landsin the common interest; forest and rivers were the wild.This was the fashion of the people who were increasing and multiplying over thegreat spaces of central Europe and west central Asia during the growth of thegreat civilization of Mesopotamia and the Nile, and whom we find pressing uponthe heliolithic peoples everywhere in the second millennium before Christ. Theywere coming into France and Britain and into Spain. They pushed westward in twowaves. The first of these people who reached Britain and Ireland were armed withbronze weapons. They exterminated or subjugated the people who had made thegreat stone monuments of Carnac in Brittany and Stonehenge and Avebury inEngland. They reached Ireland. They are called the Goidelic Celts. The secondwave of a closely kindred people, perhaps intermixed with other racial elements,brought iron with it into Great Britain, and is known as the wave of BrythonicCelts. From them the Welsh derive their language.Kindred Celtic peoples were pressing southward into Spain and coming intocontact not only with the heliolithic Basque people who still occupied thecountry but with the Semitic Phoenician colonies of the sea coast. A closelyallied series of tribes, the Italians, were making their way down the still wildand wooded Italian peninsula. They did not always conquer. In the eighth centuryB.C. Rome appears in history, a trading town on the Tiber, inhabited by AryanLatins but under the rule of Etruscan nobles and kings.At the other extremity of the Aryan range there was a similar progress southwardof similar tribes. Aryan peoples, speaking Sanskrit, had come down through thewestern passes into North India long before 1000 B.C. There they came intocontact with a primordial brunette civilization, the Dravidian civilization, andlearnt much from it. Other Aryan tribes seem to have spread over the mountainmasses of Central Asia far to the east of the present range of such peoples. InEastern Turkestan there are still fair, blue-eyed Nordic tribes, but now theyspeak Mongolian tongues.Between the Black and Caspian Seas the ancient Hittites had been submerged and\"Aryanized\" by the Armenians before 1000 B.C., and the Assyrians and Babylonianswere already aware of a new and formidable fighting barbarism on thenorth-eastern frontiers, a group of tribes amidst which the Scythians, the Medesand the Persians remain as outstanding names.But it was through the Balkan peninsula that Aryan tribes made their first heavythrust into the heart of the old-world civilization. They were already comingsouthward and crossing into Asia Minor many centuries before 1000 B.C. Firstcame a group of tribes of whom the Phrygians were the most conspicuous, and thenin succession the aeolic, the Ionic and the Dorian Greeks. By 1000 B.C. they hadwiped out the ancient aegean civilization both in the mainland of Greece and inmost of the Greek islands; the cities of Mycenae and Tiryns were obliterated andCnossos was nearly forgotten. The Greeks had taken to the sea before 1000 A.D.,they had settled in Crete and Rhodes, and they were founding colonies in Sicilyand the south of Italy after the fashion of the Phoenician trading cities thatwere dotted along the Mediterranean coasts.So it was, while Tiglath Pileser III and Sargon II and Sardanapalus were rulingin Assyria and fighting with Babylonia and Syria and Egypt, the Aryan peopleswere learning the methods of civilization and making it over for their ownpurposes in Italy and Greece and north Persia. The theme of history from theninth century B.C. onward for six centuries is the story of how these Aryanpeoples grew to power and enterprise and how at last they subjugated the wholeAncient World, Semitic, aegean and Egyptian alike. In form the Aryan peopleswere altogether victorious; but the struggle of Aryan, Semitic and Egyptianideas and methods was continued long after the sceptre was in Aryan hands. It isindeed a struggle that goes on through all the rest of history and still in amanner continues to this day.XX. THE LAST BABYLONIAN EMPIRE AND THE EMPIRE OF DARIUS IWE have already mentioned how Assyria became a great military power underTiglath Pileser III and under the usurper Sargon II. Sargon was not this man'soriginal name; he adopted it to flatter the conquered Babylonians by remindingthem of that ancient founder of the Akkadian Empire, Sargon I, two thousandyears before his time. Babylon, for all that it was a conquered city, was ofgreater population and importance than Nineveh, and its great god Bel Marduk andits traders and priests had to be treated politely. In Mesopotamia in the eighthcentury B.C. we are already far beyond the barbaric days when the capture of atown meant loot and massacre. Conquerors sought to propitiate and win theconquered. For a century and a half after Sargon the new Assyrian empire enduredand, as we have noted, Assurbanipal (Sardanapalus) held at least lower Egypt.But the power and solidarity of Assyria waned rapidly. Egypt by an effort threwoff the foreigner under a Pharoah Psammetichus I, and under Necho II attempted awar of conquest in Syria. By that time Assyria was grappling with foes nearer athand, and could make but a poor resistance. A Semitic people from south-eastMesopotamia, the Chaldeans, combined with Aryan Medes and Persians from thenorth-east against Nineveh, and in 606 B.C.-for now we are coming down to exactchronology-took that city.There was a division of the spoils of Assyria. A Median Empire was set up in thenorth under Cyaxares. It included Nineveh, and its capital was Ecbatana.Eastward it reached to the borders of India. To the south of this in a greatcrescent was a new Chaldean Empire, the Second Babylonian Empire, which rose toa very great degree of wealth and power under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar theGreat (the Nebuchadnezzar of the Bible). The last great days, the greatest daysof all, for Babylon began. For a time the two Empires remained at peace, and thedaughter of Nebuchadnezzar was married to Cyaxares.Meanwhile Necho II was pursuing his easy conquests in Syria. He had defeated andslain King Josiah of Judah, a small country of which there is more to tellpresently, at the battle of Megiddo in 608 B.C., and he pushed on to theEuphrates to encounter not a decadent Assyria but a renascent Babylonia. TheChaldeans dealt very vigorously with the Egyptians. Necho was routed and drivenback to Egypt, and the Babylonian frontier pushed down to the ancient Egyptianboundaries.From 606 until 539 B.C. the Second Babylonian Empire flourished insecurely. Itflourished so long as it kept the peace with the stronger, hardier Median Empireto the north. And during these sixty-seven years not only life but learningflourished in the ancient city.Even under the Assyrian monarchs and especially under Sardanapalus, Babylon hadbeen a scene of great intellectual activity. Sardanapalus, though an Assyrian,had been quite Babylonized. He made a library, a library not of paper but of theclay tablets that were used for writing in Mesopotamia since early Sumeriandays. His collection has been unearthed and is perhaps the most precious storeof historical material in the world. The last of the Chaldean line of Babylonianmonarchs, Nabonidus, had even keener literary tastes. He patronized antiquarianresearches, and when a date was worked out by his investigators for theaccession of Sargon I he commemorated the fact by inscriptions. But there weremany signs of disunion in his empire, and he sought to centralize it by bringinga number of the various local gods to Babylon and setting up temples to themthere. This device was to be practised quite successfully by the Romans in latertimes, but in Babylon it roused the jealousy of the powerful priesthood of BelMarduk, the dominant god of the Babylonians. They cast about for a possiblealternative to Nabonidus and found it in Cyrus the Persian, the ruler of theadjacent Median Empire. Cyrus had already distinguished himself by conqueringCroesus, the rich king of Lydia in Eastern Asia Minor. He came up againstBabylon, there was a battle outside the walls, and the gates of the city wereopened to him (538 B.C.). His soldiers entered the city without fighting. Thecrown prince Belshazzar, the son of Nabonidus, was feasting, the Bible relates,when a hand appeared and wrote in letters of fire upon the wall these mysticalwords: \"Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin,\" which was interpreted by the prophetDaniel, whom he summoned to read the riddle, as \"God has numbered thy kingdomand finished it; thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting and thykingdom is given to the Medes and Persians.\" Possibly the priests of Bel Mardukknew something about that writing on the wall. Belshazzar was killed that night,says the Bible. Nabonidus was taken prisoner, and the occupation of the city wasso peaceful that the services of Bel Marduk continued without intermission.Thus it was the Babylonian and Median empires were united. Cambyses, the son ofCyrus, subjugated Egypt. Cambyses went mad and was accidentally killed, and waspresently succeeded by Darius the Mede, Darius I, the son of Hystaspes, one ofthe chief councillors of Cyrus.The Persian Empire of Darius I, the first of the new Aryan empires in the seatof the old civilizations, was the greatest empire the world had hitherto seen.It included all Asia Minor and Syria, all the old Assyrian and Babylonianempires, Egypt, the Caucasus and Caspian regions, Media, Persia, and it extendedinto India as far as the Indus. Such an empire was possible because the horseand rider and the chariot and the made-road had now been brought into the world.Hitherto the ass and ox and the camel for desert use had afforded the swiftestmethod of transport. Great arterial roads were made by the Persian rulers tohold their new empire, and post horses were always in waiting for the imperialmessenger or the traveller with an official permit. Moreover the world was nowbeginning to use coined money, which greatly facilitated trade and intercourse.But the capital of this vast empire was no longer Babylon. In the long run thepriesthood of Bel Marduk gained nothing by their treason. Babylon though stillimportant was now a declining city, and the great cities of the new empire werePersepolis and Susa and Ecbatana. The capital was Susa. Nineveh was alreadyabandoned and sinking into ruins.XXI. THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE JEWSAND now we can tell of the Hebrews, a Semitic people, not so important in theirown time as in their influence upon the later history of the world. They weresettled in Judea long before 1000 B.C., and their capital city after that timewas Jerusalem. Their story is interwoven with that of the great empires oneither side of them, Egypt to the south and the changing empires of Syria,Assyria and Babylon to the north. Their country was an inevitable high roadbetween these latter powers and Egypt.Their importance in the world is due to the fact that they produced a writtenliterature, a world history, a collection of laws, chronicles, psalms, books ofwisdom, poetry and fiction and political utterances which became at last whatChristians know as the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible. This literature appearsin history in the fourth or fifth century B.C.Probably this literature was first put together in Babylon. We have already toldhow the Pharaoh, Necho II, invaded the Assyrian Empire while Assyria wasfighting for life against Medes, Persians and Chaldeans. Josiah King of Judahopposed him, and was defeated and slain at Megiddo (608 B.C.). Judah became atributary to Egypt, and when Nebuchadnezzar the Great, the new Chaldean king inBabylon, rolled back Necho into Egypt, he attempted to manage Judah by settingup puppet kings in Jerusalem. The experiment failed, the people massacred hisBabylonian officials, and he then determined to break up this little statealtogether, which had long been playing off Egypt against the northern empire.Jerusalem was sacked and burnt, and the remnant of the people was carried offcaptive to Babylon.There they remained until Cyrus took Babylon (538 B.C.). He then collected themtogether and sent them back to resettle their country and rebuild the walls andtemple of Jerusalem.Before that time the Jews do not seem to have been a very civilized or unitedpeople. Probably only a very few of them could read or write. In their ownhistory one never hears of the early books of the Bible being read; the firstmention of a book is in the time of Josiah. The Babylonian captivity civilizedthem and consolidated them. They returned aware of their own literature, anacutely self-conscious and political people.Their Bible at that time seems to have consisted only of the Pentateuch, that isto say the first five books of the Old Testament as we know it. In addition, asseparate books they already had many of the other books that have since beenincorporated with the Pentateuch into the present Hebrew Bible, Chronicles, thePsalms and Proverbs for example.The accounts of the Creation of the World, of Adam and Eve and of the Flood,with which the Bible begins, run closely parallel with similar Babylonianlegends; they seem to have been part of the common beliefs of all the Semeticpeoples. So too the stories of Moses and of Samson have Sumerian and Babylonianparallels. But with the story of Abraham and onward begins something morespecial to the Jewish race.Abraham may have lived as early as the days of Hammurabi in Babylon. He was apatriarchal Semitic nomad. To the book of Genesis the reader must go for thestory of his wanderings and for the stories of his sons and grandchildren andhow they became captive in the Land of Egypt. He travelled through Canaan, andthe God of Abraham, says the Bible story, promised this smiling land ofprosperous cities to him and to his children.And after a long sojourn in Egypt and after fifty years of wandering in thewilderness under the leadership of Moses, the children of Abraham, grown now toa host of twelve tribes, invaded the land of Canaan from the Arabian deserts tothe East. They may have done this somewhen between 1600 B.C. and 1300 B.C.;there are no Egyptian records of Moses nor of Canaan at this time to help outthe story. But at any rate they did not succeed in conquering any more than thehilly backgrounds of the promised land. The coast was now in the hands, not ofthe Canaanites but of newcomers, those aegean peoples, the Philistines; andtheir cities, Gaza, Gath, Ashdod, Ascalon and Joppa successfully withstood theHebrew attack. For many generations the children of Abraham remained an obscurepeople of the hilly back country engaged in incessant bickerings with thePhilistines and with the kindred tribes about them, the Moabites, the Midianitesand so forth. The reader will find in the book of Judges a record of theirstruggles and disasters during this period. For very largely it is a record ofdisasters and failures frankly told.For most of this period the Hebrews were ruled, so far as there was any ruleamong them, by priestly judges selected by the elders of the people, but at lastsomewhen towards 1000 B.C. they chose themselves a king, Saul, to lead them inbattle. But Saul's leading was no great improvement upon the leading of theJudges; he perished under the hail of Philistine arrows at the battle of MountGilboa, his armour went into the temple of the Philistine Venus, and his bodywas nailed to the walls of Beth-shan.His successor David was more successful and more politic. With David dawned theonly period of prosperity the Hebrew peoples were ever to know. It was based ona close alliance with the Phoenician city of Tyre, whose King Hiram seems tohave been a man of very great intelligence and enterprise. He wished to secure atrade route to the Red Sea through the Hebrew hill country. Normally Phoeniciantrade went to the Red Sea by Egypt, but Egypt was in a state of profounddisorder at this time; there may have been other obstructions to Phoeniciantrade along this line, and at any rate Hiram established the very closestrelations both with David and with his son and successor Solomon. Under Hiram'sauspices the walls, palace and temple of Jerusalem arose, and in return Hirambuilt and launched his ships on the Red Sea. A very considerable trade passednorthward and southward through Jerusalem. And Solomon achieved a prosperity andmagnificence unprecedented in the experience of his people. He was even given adaughter of Pharaoh in marriage.But it is well to keep the proportion of things in mind. At the climax of hisglories Solomon was only a little subordinate king in a little city. His powerwas so transitory that within a few years of his death, Shishak the firstPharaoh of the twenty-second dynasty, had taken Jerusalem and looted most of hissplendours. The account of Solomon's magnificence given in the books of Kingsand Chronicles is questioned by many critics. They say that it was added to andexaggerated by the patriotic pride of later writers. But the Bible account readcarefully is not so overwhelming as it appears at the first reading. Solomon'stemple, if one works out the measurements, would go inside a small suburbanchurch, and his fourteen hundred chariots cease to impress us when we learn froman Assyrian monument that his successor Ahab sent a contingent of two thousandto the Assyrian army. It is also plainly manifest from the Bible narrative thatSolomon spent himself in display and overtaxed and overworked his people. At hisdeath the northern part of his kingdom broke off from Jerusalem and became theindependent kingdom of Israel. Jerusalem remained the capital city of Judah.The prosperity of the Hebrew people was short-lived. Hiram died, and the help ofTyre ceased to strengthen Jerusalem. Egypt grew strong again. The history of thekings of Israel and the kings of Judah becomes a history of two little statesground between, first, Syria, then Assyria and then Babylon to the north andEgypt to the south. It is a tale of disasters and of deliverances that onlydelayed disaster. It is a tale of barbaric kings ruling a barbaric people. In721 B.C. the kingdom of Israel was swept away into captivity by the Assyriansand its people utterly lost to history. Judah struggled on until in 604 B.C., aswe have told, it shared the fate of Israel. There may be details open tocriticism in the Bible story of Hebrew history from the days of the Judgesonward, but on the whole it is evidently a true story which squares with allthat has been learnt in the excavation of Egypt and Assyria and Babylon duringthe past century.It was in Babylon that the Hebrew people got their history together and evolvedtheir tradition. The people who came back to Jerusalem at the command of Cyruswere a very different people in spirit and knowledge from those who had goneinto captivity. They had learnt civilization. In the development of theirpeculiar character a very great part was played by certain men, a new sort ofmen, the Prophets, to whom we must now direct our attention. These Prophets markthe appearance of new and remarkable forces in the steady development of humansociety.XXII. PRIESTS AND PROPHETS IN JUDEATHE FALL of Assyria and Babylon were only the first of a series of disastersthat were to happen to the Semitic peoples. In the seventh century B.C. it wouldhave seemed as though the whole civilized world was to be dominated by Semiticrulers. They ruled the great Assyrian empire and they had conquered Egypt;Assyria, Babylon, Syria were all Semitic, speaking languages that were mutuallyintelligible. The trade of the world was in Semitic hands. Tyre, Sidon, thegreat mother cities of the Phoenician coast, had thrown out colonies that grewat last to even greater proportion in Spain, Sicily and Africa. Carthage,founded before 800 B.C., had risen to a population of more than a million. Itwas for a time the greatest city on earth. Its ships went to Britain and outinto the Atlantic. They may have reached Madeira. We have already noted howHiram co-operated with Solomon to build ships on the Red Sea for the Arabian andperhaps for the Indian trade. In the time of the Pharaoh Necho, a Phoenicianexpedition sailed completely round Africa.At that time the Aryan peoples were still barbarians. Only the Greeks werereconstructing a new civilization of the ruins of the one they had destroyed,and the Medes were becoming \"formidable,\" as an Assyrian inscription calls them,in central Asia. In 800 B.C. no one could have prophesied that before the thirdcentury B.C. every trace of Semitic dominion would be wiped out byAryan-speaking conquerors, and that everywhere the Semitic peoples would besubjects or tributaries or scattered altogether. Everywhere except in thenorthern deserts of Arabia, where the Bedouin adhered steadily to the nomadicway of life, the ancient way of life of the Semites before Sargon I and hisAkkadians went down to conquer Sumeria. But the Arab Bedouin were neverconquered by Aryan masters.Now of all these civilized Semites who were beaten and overrun in these fiveeventful centuries one people only held together and clung to its ancienttraditions and that was little people, the Jews, who were sent back to buildtheir city of Jerusalem by Cyrus the Persian. And they were able to do this,because they had got together this literature of theirs, their Bible, inBabylon. It is not so much the Jews who made the Bible as the Bible which madethe Jews. Running through this Bible were certain ideas, different from theideas of the people about them, very stimulating and sustaining ideas, to whichthey were destined to cling through five and twenty centuries of hardship,adventure and oppression.Foremost of these Jewish ideas was this, that their God was invisible andremote, an invisible God in a temple not made with hands, a Lord ofRighteousness throughout the earth. All other peoples had national gods embodiedin images that lived in temples. If the image was smashed and the temple razed,presently that god died out. But this was a new idea, this God of the Jews, inthe heavens, high above priests and sacrifices. And this God of Abraham, theJews believed, had chosen them to be his peculiar people, to restore Jerusalemand make it the capital of Righteousness in the World. They were a peopleexalted by their sense of a common destiny. This belief saturated them all whenthey returned to Jerusalem after the captivity in Babylon.Is it any miracle that in their days of overthrow and subjugation manyBabylonians and Syrians and so forth and later on many Phoenicians, speakingpractically the same language and having endless customs, habits, tastes andtraditions in common, should be attracted by this inspiring cult and should seekto share in its fellowship and its promise? After the fall of Tyre, Sidon,Carthage and the Spanish Phoenician cities, the Phoenicians suddenly vanish fromhistory; and as suddenly we find, not simply in Jerusalem but in Spain, Africa,Egypt, Arabia, the East, wherever the Phoenicians had set their feet,communities of Jews. And they were all held together by the Bible and by thereading of the Bible. Jerusalem was from the first only their nominal capital;their real city was this book of books. This is a new sort of thing in history.It is something of which the seeds were sown long before, when the Sumerians andEgyptians began to turn their hieroglyphics into writing. The Jews were a newthing, a people without a king and presently without a temple (for as we shalltell Jerusalem itself was broken up in 70 A.D.), held together and consolidatedout of heterogeneous elements by nothing but the power of the written word.And this mental welding of the Jews was neither planned nor foreseen nor done byeither priests or statesmen. Not only a new kind of community but a new kind ofman comes into history with the development of the Jews. In the days of Solomonthe Hebrews looked like becoming a little people just like any other littlepeople of that time clustering around court and temple, ruled by the wisdom ofthe priest and led by the ambition of the king. But already, the reader maylearn from the Bible, this new sort of man of which we speak, the Prophet, wasin evidence.As troubles thicken round the divided Hebrews the importance of these Prophetsincreases.What were these Prophets? They were men of the most diverse origins. The ProphetEzekiel was of the priestly caste and the Prophet Amos wore the goatskin mantleof a shepherd, but all had this in common, that they gave allegiance to no onebut to the God of Righteousness and that they spoke directly to the people. Theycame without licence or consecration. \"Now the word of the Lord came unto me;\"that was the formula. They were intensely political. They exhorted the peopleagainst Egypt, \"that broken reed,\" or against Assyria or Babylon; they denouncedthe indolence of the priestly order or the flagrant sins of the King. Some ofthem turned their attention to what we should now call \"social reform.\" The richwere \"grinding the faces of the poor,\" the luxurious were consuming thechildren's bread; wealthy people made friends with and imitated the splendoursand vices of foreigners; and this was hateful to Jehovah, the God of Abraham,who would certainly punish this land.These fulminations were written down and preserved and studied. They wentwherever the Jews went, and wherever they went they spread a new religiousspirit. They carried the common man past priest and temple, past court and kingand brought him face to face with the Rule of Righteousness. That is theirsupreme importance in the history of mankind. In the great utterances of Isaiahthe prophetic voice rises to a pitch of splendid anticipation and foreshadowsthe whole earth united and at peace under one God. Therein the Jewish propheciesculminate.All the Prophets did not speak in this fashion, and the intelligent reader ofthe prophetic books will find much hate in them, much prejudice, and much thatwill remind him of the propaganda pamphlets of the present time. Nevertheless itis the Hebrew Prophets of the period round and about the Babylonian captivitywho mark the appearance of a new power in the world, the power of individualmoral appeal, of an appeal to the free conscience of mankind against the fetishsacrifices and slavish loyalties that had hitherto bridled and harnessed ourrace.XXIII. THE GREEKSNOW while after Solomon (whose reign was probably about 960 B.C.) the dividedkingdoms of Israel and Judah were suffering destruction and deportation, andwhile the Jewish people were developing their tradition in captivity in Babylon,another great power over the human mind, the Greek tradition, was also arising.While the Hebrew prophets were working out a new sense of direct moralresponsibility between the people and an eternal and universal God of Right, theGreek philosophers were training the human mind in a new method and spirit ofintellectual adventure.The Greek tribes as we have told were a branch of the Aryan-speaking stem. Theyhad come down among the aegean cities and islands some centuries before 1000B.C. They were probably already in southward movement before the PharaohThothmes hunted his first elephants beyond the conquered Euphrates. For in thosedays there were elephants in Mesopotamia and lions in Greece.It is possible that it was a Greek raid that burnt Cnossos, but there are noGreek legends of such a victory though there are stories of Minos and his palace(the Labyrinth) and of the skill of the Cretan artificers.Like most of the Aryans these Greeks had singers and reciters whose performanceswere an important social link, and these handed down from the barbaricbeginnings of their people two great epics, the Iliad, telling how a league ofGreek tribes besieged and took and sacked the town of Troy in Asia Minor, andthe Odyssey, being a long adventure story of the return of the sage captain,Odysseus, from Troy to his own island. These epics were written down somewhen inthe eighth or seventh century B.C., when the Greeks had acquired the use of analphabet from their more civilized neighbours, but they are supposed to havebeen in existence very much earlier. Formerly they were ascribed to a particularblind bard, Homer, who was supposed to have sat down and composed them as Miltoncomposed Paradise Lost. Whether there really was such a poet, whether hecomposed or only wrote down and polished these epics and so forth, is afavourite quarrelling ground for the erudite. We need not concern ourselves withsuch bickerings here. The thing that matters from our point of view is that theGreeks were in possession of their epics in the eighth century B.C., and thatthey were a common possession and a link between their various tribes, givingthem a sense of fellowship as against the outer barbarians. They were a group ofkindred peoples linked by the spoken and afterwards by the written word, andsharing common ideals of courage and behaviour.The epics showed the Greeks a barbaric people without iron, without writing, andstill not living in cities. They seem to have lived at first in open villages ofhuts around the halls of their chiefs outside the ruins of the aegean citiesthey had destroyed. Then they began to wall their cities and to adopt the ideaof temples from the people they had conquered. It has been said that the citiesof the primitive civilizations grew up about the altar of some tribal god, andthat the wall was added; in the cities of the Greeks the wall preceded thetemple. They began to trade and send out colonies. By the seventh century B.C. anew series of cities had grown up in the valleys and islands of Greece,forgetful of the aegean cities and civilization that had preceded them; Athens,Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Samos, Miletus among the chief. There were alreadyGreek settlements along the coast of the Black Sea and in Italy and Sicily. Theheel and toe of Italy was called Magna Graecia. Marseilles was a Greek townestablished on the site of an earlier Phoenician colony.Now countries which are great plains or which have as a chief means of transportsome great river like the Euphrates or Nile tend to become united under somecommon rule. The cities of Egypt and the cities of Sumeria, for example, rantogether under one system of government. But the Greek peoples were cut up amongislands and mountain valleys; both Greece and Magna Graecia are verymountainous; and the tendency was all the other way. When the Greeks come intohistory they are divided up into a number of little states which showed no signsof coalescence. They are different even in race. Some consist chiefly ofcitizens of this or that Greek tribe, Ionic, aeolian or Doric; some have amingled population of Greeks and descendants of the pre-Greek \"Mediterranean\"folk; some have an unmixed free citizenship of Greeks lording it over anenslaved conquered population like the \"Helots\" in Sparta. In some the oldleaderly Aryan families have become a close aristocracy; in some there is ademocracy of all the Aryan citizens; in some there are elected or evenhereditary kings, in some usurpers or tyrants.And the same geographical conditions that kept the Greek states divided andvarious, kept them small. The largest states were smaller than many Englishcounties, and it is doubtful if the population of any of their cities everexceeded a third of a million. Few came up even to 50,000. There were unions ofinterest and sympathy but no coalescences. Cities made leagues and alliances astrade increased, and small cities put themselves under the protection of greatones. Yet all Greece was held together in a certain community of feeling by twothings, by the epics and by the custom of taking part every fourth year in theathletic contests at Olympia. This did not prevent wars and feuds, but itmitigated something of the savagery of war between them, and a truce protectedall travellers to and from the games. As time went on the sentiment of a commonheritage grew and the number of states participating in the Olympic gamesincreased until at last not only Greeks but competitors from the closely kindredcountries of Epirus and Macedonia to the north were admitted.The Greek cities grew in trade and importance, and the quality of theircivilization rose steadily in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. Their sociallife differed in many interesting points from the social life of the aegean andriver valley civilizations. They had splendid temples but the priesthood was notthe great traditional body it was in the cities of the older world, therepository of all knowledge, the storehouse of ideas. They had leaders and noblefamilies, but no quasi-divine monarch surrounded by an elaborately organizedcourt. Rather their organization was aristocratic, with leading families whichkept each other in order. Even their so-called \"democracies\" were aristocratic;every citizen had a share in public affairs and came to the assembly in ademocracy, but everybody was not a citizen. The Greek democracies were not likeour modern \"democracies\" in which everyone has a vote. Many of the Greekdemocracies had a few hundred or a few thousand citizens and then many thousandsof slaves, freedmen and so forth, with no share in public affairs. Generally inGreece affairs were in the hands of a community of substantial men. Their kingsand their tyrants alike were just men set in front of other men or usurping aleadership; they were not quasi-divine overmen like Pharaoh or Minos or themonarchs of Mesopotamia. Both thought and government therefore had a freedomunder Greek conditions such as they had known in none of the oldercivilizations. The Greeks had brought down into cities the individualism, thepersonal initiative of the wandering life of the northern parklands. They werethe first republicans of importance in history.And we find that as they emerge from a condition of barbaric warfare a new thingbecomes apparent in their intellectual life. We find men who are not priestsseeking and recording knowledge and enquiring into the mysteries of life andbeing, in a way that has hitherto been the sublime privilege of priesthood orthe presumptuous amusement of kings. We find already in the sixth centuryB.C.—perhaps while Isaiah was still prophesying in Babylon—such men as Thalesand Anaximander of Miletus and Heraclitus of Ephesus, who were what we shouldnow call independent gentlemen, giving their minds to shrewd questionings of theworld in which we live, asking what its real nature was, whence it came and whatits destiny might be, and refusing all ready-made or evasive answers. Of thesequestionings of the universe by the Greek mind, we shall have more to say alittle later in this history. These Greek enquirers who begin to be remarkablein the sixth century B.C. are the first philosophers, the first \"wisdom-lovers,\"in the world.And it may be noted here how important a century this sixth century B.C. was inthe history of humanity. For not only were these Greek philosophers beginningthe research for clear ideas about this universe and man's place in it andIsaiah carrying Jewish prophecy to its sublimest levels, but as we shall telllater Gautama Buddha was then teaching in India and Confucius and Lao Tse inChina. From Athens to the Pacific the human mind was astir.XXIV. THE WARS OF THE GREEKS AND PERSIANSWHILE the Greeks in the cities in Greece, South Italy and Asia Minor wereembarking upon free intellectual enquiry and while in Babylon and Jerusalem thelast of the Hebrew prophets were creating a free conscience for mankind, twoadventurous Aryan peoples, the Medes and the Persians, were in possession of thecivilization of the ancient world and were making a great empire, the Persianempire, which was far larger in extent than any empire the world had seenhitherto. Under Cyrus, Babylon and the rich and ancient civilization of Lydiahad been added to the Persian rule; the Phoenician cities of the Levant and allthe Greek cities in Asia Minor had been made tributary, Cambyses had subjectedEgypt, and Darius I, the Mede, the third of the Persian rulers (521 B.C.), foundhimself monarch as it seemed of all the world. His couriers rode with hisdecrees from the Dardanelles to the Indus and from Upper Egypt to Central Asia.The Greeks in Europe, it is true, Italy, Carthage, Sicily and the SpanishPhoenician settlements, were not under the Persian Peace; but they treated itwith respect and the only people who gave any serious trouble were the oldparent hordes of Nordic people in South Russia and Central Asia, the Scythians,who raided the northern and north-eastern borders.Of course the population of this great Persian empire was not a population ofPersians. The Persians were only the small conquering minority of this enormousrealm. The rest of the population was what it had been before the Persians camefrom time immemorial, only that Persian was the administrative language. Tradeand finance were still largely Semitic, Tyre and Sidon as of old were the greatMediterranean ports and Semitic shipping plied upon the seas. But many of theseSemitic merchants and business people as they went from place to place alreadyfound a sympathetic and convenient common history in the Hebrew tradition andthe Hebrew scriptures. A new element which was increasing rapidly in this empirewas the Greek element. The Greeks were becoming serious rivals to the Semitesupon the sea, and their detached and vigorous intelligence made them useful andunprejudiced officials.It was on account of the Scythians that Darius I invaded Europe. He wanted toreach South Russia, the homeland of the Scythian horsemen. He crossed theBosphorus with a great army and marched through Bulgaria to the Danube, crossedthis by a bridge of boats and pushed far northward. His army suffered terribly.It was largely an infantry force and the mounted Scythians rode all round it,cut off its supplies, destroyed any stragglers and never came to a pitchedbattle. Darius was forced into an inglorious retreat.He returned himself to Susa but he left an army in Thrace and Macedonia, andMacedonia submitted to Darius. Insurrections of the Greek cities in Asiafollowed this failure, and the European Greeks were drawn into the contest.Darius resolved upon the subjugation of the Greeks in Europe. With thePhoenician fleet at his disposal he was able to subdue one island after another,and finally in 490 B.C. he made his main attack upon Athens. A considerableArmada sailed from the ports of Asia Minor and the eastern Mediterranean, andthe expedition landed its troops at Marathon to the north of Athens. There theywere met and signally defeated by the Athenians.An extraordinary thing happened at this time. The bitterest rival of Athens inGreece was Sparta, but now Athens appealed to Sparta, sending a herald, a swiftrunner, imploring the Spartans not to let Greeks become slaves to barbarians.This runner (the prototype of all \"Marathon\" runners) did over a hundred milesof broken country in less than two days. The Spartans responded promptly andgenerously; but when, in three days, the Spartan force reached Athens, there wasnothing for it to do but to view the battlefield and the bodies of the defeatedPersian soldiers. The Persian fleet had returned to Asia. So ended the firstPersian attack on Greece.The next was much more impressive. Darius died soon after the news of his defeatat Marathon reached him, and for four years his son and successor, Xerxes,prepared a host to crush the Greeks. For a time terror united all the Greeks.The army of Xerxes was certainly the greatest that had hitherto been assembledin the world. It was a huge assembly of discordant elements. It crossed theDardanelles, 480 B.C., by a bridge of boats; and along the coast as it advancedmoved an equally miscellaneous fleet carrying supplies. At the narrow pass ofThermopylae a small force of 1400 men under the Spartan Leonidas resisted thismultitude, and after a fight of unsurpassed heroism was completely destroyed.Every man was killed. But the losses they inflicted upon the Persians wereenormous, and the army of Xerxes pushed on to Thebes and Athens in a chastenedmood. Thebes surrendered and made terms. The Athenians abandoned their city andit was burnt.Greece seemed in the hands of the conqueror, but again came victory against theodds and all expectations. The Greek fleet, though not a third the size of thePersian, assailed it in the bay of Salamis and destroyed it. Xerxes foundhimself and his immense army cut off from supplies and his heart failed him. Heretreated to Asia with one half of his army, leaving the rest to be defeated atPlatea (479 B.C.) what time the remnants of the Persian fleet were hunted downby the Greeks and destroyed at Mycalae in Asia Minor.The Persian danger was at an end. Most of the Greek cities in Asia became free.All this is told in great detail and with much picturesqueness in the first ofwritten histories, the History of Herodotus. This Herodotus was born about 484B.C. in the Ionian city of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor, and he visited Babylonand Egypt in his search for exact particulars. From Mycalae onward Persia sankinto a confusion of dynastic troubles. Xerxes was murdered in 465 B.C. andrebellions in Egypt, Syria and Media broke up the brief order of that mightyrealm. The history of Herodotus lays stress on the weakness of Persia. Thishistory is indeed what we should now call propaganda-propaganda for Greece tounite and conquer Persia. Herodotus makes one character, Aristagoras, go to theSpartans with a map of the known world and say to them: \"These Barbarians arenot valiant in fight. You on the other hand have now attained the utmost skillin war . No other nations in the world have what they possess: gold, silver,bronze, embroidered garments, beasts and slaves. All this you might have foryourselves, if you so desired.\"XXV. THE SPLENDOUR OF GREECETHE CENTURY and a half that followed the defeat of Persia was one of very greatsplendour for the Greek civilization. True that Greece was torn by a desperatestruggle for ascendancy between Athens, Sparta and other states (thePeloponnesian War 431 to 404 B.C.) and that in 338 B.C. the Macedonians becamevirtually masters of Greece; nevertheless during this period the thought and thecreative and artistic impulse of the Greeks rose to levels that made theirachievement a lamp to mankind for all the rest of history.The head and centre of this mental activity was Athens. For over thirty years(466 to 428 B.C.) Athens was dominated by a man of great vigour and liberalityof mind, Pericles, who set himself to rebuild the city from the ashes to whichthe Persians had reduced it. The beautiful ruins that still glorify Athensto-day are chiefly the remains of this great effort. And he did not simplyrebuild a material Athens. He rebuilt Athens intellectually. He gathered abouthim not only architects and sculptors but poets, dramatists, philosophers andteachers. Herodotus came to Athens to recite his history (438 B.C.). Anaxagorascame with the beginnings of a scientific description of the sun and stars.aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides one after the other carried the Greek dramato its highest levels of beauty and nobility.The impetus Pericles gave to the intellectual life of Athens lived on after hisdeath, and in spite of the fact that the peace of Greece was now broken by thePeloponnesian War and a long and wasteful struggle for \"ascendancy\" wasbeginning. Indeed the darkling of the political horizon seems for a time to havequickened rather than discouraged men's minds.Already long before the time of Pericles the peculiar freedom of Greekinstitutions had given great importance to skill in discussion. Decision restedneither with king nor with priest but in the assemblies of the people or ofleading men. Eloquence and able argument became very desirable accomplishmentstherefore, and a class of teachers arose, the Sophists, who undertook tostrengthen young men in these arts. But one cannot reason without matter, andknowledge followed in the wake of speech. The activities and rivalries of theseSophists led very naturally to an acute examination of style, of methods ofthought and of the validity of arguments. When Pericles died a certain Socrateswas becoming prominent as an able and destructive critic of bad argument-andmuch of the teaching of the Sophists was bad argument. A group of brilliantyoung men gathered about Socrates. In the end Socrates was executed fordisturbing people's minds (399 B.C.), he was condemned after the dignifiedfashion of the Athens of those days to drink in his own house and among his ownfriends a poisonous draught made from hemlock, but the disturbance of people'sminds went on in spite of his condemnation. His young men carried on histeaching.Chief among these young men was Plato (427 to 347 B.C.) who presently began toteach philosophy in the grove of the Academy. His teaching fell into two maindivisions, an examination of the foundations and methods of human thinking andan examination of political institutions. He was the first man to write aUtopia, that is to say the plan of a community different from and better thanany existing community. This shows an altogether unprecedented boldness in thehuman mind which had hitherto accepted social traditions and usages withscarcely a question. Plato said plainly to mankind: \"Most of the social andpolitical ills from which you suffer are under your control, given only the willand courage to change them. You can live in another and a wiser fashion if youchoose to think it out and work it out. You are not awake to your own power.\"That is a high adventurous teaching that has still to soak in to the commonintelligence of our race. One of his earliest works was the Republic, a dream ofa communist aristocracy; his last unfinished work was the Laws, a scheme ofregulation for another such Utopian state.The criticism of methods of thinking and methods of government was carried onafter Plato's death by Aristotle, who had been his pupil and who taught in theLyceum. Aristotle came from the city of Stagira in Macedonia, and his father wascourt physician to the Macedonian king. For a time Aristotle was tutor toAlexander, the king's son, who was destined to achieve very great things ofwhich we shall soon be telling. Aristotle's work upon methods of thinkingcarried the science of Logic to a level at which it remained for fifteen hundredyears or more, until the mediaeval schoolmen took up the ancient questionsagain. He made no Utopias. Before man could really control his destiny as Platotaught, Aristotle perceived that he needed far more knowledge and far moreaccurate knowledge than he possessed. And so Aristotle began that systematiccollection of knowledge which nowadays we call Science. He sent out explorers tocollect facts. He was the father of natural history. He was the founder ofpolitical science. His students at the Lyceum examined and compared theconstitutions of 158 different states .Here in the fourth century B.C. we find men who are practically \"modernthinkers.\" The child-like, dream-like methods of primitive thought had given wayto a disciplined and critical attack upon the problems of life. The weird andmonstrous symbolism and imagery of the gods and god monsters, and all the taboosand awes and restraints that have hitherto encumbered thinking are herecompletely set aside. Free, exact and systematic thinking has begun. The freshand unencumbered mind of these newcomers out of the northern forests has thrustitself into the mysteries of the temple and let the daylight in.XXVI. THE EMPIRE OF ALEXANDER THE GREATFROM 431 to 404 B.C. the Peloponnesian War wasted Greece. Meanwhile to the northof Greece, the kindred country of Macedonia was rising slowly to power andcivilization. The Macedonians spoke a language closely akin to Greek, and onseveral occasions Macedonian competitors had taken part in the Olympic games. In359 B.C. a man of very great abilities and ambition became king of this littlecountry-Philip. Philip had previously been a hostage in Greece; he had had athoroughly Greek education and he was probably aware of the ideas ofHerodotus-which had also been developed by the philosopher Isocrates-of apossible conquest of Asia by a consolidated Greece.He set himself first to extend and organize his own realm and to remodel hisarmy. For a thousand years now the charging horse-chariot had been the decisivefactor in battles, that and the close-fighting infantry. Mounted horsemen hadalso fought, but as a cloud of skirmishers, individually and without discipline.Philip made his infantry fight in a closely packed mass, the Macedonian phalanx,and he trained his mounted gentlemen, the knights or companions, to fight information and so invented cavalry. The master move in most of his battles and inthe battles of his son Alexander was a cavalry charge. The phalanx held theenemy infantry in front while the cavalry swept away the enemy horse on hiswings and poured in on the flank and rear of his infantry. Chariots weredisabled by bowmen, who shot the horses.With this new army Philip extended his frontiers through Thessaly to Greece; andthe battle of Chaeronia (338 B.C.), fought against Athens and her allies, putall Greece at his feet. At last the dream of Herodotus was bearing fruit. Acongress of all the Greek states appointed Philip captain-general of theGraeco-Macedonian confederacy against Persia, and in 336 B.C. his advanced guardcrossed into Asia upon this long premeditated adventure. But he never followedit. He was assassinated; it is believed at the instigation of his queenOlympias, Alexander's mother. She was jealous because Philip had married asecond wife.But Philip had taken unusual pains with his son's education. He had not onlysecured Aristotle, the greatest philosopher in the world, as this boy's tutor,but he had shared his ideas with him and thrust military experience upon him. AtChaeronia Alexander, who was then only eighteen years old, had been in commandof the cavalry. And so it was possible for this young man, who was still onlytwenty years old at the time of his accession, to take up his father's task atonce and to proceed successfully with the Persian adventure.In 334 B.C.-for two years were needed to establish and confirm his position inMacedonia and Greece-he crossed into Asia, defeated a not very much biggerPersian army at the battle of the Granicus and captured a number of cities inAsia Minor. He kept along the sea-coast. It was necessary for him to reduce andgarrison all the coast towns as he advanced because the Persians had control ofthe fleets of Tyre and Sidon and so had command of the sea. Had he left ahostile port in his rear the Persians might have landed forces to raid hiscommunications and cut him off. At Issus (333 B.C.) he met and smashed a vastconglomerate host under Darius III. Like the host of Xerxes that had crossed theDardanelles a century and a half before, it was an incoherent accumulation ofcontingents and it was encumbered with a multitude of court officials, the haremof Darius and many camp followers. Sidon surrendered to Alexander but Tyreresisted obstinately. Finally that great city was stormed and plundered anddestroyed. Gaza also was stormed, and towards the end of 332 B.C. the conquerorentered Egypt and took over its rule from the Persians.At Alexandretta and at Alexandria in Egypt he built great cities, accessiblefrom the land and so incapable of revolt. To these the trade of the Phoeniciancities was diverted. The Phoenicians of the western Mediterranean suddenlydisappear from history-and as immediately the Jews of Alexandria and the othernew trading cities created by Alexander appear.In 331 B.C. Alexander marched out of Egypt upon Babylon as Thothmes and Ramesesand Necho had done before him. But he marched by way of Tyre. At Arbela near theruins of Nineveh, which was already a forgotten city, he met Darius and foughtthe decisive battle of the war. The Persian chariot charge failed, a Macedoniancavalry charge broke up the great composite host and the phalanx completed thevictory. Darius led the retreat. He made no further attempt to resist theinvader but fled northward into the country of the Medes. Alexander marched onto Babylon, still prosperous and important, and then to Susa and Persepolis.There after a drunken festival he burnt down the palace of Darius, the king ofkings.Thence Alexander presently made a military parade of central Asia, going to theutmost bounds of the Persian empire. At first he turned northward. Darius waspursued; and he was overtaken at dawn dying in his chariot, having been murderedby his own people. He was still living when the foremost Greeks reached him.Alexander came up to find him dead. Alexander skirted the Caspian Sea, he wentup into the mountains of western Turkestan, he came down by Herat (which hefounded) and Cabul and the Khyber Pass into India. He fought a great battle onthe Indus with an Indian king, Porus, and here the Macedonian troops metelephants for the first time and defeated them. Finally he built himself ships,sailed down to the mouth of the Indus, and marched back by the coast ofBeluchistan, reaching Susa again in 324 B.C. after an absence of six years. Hethen prepared to consolidate and organize this vast empire he had won. He soughtto win over his new subjects. He assumed the robes and tiara of a Persianmonarch, and this roused the jealousy of his Macedonian commanders. He had muchtrouble with them. He arranged a number of marriages between these Macedonianofficers and Persian and Babylonian women: the \"Marriage of the East and West.\"He never lived to effect the consolidation he had planned. A fever seized himafter a drinking bout in Babylon and he died in 323 B.C.Immediately this vast dominion fell to pieces. One of his generals, Seleucus,retained most of the old Persian empire from the Indus to Ephesus; another,Ptolemy, seized Egypt, and Antigonus secured Macedonia. The rest of the empireremained unstable, passing under the control of a succession of localadventures. Barbarian raids began from the north and grew in scope andintensity. Until at last, as we shall tell, a new power, the power of the Romanrepublic, came out of the west to subjugate one fragment after another and weldthem together into a new and more enduring empire.XXVII. THE MUSEUM AND LIBRARY AT ALEXANDRIABEFORE the time of Alexander Greeks had already been spreading as merchants,artists, officials, mercenary soldiers, over most of the Persian dominions. Inthe dynastic disputes that followed the death of Xerxes, a band of ten thousandGreek mercenaries played a part under the leadership of Xenophon. Their returnto Asiatic Greece from Babylon is described in his Retreat of the Ten Thousand,one of the first war stories that was ever written by a general in command. Butthe conquests of Alexander and the division of his brief empire among hissubordinate generals, greatly stimulated this permeation of the ancient world bythe Greeks and their language and fashions and culture. Traces of this Greekdissemination are to be found far away in central Asia and in north-west India.Their influence upon the development of Indian art was profound.For many centuries Athens retained her prestige as a centre of art and culture;her schools went on indeed to 529 A.D., that is to say for nearly a thousandyears; but the leadership in the intellectual activity of the world passedpresently across the Mediterranean to Alexandria, the new trading city thatAlexander had founded. Here the Macedonian general Ptolemy had become Pharaoh,with a court that spoke Greek. He had become an intimate of Alexander before hebecame king, and he was deeply saturated with the ideas of Aristotle. He sethimself, with great energy and capacity, to organize knowledge andinvestigation. He also wrote a history of Alexander's campaigns which,unhappily, is lost to the world.Alexander had already devoted considerable sums to finance the enquiries ofAristotle, but Ptolemy I was the first person to make a permanent endowment ofscience. He set up a foundation in Alexandria which was formerly dedicated tothe Muses, the Museum of Alexandria. For two or three generations the scientificwork done at Alexandria was extraordinarily good. Euclid, Eratosthenes whomeasured the size of the earth and came within fifty miles of its true diameter,Apollonius who wrote on conic sections, Hipparchus who made the first star mapand catalogue, and Hero who devised the first steam engine are among the greaterstars of an extraordinary constellation of scientific pioneers. Archimedes camefrom Syracuse to Alexandria to study, and was a frequent correspondent of theMuseum. Herophilus was one of the greatest of Greek anatomists, and is said tohave practised vivisection.For a generation or so during the reigns of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II there wassuch a blaze of knowledge and discovery at Alexandria as the world was not tosee again until the sixteenth century A.D. But it did not continue. There mayhave been several causes of this decline. Chief among them, the late ProfessorMahaffy suggested, was the fact that the Museum was a \"royal\" college and allits professors and fellows were appointed and paid by Pharaoh. This was all verywell when Pharaoh was Ptolemy I, the pupil and friend of Aristotle. But as thedynasty of the Ptolemies went on they became Egyptianized, they fell under thesway of Egyptian priests and Egyptian religious developments, they ceased tofollow the work that was done, and their control stifled the spirit of enquiryaltogether. The Museum produced little good work after its first century ofactivity.Ptolemy I not only sought in the most modern spirit to organize the finding offresh knowledge. He tried also to set up an encyclopaedic storehouse of wisdomin the Library of Alexandria. It was not simply a storehouse, it was also abook-copying and book-selling organization. A great army of copyists was set towork perpetually multiplying copies of books.Here then we have the definite first opening up of the intellectual process inwhich we live to-day; here we have the systematic gathering and distribution ofknowledge. The foundation of this Museum and Library marks one of the greatepochs in the history of mankind. It is the true beginning of Modern History.BOTH the work of research and the work of dissemination went on under serioushandicaps. One of these was the great social gap that separated the philosopher,who was a gentleman, from the trader and the artisan. There were glass workersand metal workers in abundance in those days, but they were not in mentalcontact with the thinkers. The glass worker was making the most beautifullycoloured beads and phials and so forth, but he never made a Florentine flask ora lens. Clear glass does not seem to have interested him. The metal worker madeweapons and jewellery but he never made a chemical balance. The philosopherspeculated loftily about atoms and the nature of things, but he had no practicalexperience of enamels and pigments and philters and so forth. He was notinterested in substances. So Alexandria in its brief day of opportunity producedno microscopes and no chemistry. And though Hero invented a steam engine it wasnever set either to pump or drive a boat or do any useful thing. There were fewpractical applications of science except in the realm of medicine, and theprogress of science was not stimulated and sustained by the interest andexcitement of practical applications. There was nothing to keep the work goingtherefore when the intellectual curiosity of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II waswithdrawn. The discoveries of the Museum went on record in obscure manuscriptsand never, until the revival of scientific curiosity at the Renascence, reachedout to the mass of mankind.Nor did the Library produce any improvements in book making. That ancient worldhad no paper made in definite sizes from rag pulp. Paper was a Chinese inventionand it did not reach the western world until the ninth century A.D. The onlybook materials were parchment and strips of the papyrus reed joined edge toedge. These strips were kept on rolls which were very unwieldy to wind to andfro and read, and very inconvenient for reference. It was these things thatprevented the development of paged and printed books. Printing itself was knownin the world it would seem as early as the Old Stone Age; there were seals inancient Sumeria; but without abundant paper there was little advantage inprinting books, an improvement that may further have been resisted by tradesunionism on the part of the copyists employed. Alexandria produced abundantbooks but not cheap books, and it never spread knowledge into the population ofthe ancient world below the level of a wealthy and influential class.So it was that this blaze of intellectual enterprise never reached beyond asmall circle of people in touch with the group of philosophers collected by thefirst two Ptolemies. It was like the light in a dark lantern which is shut offfrom the world at large. Within the blaze may be blindingly bright, butnevertheless it is unseen. The rest of the world went on its old ways unawarethat the seed of scientific knowledge that was one day to revolutionize italtogether had been sown. Presently a darkness of bigotry fell even uponAlexandria. Thereafter for a thousand years of darkness the seed that Aristotlehad sown lay hidden. Then it stirred and began to germinate. In a few centuriesit had become that widespread growth of knowledge and clear ideas that is nowchanging the whole of human life.Alexandria was not the only centre of Greek intellectual activity in the thirdcentury B.C. There were many other cities that displayed a brilliantintellectual life amidst the disintegrating fragments of the brief empire ofAlexander. There was, for example, the Greek city of Syracuse in Sicily, wherethought and science flourished for two centuries; there was Pergamum in AsiaMinor, which also had a great library. But this brilliant Hellenic world was nowstricken by invasion from the north. New Nordic barbarians, the Gauls, werestriking down along the tracks that had once been followed by the ancestors ofthe Greeks and Phrygians and Macedonians. They raided, shattered and destroyed.And in the wake of the Gauls came a new conquering people out of Italy, theRomans, who gradually subjugated all the western half of the vast realm ofDarius and Alexander. They were an able but unimaginative people, preferring lawand profit to either science of art. New invaders were also coming down out ofcentral Asia to shatter and subdue the Seleucid empire and to cut off thewestern world again from India. These were the Parthians, hosts of mountedbowmen, who treated the Graeco-Persian empire of Persepolis and Susa in thethird century B.C. in much the same fashion that the Medes and Persians hadtreated it in the seventh and sixth. And there were now other nomadic peoplesalso coming out of the north-east, peoples who were not fair and Nordic andAryan-speaking but yellow-skinned and black-haired and with a Mongolian speech.But of these latter people we shall tell more in a subsequent chapter.XXVIII. THE LIFE OF GAUTAMA BUDDHABUT now we must go back three centuries in our story to tell of a great teacherwho came near to revolutionizing the religious thought and feeling of all Asia.This was Gautama Buddha, who taught his disciples at Benares in India about thesame time that Isaiah was prophesying among the Jews in Babylon and Heraclituswas carrying on his speculative enquiries into the nature of things at Ephesus.All these men were in the world at the same time, in the sixth centuryB.C.-unaware of one another.The sixth century B.C. was indeed one of the most remarkable in all history.Everywhere-for as we shall tell it was also the case in China-men's minds weredisplaying a new boldness. Everywhere they were waking up out of the traditionsof kingships and priests and blood sacrifices and asking the most penetratingquestions. It is as if the race had reached a stage of adolescence-after achildhood of twenty thousand years.The early history of India is still very obscure. Somewhen perhaps about 2000B.C., an Aryan-speaking people came down from the north-west into India eitherin one invasion or in a series of invasions; and was able to spread its languageand traditions over most of north India. Its peculiar variety of Aryan speechwas the Sanskrit. They found a brunette people with a more elaboratecivilization and less vigour of will, in possession of the country of the Indusand Ganges. But they do not seem to have mingled with their predecessors asfreely as did the Greeks and Persians. They remained aloof. When the past ofIndia becomes dimly visible to the historian, Indian society is alreadystratified into several layers, with a variable number of sub-divisions, whichdo not eat together nor intermarry nor associate freely. And throughout historythis stratification into castes continues. This makes the Indian populationsomething different from the simple, freely inter-breeding European or Mongoliancommunities. It is really a community of communities.Siddhattha Gautama was the son of an aristocratic family which ruled a smalldistrict on the Himalayan slopes. He was married at nineteen to a beautifulcousin. He hunted and played and went about in his sunny world of gardens andgroves and irrigated rice-fields. And it was amidst this life that a greatdiscontent fell upon him. It was the unhappiness of a fine brain that seeksemployment. He felt that the existence he was leading was not the reality oflife, but a holiday-a holiday that had gone on too long.The sense of disease and mortality, the insecurity and the unsatisfactoriness ofall happiness, descended upon the mind of Gautama. While he was in this mood hemet one of those wandering ascetics who already existed in great numbers inIndia. These men lived under severe rules, spending much time in meditation andin religious discussion. They were supposed to be seeking some deeper reality inlife, and a passionate desire to do likewise took possession of Gautama.He was meditating upon this project, says the story, when the news was broughtto him that his wife had been delivered of his first-born son. \"This is anothertie to break,\" said Gautama.He returned to the village amidst the rejoicings of his fellow clansmen. Therewas a great feast and a Nautch dance to celebrate the birth of his new tie, andin the night Gautama awoke in a great agony of spirit, \"like a man who is toldthat his house is on fire.\" He resolved to leave his happy aimless lifeforthwith. He went softly to the threshold of his wife's chamber, and saw her bythe light of a little oil lamp, sleeping sweetly, surrounded by flowers, withhis infant son in her arms. He felt a great craving to take up the child in onefirst and last embrace before he departed, but the fear of waking his wifeprevented him, and at last he turned away and went out into the bright Indianmoonshine and mounted his horse and rode off into the world.Very far he rode that night, and in the morning he stopped outside the lands ofhis clan, and dismounted beside a sandy river. There he cut off his flowinglocks with his sword, removed all his ornaments and sent them and his horse andsword back to his house. Going on he presently met a ragged man and exchangedclothes with him, and so having divested himself of all worldly entanglements hewas free to pursue his search after wisdom. He made his way southward to aresort of hermits and teachers in a hilly spur of the Vindhya Mountains. Therelived a number of wise men in a warren of caves, going into the town for theirsimple supplies and imparting their knowledge by word of mouth to such as caredto come to them. Gautama became versed in all the metaphysics of his age. Buthis acute intelligence was dissatisfied with the solutions offered him.The Indian mind has always been disposed to believe that power and knowledge maybe obtained by extreme asceticism, by fasting, sleeplessness, and self-torment,and these ideas Gautama now put to the test. He betook himself with fivedisciple companions to the jungle and there he gave himself up to fasting andterrible penances. His fame spread, \"like the sound of a great bell hung in thecanopy of the skies.\" But it brought him no sense of truth achieved. One day hewas walking up and down, trying to think in spite of his enfeebled state.Suddenly he fell unconscious. When he recovered, the preposterousness of thesesemi-magical ways to wisdom was plain to him.He horrified his companions by demanding ordinary food and refusing to continuehis mortifications. He had realized that whatever truth a man may reach isreached best by a nourished brain in a healthy body. Such a conception wasabsolutely foreign to the ideas of the land and age. His disciples deserted him,and went off in a melancholy state to Benares. Gautama wandered alone.When the mind grapples with a great and intricate problem, it makes its advancesstep by step, with but little realization of the gains it has made, untilsuddenly, with an effect of abrupt illumination, it realizes its victory. So ithappened to Gautama. He had seated himself under a great tree by the side of ariver to eat, when this sense of clear version came to him. It seemed to himthat he saw life plain. He is said to have sat all day and all night in profoundthought, and then he rose up to impart his vision to the world.He went on to Benares and there he sought out and won back his lost disciples tohis new teaching. In the King's Deer Park at Benares they built themselves hutsand set up a sort of school to which came many who were seeking after wisdom.The starting point of his teaching was his own question as a fortunate youngman, \"Why am I not completely happy?\" It was an introspective question. It was aquestion very different in quality from the frank and self-forgetfulexternalized curiosity with which Thales and Heraclitus were attacking theproblems of the universe, or the equally self-forgetful burthen of moralobligation that the culminating prophets were imposing upon the Hebrew mind. TheIndian teacher did not forget self, he concentrated upon self and sought todestroy it. All suffering, he taught, was due to the greedy desires of theindividual. Until man has conquered his personal cravings his life is troubleand his end sorrow. There were three principal forms that the craving for lifetook and they were all evil. The first was the desire of the appetites, greedand all forms of sensuousness, the second was the desire for a personal andegotistic immortality, the third was the craving for personal success,worldliness, avarice and the like. All these forms of desire had to be overcometo escape from the distresses and chagrins of life. When they were overcome,when self had vanished altogether, then serenity of soul, Nirvana, the highestgood was attained.This was the gist of his teaching, a very subtle and metaphysical teachingindeed, not nearly so easy to understand as the Greek injunction to see and knowfearlessly and rightly and the Hebrew command to fear God and accomplishrighteousness. It was a teaching much beyond the understanding of even Gautama'simmediate disciples, and it is no wonder that so soon as his personal influencewas withdrawn it became corrupted and coarsened. There was a widespread beliefin India at that time that at long intervals Wisdom came to earth and wasincarnate in some chosen person who was known as the Buddha. Gautama's disciplesdeclared that he was a Buddha, the latest of the Buddhas, though there is noevidence that he himself ever accepted the title. Before he was well dead, acycle of fantastic legends began to be woven about him. The human heart wasalways preferred a wonder story to a moral effort, and Gautama Buddha becamevery wonderful.Yet there remained a substantial gain in the world. If Nirvana was too high andsubtle for most men's imaginations, if the myth-making impulse in the race wastoo strong for the simple facts of Gautama's life, they could at least graspsomething of the intention of what Gautama called the Eight-fold way, the Aryanor Noble Path in life. In this there was an insistence upon mental uprightness,upon right aims and speech, right conduct and honest livelihood. There was aquickening of the conscience and an appeal to generous and self-forgetful ends.XXIX. KING ASOKAFOR some generations after the death of Gautama, these high and noble Buddhistteachings, this first plain teaching that the highest good for man is thesubjugation of self, made comparatively little headway in the world. Then theyconquered the imagination of one of the greatest monarchs the world has everseen.We have already mentioned how Alexander the Great came down into India andfought with Porus upon the Indus. It is related by the Greek historians that acertain Chandragupta Maurya came into Alexander's camp and tried to persuade himto go on to the Ganges and conquer all India. Alexander could not do thisbecause of the refusal of his Macedonians to go further into what was for theman unknown world, and later on (321 B.C.) Chandragupta was able to secure thehelp of various hill tribes and realize his dream without Greek help. He builtup an empire in North India and was presently (303 B.C.) able to attack SeleucusI in the Punjab and drive the last vestige of Greek power out of India. His sonextended this new empire. His grandson, Asoka, the monarch of whom we now haveto tell, found himself in 264 B.C. ruling from Afghanistan to Madras.Asoka was at first disposed to follow the example of his father and grandfatherand complete the conquest of the Indian peninsula. He invaded Kalinga (255B.C.), a country on the east coast of Madras, he was successful in his militaryoperations and-alone among conquerors-he was so disgusted by the cruelty andhorror of war that he renounced it. He would have no more of it. He adopted thepeaceful doctrines of Buddhism and declared that henceforth his conquests shouldbe the conquests of religion.His reign for eight-and-twenty years was one of the brightest interludes in thetroubled history of mankind. He organized a great digging of wells in India andthe planting of trees for shade. He founded hospitals and public gardens andgardens for the growing of medicinal herbs. He created a ministry for the careof the aborigines and subject races of India. He made provision for theeducation of women. He made vast benefactions to the Buddhist teaching orders,and tried to stimulate them to a better and more energetic criticism of theirown accumulated literature. For corruptions and superstitious accretions hadaccumulated very speedily upon the pure and simple teaching of the great Indianmaster. Missionaries went from Asoka to Kashmir, to Persia, to Ceylon andAlexandria.Such was Asoka, greatest of kings. He was far in advance of his age. He left noprince and no organization of men to carry on his work, and within a century ofhis death the great days of his reign had become a glorious memory in ashattered and decaying India. The priestly caste of the Brahmins, the highestand most privileged caste in the Indian social body, has always been opposed tothe frank and open teaching of Buddha. Gradually they undermined the Buddhistinfluence in the land. The old monstrous gods, the innumerable cults ofHinduism, resumed their sway. Caste became more rigorous and complicated. Forlong centuries Buddhism and Brahminism flourished side by side, and then slowlyBuddhism decayed and Brahminism in a multitude of forms replaced it. But beyondthe confines of India and the realms of caste Buddhism spread-until it had wonChina and Siam and Burma and Japan, countries in which it is predominant to thisday.XXX. CONFUCIUS AND LAO TSEWE have still to tell of two other great men, Confucius and Lao Tse, who livedin that wonderful century which began the adolescence of mankind, the sixthcentury B.C. In this history thus far we have told very little of the earlystory of China. At present that early history is still very obscure, and we lookto Chinese explorers and archaeologists in the new China that is now arising towork out their past as thoroughly as the European past has been worked outduring the last century. Very long ago the first primitive Chinese civilizationsarose in the great river valleys out of the primordial heliolithic culture. Theyhad, like Egypt and Sumeria, the general characteristics of that culture, andthey centred upon temples in which priests and priest kings offered the seasonalblood sacrifices. The life in those cities must have been very like the Egyptianand Sumerian life of six or seven thousand years ago and very like the Maya lifeof Central America a thousand years ago.If there were human sacrifices they had long given way to animal sacrificesbefore the dawn of history. And a form of picture writing was growing up longbefore a thousand years B.C.And just as the primitive civilizations of Europe and western Asia were inconflict with the nomads of the desert and the nomads of the north, so theprimitive Chinese civilizations had a great cloud of nomadic peoples on theirnorthern borders. There was a number of tribes akin in language and ways ofliving, who are spoken of in history in succession as the Huns, the Mongols, theTurks and Tartars. They changed and divided and combined and re-combined, justas the Nordic peoples in north Europe and central Asia changed and varied inname rather than in nature. These Mongolian nomads had horses earlier than theNordic peoples, and it may be that in the region of the Altai Mountains theymade an independent discovery of iron somewhen after 1000 B.C. And just as inthe western case so ever and again these eastern nomads would achieve a sort ofpolitical unity, and become the conquerors and masters and revivers of this orthat settled and civilized region.It is quite possible that the earliest civilization of China was not Mongolianat all any more than the earliest civilization of Europe and western Asia wasNordic or Semitic. It is quite possible that the earliest civilization of Chinawas a brunette civilization and of a piece with the earliest Egyptian, Sumerianand Dravidian civilizations, and that when the first recorded history of Chinabegan there had already been conquests and intermixture. At any rate we findthat by 1750 B.C. China was already a vast system of little kingdoms and citystates, all acknowledging a loose allegiance and paying more or less regularly,more or less definite feudal dues to one great priest emperor, the \"Son ofHeaven.\" The \"Shang\" dynasty came to an end in 1125 B.C. A \"Chow\" dynastysucceeded \"Shang,\" and maintained China in a relaxing unity until the days ofAsoka in India and of the Ptolemies in Egypt. Gradually China went to piecesduring that long \"Chow\" period. Hunnish peoples came down and set upprincipalities; local rulers discontinued their tribute and became independent.There was in the sixth century B.C., says one Chinese authority, five or sixthousand practically independent states in China. It was what the Chinese callin their records an \"Age of Confusion.\"But this Age of Confusion was compatible with much intellectual activity andwith the existence of many local centres of art and civilized living. When weknow more of Chinese history we shall find that China also had her Miletus andher Athens, her Pergamum and her Macedonia. At present we must be vague andbrief about this period of Chinese division simply because our knowledge is notsufficient for us to frame a coherent and consecutive story.And just as in divided Greece there were philosophers and in shattered andcaptive Jewry prophets, so in disordered China there were philosophers andteachers at this time. In all these cases insecurity and uncertainty seemed tohave quickened the better sort of mind. Confucius was a man of aristocraticorigin and some official importance in a small state called Lu. Here in a veryparallel mood to the Greek impulse he set up a sort of Academy for discoveringand teaching Wisdom. The lawlessness and disorder of China distressed himprofoundly. He conceived an ideal of a better government and a better life, andtravelled from state to state seeking a prince who would carry out hislegislative and educational ideas. He never found his prince; he found a prince,but court intrigues undermined the influence of the teacher and finally defeatedhis reforming proposals. It is interesting to note that a century and a halflater the Greek philosopher Plato also sought a prince, and was for a timeadviser to the tyrant Dionysius who ruled Syracuse in Sicily.Confucius died a disappointed man. \"No intelligent ruler arises to take me ashis master,\" he said, \"and my time has come to die.\" But his teaching had morevitality than he imagined in his declining and hopeless years, and it became agreat formative influence with the Chinese people. It became one of what theChinese call the Three Teachings, the other two being those of Buddha and of LaoTse.The gist of the teaching of Confucius was the way of the noble or aristocraticman. He was concerned with personal conduct as much as Gautama was concernedwith the peace of self-forgetfulness and the Greek with external knowledge andthe Jew with righteousness. He was the most public-minded of all great teachers.He was supremely concerned by the confusion and miseries of the world, and hewanted to make men noble in order to bring about a noble world. He sought toregulate conduct to an extraordinary extent; to provide sound rules for everyoccasion in life. A polite, public-spirited gentleman, rather sternlyself-disciplined, was the ideal he found already developing in the northernChinese world and one to which he gave a permanent form.The teaching of Lao Tse, who was for a long time in charge of the imperiallibrary of the Chow dynasty, was much more mystical and vague and elusive thanthat of Confucius. He seems to have preached a stoical indifference to thepleasures and powers of the world and a return to an imaginary simple life ofthe past. He left writings very contracted in style and very obscure. He wrotein riddles. After his death his teachings, like the teachings of Gautama Buddha,were corrupted and overlaid by legends and had the most complex andextraordinary observances and superstitious ideas grafted upon them. In Chinajust as in India primordial ideas of magic and monstrous legends out of thechildish past of our race struggled against the new thinking in the world andsucceeded in plastering it over with grotesque, irrational and antiquatedobservances. Both Buddhism and Taoism (which ascribes itself largely to Lao Tse)as one finds them in China now, are religions of monk, temple, priest andoffering of a type as ancient in form, if not in thought, as the sacrificialreligions of ancient Sumeria and Egypt. But the teaching of Confucius was not sooverlaid because it was limited and plain and straightforward and lent itself tono such distortions.North China, the China of the Hwang-ho River, became Confucian in thought andspirit; south China, Yang-tse-Kiang China, became Taoist. Since those days aconflict has always been traceable in Chinese affairs between these two spirits,the spirit of the north and the spirit of the south, between (in latter times)Pekin and Nankin, between the official-minded, upright and conservative north,and the sceptical, artistic, lax and experimental south.The divisions of China of the Age of Confusion reached their worst stage in thesixth century B.C. The Chow dynasty was so enfeebled and so discredited that LaoTse left the unhappy court and retired into private life.Three nominally subordinate powers dominated the situation in those days, Ts'iand Ts'in, both northern powers, and Ch'u, which was an aggressive militarypower in the Yangtse valley. At last Ts'i and Ts'in formed an alliance, subduedCh'u and imposed a general treaty of disarmament and peace in China. The powerof Ts'in became predominant. Finally about the time of Asoka in India the Ts'inmonarch seized upon the sacrificial vessels of the Chow emperor and took overhis sacrificial duties. His son, Shi-Hwang-ti (king in 246 B.C., emperor in 220B.C.), is called in the Chinese Chronicles \"the First Universal Emperor.\"More fortunate than Alexander, Shi-Hwang-ti reigned for thirty-six years as kingand emperor. His energetic reign marks the beginning of a new era of unity andprosperity for the Chinese people. He fought vigorously against the Hunnishinvaders from the northern deserts, and he began that immense work, the GreatWall of China, to set a limit to their incursions.XXXI. ROME COMES INTO HISTORYTHE READER will note a general similarity in the history of all thesecivilizations in spite of the effectual separation caused by the great barriersof the Indian north-west frontier and of the mountain masses of Central Asia andfurther India. First for thousands of years the heliolithic culture spread overall the warm and fertile river valleys of the old world and developed a templesystem and priest rulers about its sacrificial traditions. Apparently its firstmakers were always those brunette peoples we have spoken of as the central raceof mankind. Then the nomads came in from the regions of seasonal grass andseasonal migrations and superposed their own characteristics and often their ownlanguage on the primitive civilization. They subjugated and stimulated it, andwere stimulated to fresh developments and made it here one thing and hereanother. In Mesopotamia it was the Elamite and then the Semite, and at last theNordic Medes and Persians and the Greeks who supplied the ferment; over theregion of the aegean peoples it was the Greeks; in India it was theAryan-speakers; in Egypt there was a thinner infusion of conquerors into a moreintensely saturated priestly civilization; in China, the Hun conquered and wasabsorbed and was followed by fresh Huns. China was Mongolized just as Greece andNorth India were Aryanized and Mesopotamia Semitized and Aryanized. Everywherethe nomads destroyed much, but everywhere they brought in a new spirit of freeenquiry and moral innovation. They questioned the beliefs of immemorial ages.They let daylight into the temples. They set up kings who were neither priestsnor gods but mere leaders among their captains and companions.In the centuries following the sixth century B.C. we find everywhere a greatbreaking down of ancient traditions and a new spirit of moral and intellectualenquiry awake, a spirit never more to be altogether stilled in the greatprogressive movement of mankind. We find reading and writing becoming common andaccessible accomplishments among the ruling and prosperous minority; they wereno longer the jealously guarded secret of the priests. Travel is increasing andtransport growing easier by reason of horses and roads. A new and easy device tofacilitate trade has been found in coined money.Let us now transfer our attention back from China in the extreme east of the oldworld to the western half of the Mediterranean. Here we have to note theappearance of a city which was destined to play at last a very great part indeedin human affairs, Rome.Hitherto we have told very little about Italy in our story. It was before 1000B.C. a land of mountain and forest and thinly populated. Aryan-speaking tribeshad pressed down this peninsula and formed little towns and cities, and thesouthern extremity was studded with Greek settlements. The noble ruins ofPaestum preserve for us to this day something of the dignity and splendour ofthese early Greek establishments. A non-Aryan people, probably akin to theaegean peoples, the Etruscans, had established themselves in the central part ofthe peninsula. They had reversed the usual process by subjugating various Aryantribes. Rome, when it comes into the light of history, is a little trading cityat a ford on the Tiber, with a Latin-speaking population ruled over by Etruscankings. The old chronologies gave 753 B.C. as the date of the founding of Rome,half a century later than the founding of the great Phoenician city of Carthageand twenty-three years after the first Olympiad. Etruscan tombs of a muchearlier date than 753 B.C. have, however, been excavated in the Roman Forum.In that red-letter century, the sixth century B.C., the Etruscan kings wereexpelled (510 B.C.) and Rome became an aristocratic republic with a lordly classof \"patrician\" families dominating a commonalty of \"plebeians.\" Except that itspoke Latin it was not unlike many aristocratic Greek republics.For some centuries the internal history of Rome was the story of a long andobstinate struggle for freedom and a share in the government on the part of theplebeians. It would not be difficult to find Greek parallels to this conflict,which the Greeks would have called a conflict of aristocracy with democracy. Inthe end the plebeians broke down most of the exclusive barriers of the oldfamilies and established a working equality with them. They destroyed the oldexclusiveness, and made it possible and acceptable for Rome to extend hercitizenship by the inclusion of more and more \"outsiders.\" For while she stillstruggled at home, she was extending her power abroad.The extension of Roman power began in the fifth century B.C. Until that timethey had waged war, and generally unsuccessful war, with the Etruscans. Therewas an Etruscan fort, Veii, only a few miles from Rome which the Romans hadnever been able to capture. In 474 B.C., however, a great misfortune came to theEtruscans. Their fleet was destroyed by the Greeks of Syracuse in Sicily. At thesame time a wave of Nordic invaders came down upon them from the north, theGauls. Caught between Roman and Gaul, the Etruscans fell-and disappear fromhistory. Veii was captured by the Romans. The Gauls came through to Rome andsacked the city (390 B.C.) but could not capture the Capitol. An attempted nightsurprise was betrayed by the cackling of some geese, and finally the invaderswere bought off and retired to the north of Italy again.The Gaulish raid seems to have invigorated rather than weakened Rome. The Romansconquered and assimilated the Etruscans, and extended their power over allcentral Italy from the Arno to Naples. To this they had reached within a fewyears of 300 B.C. Their conquests in Italy were going on simultaneously with thegrowth of Philip's power in Macedonia and Greece, and the tremendous raid ofAlexander to Egypt and the Indus. The Romans had become notable people in thecivilized world to the east of them by the break-up of Alexander's empire.To the north of the Roman power were the Gauls; to the south of them were theGreek settlements of Magna Graecia, that is to say of Sicily and of the toe andheel of Italy. The Gauls were a hardy, warlike people and the Romans held thatboundary by a line of forts and fortified settlements. The Greek cities in thesouth headed by Tarentum (now Taranto) and by Syracuse in Sicily, did not somuch threaten as fear the Romans. They looked about for some help against thesenew conquerors.We have already told how the empire of Alexander fell to pieces and was dividedamong his generals and companions. Among these adventurers was a kinsman ofAlexander's named Pyrrhus, who established himself in Epirus, which is acrossthe Adriatic Sea over against the heel of Italy. It was his ambition to play thepart of Philip of Macedonia to Magna Graecia, and to become protector andmaster-general of Tarentum, Syracuse and the rest of that part of the world. Hehad what was then a very efficient modern army; he had an infantry phalanx,cavalry from Thessaly-which was now quite as good as the original Macedoniancavalry-and twenty fighting elephants; he invaded Italy and routed the Romans intwo considerable battles, Heraclea (280 B.C.) and Ausculum (279 B.C.), andhaving driven them north, he turned his attention to the subjugation of Sicily.But this brought against him a more formidable enemy than were the Romans atthat time, the Phoenician trading city of Carthage, which was probably then thegreatest city in the world. Sicily was too near Carthage for a new Alexander tobe welcome there, and Carthage was mindful of the fate that had befallen hermother city Tyre half a century before. So she sent a fleet to encourage orcompel Rome to continue the struggle, and she cut the overseas communications ofPyrrhus. Pyrrhus found himself freshly assailed by the Romans, and suffered adisastrous repulse in an attack he had made upon their camp at Beneventumbetween Naples and Rome.And suddenly came news that recalled him to Epirus. The Gauls were raidingsouth. But this time they were not raiding down into Italy; the Roman frontier,fortified and guarded, had become too formidable for them. They were raidingdown through Illyria (which is now Serbia and Albania) to Macedonia and Epirus.Repulsed by the Romans, endangered at sea by the Carthaginians, and threatenedat home by the Gauls, Pyrrhus abandoned his dream of conquest and went home (275B.C.), and the power of Rome was extended to the Straits of Messina.On the Sicilian side of the Straits was the Greek city of Messina, and thispresently fell into the hands of a gang of pirates. The Carthaginians, who werealready practically overlords of Sicily and allies of Syracuse, suppressed thesepirates (270 B.C.) and put in a Carthaginian garrison there. The piratesappealed to Rome and Rome listened to their complaint. And so across the Straitsof Messina the great trading power of Carthage and this new conquering people,the Romans, found themselves in antagonism, face to face.XXXII. ROME AND CARTHAGEIT was in 264 B.C. that the great struggle between Rome and Carthage, the PunicWars, began. In that year Asoka was beginning his reign in Behar andShi-Hwang-ti was a little child, the Museum in Alexandria was still doing goodscientific work, and the barbaric Gauls were now in Asia Minor and exacting atribute from Pergamum. The different regions of the world were still separatedby insurmountable distances, and probably the rest of mankind heard only vagueand remote rumours of the mortal fight that went on for a century and a half inSpain, Italy, North Africa and the western Mediterranean, between the laststronghold of Semitic power and Rome, this newcomer among Aryan-speakingpeoples.That war has left its traces upon issues that still stir the world. Rometriumphed over Carthage, but the rivalry of Aryan and Semite was to merge itselflater on in the conflict of Gentile and Jew. Our history now is coming to eventswhose consequences and distorted traditions still maintain a lingering andexpiring vitality in, and exercise a complicating and confusing influence upon,the conflicts and controversies of to-day.The First Punic War began in 264 B.C. about the pirates of Messina. It developedinto a struggle for the possession of all Sicily except the dominions of theGreek king of Syracuse. The advantage of the sea was at first with theCarthaginians. They had great fighting ships of what was hitherto an unheard-ofsize, quinqueremes, galleys with five banks of oars and a huge ram. At thebattle of Salamis, two centuries before, the leading battleships had only beentriremes with three banks. But the Romans, with extraordinary energy and inspite of the fact that they had little naval experience, set themselves tooutbuild the Carthaginians. They manned the new navy they created chiefly withGreek seamen, and they invented grappling and boarding to make up for thesuperior seamanship of the enemy. When the Carthaginian came up to ram or shearthe oars of the Roman, huge grappling irons seized him and the Roman soldiersswarmed aboard him. At Mylae (260 B.C.) and at Ecnomus (256 B.C.) theCarthaginians were disastrously beaten. They repulsed a Roman landing nearCarthage but were badly beaten at Palermo, losing one hundred and four elephantsthere-to grace such a triumphal procession through the Forum as Rome had neverseen before. But after that came two Roman defeats and then a Roman recovery.The last naval forces of Carthage were defeated by a last Roman effort at thebattle of the aegatian Isles (241 B.C.) and Carthage sued for peace. All Sicilyexcept the dominions of Hiero, king of Syracuse, was ceded to the Romans.For twenty-two years Rome and Carthage kept the peace. Both had trouble enoughat home. In Italy the Gauls came south again, threatened Rome-which in a stateof panic offered human sacrifices to the Gods!-and were routed at Telamon. Romepushed forward to the Alps, and even extended her dominions down the Adriaticcoast to Illyria. Carthage suffered from domestic insurrections and from revoltsin Corsica and Sardinia, and displayed far less recuperative power. Finally, anact of intolerable aggression, Rome seized and annexed the two revoltingislands.Spain at that time was Carthaginian as far north as the river Ebro. To thatboundary the Romans restricted them. Any crossing of the Ebro by theCarthaginians was to be considered an act of war against the Romans. At last in218 B.C. the Carthaginians, provoked by new Roman aggressions, did cross thisriver under a young general named Hannibal, one of the most brilliant commandersin the whole of history. He marched his army from Spain over the Alps intoItaly, raised the Gauls against the Romans, and carried on the Second Punic Warin Italy itself for fifteen years. He inflicted tremendous defeats upon theRomans at Lake Trasimere and at Cannae, and throughout all his Italian campaignsno Roman army stood against him and escaped disaster. But a Roman army hadlanded at Marseilles and cut his communications with Spain; he had no siegetrain, and he could never capture Rome. Finally the Carthaginians, threatened bythe revolt of the Numidians at home, were forced back upon the defence of theirown city in Africa, a Roman army crossed into Africa, and Hannibal experiencedhis first defeat under its walls at the battle of Zama (202 B.C.) at the handsof Scipio Africanus the Elder. The battle of Zama ended this Second Punic War.Carthage capitulated; she surrendered Spain and her war fleet; she paid anenormous indemnity and agreed to give up Hannibal to the vengeance of theRomans. But Hannibal escaped and fled to Asia where later, being in danger offalling into the hands of his relentless enemies, he took poison and died.For fifty-six years Rome and the shorn city of Carthage were at peace. Andmeanwhile Rome spread her empire over confused and divided Greece, invaded AsiaMinor, and defeated Antiochus III, the Seleucid monarch, at Magnesia in Lydia.She made Egypt, still under the Ptolemies, and Pergamum and most of the smallstates of Asia Minor into \"Allies,\" or, as we should call them now, \"protectedstates.\"Meanwhile Carthage, subjugated and enfeebled, had been slowly regainingsomething of her former prosperity. Her recovery revived the hate and suspicionof the Romans. She was attacked upon the most shallow and artificial of quarrels(149 B.C.), she made an obstinate and bitter resistance, stood a long siege andwas stormed (146 B.C.). The street fighting, or massacre, lasted six days; itwas extraordinarily bloody, and when the citadel capitulated only about fiftythousand of the Carthaginian population remained alive out of a quarter of amillion. They were sold into slavery, and the city was burnt and elaboratelydestroyed. The blackened ruins were ploughed and sown as a sort of ceremonialeffacement.So ended the Third Punic War. Of all the Semitic states and cities that hadflourished in the world five centuries before only one little country remainedfree under native rulers. This was Judea, which had liberated itself from theSeleucids and was under the rule of the native Maccabean princes. By this timeit had its Bible almost complete, and was developing the distinctive traditionsof the Jewish world as we know it now. It was natural that the Carthaginians,Phoenicians and kindred peoples dispersed about the world should find a commonlink in their practically identical language and in this literature of hope andcourage. To a large extent they were still the traders and bankers of the world.The Semitic world had been submerged rather than replaced.Jerusalem, which has always been rather the symbol than the centre of Judaism,was taken by the Romans in 65 B.C.; and after various vicissitudes ofquasi-independence and revolt was besieged by them in 70 A.D. and captured aftera stubborn struggle. The Temple was destroyed. A later rebellion in 132 A.D.completed its destruction, and the Jerusalem we know to-day was rebuilt laterunder Roman auspices. A temple to the Roman god, Jupiter Capitolinus, stood inthe place of the Temple, and Jews were forbidden to inhabit the city."},{"pageContent":"XXXIII. THE GROWTH OF THE ROMAN EMPIRENOW this new Roman power which arose to dominate the western world in the secondand first centuries B.C. was in several respects a different thing from any ofthe great empires that had hitherto prevailed in the civilized world. It was notat first a monarchy, and it was not the creation of any one great conqueror. Itwas not indeed the first of republican empires; Athens had dominated a group ofAllies and dependents in the time of Pericles, and Carthage when she enteredupon her fatal struggle with Rome was mistress of Sardinia and Corsica, Morocco,Algiers, Tunis, and most of Spain and Sicily. But it was the first republicanempire that escaped extinction and went on to fresh developments.The centre of this new system lay far to the west of the more ancient centres ofempire, which had hitherto been the river valleys of Mesopotamia and Egypt. Thiswestward position enabled Rome to bring in to civilization quite fresh regionsand peoples. The Roman power extended to Morocco and Spain, and was presentlyable to thrust north-westward over what is now France and Belgium to Britain andnorth-eastward into Hungary and South Russia. But on the other hand it was neverable to maintain itself in Central Asia or Persia because they were too far fromits administrative centres. It included therefore great masses of fresh NordicAryan-speaking peoples, it presently incorporated nearly all the Greek people inthe world, and its population was less strongly Hamitic and Semitic than that ofany preceding empire.For some centuries this Roman Empire did not fall into the grooves of precedentthat had so speedily swallowed up Persian and Greek, and all that time itdeveloped. The rulers of the Medes and Persians became entirely Babylonized in ageneration or so; they took over the tiara of the king of kings and the templesand priesthoods of his gods; Alexander and his successors followed in the sameeasy path of assimilation; the Seleucid monarchs had much the same court andadministrative methods as Nebuchadnezzar; the Ptolemies became Pharaohs andaltogether Egyptian. They were assimilated just as before them the Semiticconquerors of the Sumerians had been assimilated. But the Romans ruled in theirown city, and for some centuries kept to the laws of their own nature. The onlypeople who exercised any great mental influence upon them before the second orthird century A.D. were the kindred and similar Greeks. So that the Roman Empirewas essentially a first attempt to rule a great dominion upon mainly Aryanlines. It was so far a new pattern in history, it was an expanded Aryanrepublic. The old pattern of a personal conqueror ruling over a capital citythat had grown up round the temple of a harvest god did not apply to it. TheRomans had gods and temples, but like the gods of the Greeks their gods werequasi-human immortals, divine patricians. The Romans also had blood sacrificesand even made human ones in times of stress, things they may have learnt to dofrom their dusky Etruscan teachers; but until Rome was long past its zenithneither priest nor temple played a large part in Roman history.The Roman Empire was a growth, an unplanned novel growth; the Roman people foundthemselves engaged almost unawares in a vast administrative experiment. Itcannot be called a successful experiment. In the end their empire collapsedaltogether. And it changed enormously in form and method from century tocentury. It changed more in a hundred years than Bengal or Mesopotamia or Egyptchanged in a thousand. It was always changing. It never attained to any fixity.In a sense the experiment failed. In a sense the experiment remains unfinished,and Europe and America to-day are still working out the riddles of world-widestatescraft first confronted by the Roman people.It is well for the student of history to bear in mind the very great changes notonly in political but in social and moral matters that went on throughout theperiod of Roman dominion. There is much too strong a tendency in people's mindsto think of the Roman rule as something finished and stable, firm, rounded,noble and decisive. Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome, S.P.Q.R. the elder Cato,the Scipios, Julius Caesar, Diocletian, Constantine the Great, triumphs,orations, gladiatorial combats and Christian martyrs are all mixed up togetherin a picture of something high and cruel and dignified. The items of thatpicture have to be disentangled. They are collected at different points from aprocess of change profounder than that which separates the London of William theConqueror from the London of to-day.We may very conveniently divide the expansion of Rome into four stages. Thefirst stage began after the sack of Rome by the Goths in 390 B.C. and went onuntil the end of the First Punic War (240 B.C.). We may call this stage thestage of the Assimilative Republic. It was perhaps the finest, mostcharacteristic stage in Roman history. The age-long dissensions of patrician andplebeian were drawing to a close, the Etruscan threat had come to an end, no onewas very rich yet nor very poor, and most men were public-spirited. It was arepublic like the republic of the South African Boers before 1900 or like thenorthern states of the American Union between 1800 and 1850; a free-farmersrepublic. At the outset of this stage Rome was a little state scarcely twentymiles square. She fought the sturdy but kindred states about her, and sought nottheir destruction but coalescence. Her centuries of civil dissension had trainedher people in compromise and concessions. Some of the defeated cities becamealtogether Roman with a voting share in the government, some becameself-governing with the right to trade and marry in Rome; garrisons full ofcitizens were set up at strategic points and colonies of varied privilegesfounded among the freshly conquered people. Great roads were made. The rapidLatinization of all Italy was the inevitable consequence of such a policy. In 89B.C. all the free inhabitants of Italy became citizens of the city of RomeFormally the whole Roman Empire became at last an extended city. In 212 A.D.every free man in the entire extent of the empire was given citizenship; theright, if he could get there, to vote in the town meeting in Rome.This extension of citizenship to tractable cities and to whole countries was thedistinctive device of Roman expansion. It reversed the old process of conquestand assimilation altogether. By the Roman method the conquerors assimilated theconquered.But after the First Punic War and the annexation of Sicily, though the oldprocess of assimilation still went on, another process arose by its side. Sicilyfor instance was treated as a conquered prey. It was declared an \"estate\" of theRoman people. Its rich soil and industrious population was exploited to makeRome rich. The patricians and the more influential among the plebeians securedthe major share of that wealth. And the war also brought in a large supply ofslaves. Before the First Punic War the population of the republic had beenlargely a population of citizen farmers. Military service was their privilegeand liability. While they were on active service their farms fell into debt anda new large-scale slave agriculture grew up; when they returned they found theirproduce in competition with slave-grown produce from Sicily and from the newestates at home. Times had changed. The republic had altered its character. Notonly was Sicily in the hands of Rome, the common man was in the hands of therich creditor and the rich competitor. Rome had entered upon its second stage,the Republic of Adventurous Rich Men.For two hundred years the Roman soldier farmers had struggled for freedom and ashare in the government of their state; for a hundred years they had enjoyedtheir privileges. The First Punic War wasted them and robbed them of all theyhad won.The value of their electoral privileges had also evaporated. The governingbodies of the Roman republic were two in number. The first and more importantwas the Senate. This was a body originally of patricians and then of prominentmen of all sorts, who were summoned to it first by certain powerful officials,the consuls and censors. Like the British House of Lords it became a gatheringof great landowners, prominent politicians, big business men and the like. Itwas much more like the British House of Lords than it was like the AmericanSenate. For three centuries, from the Punic Wars onward, it was the centre ofRoman political thought and purpose. The second body was the Popular Assembly.This was supposed to be an assembly of all the citizens of Rome. When Rome was alittle state twenty miles square this was a possible gathering. When thecitizenship of Rome had spread beyond the confines in Italy, it was analtogether impossible one. Its meetings, proclaimed by horn-blowing from theCapitol and the city walls, became more and more a gathering of political hacksand city riff-raff. In the fourth century B.C. the Popular Assembly was aconsiderable check upon the Senate, a competent representation of the claims andrights of the common man. By the end of the Punic Wars it was an impotent relicof a vanquished popular control. No effectual legal check remained upon the bigmen.Nothing of the nature of representative government was ever introduced into theRoman republic. No one thought of electing delegates to represent the will ofthe citizens. This is a very important point for the student to grasp. ThePopular Assembly never became the equivalent of the American House ofRepresentatives or the British House of Commons. In theory it was all thecitizens; in practice it ceased to be anything at all worth consideration.The common citizen of the Roman Empire was therefore in a very poor case afterthe Second Punic War; he was impoverished, he had often lost his farm, he wasousted from profitable production by slaves, and he had no political power leftto him to remedy these things. The only methods of popular expression left to apeople without any form of political expression are the strike and the revolt.The story of the second and first centuries B.C., so far as internal politicsgo, is a story of futile revolutionary upheaval. The scale of this history willnot permit us to tell of the intricate struggles of that time, of the attemptsto break up estates and restore the land to the free farmer, of proposals toabolish debts in whole or in part. There was revolt and civil war. In 73 B.C.,the distresses of Italy were enhanced by a great insurrection of the slavesunder Spartacus. The slaves of Italy revolted with some effect, for among themwere the trained fighters of the gladiatorial shows. For two years Spartacusheld out in the crater of Vesuvius, which seemed at that time to be an extinctvolcano. This insurrection was defeated at last and suppressed with franticcruelty. Six thousand captured Spartacists were crucified along the Appian Way,the great highway that runs southward out of Rome (71 B.C.).The common man never made head against the forces that were subjugating anddegrading him. But the big rich men who were overcoming him were even in hisdefeat preparing a new power in the Roman world over themselves and him, thepower of the army.Before the Second Punic War the army of Rome was a levy of free farmers, who,according to their quality, rode or marched afoot to battle. This was a verygood force for wars close at hand, but not the sort of army that will go abroadand bear long campaigns with patience. And moreover as the slaves multiplied andthe estates grew, the supply of free-spirited fighting farmers declined. It wasa popular leader named Marius who introduced a new factor. North Africa afterthe overthrow of the Carthaginian civilization had become a semi-barbarickingdom, the kingdom of Numidia. The Roman power fell into conflict withJugurtha, king of this state, and experienced enormous difficulties in subduinghim. Marius was made consul, in a phase of public indignation, to end thisdiscreditable war. This he did by raising paid troops and drilling them hard.Jugurtha was brought in chains to Rome (106 B.C.) and Marius, when his time ofoffice had expired, held on to his consulship illegally with his newly createdlegions. There was no power in Rome to restrain him.With Marius began the third phase in the development of the Roman power, theRepublic of the Military Commanders. For now began a period in which the leadersof the paid legions fought for the mastery of the Roman world. Against Mariuswas pitted the aristocratic Sulla who had served under him in Africa. Each inturn made a great massacre of his political opponents. Men were proscribed andexecuted by the thousand, and their estates were sold. After the bloody rivalryof these two and the horror of the revolt of Spartacus, came a phase in whichLucullus and Pompey the Great and Crassus and Julius Caesar were the masters ofarmies and dominated affairs. It was Crassus who defeated Spartacus. Lucullusconquered Asia Minor and penetrated to Armenia, and retired with great wealthinto private life. Crassus thrusting further invaded Persia and was defeated andslain by the Parthians. After a long rivalry Pompey was defeated by JuliusCaesar (48 B.C.) and murdered in Egypt, leaving Julius Caesar sole master of theRoman world.The figure of Julius Caesar is one that has stirred the human imagination out ofall proportion to its merit or true importance. He has become a legend and asymbol. For us he is chiefly important as marking the transition from the phaseof military adventurers to the beginning of the fourth stage in Roman expansion,the Early Empire. For in spite of the profoundest economic and politicalconvulsions, in spite of civil war and social degeneration, throughout all thistime the boundaries of the Roman state crept outward and continued to creepoutward to their maximum about 100 A.D. There had been something like an ebbduring the doubtful phases of the Second Punic War, and again a manifest loss ofvigour before the reconstruction of the army by Marius. The revolt of Spartacusmarked a third phase. Julius Caesar made his reputation as a military leader inGaul, which is now France and Belgium. (The chief tribes inhabiting this countrybelonged to the same Celtic people as the Gauls who had occupied north Italy fora time, and who had afterwards raided into Asia Minor and settled down as theGalatians.) Caesar drove back a German invasion of Gaul and added all thatcountry to the empire, and he twice crossed the Straits of Dover into Britain(55 and 54 B.C.), where however he made no permanent conquest. Meanwhile Pompeythe Great was consolidating Roman conquests that reached in the east to theCaspian Sea.At this time, the middle of the first century B.C., the Roman Senate was stillthe nominal centre of the Roman government, appointing consuls and otherofficials, granting powers and the like; and a number of politicians, among whomCicero was an outstanding figure, were struggling to preserve the greattraditions of republican Rome and to maintain respect for its laws. But thespirit of citizenship had gone from Italy with the wasting away of the freefarmers; it was a land now of slaves and impoverished men with neither theunderstanding nor the desire for freedom. There was nothing whatever behindthese republican leaders in the Senate, while behind the great adventurers theyfeared and desired to control were the legions. Over the heads of the SenateCrassus and Pompey and Caesar divided the rule of the Empire between them (TheFirst Triumvirate). When presently Crassus was killed at distant Carrhae by theParthians, Pompey and Caesar fell out. Pompey took up the republican side, andlaws were passed to bring Caesar to trial for his breaches of law and hisdisobedience to the decrees of the Senate.It was illegal for a general to bring his troops out of the boundary of hiscommand, and the boundary between Caesar's command and Italy was the Rubicon. In49 B.C. he crossed the Rubicon, saying \"The die is cast\" and marched upon Pompeyand Rome.It had been the custom in Rome in the past, in periods of military extremity, toelect a \"dictator\" with practically unlimited powers to rule through the crisis.After his overthrow of Pompey, Caesar was made dictator first for ten years andthen (in 45 B.C.) for life. In effect he was made monarch of the empire forlife. There was talk of a king, a word abhorrent to Rome since the expulsion ofthe Etruscans five centuries before. Caesar refused to be king, but adoptedthrone and sceptre. After his defeat of Pompey, Caesar had gone on into Egyptand had made love to Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, the goddess queen ofEgypt. She seems to have turned his head very completely. He had brought back toRome the Egyptian idea of a god-king. His statue was set up in a temple with aninscription \"To the Unconquerable God.\" The expiring republicanism of Romeflared up in a last protest, and Caesar was stabbed to death in the Senate atthe foot of the statue of his murdered rival, Pompey the Great.Thirteen years more of this conflict of ambitious personalities followed. Therewas a second Triumvirate of Lepidus, Mark Antony and Octavian Caesar, the latterthe nephew of Julius Caesar. Octavian like his uncle took the poorer, hardierwestern provinces where the best legions were recruited. In 31 B.C., he defeatedMark Antony, his only serious rival, at the naval battle of Actium, and madehimself sole master of the Roman world. But Octavian was a man of differentquality altogether from Julius Caesar. He had no foolish craving to be God orKing. He had no queen-lover that he wished to dazzle. He restored freedom to theSenate and people of Rome. He declined to be dictator. The grateful Senate inreturn gave him the reality instead of the forms of power. He was to be callednot King indeed, but \"Princeps\" and \"Augustus.\" He became Augustus Caesar, thefirst of the Roman emperors (27 B.C. to 14 A.D.).He was followed by Tiberius Caesar (14 to 37 A.D.) and he by others, Caligula,Claudius, Nero and so on up to Trajan (98 A.D.), Hadrian (117 A.D.), AntoniusPius (138 A.D.) and Marcus Aurelius (161-180 A.D.). All these emperors wereemperors of the legions. The soldiers made them, and some the soldiersdestroyed. Gradually the Senate fades out of Roman history, and the emperor andhis administrative officials replace it. The boundaries of the empire creptforward now to their utmost limits. Most of Britain was added to the empire,Transylvania was brought in as a new province, Dacia; Trajan crossed theEuphrates. Hadrian had an idea that reminds us at once of what had happened atthe other end of the old world. Like Shi-Hwang-ti he built walls against thenorthern barbarians; one across Britain and a palisade between the Rhine and theDanube. He abandoned some of the acquisitions of Trajan. 2 The expansion of theRoman Empire was at an end.XXXIV. BETWEEN ROME AND CHINATHE SECOND and first centuries B.C. mark a new phase in the history of mankind.Mesopotamia and the eastern Mediterranean are no longer the centre of interest.Both Mesopotamia and Egypt were still fertile, populous and fairly prosperous,but they were no longer the dominant regions of the world. Power had drifted tothe west and to the east. Two great empires now dominated the world, this newRoman Empire and the renascent Empire of China. Rome extended its power to theEuphrates, but it was never able to get beyond that boundary. It was too remote.Beyond the Euphrates the former Persian and Indian dominions of the Seleucidsfell under a number of new masters. China, now under the Han dynasty, which hadreplaced the Ts'in dynasty at the death of Shi-Hwang-ti, had extended its poweracross Tibet and over the high mountain passes of the Pamirs into westernTurkestan. But there, too, it reached its extremes. Beyond was too far.China at this time was the greatest, best organized and most civilized politicalsystem in the world. It was superior in area and population to the Roman Empireat its zenith. It was possible then for these two vast systems to flourish inthe same world at the same time in almost complete ignorance of each other. Themeans of communication both by sea and land was not yet sufficiently developedand organized for them to come to a direct clash.Yet they reacted upon each other in a very remarkable way, and their influenceupon the fate of the regions that lay between them, upon central Asia and India,was profound. A certain amount of trade trickled through, by camel caravansacross Persia, for example, and by coasting ships by way of India and the RedSea. In 66 B.C. Roman troops under Propey followed in the footsteps of Alexanderthe Great, and marched up the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea. In 102 A.D. aChinese expeditionary force under Pan Chau reached the Caspian, and sentemissaries to report upon the power of Rome. But many centuries were still topass before definite knowledge and direct intercourse were to link the greatparallel worlds of Europe and Eastern Asia.To the north of both these great empires were barbaric wildernesses. What is nowGermany was largely forest lands; the forests extended far into Russia and madea home for the gigantic aurochs, a bull of almost elephantine size. Then to thenorth of the great mountain masses of Asia stretched a band of deserts, steppesand then forests and frozen lands. In the eastward lap of the elevated part ofAsia was the great triangle of Manchuria. Large parts of these regions,stretching between South Russia and Turkestan into Manchuria, were and areregions of exceptional climatic insecurity. Their rainfall has varied greatly inthe course of a few centuries. They are lands treacherous to man. For years theywill carry pasture and sustain cultivation, and then will come an age of declinein humidity and a cycle of killing droughts.The western part of this barbaric north from the German forests to South Russiaand Turkestan and from Gothland to the Alps was the region of origin of theNordic peoples and of the Aryan speech. The eastern steppes and deserts ofMongolia was the region of origin of the Hunnish or Mongolian or Tartar orTurkish peoples-for all these several peoples were akin in language, race, andway of life. And as the Nordic peoples seem to have been continually overflowingtheir own borders and pressing south upon the developing civilizations ofMesopotamia and the Mediterranean coast, so the Hunnish tribes sent theirsurplus as wanderers, raiders and conquerors into the settled regions of China.Periods of plenty in the north would mean an increase in population there; ashortage of grass, a spell of cattle disease, would drive the hungry warliketribesmen south.For a time there were simultaneously two fairly effective Empires in the worldcapable of holding back the barbarians and even forcing forward the frontiers ofthe imperial peace. The thrust of the Han empire from north China into Mongoliawas strong and continuous. The Chinese population welled up over the barrier ofthe Great Wall. Behind the imperial frontier guards came the Chinese farmer withhorse and plough, ploughing up the grass lands and enclosing the winter pasture.The Hunnish peoples raided and murdered the settlers, but the Chinese punitiveexpeditions were too much for them. The nomads were faced with the choice ofsettling down to the plough and becoming Chinese tax-payers or shifting insearch of fresh summer pastures. Some took the former course and were absorbed.Some drifted north-eastward and eastward over the mountain passes down intowestern Turkestan.This westward drive of the Mongolian horsemen was going on from 200 B.C. onward.It was producing a westward pressure upon the Aryan tribes, and these again werepressing upon the Roman frontiers ready to break through directly there was anyweakness apparent. The Parthians, who were apparently a Scythian people withsome Mongolian admixture, came down to the Euphrates by the first century B.C.They fought against Pompey the Great in his eastern raid. They defeated andkilled Crassus. They replaced the Seleucid monarchy in Persia by a dynasty ofParthian kings, the Arsacid dynasty.But for a time the line of least resistance for hungry nomads lay neither to thewest nor the east but through central Asia and then south-eastward through theKhyber Pass into India. It was India which received the Mongolian drive in thesecenturies of Roman and Chinese strength. A series of raiding conquerors poureddown through the Punjab into the great plains to loot and destroy. The empire ofAsoka was broken up, and for a time the history of India passes into darkness. Acertain Kushan dynasty founded by the \"Indo-Scythians\"-one of the raidingpeoples-ruled for a time over North India and maintained a certain order. Theseinvasions went on for several centuries. For a large part of the fifth centuryA.D. India was afflicted by the Ephthalites or White Huns, who levied tribute onthe small Indian princes and held India in terror. Every summer theseEphthalites pastured in western Turkestan, every autumn they came down throughthe passes to terrorize India.In the second century A.D. a great misfortune came upon the Roman and Chineseempires that probably weakened the resistance of both to barbarian pressure.This was a pestilence of unexampled virulence. It raged for eleven years inChina and disorganized the social framework profoundly. The Han dynasty fell,and a new age of division and confusion began from which China did not fairlyrecover until the seventh century A.D. with the coming of the great Tangdynasty.The infection spread through Asia to Europe. It raged throughout the RomanEmpire from 164 to 180 A.D. It evidently weakened the Roman imperial fabric veryseriously. We begin to hear of depopulation in the Roman provinces after this,and there was a marked deterioration in the vigour and efficiency of government.At any rate we presently find the frontier no longer invulnerable, but givingway first in this place and then in that. A new Nordic people, the Goths, comingoriginally from Gothland in Sweden, had migrated across Russia to the Volgaregion and the shores of the Black Sea and taken to the sea and piracy. By theend of the second century they may have begun to feel the westward thrust of theHuns. In 247 they crossed the Danube in a great land raid, and defeated andkilled the Emperor Decius in a battle in what is now Serbia. In 236 anotherGermanic people, the Franks, had broken bounds upon the lower Rhine, and theAlemanni had poured into Alsace. The legions in Gaul beat back their invaders,but the Goths in the Balkan peninsula raided again and again. The province ofDacia vanished from Roman history.A chill had come to the pride and confidence of Rome. In 270-275 Rome, which hadbeen an open and secure city for three centuries, was fortified by the EmperorAurelian.XXXV. THE COMMON MAN'S LIFE UNDER THE EARLY ROMAN EMPIREBEFORE we tell of how this Roman empire which was built up in the two centuriesB.C., and which flourished in peace and security from the days of AugustusCaesar onward for two centuries, fell into disorder and was broken up, it may beas well to devote some attention to the life of the ordinary people throughoutthis great realm. Our history has come down now to within 2000 years of our owntime; and the life of the civilized people, both under the Peace of Rome and thePeace of the Han dynasty, was beginning to resemble more and more clearly thelife of their civilized successors to-day.In the western world coined money was now in common use; outside the priestlyworld there were many people of independent means who were neither officials ofthe government nor priests; people travelled about more freely than they hadever done before, and there were high roads and inns for them. Compared with thepast, with the time before 500 B.C., life had become much more loose. Beforethat date civilized men had been bound to a district or country, had been boundto a tradition and lived within a very limited horizon; only the nomads tradedand travelled.But neither the Roman Peace nor the Peace of the Han dynasty meant a uniformcivilization over the large areas they controlled. There were very great localdifferences and great contrasts and inequalities of culture between one districtand another, just as there are to-day under the British Peace in India. TheRoman garrisons and colonies were dotted here and there over this great space,worshipping Roman gods and speaking the Latin language; but where there had beentowns and cities before the coming of the Romans, they went on, subordinatedindeed but managing their own affairs, and, for a time at least, worshippingtheir own gods in their own fashion. Over Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt and theHellenized East generally, the Latin language never prevailed. Greek ruled thereinvincibly. Saul of Tarsus, who became the apostle Paul, was a Jew and a Romancitizen; but he spoke and wrote Greek and not Hebrew. Even at the court of theParthian dynasty, which had overthrown the Greek Seleucids in Persia, and wasquite outside the Roman imperial boundaries, Greek was the fashionable language.In some parts of Spain and in North Africa, the Carthaginian language also heldon for a long time in spite of the destruction of Carthage. Such a town asSeville, which had been a prosperous city long before the Roman name had beenheard of, kept its Semitic goddess and preserved its Semitic speech forgenerations, in spite of a colony of Roman veterans at Italica a few miles away.Septimius Severus, who was emperor from 193 to 211 A.D., spoke Carthaginian ashis mother speech. He learnt Latin later as a foreign tongue; and it is recordedthat his sister never learnt Latin and conducted her Roman household in thePunic language.In such countries as Gaul and Britain and in provinces like Dacia (now roughlyRoumania) and Pannonia (Hungary south of the Danube), where there were nopre-existing great cities and temples and cultures, the Roman empire did however\"Latinize.\" It civilized these countries for the first time. It created citiesand towns where Latin was from the first the dominant speech, and where Romangods were served and Roman customs and fashions followed. The Roumanian,Italian, French and Spanish languages, all variations and modifications ofLatin, remain to remind us of this extension of Latin speech and customs.North-west Africa also became at last largely Latin-speaking. Egypt, Greece andthe rest of the empire to the east were never Latinized. They remained Egyptianand Greek in culture and spirit. And even in Rome, among educated men, Greek waslearnt as the language of a gentleman and Greek literature and learning werevery properly preferred to Latin.In this miscellaneous empire the ways of doing work and business were naturallyalso very miscellaneous. The chief industry of the settled world was stilllargely agriculture. We have told how in Italy the sturdy free farmers who werethe backbone of the early Roman republic were replaced by estates worked byslave labour after the Punic wars. The Greek world had had very various methodsof cultivation, from the Arcadian plan, wherein every free citizen toiled withhis own hands, to Sparta, wherein it was a dishonour to work and whereagricultural work was done by a special slave class, the Helots. But that wasancient history now, and over most of the Hellenized world the estate system andslavegangs had spread. The agricultural slaves were captives who spoke manydifferent languages so that they could not understand each other, or they wereborn slaves; they had no solidarity to resist oppression, no tradition ofrights, no knowledge, for they could not read nor write. Although they came toform a majority of the country population they never made a successfulinsurrection. The insurrection of Spartacus in the first century B.C. was aninsurrection of the special slaves who were trained for the gladiatorialcombats. The agricultural workers in Italy in the latter days of the Republicand the early Empire suffered frightful indignities; they would be chained atnight to prevent escape or have half the head shaved to make it difficult. Theyhad no wives of their own; they could be outraged, mutilated and killed by theirmasters. A master could sell his slave to fight beasts in the arena. If a slaveslew his master, all the slaves in his household and not merely the murdererwere crucified. In some parts of Greece, in Athens notably, the lot of the slavewas never quite so frightful as this, but it was still detestable. To such apopulation the barbarian invaders who presently broke through the defensive lineof the legions, came not as enemies but as liberators.The slave system had spread to most industries and to every sort of work thatcould be done by gangs. Mines and metallurgical operations, the rowing ofgalleys, road-making and big building operations were all largely slaveoccupations. And almost all domestic service was performed by slaves. There werepoor freemen men and there were reed-men in the cities and upon the countryside, working for themselves or even working for wages. They were artizans,supervisors and so forth, workers of a new money-paid class working incompetition with slave workers; but we do not know what proportion they made ofthe general population. It probably varied widely in different places and atdifferent periods. And there were also many modifications of slavery, from theslavery that was chained at night and driven with whips to the farm or quarry,to the slave whose master found it advantageous to leave him to cultivate hispatch or work his craft and own his wife like a free-man, provided he paid in asatisfactory quittance to his owner.There were armed slaves. At the opening of the period of the Punic wars, in 264B.C., the Etruscan sport of setting slaves to fight for their lives was revivedin Rome. It grew rapidly fashionable; and soon every great Roman rich man kept aretinue of gladiators, who sometimes fought in the arena but whose real businessit was to act as his bodyguard of bullies. And also there were learned slaves.The conquests of the later Republic were among the highly civilized cities ofGreece, North Africa and Asia Minor; and they brought in many highly educatedcaptives. The tutor of a young Roman of good family was usually a slave. A richman would have a Greek slave as librarian, and slave secretaries and learnedmen. He would keep his poet as he would keep a performing dog. In thisatmosphere of slavery the traditions of modern literary criticism were evolved.The slaves still boast and quarrel in our reviews. There were enterprisingpeople who bought intelligent boy slaves and had them educated for sale. Slaveswere trained as book copyists, as jewellers, and for endless skilled callings.But there were very considerable changes in the position of a slave during thefour hundred years between the opening days of conquest under the republic ofrich men and the days of disintegration that followed the great pestilence. Inthe second century B.C. war-captives were abundant, manners gross and brutal;the slave had no rights and there was scarcely an outrage the reader can imaginethat was not practised upon slaves in those days. But already in the firstcentury A.D. there was a perceptible improvement in the attitude of the Romancivilization towards slavery. Captives were not so abundant for one thing, andslaves were dearer. And slave-owners began to realize that the profit andcomfort they got from their slaves increased with the self-respect of theseunfortunates. But also the moral tone of the community was rising, and a senseof justice was becoming effective. The higher mentality of Greece was qualifyingthe old Roman harshness. Restrictions upon cruelty were made, a master might nolonger sell his slave to fight beasts, a slave was given property rights in whatwas called his peculium, slaves were paid wages as an encouragement andstimulus, a form of slave marriage was recognized. Very many forms ofagriculture do not lend themselves to gang working, or require gang workers onlyat certain seasons. In regions where such conditions prevailed the slavepresently became a serf, paying his owner part of his produce or working for himat certain seasons.When we begin to realize how essentially this great Latin and Greek-speakingRoman Empire of the first two centuries A.D. was a slave state and how small wasthe minority who had any pride or freedom in their lives, we lay our hands onthe clues to its decay and collapse. There was little of what we should callfamily life, few homes of temperate living and active thought and study; schoolsand colleges were few and far between. The free will and the free mind werenowhere to be found. The great roads, the ruins of splendid buildings, thetradition of law and power it left for the astonishment of succeedinggenerations must not conceal from us that all its outer splendour was built uponthwarted wills, stifled intelligence, and crippled and perverted desires. Andeven the minority who lorded it over that wide realm of subjugation and ofrestraint and forced labour were uneasy and unhappy in their souls; art andliterature, science and philosophy, which are the fruits of free and happyminds, waned in that atmosphere. There was much copying and imitation, anabundance of artistic artificers, much slavish pedantry among the servile men oflearning, but the whole Roman empire in four centuries produced nothing to setbeside the bold and noble intellectual activities of the comparatively littlecity of Athens during its one century of greatness. Athens decayed under theRoman sceptre. The science of Alexandria decayed. The spirit of man, it seemed,was decaying in those days.XXXVI. RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENTS UNDER THE ROMAN EMPIRETHE SOUL of man under that Latin and Greek empire of the first two centuries ofthe Christian era was a worried and frustrated soul. Compulsion and crueltyreigned; there were pride and display but little honour; little serenity orsteadfast happiness. The unfortunate were despised and wretched; the fortunatewere insecure and feverishly eager for gratifications. In a great number ofcities life centred on the red excitement of the arena, where men and beastsfought and were tormented and slain. Amphitheatres are the most characteristicof Roman ruins. Life went on in that key. The uneasiness of men's heartsmanifested itself in profound religious unrest.From the days when the Aryan hordes first broke in upon the ancientcivilizations, it was inevitable that the old gods of the temples andpriesthoods should suffer great adaptations or disappear. In the course ofhundreds of generations the agricultural peoples of the brunette civilizationshad shaped their lives and thoughts to the temple-centred life. Observances andthe fear of disturbed routines, sacrifices and mysteries, dominated their minds.Their gods seem monstrous and illogical to our modern minds because we belong toan Aryanized world, but to these older peoples these deities had the immediateconviction and vividness of things seen in an intense dream. The conquest of onecity state by another in Sumeria or early Egypt meant a change or a renaming ofgods or goddesses, but left the shape and spirit of the worship intact. Therewas no change in its general character. The figures in the dream changed, butthe dream went on and it was the same sort of dream. And the early Semiticconquerors were sufficiently akin in spirit to the Sumerians to take over thereligion of the Mesopotamian civilization they subjugated without any profoundalteration. Egypt was never indeed subjugated to the extent of a religiousrevolution. Under the Ptolemies and under the Caesars, her temples and altarsand priesthoods remained essentially Egyptian.So long as conquests went on between people of similar social and religioushabits it was possible to get over the clash between the god of this temple andregion and the god of that by a process of grouping or assimilation. If the twogods were alike in character they were identified. It was really the same godunder another name, said the priests and the people. This fusion of gods iscalled theocrasia; and the age of the great conquests of the thousand years B.C.was an age of theocrasia. Over wide areas the local gods were displaced by, orrather they were swallowed up in, a general god. So that when at last Hebrewprophets in Babylon proclaimed one God of Righteousness in all the earth men'sminds were fully prepared for that idea.But often the gods were too dissimilar for such an assimilation, and then theywere grouped together in some plausible relationship. A female god-and theaegean world before the coming of the Greek was much addicted to MotherGods-would be married to a male god, and an animal god or a star god would behumanized and the animal or astronomical aspect, the serpent or the sun or thestar, made into an ornament or a symbol. Or the god of a defeated people wouldbecome a malignant antagonist to the brighter gods. The history of theology isfull of such adaptations, compromises and rationalizations of once local gods.As Egypt developed from city states into one united kingdom there was much ofthis theocrasia. The chief god so to speak was Osiris, a sacrificial harvest godof whom Pharaoh was supposed to be the earthly incarnation. Osiris wasrepresented as repeatedly dying and rising again; he was not only the seed andthe harvest but also by a natural extension of thought the means of humanimmortality. Among his symbols was the wide-winged scarabeus beetle which buriesits eggs to rise again, and also the effulgent sun which sets to rise. Later onhe was to be identified with Apis, the sacred bull. Associated with him was thegoddess Isis. Isis was also Hathor, a cow-goddess, and the crescent moon and theStar of the sea. Osiris dies and she bears a child, Horus, who is also ahawk-god and the dawn, and who grows to become Osiris again. The effigies ofIsis represent her as bearing the infant Horus in her arms and standing on thecrescent moon. These are not logical relationships, but they were devised by thehuman mind before the development of hard and systematic thinking and they havea dream-like coherence. Beneath this triple group there are other and darkerEgyptian gods, bad gods, the dog-headed Anubis, black night and the like,devourers, tempters, enemies of god and man.Every religious system does in the course of time fit itself to the shape of thehuman soul, and there can be no doubt that out of these illogical and evenuncouth symbols, Egyptian people were able to fashion for themselves ways ofgenuine devotion and consolation. The desire for immortality was very strong inthe Egyptian mind, and the religious life of Egypt turned on that desire. TheEgyptian religion was an immortality religion as no other religion had everbeen. As Egypt went down under foreign conquerors and the Egyptian gods ceasedto have any satisfactory political significance, this craving for a life ofcompensations hereafter, intensified.After the Greek conquest, the new city of Alexandria became the centre ofEgyptian religious life, and indeed of the religious life of the whole Hellenicworld. A great temple, the Serapeum, was set up by Ptolemy I at which a sort oftrinity of gods was worshipped. These were Serapis (who was Osiris-Apisrechristened), Isis and Horus. These were not regarded as separate gods but asthree aspects of one god, and Serapis was identified with the Greek Zeus, theRoman Jupiter and the Persian sun-god. This worship spread wherever the Hellenicinfluence extended, even into North India and Western China. The idea ofimmortality, an immortality of compensations and consolation, was eagerlyreceived by a world in which the common life was hopelessly wretched. Serapiswas called \"the saviour of souls.\" \"After death,\" said the hymns of that time,\"we are still in the care of his providence.\" Isis attracted many devotees. Herimages stood in her temples, as Queen of Heaven, bearing the infant Horus in herarms. Candles were burnt before her, votive offerings were made to her, shavenpriests consecrated to celibacy waited on her altar.The rise of the Roman empire opened the western European world to this growingcult. The temples of Serapis-Isis, the chanting of the priests and the hope ofimmortal life, followed the Roman standards to Scotland and Holland. But therewere many rivals to the Serapis-Isis religion. Prominent among these wasMithraism. This was a religion of Persian origin, and it centred upon some nowforgotten mysteries about Mithras sacrificing a sacred and benevolent bull. Herewe seem to have something more primordial than the complicated and sophisticatedSerapis-Isis beliefs. We are carried back directly to the blood sacrifices ofthe heliolithic stage in human culture. The bull upon the Mithraic monumentsalways bleeds copiously from a wound in its side, and from this blood springsnew life. The votary to Mithraism actually bathed in the blood of thesacrificial bull. At his initiation he went beneath a scaffolding upon which abull was killed so that the blood could actually run down on him.Both these religions, and the same is true of many other of the numerousparallel cults that sought the allegiance of the slaves and citizens under theearlier Roman emperors, are personal religions. They aim at personal salvationand personal immortality. The older religions were not personal like that; theywere social. The older fashion of divinity was god or goddess of the city firstor of the state, and only secondarily of the individual. The sacrifices were apublic and not a private function. They concerned collective practical needs inthis world in which we live. But the Greeks first and now the Romans had pushedreligion out of politics. Guided by the Egyptian tradition religion hadretreated to the other world.These new private immortality religions took all the heart and emotion out ofthe old state religions, but they did not actually replace them. A typical cityunder the earlier Roman emperors would have a number of temples to all sorts ofgods. There might be a temple to Jupiter of the Capitol, the great god of Rome,and there would probably be one to the reigning Caesar. For the Caesars hadlearnt from the Pharaohs the possibility of being gods. In such temples a coldand stately political worship went on; one would go and make an offering andburn a pinch of incense to show one's loyalty. But it would be to the temple ofIsis, the dear Queen of Heaven, one would go with the burthen of one's privatetroubles for advice and relief. There might be local and eccentric gods.Seville, for example, long affected the worship of the old Carthaginian Venus.In a cave or an underground temple there would certainly be an altar to Mithras,attended by legionaries and slaves. And probably also there would be a synagoguewhere the Jews gathered to read their Bible and uphold their faith in the unseenGod of all the Earth.Sometimes there would be trouble with the Jews about the political side of thestate religion. They held that their God was a jealous God intolerant ofidolatry, and they would refuse to take part in the public sacrifices to Caesar.They would not even salute the Roman standards for fear of idolatry.In the East long before the time of Buddha there had been ascetics, men andwomen who gave up most of the delights of life, who repudiated marriage andproperty and sought spiritual powers and an escape from the stresses andmortifications of the world in abstinence, pain and solitude. Buddha himself sethis face against ascetic extravagances, but many of his disciples followed amonkish life of great severity. Obscure Greek cults practised similardisciplines even to the extent of self-mutilation. Asceticism appeared in theJewish communities of Judea and Alexandria also in the first century B.C.Communities of men abandoned the world and gave themselves to austerities andmystical contemplation. Such was the sect of the Essenes. Throughout the firstand second centuries A.D. there was an almost world-wide resort to suchrepudiations of life, a universal search for \"salvation\" from the distresses ofthe time. The old sense of an established order, the old confidence in priestand temple and law and custom, had gone. Amidst the prevailing slavery, cruelty,fear, anxiety, waste, display and hectic self-indulgence, went this epidemic ofself-disgust and mental insecurity, this agonized search for peace even at theprice of renunciation and voluntary suffering. This it was that filled theSerapeum with weeping penitents and brought the converts into the gloom and goreof the Mithraic cave.XXXVII. THE TEACHING OF JESUSIT was while Augustus Caesar, the first of the Emperors, was reigning in Romethat Jesus who is the Christ of Christianity was born in Judea. In his name areligion was to arise which was destined to become the official religion of theentire Roman Empire.Now it is on the whole more convenient to keep history and theology apart. Alarge proportion of the Christian world believes that Jesus was an incarnationof that God of all the Earth whom the Jews first recognized. The historian, ifhe is to remain historian, can neither accept nor deny that interpretation.Materially Jesus appeared in the likeness of a man, and it is as a man that thehistorian must deal with him.He appeared in Judea in the reign of Tiberius Caesar. He was a prophet. Hepreached after the fashion of the preceding Jewish prophets. He was a man ofabout thirty, and we are in the profoundest ignorance of his manner of lifebefore his preaching began.Our only direct sources of information about the life and teaching of Jesus arethe four Gospels. All four agree in giving us a picture of a very definitepersonality. One is obliged to say, \"Here was a man. This could not have beeninvented.\"But just as the personality of Gautama Buddha has been distorted and obscured bythe stiff squatting figure, the gilded idol of later Buddhism, so one feels thatthe lean and strenuous personality of Jesus is much wronged by the unreality andconventionality that a mistaken reverence has imposed upon his figure in modernChristian art. Jesus was a penniless teacher, who wandered about the dustysun-bit country of Judea, living upon casual gifts of food; yet he is alwaysrepresented clean, combed and sleek, in spotless raiment, erect and withsomething motionless about him as though he was gliding through the air. Thisalone has made him unreal and incredible to many people who cannot distinguishthe core of the story from the ornamental and unwise additions of theunintelligently devout.We are left, if we do strip this record of these difficult accessories. with thefigure of a being, very human, very earnest and passionate, capable of swiftanger, and teaching a new and simple and profound doctrine-namely, the universalloving Fatherhood of God and the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven. He was clearlya person-to use a common phrase-of intense personal magnetism. He attractedfollowers and filled them with love and courage. Weak and ailing people wereheartened and healed by his presence. Yet he was probably of a delicatephysique, because of the swiftness with which he died under the pains ofcrucifixion. There is a tradition that he fainted when, according to the custom,he was made to bear his cross to the place of execution. He went about thecountry for three years spreading his doctrine and then he came to Jerusalem andwas accused of trying to set up a strange kingdom in Judea; he was tried uponthis charge, and crucified together with two thieves. Long before these two weredead his sufferings were over.The doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, which was the main teaching of Jesus, iscertainly one of the most revolutionary doctrines that ever stirred and changedhuman thought. It is small wonder if the world of that time failed to grasp itsfull significance, and recoiled in dismay from even a half apprehension of itstremendous challenges to the established habits and institutions of mankind. Forthe doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, as Jesus seems to have preached it, wasno less than a bold and uncompromising demand for a complete change andcleansing of the life of our struggling race, an utter cleansing, without andwithin. To the gospels the reader must go for all that is preserved of thistremendous teaching; here we are only concerned with the jar of its impact uponestablished ideas.The Jews were persuaded that God, the one God of the whole world, was arighteous god, but they also thought of him as a trading god who had made abargain with their Father Abraham about them, a very good bargain indeed forthem, to bring them at last to predominance in the earth. With dismay and angerthey heard Jesus sweeping away their dear securities. God, he taught, was nobargainer; there were no chosen people and no favourites in the Kingdom ofHeaven. God was the loving father of all life, as incapable of showing favour asthe universal sun. And all men were brothers-sinners alike and beloved sonsalike-of this divine father. In the parable of the Good Samaritan Jesus castscorn upon that natural tendency we all obey, to glorify our own people and tominimize the righteousness of other creeds and other races. In the parable ofthe labourers he thrust aside the obstinate claim of the Jews to have a specialclaim upon God. All whom God takes into the kingdom, he taught, God servesalike; there is no distinction in his treatment, because there is no measure tohis bounty. From all, moreover, as the parable of the buried talent witnesses,and as the incident of the widow's mite enforces, he demands the utmost. Thereare no privileges, no rebates and no excuses in the Kingdom of Heaven.But it is not only the intense tribal patriotism of the Jews that Jesusoutraged. They were a people of intense family loyalty, and he would have sweptaway all the narrow and restrictive family affections in the great flood of thelove of God. The whole kingdom of Heaven was to be the family of his followers.We are told that, \"While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and hisbrethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. Then one said unto him,Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who aremy brethren? And he stretched forth his hands towards his disciples, and said,Behold my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of my Fatherwhich is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.\"And not only did Jesus strike at patriotism and the bonds of family loyalty inthe name of God's universal fatherhood and brotherhood of all mankind, but it isclear that his teaching condemned all the gradations of the economic system, allprivate wealth, and personal advantages. All men belonged to the kingdom; alltheir possessions belonged to the kingdom; the righteous life for all men, theonly righteous life, was the service of God's will with all that we had, withall that we were. Again and again he denounced private riches and thereservation of any private life.\"And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled tohim, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternallife? And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good butone, that is God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do notkill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy fatherand mother. And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these things have Iobserved from my youth. Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him,One thing thou lackest; go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to thepoor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, andfollow me. And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he hadgreat possessions.\"And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shallthey that have riches enter into the Kingdom of God! And the disciples wereastonished at his words. But Jesus answered again, and saith unto them,Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the Kingdomof God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for arich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.\"Moreover, in his tremendous prophecy of this kingdom which was to make all menone together in God, Jesus had small patience for the bargaining righteousnessof formal religion. Another large part of his recorded utterances is aimedagainst the meticulous observance of the rules of the pious career. \"Then thePharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to thetradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? He answered and saidunto them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written,\"This people honoureth me with their lips, \"But their heart is far from me.\"Howbeit in vain do they worship me, \"Teaching for doctrines the commandments ofmen.\"For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as thewashing of pots and cups: and many other such things ye do. And he said untothem, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your owntradition.\"It was not merely a moral and a social revolution that Jesus proclaimed; it isclear from a score of indications that his teaching had a political bent of theplainest sort. It is true that he said his kingdom was not of this world, thatit was in the hearts of men and not upon a throne; but it is equally clear thatwherever and in what measure his kingdom was set up in the hearts of men, theouter world would be in that measure revolutionized and made new.Whatever else the deafness and blindness of his hearers may have missed in hisutterances, it is plain they did not miss his resolve to revolutionize theworld. The whole tenor of the opposition to him and the circumstances of histrial and execution show clearly that to his contemporaries he seemed to proposeplainly, and did propose plainly, to change and fuse and enlarge all human life.In view of what he plainly said, is it any wonder that all who were rich andprosperous felt a horror of strange things, a swimming of their world at histeaching? He was dragging out all the little private reservations they had madefrom social service into the light of a universal religious life. He was likesome terrible moral huntsman digging mankind out of the snug burrows in whichthey had lived hitherto. In the white blaze of this kingdom of his there was tobe no property, no privilege, no pride and precedence; no motive indeed and noreward but love. Is it any wonder that men were dazzled and blinded and criedout against him? Even his disciples cried out when he would not spare them thelight. Is it any wonder that the priests realized that between this man andthemselves there was no choice but that he or priestcraft should perish? Is itany wonder that the Roman soldiers, confronted and amazed by something soaringover their comprehension and threatening all their disciplines, should takerefuge in wild laughter, and crown him with thorns and robe him in purple andmake a mock Caesar of him? For to take him seriously was to enter upon a strangeand alarming life, to abandon habits, to control instincts and impulses, toessay an incredible happiness.Matt. xii, 46-50.Mark x. 17-25.Mark vii. 1-9.XXXVIII. THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOCTRINAL CHRISTIANITYIN the four gospels we find the personality and teachings of Jesus but verylittle of the dogmas of the Christian church. It is in the epistles, a series ofwritings by the immediate followers of Jesus, that the broad lines of Christianbelief are laid down.Chief among the makers of Christian doctrine was St. Paul. He had never seenJesus nor heard him preach. Paul's name was originally Saul, and he wasconspicuous at first as an active persecutor of the little band of disciplesafter the crucifixion. Then he was suddenly converted to Christianity, and hechanged his name to Paul. He was a man of great intellectual vigour and deeplyand passionately interested in the religious movements of the time. He was wellversed in Judaism and in the Mithraism and Alexandrian religion of the day. Hecarried over many of their ideas and terms of expression into Christianity. Hedid very little to enlarge or develop the original teaching of Jesus, theteaching of the Kingdom of Heaven. But he taught that Jesus was not only thepromised Christ, the promised leader of the Jews, but also that his death was asacrifice, like the deaths of the ancient sacrificial victims of the primordialcivilizations, for the redemption of mankind.When religions flourish side by side they tend to pick up each other'sceremonial and other outward peculiarities. Buddhism, for example, in China hasnow almost the same sort of temples and priests and uses as Taoism, whichfollows in the teachings of Lao Tse. Yet the original teachings of Buddhism andTaoism were almost flatly opposed. And it reflects no doubt or discredit uponthe essentials of Christian teaching that it took over not merely such formalthings as the shaven priest, the votive offering, the altars, candles, chantingand images of the Alexandrian and Mithraic faiths, but adopted even theirdevotional phrases and their theological Osiris, was a god who died to riseagain and give men immortality. And presently the spreading Christian communitywas greatly torn by complicated theological disputes about the relationship ofthis God Jesus to God the Father of Mankind. The Arians taught that Jesus wasdivine, but distant from and inferior to the Father. The Sabellians taught thatJesus was merely an aspect of the Father, and that God was Jesus and Father atthe same time just as a man may be a father and an artificer at the same time;and the Trinitarians taught a more subtle doctrine that God was both one andthree, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. For a time it seemed that Arianism wouldprevail over its rivals, and then after disputes, violence and wars, theTrinitarian formula became the accepted formula of all Christendom. It may befound in its completest expression in the Athanasian Creed.We offer no comment on these controversies here. They do not sway history as thepersonal teaching of Jesus sways history. The personal teaching of Jesus doesseem to mark a new phase in the moral and spiritual life of our race. Itsinsistence upon the universal Fatherhood of God and the implicit brotherhood ofall men, its insistence upon the sacredness of every human personality as aliving temple of God, was to have the profoundest effect upon all the subsequentsocial and political life of mankind. With Christianity, with the spreadingteachings of Jesus, a new respect appears in the world for man as man. It may betrue, as hostile critics of Christianity have urged, that St. Paul preachedobedience to slaves, but it is equally true that the whole spirit of theteachings of Jesus preserved in the gospels was against the subjugation of manby man. And still more distinctly was Christianity opposed to such outrages uponhuman dignity as the gladiatorial combats in the arena.Throughout the first two centuries after Christ, the Christian religion spreadthroughout the Roman Empire, weaving together an ever-growing multitude ofconverts into a new community of ideas and will. The attitude of the emperorsvaried between hostility and toleration. There were attempts to suppress thisnew faith in both the second and third centuries; and finally in 303 and thefollowing years a great persecution under the Emperor Diocletian. Theconsiderable accumulations of Church property were seized, all bibles andreligious writings were confiscated and destroyed, Christians were put out ofthe protection of the law and many executed. The destruction of the books isparticularly notable. It shows how the power of the written word in holdingtogether the new faith was appreciated by the authorities. These \"bookreligions,\" Christianity and Judaism, were religions that educated. Theircontinued existence depended very largely on people being able to read andunderstand their doctrinal ideas. The older religions had made no such appeal tothe personal intelligence. In the ages of barbaric confusion that were now athand in western Europe it was the Christian church that was mainly instrumentalin preserving the tradition of learning.The persecution of Diocletian failed completely to suppress the growingChristian community. In many provinces it was ineffective because the bulk ofthe population and many of the officials were Christian. In 317 an edict oftoleration was issued by the associated Emperor Galerius, and in 324 Constantinethe Great, a friend and on his deathbed a baptized convert to Christianity,became sole ruler of the Roman world. He abandoned all divine pretensions andput Christian symbols on the shields and banners of his troops.In a few years Christianity was securely established as the official religion ofthe empire. The competing religions disappeared or were absorbed withextraordinary celerity, and in 390 Theodosius the Great caused the great statueof Jupiter Serapis at Alexandria to be destroyed. From the outset of the fifthcentury onward the only priests or temples in the Roman Empire were Christianpriests and temples.XXXIX. THE BARBARIANS BREAK THE EMPIRE INTO EAST AND WESTTHROUGHOUT the third century the Roman Empire, decaying socially anddisintegrating morally, faced the barbarians. The emperors of this period werefighting military autocrats, and the capital of the empire shifted with thenecessities of their military policy. Now the imperial headquarters would be atMilan in north Italy, now in what is now Serbia at Sirmium or Nish, now inNicomedia in Asia Minor. Rome halfway down Italy was too far from the centre ofinterest to be a convenient imperial seat. It was a declining city. Over most ofthe empire peace still prevailed and men went about without arms. The armiescontinued to be the sole repositories of power; the emperors, dependent on theirlegions, became more and more autocratic to the rest of the empire and theirstate more and more like that of the Persian and other oriental monarchs.Diocletian assumed a royal diadem and oriental robes.All along the imperial frontier, which ran roughly along the Rhine and Danube,enemies were now pressing. The Franks and other German tribes had come up to theRhine. In north Hungary were the Vandals; in what was once Dacia and is nowRoumania, the Visigoths or West Goths. Behind these in south Russia were theEast Goths or Ostrogoths, and beyond these again in the Volga region the Alans.But now Mongolian peoples were forcing their way towards Europe. The Huns werealready exacting tribute from the Alans and Ostrogoths and pushing them to thewest.In Asia the Roman frontiers were crumpling back under the push of a renascentPersia. This new Persia, the Persia of the Sassenid kings, was to be a vigorousand on the whole a successful rival of the Roman Empire in Asia for the nextthree centuries.A glance at the map of Europe will show the reader the peculiar weakness of theempire. The river Danube comes down to within Vandals, being pressed by theGoths, asked to be received into the Roman Empire. They were assigned lands inPannonia, which is now that part of Hungary west of the Danube, and theirfighting men became nominally legionaries. But these new legionaries remainedunder their own chiefs. Rome failed to digest them.Constantine died working to reorganize his great realm, and soon the frontierswere ruptured again and the Visigoths came almost to Constantinople. Theydefeated the Emperor Valens at Adrianople and made a settlement in what is nowBulgaria, similar to the settlement of the Vandals in Pannonia. Nominally theywere subjects of the emperor, practically they were conquerors.From 379 to 395 A.D. reigned the Emperor Theodosius the Great, and while hereigned the empire was still formally intact. Over the armies of Italy andPannonia presided Stilicho, a Vandal, over the armies in the Balkan peninsula,Alaric, a Goth. When Theodosius died at the close of the fourth century he lefttwo sons. Alaric supported one of these, Arcadius, in Constantinople, andStilicho the other, Honorius, in Italy. In other words Alaric and Stilichofought for the empire with the princes as puppets. In the course of theirstruggle Alaric marched into Italy and after a short siege took Rome (410 A.D.).The opening half of the fifth century saw the whole of the Roman Empire inEurope the prey of robber armies of barbarians. It is difficult to visualize thestate of affairs in the world at that time. Over France, Spain, Italy and theBalkan peninsula, the great cities that had flourished under the early empirestill stood, impoverished, partly depopulated and falling into decay. Life inthem must have been shallow, mean and full of uncertainty. Local officialsasserted their authority and went on with their work with such conscience asthey had, no doubt in the name of a now remote and inaccessible emperor. Thechurches went on, but usually with illiterate priests. There was little readingand much superstition and fear. But everywhere except where looters haddestroyed them, books and pictures and statuary and such-like works of art werestill to be found.The life of the countryside had also degenerated. Everywhere this Roman worldwas much more weedy and untidy than it had been. In some regions war andpestilence had brought the land down to the level of a waste. Roads and forestswere infested with robbers. Into such regions the barbarians marched, withlittle or no opposition, and set up their chiefs as rulers, often with Romanofficial titles. If they were half civilized barbarians they would give theconquered districts tolerable terms, they would take possession of the towns,associate and intermarry, and acquire (with an accent) the Latin speech; but theJutes, the Angles and Saxons who submerged the Roman province of Britain wereagriculturalists and had no use for towns, they seem to have swept south Britainclear of the Romanized population and they replaced the language by their ownTeutonic dialects, which became at last English.It is impossible in the space at our disposal to trace the movements of all thevarious German and Slavonic tribes as they went to and fro in the disorganizedempire in search of plunder and a pleasant home. But let the Vandals serve as anexample. They came into history in east Germany. They settled as we have told inPannonia. Thence they moved somewhen about 425 A.D. through the interveningprovinces to Spain. There they found Visigoths from South Russia and otherGerman tribes setting up dukes and kings. From Spain the Vandals under Gensericsailed for North Africa (429), captured Carthage (439), and built a fleet. Theysecured the mastery of the sea and captured and pillaged Rome (455), which hadrecovered very imperfectly from her capture and looting by Alaric half a centuryearlier. Then the Vandals made themselves masters of Sicily, Corsica, Sardiniaand most of the other islands of the western Mediterranean. They made, in fact,a sea empire very similar in its extent to the sea empire of Carthage sevenhundred odd years before. They were at the climax of their power about 477. Theywere a mere handful of conquerors holding all this country. In the next centuryalmost all their territory had been reconquered for the empire of Constantinopleduring a transitory blaze of energy under Justinian I.The story of the Vandals is but one sample of a host of similar adventures. Butnow there was coming into the European world the least kindred and mostredoubtable of all these devastators, the Mongolian Huns or Tartars, a yellowpeople active and able, such as the western world had never before encountered.XL. THE HUNS AND THE END OF THE WESTERN EMPIRETHIS appearance of a conquering Mongolian people in Europe may be taken to marka new stage in human history. Until the last century or so before the Christianera, the Mongol and the Nordic peoples had not been in close touch. Far away inthe frozen lands beyond the northern forests the Lapps, a Mongolian people, haddrifted westward as far as Lapland, but they played no part in the main currentof history. For thousands of years the western world carried on the dramaticinterplay of the Aryan, Semitic and fundamental brunette peoples with verylittle interference (except for an Ethiopian invasion of Egypt or so) eitherfrom the black peoples to the south or from the Mongolian world in the far East.It is probable that there were two chief causes for the new westward drift ofthe nomadic Mongolians. One was the consolidation of the great empire of China,its extension northward and the increase of its population during the prosperousperiod of the Han dynasty. The other was some process of climatic change; alesser rainfall that abolished swamps and forests perhaps, or a greater rainfallthat extended grazing over desert steppes, or even perhaps both these processesgoing on in different regions but which anyhow facilitated a westward migration.A third contributary cause was the economic wretchedness, internal decay andfalling population of the Roman Empire. The rich men of the later RomanRepublic, and then the tax-gatherers of the military emperors had utterlyconsumed its vitality. So we have the factors of thrust, means and opportunity.There was pressure from the east, rot in the west and an open road.The Hun had reached the eastern boundaries of European Russia by the firstcentury A.D., but it was not until the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. thatthese horsemen rose to predominance upon the steppes. The fifth century was theHun's century. The first Huns to come into Italy were mercenary bands in the payof Stilicho the Vandal, the master of Honorius. Presently they were inpossession of Pannonia, the empty nest of the Vandals.By the second quarter of the fifth century a great war chief had arisen amongthe Huns, Attila. We have only vague and tantalizing glimpses of his power. Heruled not only over the Huns but over a conglomerate of tributary Germanictribes; his empire extended from the Rhine cross the plains into Central Asia.He exchanged ambassadors with China. His head camp was in the plain of Hungaryeast of the Danube. There he was visited by an envoy from Constantinople,Priscus, who has left us an account of his state. The way of living of theseMongols was very like the way of living of the primitive Aryans they hadreplaced. The common folk were in huts and tents; the chiefs lived in greatstockaded timber halls. There were feasts and drinking and singing by the bards.The Homeric heroes and even the Macedonian companions of Alexander wouldprobably have felt more at home in the camp-capital of Attila than they wouldhave done in the cultivated and decadent court of Theodosius II, the son ofArcadius, who was then reigning in Constantinople.For a time it seemed as though the nomads under the leadership of the Huns andAttila would play the same part towards the Graeco-Roman civilization of theMediterranean countries that the barbaric Greeks had played long ago to theaegean civilization. It looked like history repeating itself upon a largerstage. But the Huns were much more wedded to the nomadic life than the earlyGreeks, who were rather migratory cattle farmers than true nomads. The Hunsraided and plundered but did not settle.For some years Attila bullied Theodosius as he chose. His armies devastated andlooted right down to the walls of Constantinople, Gibbon says that he totallydestroyed no less than seventy cities in the Balkan peninsula, and Theodosiusbought him off by payments of tribute and tried to get rid of him for good bysending secret agents to assassinate him. In 451 Attila turned his attention tothe remains of the Latin-speaking half of the empire and invaded Gaul. Nearlyevery town in northern Gaul was sacked. Franks, Visigoths and the imperialforces united against him and he was defeated at Troyes in a vast dispersedbattle in which a multitude of men, variously estimated as between 150,000 and300,000, were killed. This checked him in Gaul, but it did not exhaust hisenormous military resources. Next year he came into Italy by way of Venetia,burnt Aquileia and Padua and looted Milan.Numbers of fugitives from these north Italian towns and particularly from Paduafled to islands in the lagoons at the head of the Adriatic and laid there thefoundations of the city state of Venice, which was to become one of the greatestof the trading centres in the middle ages.In 453 Attila died suddenly after a great feast to celebrate his marriage to ayoung woman, and at his death this plunder confederation of his fell to pieces.The actual Huns disappear from history, mixed into the surrounding more numerousAryan-speaking populations. But these great Hun raids practically consummatedthe end of the Latin Roman Empire. After his death ten different emperors ruledin Rome in twenty years, set up by Vandal and other mercenary troops. TheVandals from Carthage took and sacked Rome in 455. Finally in 476 Odoacer, thechief of the barbarian troops, suppressed a Pannonian who was figuring asemperor under the impressive name of Romulus Augustulus, and informed the Courtof Constantinople that there was no longer an emperor in the west. Soingloriously the Latin Roman Empire came to an end. In 493 Theodoric the Gothbecame King of Rome.All over western and central Europe now barbarian chiefs were reigning as kings,dukes and the like, practically independent but for the most part professingsome sort of shadowy allegiance to the emperor. There were hundreds and perhapsthousands of such practically independent brigand rulers. In Gaul, Spain andItaly and in Dacia the Latin speech still prevailed in locally distorted forms,but in Britain and east of the Rhine languages of the German group (or inBohemia a Slavonic language, Czech) were the common speech. The superior clergyand a small remnant of other educated men read and wrote Latin. Everywhere lifewas insecure and property was held by the strong arm. Castles multiplied androads fell into decay. The dawn of the sixth century was an age of division andof intellectual darkness throughout the western world. Had it not been for themonks and Christian missionaries Latin learning might have perished altogether.Why had the Roman Empire grown and why had it so completely decayed? It grewbecause at first the idea of citizenship held it together. Throughout the daysof the expanding republic, and even into the days of the early empire thereremained a great number of men conscious of Roman citizenship, feeling it aprivilege and an obligation to be a Roman citizen, confident of their rightsunder the Roman law and willing to make sacrifices in the name of Rome. Theprestige of Rome as of something just and great and law-up-holding spread farbeyond the Roman boundaries. But even as early as the Punic wars the sense ofcitizenship was being undermined by the growth of wealth and slavery.Citizenship spread indeed but not the idea of citizenship.The Roman Empire was after all a very primitive organization; it did noteducate, did not explain itself to its increasing multitudes of citizens, didnot invite their co-operation in its decisions. There was no network of schoolsto ensure a common understanding, no distribution of news to sustain collectiveactivity. The adventurers who struggled for power from the days of Marius andSulla onward had no idea of creating and calling in public opinion upon theimperial affairs. The spirit of citizenship died of starvation and no oneobserved it die. All empires, all states, all organizations of human societyare, in the ultimate, things of understanding and will. There remained no willfor the Roman Empire in the World and so it came to an end.But though the Latin-speaking Roman Empire died in the fifth century, somethingelse had been born within it that was to avail itself enormously of its prestigeand tradition, and that was the Latin-speaking half of the Catholic Church. Thislived while the empire died because it appealed to the minds and wills of men,because it had books and a great system of teachers and missionaries to hold ittogether, things stronger than any law or legions. Throughout the fourth andfifth centuries A.D. while the empire was decaying, Christianity was spreadingto a universal dominion in Europe. It conquered its conquerors, the barbarians.When Attila seemed disposed to march on Rome, the patriarch of Rome interceptedhim and did what no armies could do, turning him back by sheer moral force.The Patriarch or Pope of Rome claimed to be the head of the entire Christianchurch. Now that there were no more emperors, he began to annex imperial titlesand claims. He took the title of pontifex maximus, head sacrificial priest ofthe Roman dominion, the most ancient of all the titles that the emperors hadenjoyed.XLI. THE BYZANTINE AND SASSANID EMPIRESTHE GREEK-SPEAKING eastern half of the Roman Empire showed much more politicaltenacity than the western half. It weathered the disasters of the fifth centuryA.D., which saw a complete and final breaking up of the original Latin Romanpower. Attila bullied the Emperor Theodosius II and sacked and raided almost tothe walls of Constantinople, but that city remained intact. The Nubians camedown the Nile and looted Upper Egypt, but Lower Egypt and Alexandria were leftstill fairly prosperous. Most of Asia Minor was held against the SassanidPersians.The sixth century, which was an age of complete darkness for the West, sawindeed a considerable revival of the Greek power. Justinian I (527-565) was aruler of very great ambition and energy, and he was married to the EmpressTheodora, a woman of quite equal capacity who had begun life as an actress.Justinian reconquered North Africa from the Vandals and most of Italy from theGoths. He even regained the south of Spain. He did not limit his energies tonaval and military enterprises. He founded a university, built the great churchof Sta. Sophia in Constantinople and codified the Roman law. But in order todestroy a rival to his university foundation he closed the schools of philosophyin Athens, which had been going on in unbroken continuity from the days ofPlato, that is to say for nearly a thousand years.From the third century onwards the Persian Empire had been the steadfast rivalof the Byzantine. The two empires kept Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt in a state ofperpetual unrest and waste. In the first century A.D., these lands were still ata high level of civilization, wealthy and with an abundant population, but thecontinual coming and going of armies, massacres, looting and war taxation worethem down steadily until only shattered and ruinous cities remained upon acountryside of scattered peasants. In this melancholy process of impoverishmentand disorder lower Egypt fared perhaps less badly than the rest of the world.Alexandria, like Constantinople, continued a dwindling trade between the eastand the west.Science and political philosophy seemed dead now in both these warring anddecaying empires. The last philosophers of Athens, until their suppression,preserved the texts of the great literature of the past with an infinitereverence and want of understanding. But there remained no class of men in theworld, no free gentlemen with bold and independent habits of thought, to carryon the tradition of frank statement and enquiry embodied in these writings. Thesocial and political chaos accounts largely for the disappearance of this class,but there was also another reason why the human intelligence was sterile andfeverish during this age. In both Persia and Byzantium it was an age ofintolerance. Both empires were religious empires in a new way, in a way thatgreatly hampered the free activities of the human mind.Of course the oldest empires in the world were religious empires, centring uponthe worship of a god or of a god-king. Alexander was treated as a divinity andthe Caesars were gods in so much as they had altars and temples devoted to themand the offering of incense was made a test of loyalty to the Roman state. Butthese older religions were essentially religions of act and fact. They did notinvade the mind. If a man offered his sacrifice and bowed to the god, he wasleft not only to think but to say practically whatever he liked about theaffair. But the new sort of religions that had come into the world, andparticularly Christianity, turned inward. These new faiths demanded not simplyconformity but understanding belief. Naturally fierce controversy ensued uponthe exact meaning of the things believed. These new religions were creedreligions. The world was confronted with a new word. Orthodoxy, and with a sternresolve to keep not only acts but speech and private thought within the limitsof a set teaching. For to hold a wrong opinion, much more to convey it to otherpeople, was no longer regarded as an intellectual defect but a moral fault thatmight condemn a soul to everlasting destruction.Both Ardashir I who founded the Sassanid dynasty in the third century A.D., andConstantine the Great who reconstructed the Roman Empire in the fourth, turnedto religious organizations for help, because in these organizations they saw anew means of using and controlling the wills of men. And already before the endof the fourth century both empires were persecuting free talk and religiousinnovation. In Persia Ardashir found the ancient Persian religion of Zoroaster(or Zarathushtra) with its priests and temples and a sacred fire that burnt uponits altars, ready for his purpose as a state religion. Before the end of thethird century Zoroastrianism was persecuting Christianity, and in 277 A.D. Mani,the founder of a new faith, the Manichaeans, was crucified and his body flayed.Constantinople, on its side, was busy hunting out Christian heresies. Manichaeanideas infected Christianity and had to be fought with the fiercest methods; inreturn ideas from Christianity affected the purity of the Zoroastrian doctrine.All ideas became suspect. Science, which demands before all things the freeaction of an untroubled mind, suffered a complete eclipse throughout this phaseof intolerance.War, the bitterest theology, and the usual vices of mankind constitutedByzantine life of those days. It was picturesque, it was romantic; it had littlesweetness or light. When Byzantium and Persia were not fighting the barbariansfrom the north, they wasted Asia Minor and Syria in dreary and destructivehostilities. Even in close alliance these two empires would have found it a hardtask to turn back the barbarians and recover their prosperity. The Turks orTartars first come into history as the allies first of one power and then ofanother. In the sixth century the two chief antagonists were Justinian andChosroes I; in the opening of the seventh the Emperor Heraclius was pittedagainst Chosroes II (580).At first and until after Heraclius had become Emperor (610) Chosroes II carriedall before him. He took Antioch, Damascus and Jerusalem and his armies reachedChalcedon, which is in Asia Minor over against Constantinople. In 619 heconquered Egypt. Then Heraclius pressed a counter attack home and routed aPersian army at Nineveh (627), although at that time there were still Persiantroops at Chalcedon. In 628 Chosroes II was deposed and murdered by his son,Kavadh, and an inconclusive peace was made between the two exhausted empires.Byzantium and Persia had fought their last war. But few people as yet dreamt ofthe storm that was even then gathering in the deserts to put an end for ever tothis aimless, chronic struggle.While Heraclius was restoring order in Syria a message reached him. It had beenbrought in to the imperial outpost at Bostra south of Damascus; it was inArabic, an obscure Semitic desert language, and it was read to the Emperor, ifit reached him at all, by an interpreter. It was from someone who called himself\"Muhammad the Prophet of God.\" It called upon the Emperor to acknowledge the OneTrue God and to serve him. What the Emperor said is not recorded.A similar message came to Kavadh at Ctesiphon. He was annoyed, tore up theletter, and bade the messenger begone.This Muhammad, it appeared, was a Bedouin leader whose headquarters were in themean little desert town of Medina. He was preaching a new religion of faith inthe One True God.\"Even so, O Lord!\" he said; \"rend thou his Kingdom from Kavadh.\"XLII. THE DYNASTIES OF SUY AND TANG IN CHINATHROUGHOUT the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth centuries, there was a steadydrift of Mongolian peoples westward. The Huns of Attila were merely precursorsof this advance, which led at last to the establishment of Mongolian peoples inFinland, Esthonia, Hungary and Bulgaria, where their descendants, speakinglanguages akin to Turkish, survive to this day. The Mongolian nomads were, infact, playing a rôle towards the Aryanized civilizations of Europe and Persiaand India that the Aryans had played to the aeean and Semitic civilizations tenor fifteen centuries before.In Central Asia the Turkish peoples had taken root in what is now WesternTurkestan, and Persia already employed many Turkish officials and Turkishmercenaries. The Parthians had gone out of history, absorbed into the generalpopulation of Persia. There were no more Aryan nomads in the history of CentralAsia; Mongolian people had replaced them. The Turks became masters of Asia fromChina to the Caspian.The same great pestilence at the end of the second century A.D. that hadshattered the Roman Empire had overthrown the Han dynasty in China. Then came aperiod of division and of Hunnish conquests from which China arose refreshed,more rapidly and more completely than Europe was destined to do. Before the endof the sixth century China was reunited under the Suy dynasty, and this by thetime of Heraclius gave place to the Tang dynasty, whose reign marks anothergreat period of prosperity for China.Throughout the seventh, eighth and ninth centuries China was the most secure andcivilized country in the world. The Han dynasty had extended her boundaries inthe north; the Suy and Tang dynasties now spread her civilization to the south,and China began to assume the proportions she has to-day. In Central Asia indeedshe reached much further, extending at last, through tributary Turkish tribes,to Persia and the Caspian Sea.The new China that had arisen was a very different land from the old China ofthe Hans. A new and more vigorous literary school appeared, there was a greatpoetic revival; Buddhism had revolutionized philosophical and religious thought.There were great advances in artistic work, in technical skill and in all theamenities of life. Tea was first used, paper manufactured and wood-blockprinting began. Millions of people indeed were leading orderly, graceful andkindly lives in China during these centuries when the attenuated populations ofEurope and Western Asia were living either in hovels, small walled cities orgrim robber fortresses. While the mind of the west was black with theologicalobsessions, the mind of China was open and tolerant and enquiring.One of the earliest monarchs of the Tang dynasty was Tai-tsung, who began toreign in 627, the year of the victory of Heraclius at Nineveh. He received anembassy from Heraclius, who was probably seeking an ally in the rear of Persia.From Persia itself came a party of Christian missionaries (635). They wereallowed to explain their creed to Tai-tsung and he examined a Chinesetranslation of their Scriptures. He pronounced this strange religion acceptable,and gave permission for the foundation of a church and monastery.To this monarch also (in 628) came messengers from Muhammad. They came to Cantonon a trading ship. They had sailed the whole way from Arabia along the Indiancoasts. Unlike Heraclius and Kavadh, Tai-tsung gave these envoys a courteoushearing. He expressed his interest in their theological ideas and assisted themto build a mosque in Canton, a mosque which survives, it is said, to this day,the oldest mosque in the world.XLIII. MUHAMMAD AND ISLAMAPROPHETIC amateur of history surveying the world in the opening of the seventhcentury might have concluded very reasonably that it was only a question of afew centuries before the whole of Europe and Asia fell under Mongoliandomination. There were no signs of order or union in Western Europe, and theByzantine and Persian Empires were manifestly bent upon a mutual destruction.India also was divided and wasted. On the other hand China was a steadilyexpanding empire which probably at that time exceeded all Europe in population,and the Turkish people who were growing to power in Central Asia were disposedto work in accord with China. And such a prophecy would not have been analtogether vain one. A time was to come in the thirteenth century when aMongolian overlord would rule from the Danube to the Pacific, and Turkishdynasties were destined to reign over the entire Byzantine and Persian Empires,over Egypt and most of India.Where our prophet would have been most likely to have erred would have been inunder-estimating the recuperative power of the Latin end of Europe and inignoring the latent forces of the Arabian desert. Arabia would have seemed whatit had been for times immemorial, the refuge of small and bickering nomadictribes. No Semitic people had founded an empire now for more than a thousandyears.Then suddenly the Bedouin flared out for a brief century of splendour. Theyspread their rule and language from Spain to the boundaries of China. They gavethe world a new culture. They created a religion that is still to this day oneof the most vital forces in the world.The man who fired this Arab flame appears first in history as the young husbandof the widow of a rich merchant of the town of Mecca, named Muhammad. Until hewas forty he did very little to distinguish himself in the world. He seems tohave taken considerable interest in religious discussion. Mecca was a pagan cityat that time worshipping in particular a black stone, the Kaaba, of great reputethroughout all Arabia and a centre of pilgrimages; but there were great numbersof Jews in the country-indeed all the southern portion of Arabia professed theJewish faith-and there were Christian churches in Syria.About forty Muhammad began to develop prophetic characteristics like those ofthe Hebrew prophets twelve hundred years before him. He talked first to his wifeof the One True God, and of the rewards and punishments of virtue andwickedness. There can be no doubt that his thoughts were very stronglyinfluenced by Jewish and Christian ideas. He gathered about him a small circleof believers and presently began to preach in the town against the prevalentidolatry. This made him extremely unpopular with his fellow townsmen because thepilgrimages to the Kaaba were the chief source of such prosperity as Meccaenjoyed. He became bolder and more definite in his teaching, declaring himselfto be the last chosen prophet of God entrusted with a mission to perfectreligion. Abraham, he declared, and Jesus Christ were his forerunners. He hadbeen chosen to complete and perfect the revelation of God's will.He produced verses which he said had been communicated to him by an angel, andhe had a strange vision in which he was taken up through the Heavens to God andinstructed in his mission.As his teaching increased in force the hostility of his fellow townsmenincreased also. At last a plot was made to kill him; but he escaped with hisfaithful friend and disciple, Abu Bekr, to the friendly town of Medina whichadopted his doctrine. Hostilities followed between Mecca and Medina which endedat last in a treaty. Mecca was to adopt the worship of the One True God andaccept Muhammad as his prophet, but the adherents of the new faith were still tomake the pilgrimage to Mecca just as they had done when they were pagans. SoMuhammad established the One True God in Mecca without injuring its pilgrimtraffic. In 629 Muhammad returned to Mecca as its master, a year after he hadsent out these envoys of his to Heraclius, Tai-tsung, Kavadh and all the rulersof the earth.Then for four years more until his death in 632, Muhammad spread his power overthe rest of Arabia. He married a number of wives in his declining years, and hislife on the whole was by modern standards unedifying. He seems to have been aman compounded of very considerable vanity, greed, cunning, self-deception andquite sincere religious passion. He dictated a book of injunctions andexpositions, the Koran, which he declared was communicated to him from God.Regarded as literature or philosophy the Koran is certainly unworthy of itsalleged Divine authorship.Yet when the manifest defects of Muhammad's life and writings have been allowedfor, there remains in Islam, this faith he imposed upon the Arabs, much powerand inspiration. One is its uncompromising monotheism; its simple enthusiasticfaith in the rule and fatherhood of God and its freedom from theologicalcomplications. Another is its complete detachment from the sacrificial priestand the temple. It is an entirely prophetic religion, proof against anypossibility of relapse towards blood sacrifices. In the Koran the limited andceremonial nature of the pilgrimage to Mecca is stated beyond the possibility ofdispute, and every precaution was taken by Muhammad to prevent the deificationof himself after his death. And a third element of strength lay in theinsistence of Islam upon the perfect brotherhood and equality before God of allbelievers, whatever their colour, origin or status.These are the things that made Islam a power in human affairs. It has been saidthat the true founder of the Empire of Islam was not so much Muhammad as hisfriend and helper, Abu Bekr. If Muhammad, with his shifty character, was themind and imagination of primitive Islam, Abu Bekr was its conscience and itswill. Whenever Muhammad wavered Abu Bekr sustained him. And when Muhammad died,Abu Bekr became Caliph = successor), and with that faith that moves mountains,he set himself simply and sanely to organize the subjugation of the whole worldto Allah-with little armies of 3,000 or 4,000 Arabs-according to those lettersthe prophet had written from Medina in 628 to all the monarchs of the world.XLIV. THE GREAT DAYS OF THE ARABSTHERE follows the most amazing story of conquest in the whole history of ourrace. The Byzantine army was smashed at the battle of the Yarmuk (a tributary ofthe Jordan) in 634; and the Emperor Heraclius, his energy sapped by dropsy andhis resources exhausted by the Persian war, saw his new conquests in Syria,Damascus, Palmyra, Antioch, Jerusalem and the rest fall almost withoutresistance to the Moslim. Large elements in the population went over to Islam.Then the Moslim turned east. The Persians had found an able general in Rustam;they had a great host with a force of elephants; and for three days they foughtthe Arabs at Kadessia (637) and broke at last in headlong rout.The conquest of all Persia followed, and the Moslem Empire pushed far intoWestern Turkestan and eastward until it met the Chinese. Egypt fell almostwithout resistance to the new conquerors, who full of a fanatical belief in thesufficiency of the Koran, wiped out the vestiges of the book-copying industry ofthe Alexandria Library. The tide of conquest poured along the north coast ofAfrica to the Straits of Gibraltar and Spain. Spain was invaded in 710 and thePyrenees Mountains were reached in 720. In 732 the Arab advance had reached thecentre of France, but here it was stopped for good at the battle of Poitiers andthrust back as far as the Pyrenees again. The conquest of Egypt had given theMoslim a fleet, and for a time it looked as though they would takeConstantinople. They made repeated sea attacks between 672 and 718 but the greatcity held out against them.The Arabs had little political aptitude and no political experience, and thisgreat empire with its capital now at Damascus, which stretched from Spain toChina, was destined to break up very speedily. From the very beginning doctrinaldifferences undermined its unity. But our interest here lies not with the storyof its political disintegration but with its effect upon the human mind and uponthe general destinies of our race. The Arab intelligence had been flung acrossthe world even more swiftly and dramatically than had the Greek a thousand yearsbefore. The intellectual stimulation of the whole world west of China, thebreak-up of old ideas and development of new ones, was enormous.In Persia this fresh excited Arabic mind came into contact not only withManichaean, Zoroastrian and Christian doctrine, but with the scientific Greekliterature, preserved not only in Greek but in Syrian translations. It foundGreek learning in Egypt also. Everywhere, and particularly in Spain, itdiscovered an active Jewish tradition of speculation and discussion. In CentralAsia it met Buddhism and the material achievements of Chinese civilization. Itlearnt the manufacture of paper-which made printed books possible-from theChinese. And finally it came into touch with Indian mathematics and philosophy.Very speedily the intolerant self-sufficiency of the early days of faith, whichmade the Koran seem the only possible book, was dropped. Learning sprang upeverywhere in the footsteps of the Arab conquerors. By the eighth century therewas an educational organization throughout the whole \"Arabized\" world. In theninth learned men in the schools of Cordoba in Spain were corresponding withlearned men in Cairo, Bagdad, Bokhara and Samarkand. The Jewish mind assimilatedvery readily with the Arab, and for a time the two Semitic races worked togetherthrough the medium of Arabic. Long after the political break-up and enfeeblementof the Arabs, this intellectual community of the Arab-speaking world endured. Itwas still producing very considerable results in the thirteenth century.So it was that the systematic accumulation and criticism of facts which wasfirst begun by the Greeks was resumed in this astonishing renascence of theSemitic world. The seed of Aristotle and the museum of Alexandria that had lainso long inactive and neglected now germinated and began to grow towardsfruition. Very great advances were made in mathematical, medical and physicalscience.The clumsy Roman numerals were ousted by the Arabic figures we use to this dayand the zero sign was first employed. The very name algebra is Arabic. So is theword chemistry. The names of such stars as Algol, Aldebaran and Boötes preservethe traces of Arab conquests in the sky. Their philosophy was destined toreanimate the medieval philosophy of France and Italy and the whole Christianworld.The Arab experimental chemists were called alchemists, and they were stillsufficiently barbaric in spirit to keep their methods and results secret as faras possible. They realized from the very beginning what enormous advantagestheir possible discoveries might give them, and what far-reaching consequencesthey might have on human life. They came upon many metallurgical and technicaldevices of the utmost value, alloys and dyes, distilling, tinctures andessences, optical glass; but the two chief ends they sought, they sought invain. One was \"the philosopher's stone\"-a means of changing the metallicelements one into another and so getting a control of artificial gold, and theother was the elixir vitoe, a stimulant that would revivify age and prolong lifeindefinitely. The crabbed patient experimenting of these Arab alchemists spreadinto the Christian world. The fascination of their enquiries spread. Verygradually the activities of these alchemists became more social andco-operative. They found it profitable to exchange and compare ideas. Byinsensible gradations the last of the alchemists became the first of theexperimental philosophers.The old alchemists sought the philosopher's stone which was to transmute basemetals to gold, and an elixir of immortality; they found the methods of modernexperimental science which promise in the end to give man illimitable power overthe world and over his own destiny.XLV. THE DEVELOPMENT OF LATIN CHRISTENDOMIT is worth while to note the extremely shrunken dimensions of the share of theworld remaining under Aryan control in the seventh and eighth centuries. Athousand years before, the Aryan-speaking races were triumphant over all thecivilized world west of China. Now the Mongol had thrust as far as Hungary,nothing of Asia remained under Aryan rule except the Byzantine dominions in AsiaMinor, and all Africa was lost and nearly all Spain. The great Hellenic worldhad shrunken to a few possessions round the nucleus of the trading city ofConstantinople, and the memory of the Roman world was kept alive by the Latin ofthe western Christian priests. In vivid contrast to this tale of retrogression,the Semitic tradition had risen again from subjugation and obscurity after athousand years of darkness.Yet the vitality of the Nordic peoples was not exhausted. Confined now toCentral and North-Western Europe and terribly muddled in their social andpolitical ideas, they were nevertheless building up gradually and steadily a newsocial order and preparing unconsciously for the recovery of a power even moreextensive than that they had previously enjoyed.We have told how at the beginning of the sixth century there remained no centralgovernment in Western Europe at all. That world was divided up among numbers oflocal rulers holding their own as they could. This was too insecure a state ofaffairs to last; a system of co-operation and association grew up in thisdisorder, the feudal system, which has left its traces upon European life up tothe present time. This feudal system was a sort of crystallization of societyabout power. Everywhere the lone man felt insecure and was prepared to barter acertain amount of his liberty for help and protection. He sought a stronger manas his lord and protector; he gave him military services and paid him dues, andin return he was confirmed in his possession of what was his. His lord againfound safety in vassalage to a still greater lord. Cities also found itconvenient to have feudal protectors, and monasteries and church estates boundthemselves by similar ties. No doubt in many cases allegiance was claimed beforeit was offered; the system grew downward as well as upward. So a sort ofpyramidal system grew up, varying widely in different localities, permitting atfirst a considerable play of violence and private warfare but making steadilyfor order and a new reign of law. The pyramids grew up until some becamerecognizable as kingdoms. Already by the early sixth century a Frankish kingdomexisted under its founder Clovis in what is now France and the Netherlands, andpresently Visigothic and Lombard and Gothic kingdoms were in existence.The Moslim when they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this Frankish kingdomunder the practical rule of Charles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of adegenerate descendant of Clovis, and experienced the decisive defeat of Poitiers(732) at his hands. This Charles Martel was practically overlord of Europe northof the Alps from the Pyrenees to Hungary. He ruled over a multitude ofsubordinate lords speaking French-Latin, and High and Low German languages. Hisson Pepin extinguished the last descendants of Clovis and took the kingly stateand title. His grandson Charlemagne, who began to reign in 768, found himselflord of a realm so large that he could think of reviving the title of LatinEmperor. He conquered North Italy and made himself master of Rome.Approaching the story of Europe as we do from the wider horizons of a worldhistory we can see much more distinctly than the mere nationalist historian howcramping and disastrous this tradition of the Latin Roman Empire was. A narrowintense struggle for this phantom predominance was to consume European energyfor more than a thousand years. Through all that period it is possible to tracecertain unquenchable antagonisms; they run through the wits of Europe like theobsessions of a demented mind. One driving force was this ambition of successfulrulers, which Charlemagne (Charles the Great) embodied, to become Caesar. Therealm of Charlemagne consisted of a complex of feudal German states at variousstages of barbarism. West of the Rhine, most of these German peoples had learntto speak various Latinized dialects which fused at last to form French. East ofthe Rhine, the racially similar German peoples did not lose their German speech.On account of this, communication was difficult between these two groups ofbarbarian conquerors and a split easily brought about. The split was made themore easy by the fact that the Frankish usage made it seem natural to divide theempire of Charlemagne among his sons at his death. So one aspect of the historyof Europe from the days of Charlemagne onwards is a history of first thismonarch and his family and then that, struggling to a precarious headship of thekings, princes, dukes, bishops and cities of Europe, while a steadily deepeningantagonism between the French and German speaking elements develops in themedley. There was a formality of election for each emperor; and the climax ofhis ambition was to struggle to the possession of that worn-out, misplacedcapital Rome and to a coronation there.The next factor in the European political disorder was the resolve of the Churchat Rome to make no temporal prince but the Pope of Rome himself emperor ineffect. He was already pontifex maximus; for all practical purposes he held thedecaying city; if he had no armies he had at least a vast propagandaorganization in his priests throughout the whole Latin world; if he had littlepower over men's bodies he held the keys of heaven and hell in theirimaginations and could exercise much influence upon their souls. So throughoutthe middle ages while one prince manoeuvred against another first for equality,then for ascendancy, and at last for the supreme prize, the Pope of Rome,sometimes boldly, sometimes craftily, sometimes feebly-for the Popes were asuccession of oldish men and the average reign of a Pope was not more than twoyears-manoeuvred for the submission of all the princes to himself as theultimate overlord of Christendom.But these antagonisms of prince against prince and of Emperor against Pope donot by any means exhaust the factors of the European confusion. There was stillan Emperor in Constantinople speaking Greek and claiming the allegiance of allEurope. When Charlemagne sought to revive the empire, it was merely the Latinend of the empire he revived. It was natural that a sense of rivalry betweenLatin Empire and Greek Empire should develop very readily. And still morereadily did the rivalry of Greek-speaking Christianity and the newerLatin-speaking version develop. The Pope of Rome claimed to be the successor ofSt. Peter, the chief of the apostles of Christ, and the head of the Christiancommunity everywhere. Neither the emperor nor the patriarch in Constantinoplewere disposed to acknowledge this claim. A dispute about a fine point in thedoctrine of the Holy Trinity consummated a long series of dissensions in a finalrupture in 1054. The Latin Church and the Greek Church became and remainedthereafter distinct and frankly antagonistic. This antagonism must be added tothe others in our estimate of the conflicts that wasted Latin Christendom in themiddle ages.Upon this divided world of Christendom rained the blows of three sets ofantagonists. About the Baltic and North Seas remained a series of Nordic tribeswho were only very slowly and reluctantly Christianized; these were theNorthmen. They had taken to the sea and piracy, and were raiding all theChristian coasts down to Spain. They had pushed up the Russian rivers to thedesolate central lands and brought their shipping over into the south-flowingrivers. They had come out upon the Caspian and Black Seas as pirates also. Theyset up principalities in Russia; they were the first people to be calledRussians. These Northmen Russians came near to taking Constantinople. England inthe early ninth century was a Christianized Low German country under a king,Egbert, a protégé and pupil of Charlemagne. The Northmen wrested half thekingdom from his successor Alfred the Great (886), and finally under Canute(1016) made themselves masters of the whole land. Under Rolph the Ganger (912)another band of Northmen conquered the north of France, which became Normandy.Canute ruled not only over England but over Norway and Denmark, but his briefempire fell to pieces at his death through that political weakness of thebarbaric peoples-division among a ruler's sons. It is interesting to speculatewhat might have happened if this temporary union of the Northmen had endured.They were a race of astonishing boldness and energy. They sailed in theirgalleys even to Iceland and Greenland. They were the first Europeans to land onAmerican soil. Later on Norman adventurers were to recover Sicily from theSaracens and sack Rome. It is a fascinating thing to imagine what a greatnorthern sea-faring power might have grown out of Canute's kingdom, reachingfrom America to Russia.To the east of the Germans and Latinized Europeans was a medley of Slav tribesand Turkish peoples. Prominent among these were the Magyars or Hungarians whowere coming westward throughout the eighth and ninth centuries. Charlemagne heldthem for a time, but after his death they established themselves in what is nowHungary; and after the fashion of their kindred predecessors, the Huns, raidedevery summer into the settled parts of Europe. In 938 they went through Germanyinto France, crossed the Alps into North Italy, and so came home, burning,robbing and destroying.Finally pounding away from the south at the vestiges of the Roman Empire werethe Saracens. They had made themselves largely masters of the sea; their onlyformidable adversaries upon the water were the Northmen, the Russian Northmenout of the Black Sea and the Northmen of the west.Hemmed in by these more vigorous and aggressive peoples, amidst forces they didnot understand and dangers they could not estimate, Charlemagne and after him aseries of other ambitious spirits took up the futile drama of restoring theWestern Empire under the name of the Holy Roman Empire. From the time ofCharlemagne onward this idea obsessed the political life of Western Europe,while in the East the Greek half of the Roman power decayed and dwindled untilat last nothing remained of it at all but the corrupt trading city ofConstantinople and a few miles of territory about it. Politically the continentof Europe remained traditional and uncreative from the time of Charlemagneonward for a thousand years.The name of Charlemagne looms large in European history but his personality isbut indistinctly seen. He could not read nor write, but he had a considerablerespect for learning; he liked to be read aloud to at meals and he had aweakness for theological discussion. At his winter quarters at Aix-la-Chapelleor Mayence he gathered about him a number of learned men and picked up much fromtheir conversation. In the summer he made war, against the Spanish Saracens,against the Slavs and Magyars, against the Saxons, and other still heathenGerman tribes. It is doubtful whether the idea of becoming Caesar in successionto Romulus Augustulus occurred to him before his acquisition of North Italy, orwhether it was suggested to him by Pope Leo III, who was anxious to make theLatin Church independent of Constantinople.There were the most extraordinary manoeuvres at Rome between the Pope and theprospective emperor in order to make it appear or not appear as if the Pope gavehim the imperial crown. The Pope succeeded in crowning his visitor and conquerorby surprise in St. Peter's on Christmas Day 800 A.D. He produced a crown, put iton the head of Charlemagne and hailed him Caesar and Augustus. There was greatapplause among the people. Charlemagne was by no means pleased at the way inwhich the thing was done, it rankled in his mind as a defeat; and he left themost careful instructions to his son that he was not to let the Pope crown himemperor; he was to seize the crown into his own hands and put it on his own headhimself. So at the very outset of this imperial revival we see beginning theage-long dispute of Pope and Emperor for priority. But Louis the Pious, the sonof Charlemagne, disregarded his father's instructions and was entirelysubmissive to the Pope.The empire of Charlemagne fell apart at the death of Louis the Pious and thesplit between the French-speaking Franks and the German-speaking Franks widened.The next emperor to arise was Otto, the son of a certain Henry the Fowler, aSaxon, who had been elected King of Germany by an assembly of German princes andprelates in 919. Otto descended upon Rome and was crowned emperor there in 962.This Saxon line came to an end early in the eleventh century and gave place toother German rulers. The feudal princes and nobles to the west who spoke variousFrench dialects did not fall under the sway of these German emperors after theCarlovingian line, the line that is descended from Charlemagne, had come to anend, and no part of Britain ever came into the Holy Roman Empire. The Duke ofNormandy, the King of France and a number of lesser feudal rulers remainedoutside.In 987 the Kingdom of France passed out of the possession of the Carlovingianline into the hands of Hugh Capet, whose descendants were still reigning in theeighteenth century. At the time of Hugh Capet the King of France ruled only acomparatively small territory round Paris.In 1066 England was attacked almost simultaneously by an invasion of theNorwegian Northmen under King Harold Hardrada and by the Latinized Northmenunder the Duke of Normandy. Harold King of England defeated the former at thebattle of Stamford Bridge, and was defeated by the latter at Hastings. Englandwas conquered by the Normans, and so cut off from Scandinavian, Teutonic andRussian affairs, and brought into the most intimate relations and conflicts withthe French. For the next four centuries the English were entangled in theconflicts of the French feudal princes and wasted upon the fields of France.XLVI. THE CRUSADES AND THE AGE OF PAPAL DOMINIONIT is interesting to note that Charlemagne corresponded with the CaliphHaroun-al-Raschid, the Haroun-al-Raschid of the Arabian Nights. It is recordedthat Haroun-al-Raschid sent ambassadors from Bagdad-which had now replacedDamascus as the Moslem capital-with a splendid tent, a water clock, an elephantand the keys of the Holy Sepulchre. This latter present was admirably calculatedto set the Byzantine Empire and this new Holy Roman Empire by the ears as towhich was the proper protector of the Christians in Jerusalem.These presents remind us that while Europe in the ninth century was still aweltering disorder of war and pillage, there flourished a great Arab Empire inEgypt and Mesopotamia, far more civilized than anything Europe could show. Hereliterature and science still lived; the arts flourished, and the mind of mancould move without fear or superstition. And even in Spain and North Africawhere the Saracenic dominions were falling into political confusion there was avigorous intellectual life. Aristotle was read and discussed by these Jews andArabs during these centuries of European darkness. They guarded the neglectedseeds of science and philosophy.North-east of the Caliph's dominions was a number of Turkish tribes. They hadbeen converted to Islam, and they held the faith much more simply and fiercelythan the actively intellectual Arabs and Persians to the south. In the tenthcentury the Turks were growing strong and vigorous while the Arab power wasdivided and decaying. The relations of the Turks to the Empire of the Caliphatebecame very similar to the relations of the Medes to the last Babylonian Empirefourteen centuries before. In the eleventh century a group of Turkish tribes,the Seljuk Turks, came down into Mesopotamia and made the Caliph their nominalruler but really their captive and tool. They conquered Armenia. Then theystruck at the remnants of the Byzantine power in Asia Minor. In 1071 theByzantine army was utterly smashed at the battle of Melasgird, and the Turksswept forward until not a trace of Byzantine rule remained in Asia. They tookthe fortress of Nicaea over against Constantinople, and prepared to attempt thatcity.The Byzantine emperor, Michael VII, was overcome with terror. He was alreadyheavily engaged in warfare with a band of Norman adventurers who had seizedDurazzo, and with a fierce Turkish people, the Petschenegs, who were raidingover the Danube. In his extremity he sought help where he could, and it isnotable that he did not appeal to the western emperor but to the Pope of Rome asthe head of Latin Christendom. He wrote to Pope Gregory VII, and his successorAlexius Comnenus wrote still more urgently to Urban II.This was not a quarter of a century from the rupture of the Latin and Greekchurches. That controversy was still vividly alive in men's minds, and thisdisaster to Byzantium must have presented itself to the Pope as a supremeopportunity for reasserting the supremacy of the Latin Church over thedissentient Greeks. Moreover this occasion gave the Pope a chance to deal withtwo other matters that troubled western Christendom very greatly. One was thecustom of \"private war\" which disordered social life, and the other was thesuperabundant fighting energy of the Low Germans and Christianized Northmen andparticularly of the Franks and Normans. A religious war, the Crusade, the War ofthe Cross, was preached against the Turkish captors of Jerusalem, and a truce toall warfare amongst Christians (1095). The declared object of this war was therecovery of the Holy Sepulchre from the unbelievers. A man called Peter theHermit carried on a popular propaganda throughout France and Germany on broadlydemocratic lines. He went clad in a coarse garment, barefooted on an ass, hecarried a huge cross and harangued the crowd in street or market-place orchurch. He denounced the cruelties practised upon the Christian pilgrims by theTurks, and the shame of the Holy Sepulchre being in any but Christian hands. Thefruits of centuries of Christian teaching became apparent in the response. Agreat wave of enthusiasm swept the western world, and popular Christendomdiscovered itself.Such a widespread uprising of the common people in relation to a single idea asnow occurred was a new thing in the history of our race. There is nothing toparallel it in the previous history of the Roman Empire or of India or China. Ona smaller scale, however, there had been similar movements among the Jewishpeople after their liberation from the Babylonian captivity, and later on Islamwas to display a parallel susceptibility to collective feeling. Such movementswere certainly connected with the new spirit that had come into life with thedevelopment of the missionary-teaching religions. The Hebrew prophets, Jesus andhis disciples, Mani, Muhammad, were all exhorters of men's individual souls.They brought the personal conscience face to face with God. Before that timereligion had been much more a business of fetish, of pseudoscience, than ofconscience. The old kind of religion turned upon temple, initiated priest andmystical sacrifice, and ruled the common man like a slave by fear. The new kindof religion made a man of him.The preaching of the First Crusade was the first stirring of the common peoplein European history. It may be too much to call it the birth of moderndemocracy, but certainly at that time modern democracy stirred. Before very longwe shall find it stirring again, and raising the most disturbing social andreligious questions.Certainly this first stirring of democracy ended very pitifully and lamentably.Considerable bodies of common people, crowds rather than armies, set outeastward from France and the Rhineland and Central Europe without waiting forleaders or proper equipment to rescue the Holy Sepulchre. This was the \"people'scrusade.\" Two great mobs blundered into Hungary, mistook the recently convertedMagyars for pagans, committed atrocities and were massacred. A third multitudewith a similarly confused mind, after a great pogrom of the Jews in theRhineland, marched eastward, and was also destroyed in Hungary. Two other hugecrowds, under the leadership of Peter the Hermit himself, reachedConstantinople, crossed the Bosphorus, and were massacred rather than defeatedby the Seljuk Turks. So began and ended this first movement of the Europeanpeople, as people.Next year (1097) the real fighting forces crossed the Bosphorus. Essentiallythey were Norman in leadership and spirit. They stormed Nicaea, marched by muchthe same route as Alexander had followed fourteen centuries before, to Antioch.The siege of Antioch kept them a year, and in June 1099 they invested Jerusalem.It was stormed after a month's siege. The slaughter was terrible. Men riding onhorseback were splashed by the blood in the streets. At nightfall on July 15ththe Crusaders had fought their way into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre andovercome all opposition there: blood-stained, weary and \"sobbing from excess ofjoy\" they knelt down in prayer.Immediately the hostility of Latin and Greek broke out again. The Crusaders werethe servants of the Latin Church, and the Greek patriarch of Jerusalem foundhimself in a far worse case under the triumphant Latins than under the Turks.The Crusaders discovered themselves between Byzantine and Turk and fightingboth. Much of Asia Minor was recovered by the Byzantine Empire, and the Latinprinces were left, a buffer between Turk and Greek, with Jerusalem and a fewsmall principalities, of which Edessa was one of the chief, in Syria. Their gripeven on these possessions was precarious, and in 1144 Edessa fell to the Moslim,leading to an ineffective Second Crusade, which failed to recover Edessa butsaved Antioch from a similar fate.In 1169 the forces of Islam were rallied under a Kurdish adventurer namedSaladin who had made himself master of Egypt. He preached a Holy War against theChristians, recaptured Jerusalem in 1187, and so provoked the Third Crusade.This failed to recover Jerusalem. In the Fourth Crusade (1202-4) the LatinChurch turned frankly upon the Greek Empire, and there was not even a pretenceof fighting the Turks. It started from Venice and in 1204 it stormedConstantinople. The great rising trading city of Venice was the leader in thisadventure, and most of the coasts and islands of the Byzantine Empire wereannexed by the Venetians. A \"Latin\" emperor (Baldwin of Flanders) was set up inConstantinople and the Latin and Greek Church were declared to be reunited. TheLatin emperors ruled in Constantinople from 1204 to 1261 when the Greek worldshook itself free again from Roman predominance.The twelfth century then and the opening of the thirteenth was the age of papalascendancy just as the eleventh was the age of the ascendancy of the SeljukTurks and the tenth the age of the Northmen. A united Christendom under the ruleof the Pope came nearer to being a working reality than it ever was before orafter that time.In those centuries a simple Christian faith was real and widespread over greatareas of Europe. Rome itself had passed through some dark and discreditablephases; few writers can be found to excuse the lives of Popes John XI and JohnXII in the tenth century; they were abominable creatures; but the heart and bodyof Latin Christendom had remained earnest and simple; the generality of thecommon priests and monks and nuns had lived exemplary and faithful lives. Uponthe wealth of confidence such lives created rested the power of the church.Among the great Popes of the past had been Gregory the Great, Gregory I(590-604) and Leo III (795-816) who invited Charlemagne to be Caesar and crownedhim in spite of himself. Towards the close of the eleventh century there arose agreat clerical statesman, Hildebrand, who ended his life as Pope Gregory VII(1073-1085). Next but one after him came Urban II (1087-1099), the Pope of theFirst Crusade. These two were the founders of this period of papal greatnessduring which the Popes lorded it over the Emperors. From Bulgaria to Ireland andfrom Norway to Sicily and Jerusalem the Pope was supreme. Gregory VII obligedthe Emperor Henry IV to come in penitence to him at Canossa and to awaitforgiveness for three days and nights in the courtyard of the castle, clad insackcloth and barefooted to the snow. In 1176 at Venice the Emperor Frederick(Frederick Barbarossa), knelt to Pope Alexander III and swore fealty to him.The great power of the church in the beginning of the eleventh century lay inthe wills and consciences of men. It failed to retain the moral prestige onwhich its power was based. In the opening decades of the fourteenth century itwas discovered that the power of the Pope had evaporated. What was it thatdestroyed the naïve confidence of the common people of Christendom in the churchso that they would no longer rally to its appeal and serve its purposes?The first trouble was certainly the accumulation of wealth by the church. Thechurch never died, and there was a frequent disposition on the part of dyingchildless people to leave lands to the church. Penitent sinners were exhorted todo so. Accordingly in many European countries as much as a fourth of the landbecame church property. The appetite for property grows with what it feeds upon.Already in the thirteenth century it was being said everywhere that the priestswere not good men, that they were always hunting for money and legacies.The kings and princes disliked this alienation of property very greatly. In theplace of feudal lords capable of military support, they found their landsupporting abbeys and monks and nuns. And these lands were really under foreigndominion. Even before the time of Pope Gregory VII there had been a strugglebetween the princes and the papacy over the question of \"investitures,\" thequestion that is of who should appoint the bishops. If that power rested withthe Pope and not the King, then the latter lost control not only of theconsciences of his subjects but of a considerable part of his dominions. Foralso the clergy claimed exemption from taxation. They paid their taxes to Rome.And not only that, but the church also claimed the right to levy a tax ofone-tenth upon the property of the layman in addition to the taxes he paid hisprince.The history of nearly every country in Latin Christendom tells of the same phasein the eleventh century, a phase of struggle between monarch and Pope on theissue of investitures and generally it tells of a victory for the Pope. Heclaimed to be able to excommunicate the prince, to absolve his subjects fromtheir allegiance to him, to recognize a successor. He claimed to be able to puta nation under an interdict, and then nearly all priestly functions ceasedexcept the sacraments of baptism, confirmation and penance; the priests couldneither hold the ordinary services, marry people, nor bury the dead. With thesetwo weapons it was possible for the twelfth century Popes to curb the mostrecalcitrant princes and overawe the most restive peoples. These were enormouspowers, and enormous powers are only to be used on extraordinary occasions. ThePopes used them at last with a frequency that staled their effect. Within thirtyyears at the end of the twelfth century we find Scotland, France and England inturn under an interdict. And also the Popes could not resist the temptation topreach crusades against offending princes-until the crusading spirit wasextinct.It is possible that if the Church of Rome had struggled simply against theprinces and had had a care to keep its hold upon the general mind, it might haveachieved a permanent dominion over all Christendom. But the high claims of thePope were reflected as arrogance in the conduct of the clergy. Before theeleventh century the Roman priests could marry; they had close ties with thepeople among whom they lived; they were indeed a part of the people. Gregory VIImade them celibates; he cut the priests off from too great an intimacy with thelaymen in order to bind them more closely to Rome, but indeed he opened afissure between the church and the commonalty. The church had its own lawcourts. Cases involving not merely priests but monks, students, crusaders,widows, orphans and the helpless were reserved for the clerical courts, and sowere all matters relating to wills, marriages and oaths and all cases ofsorcery, heresy and blasphemy. Whenever the layman found himself in conflictwith the priest he had to go to a clerical court. The obligations of peace andwar fell upon his shoulders alone and left the priest free. It is no greatwonder that jealousy and hatred of the priests grew up in the Christian world.Never did Rome seem to realize that its power was in the consciences of commonmen. It fought against religious enthusiasm, which should have been its ally,and it forced doctrinal orthodoxy upon honest doubt and aberrant opinion. Whenthe church interfered in matters of morality it had the common man with it, butnot when it interfered in matters of doctrine. When in the south of France Waldotaught a return to the simplicity of Jesus in faith and life, Innocent IIIpreached a crusade against the Waldenses, Waldo's followers, and permitted themto be suppressed with fire, sword, rape and the most abominable cruelties. Whenagain St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) taught the imitation of Christ and alife of poverty and service, his followers, the Franciscans, were persecuted,scourged, imprisoned and dispersed. In 1318 four of them were burnt alive atMarseilles. On the other hand the fiercely orthodox order of the Dominicans,founded by St. Dominic (1170-1221) was strongly supported by Innocent III, whowith its assistance set up an organization, the Inquisition, for the hunting ofheresy and the affliction of free thought.So it was that the church by excessive claims, by unrighteous privileges, and byan irrational intolerance destroyed that free faith of the common man which wasthe final source of all its power. The story of its decline tells of no adequatefoemen from without but continually of decay from within.XLVII. RECALCITRANT PRINCES AND THE GREAT SCHISMONE very great weakness of the Roman Church in its struggle to secure theheadship of all Christendom was the manner in which the Pope was chosen.If indeed the papacy was to achieve its manifest ambition and establish one ruleand one peace throughout Christendom, then it was vitally necessary that itshould have a strong, steady and continuous direction. In those great days ofits opportunity it needed before all things that the Popes when they took officeshould be able men in the prime of life, that each should have hissuccessor-designate with whom he could discuss the policy of the church, andthat the forms and processes of election should be clear, definite, unalterableand unassailable. Unhappily none of these things obtained. It was not even clearwho could vote in the election of a Pope, nor whether the Byzantine or HolyRoman Emperor had a voice in the matter. That very great papal statesmanHildebrand (Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085) did much to regularize the election. Heconfined the votes to the Roman cardinals and he reduced the Emperor's share toa formula of assent conceded to him by the church, but he made no provision fora successor-designate and he left it possible for the disputes of the cardinalsto keep the See vacant, as in some cases it was kept vacant, for a year or more.The consequences of this want of firm definition are to be seen in the wholehistory of the papacy up to the sixteenth century. From quite early times onwardthere were disputed elections and two or more men each claiming to be Pope. Thechurch would then be subjected to the indignity of going to the Emperor or someother outside arbiter to settle the dispute. And the career of every one of thegreat Popes ended in a note of interrogation. At his death the church might beleft headless and as ineffective as a decapitated body. Or he might be replacedby some old rival eager only to discredit and undo his work. Or some enfeebledold man tottering on the brink of the grave might succeed him.It was inevitable that this peculiar weakness of the papal organization shouldattract the interference of the various German princes, the French King, and theNorman and French Kings who ruled in England; that they should all try toinfluence the elections, and have a Pope in their own interest established inthe Lateran Palace at Rome. And the more powerful and important the Pope becamein European affairs, the more urgent did these interventions become. Under thecircumstances it is no great wonder that many of the Popes were weak and futile.The astonishing thing is that many of them were able and courageous men.One of the most vigorous and interesting of the Popes of this great period wasInnocent III (1198-1216) who was so fortunate as to become Pope before he wasthirty-eight. He and his successors were pitted against an even more interestingpersonality, the Emperor Frederick II; Stupor mundi he was called, the Wonder ofthe world. The struggle of this monarch against Rome is a turning place inhistory. In the end Rome defeated him and destroyed his dynasty, but he left theprestige of the church and Pope so badly wounded that its wounds festered andled to its decay.Frederick was the son of the Emperor Henry VI and his mother was the daughter ofRoger I, the Norman King of Sicily. He inherited this kingdom in 1198 when hewas a child of four years. Innocent III had been made his guardian. Sicily inthose days had been but recently conquered by the Normans; the Court was halforiental and full of highly educated Arabs; and some of these were associated inthe education of the young king. No doubt they were at some pains to make theirpoint of view clear to him. He got a Moslem view of Christianity as well as aChristian view of Islam, and the unhappy result of this double system ofinstruction was a view, exceptional in that age of faith, that all religionswere impostures. He talked freely on the subject; his heresies and blasphemiesare on record.As the young man grew up he found himself in conflict with his guardian.Innocent III wanted altogether too much from his ward. When the opportunity camefor Frederick to succeed as Emperor, the Pope intervened with conditions.Frederick must promise to put down heresy in Germany with a strong hand.Moreover he must relinquish his crown in Sicily and South Italy, becauseotherwise he would be too strong for the Pope. And the German clergy were to befreed from all taxation. Frederick agreed-but with no intention of keeping hisword. The Pope had already induced the French King to make war upon his ownsubjects in France, the cruel and bloody crusade against the Waldenses; hewanted Frederick to do the same thing in Germany. But Frederick being far moreof a heretic than any of the simple pietists who had incurred the Pope'sanimosity, lacked the crusading impulse. And when Innocent urged him to crusadeagainst the Moslim and recover Jerusalem he was equally ready to promise andequally slack in his performance.Having secured the imperial crown Frederick II stayed in Sicily, which hegreatly preferred to Germany as a residence, and did nothing to redeem any ofhis promises to Innocent III, who died baffled in 1216.Honorius III, who succeeded Innocent, could do no better with Frederick, andGregory IX (1227) came to the papal throne evidently resolved to settle accountswith this young man at any cost. He excommunicated him. Frederick II was deniedall the comforts of religion. In the half-Arab Court of Sicily this producedsingularly little discomfort. And also the Pope addressed a public letter to theEmperor reciting his vices (which were indisputable), his heresies, and hisgeneral misconduct. To this Frederick replied in a document of diabolicalability. It was addressed to all the princes of Europe, and it made the firstclear statement of the issue between the Pope and the princes. He made ashattering attack upon the manifest ambition of the Pope to become the absoluteruler of all Europe. He suggested a union of princes against this usurpation. Hedirected the attention of the princes specifically to the wealth of the church.Having fired off this deadly missile Frederick resolved to perform histwelve-year-old promise and go upon a crusade. This was the Sixth Crusade(1228). It was, as a crusade, farcical. Frederick II went to Egypt and met anddiscussed affairs with the Sultan. These two gentlemen, both of scepticalopinions, exchanged congenial views, made a commercial convention to theirmutual advantage, and agreed to transfer Jerusalem to Frederick. This indeed wasa new sort of crusade, a crusade by private treaty. Here was no blood splashingthe conqueror, no \"weeping with excess of joy.\" As this astonishing crusader wasan excommunicated man, he had to be content with a purely secular coronation asKing of Jerusalem, taking the crown from the altar with his own hand-for all theclergy were bound to shun him. He then returned to Italy, chased the papalarmies which had invaded his dominions back to their own territories, andobliged the Pope to grant him absolution from his excommunication. So a princemight treat the Pope in the thirteenth century, and there was now no storm ofpopular indignation to avenge him. Those days were past.In 1239 Gregory IX resumed his struggle with Frederick, excommunicated him for asecond time, and renewed that warfare of public abuse in which the papacy hadalready suffered severely. The controversy was revived after Gregory IX wasdead, when Innocent IV was Pope; and again a devastating letter, which men werebound to remember, was written by Frederick against the church. He denounced thepride and irreligion of the clergy, and ascribed all the corruptions of the timeto their pride and wealth. He proposed to his fellow princes a generalconfiscation of church property-for the good of the church. It was a suggestionthat never afterwards left the imagination of the European princes.We will not go on to tell of his last years. The particular events of his lifeare far less significant than its general atmosphere. It is possible to piecetogether something of his court life in Sicily. He was luxurious in his way ofliving, and fond of beautiful things. He is described as licentious. But it isclear that he was a man of very effectual curiosity and inquiry. He gatheredJewish and Moslem as well as Christian philosophers at his court, and he didmuch to irrigate the Italian mind with Saracenic influences. Through him theArabic numerals and algebra were introduced to Christian students, and amongother philosophers at his court was Michael Scott, who translated portions ofAristotle and the commentaries thereon of the great Arab philosopher Averroes(of Cordoba). In 1224 Frederick founded the University of Naples, and heenlarged and enriched the great medical school at Salerno University. He alsofounded a zoological garden. He left a book on hawking, which shows him to havebeen an acute observer of the habits of birds, and he was one of the firstItalians to write Italian verse. Italian poetry was indeed born at his court. Hehas been called by an able writer, \"the first of the moderns,\" and the phraseexpresses aptly the unprejudiced detachment of his intellectual side.A still more striking intimation of the decay of the living and sustainingforces of the papacy appeared when presently the Popes came into conflict withthe growing power of the French King. During the lifetime of the EmperorFrederick II, Germany fell into disunion, and the French King began to play therôle of guard, supporter and rival to the Pope that had hitherto fallen to theHohenstaufen Emperors. A series of Popes pursued the policy of supporting theFrench monarchs. French princes were established in the kingdom of Sicily andNaples, with the support and approval of Rome, and the French Kings saw beforethem the possibility of restoring and ruling the Empire of Charlemagne. When,however, the German interregnum after the death of Frederick II, the last of theHohenstaufens, came to an end and Rudolf of Habsburg was elected first HabsburgEmperor (1273), the policy of Rome began to fluctuate between France andGermany, veering about with the sympathies of each successive Pope. In the Eastin 1261 the Greeks recaptured Constantinople from the Latin emperors, and thefounder of the new Greek dynasty, Michael Palaeologus, Michael VIII, after someunreal tentatives of reconciliation with the Pope, broke away from the Romancommunion altogether, and with that, and the fall of the Latin kingdoms in Asia,the eastward ascendancy of the Popes came to an endIn 1294 Boniface VIII became Pope. He was an Italian, hostile to the French, andfull of a sense of the great traditions and mission of Rome. For a time hecarried things with a high hand. In 1300 he held a jubilee, and a vast multitudeof pilgrims assembled in Rome. \"So great was the influx of money into the papaltreasury, that two assistants were kept busy with the rakes collecting theofferings that were deposited at the tomb of St. Peter.\" But this festival was adelusive triumph. Boniface came into conflict with the French King in 1302, andin 1303, as he was about to pronounce sentence of excommunication against thatmonarch, he was surprised and arrested in his own ancestral palace at Anagni, byGuillaume de Nogaret. This agent from the French King forced an entrance intothe palace, made his way into the bedroom of the frightened Pope-he was lying inbed with a cross in his hands-and heaped threats and insults upon him. The Popewas liberated a day or so later by the townspeople, and returned to Rome; butthere he was seized upon and again made prisoner by the Orsini family, and in afew weeks' time the shocked and disillusioned old man died a prisoner in theirhands.The people of Anagni did resent the first outrage, and rose against Nogaret toliberate Boniface, but then Anagni was the Pope's native town. The importantpoint to note is that the French King in this rough treatment of the head ofChristendom was acting with the full approval of his people; he had summoned acouncil of the Three Estates of France (lords, church and commons) and gainedtheir consent before proceeding to extremities. Neither in Italy, Germany norEngland was there the slightest general manifestation of disapproval at thisfree handling of the sovereign pontiff. The idea of Christendom had decayeduntil its power over the minds of men had gone.Throughout the fourteenth century the papacy did nothing to recover its moralsway. The next Pope elected, Clement V, was a Frenchman, the choice of KingPhilip of France. He never came to Rome. He set up his court in the town ofAvignon, which then belonged not to France but to the papal See, though embeddedin French territory, and there his successors remained until 1377, when PopeGregory XI returned to the Vatican palace in Rome. But Gregory XI did not takethe sympathies of the whole church with him. Many of the cardinals were ofFrench origin and their habits and associations were rooted deep at Avignon.When in 1378 Gregory XI died, and an Italian, Urban VI, was elected, thesedissentient cardinals declared the election invalid, and elected another Pope,the anti-Pope, Clement VII. This split is called the Great Schism. The Popesremained in Rome, and all the anti-French powers, the Emperor, the King ofEngland, Hungary, Poland and the North of Europe were loyal to them. Theanti-Popes, on the other hand, continued in Avignon, and were supported by theKing of France, his ally the King of Scotland, Spain, Portugal and variousGerman princes. Each Pope excommunicated and cursed the adherents of his rival(1378-1417).Is it any wonder that presently all over Europe people began to think forthemselves in matters of religion?The beginnings of the Franciscans and the Dominicans, which we have noted in thepreceding chapters, were but two among many of the new forces that were arisingin Christendom, either to hold or shatter the church as its own wisdom mightdecide. Those two orders the church did assimilate and use, though with a littleviolence in the case of the former. But other forces were more franklydisobedient and critical. A century and a half later came Wycliffe (1320-1384).He was a learned Doctor at Oxford. Quite late in his life he began a series ofoutspoken criticisms of the corruption of the clergy and the unwisdom of thechurch. He organized a number of poor priests, the Wycliffites, to spread hisideas throughout England; and in order that people should judge between thechurch and himself, he translated the Bible into English. He was a more learnedand far abler man than either St. Francis or St. Dominic. He had supporters inhigh places and a great following among the people; and though Rome ragedagainst him, and ordered his imprisonment, he died a free man. But the black andancient spirit that was leading the Catholic Church to its destruction would notlet his bones rest in the grave. By a decree of the Council of Constance in1415, his remains were ordered to be dug up and burnt, an order which wascarried out at the command of Pope Martin V by Bishop Fleming in 1428. Thisdesecration was not the act of some isolated fanatic; it was the official act ofthe church.J. H. Robinson.XLVIII. THE MONGOL CONQUESTSBUT in the thirteenth century, while this strange and finally ineffectualstruggle to unify Christendom under the rule of the Pope was going on in Europe,far more momentous events were afoot upon the larger stage of Asia. A Turkishpeople from the country to the north of China rose suddenly to prominence in theworld's affairs, and achieved such a series of conquests as has no parallel inhistory. These were the Mongols. At the opening of the thirteenth century theywere a horde of nomadic horsemen, living very much as their predecessors, theHuns, had done, subsisting chiefly upon meat and mare's milk and living in tentsof skin. They had shaken themselves free from Chinese dominion, and brought anumber of other Turkish tribes into a military confederacy. Their central campwas at Karakorum in Mongolia.At this time China was in a state of division. The great dynasty of Tang hadpassed into decay by the tenth century, and after a phase of division intowarring states, three main empires, that of Kin in the north with Pekin as itscapital and that of Sung in the south with a capital at Nankin, and Hsia in thecentre, remain. In 1214 Jengis Khan, the leader of the Mongol confederates, madewar on the Kin Empire and captured Pekin (1214). He then turned westward andconquered Western Turkestan, Persia, Armenia, India down to Lahore, and SouthRussia as far as Kieff. He died master of a vast empire that reached from thePacific to the Dnieper.His successor, Ogdai Khan, continued this astonishing career of conquest. Hisarmies were organized to a very high level of efficiency; and they had with thema new Chinese invention, gunpowder, which they used in small field guns. Hecompleted the conquest of the Kin Empire and then swept his hosts right acrossAsia to Russia (1235), an altogether amazing march. Kieff was destroyed in 1240,and nearly all Russia became tributary to the Mongols. Poland was ravaged, and amixed army of Poles and Germans was annihilated at the battle of Liegnitz inLower Silesia in 1241. The Emperor Frederick II does not seem to have made anygreat efforts to stay the advancing tide.\"It is only recently,\" says Bury in his notes to Gibbon's Decline and Fall ofthe Roman Empire, \"that European history has begun to understand that thesuccesses of the Mongol army which overran Poland and occupied Hungary in thespring of A.D. 1241 were won by consummate strategy and were not due to a mereoverwhelming superiority of numbers. But this fact has not yet become a matterof common knowledge; the vulgar opinion which represents the Tartars as a wildhorde carrying all before them solely by their multitude, and galloping throughEastern Europe without a strategic plan, rushing at all obstacles and overcomingthem by mere weight, still prevails.\"It was wonderful how punctually and effectually the arrangements were carriedout in operations extending from the Lower Vistula to Transylvania. Such acampaign was quite beyond the power of any European army of the time, and it wasbeyond the vision of any European commander. There was no general in Europe,from Frederick II downward, who was not a tyro in strategy compared to Subutai.It should also be noticed that the Mongols embarked upon the enterprise withfull knowledge of the political situation of Hungary and the condition ofPoland-they had taken care to inform themselves by a well-organized system ofspies; on the other hand, the Hungarians and the Christian powers, like childishbarbarians, knew hardly anything about their enemies.\"But though the Mongols were victorious at Liegnitz, they did not continue theirdrive westward. They were getting into woodlands and hilly country, which didnot suit their tactics; and so they turned southward and prepared to settle inHungary, massacring or assimilating the kindred Magyar, even as these hadpreviously massacred and assimilated the mixed Scythians and Avars and Hunsbefore them. From the Hungarian plain they would probably have made raids westand south as the Hungarians had done in the ninth century, the Avars in theseventh and eighth and the Huns in the fifth. But Ogdai died suddenly, and in1242 there was trouble about the succession, and recalled by this, theundefeated hosts of Mongols began to pour back across Hungary and Roumaniatowards the east.Thereafter the Mongols concentrated their attention upon their Asiaticconquests. By the middle of the thirteenth century they had conquered the SungEmpire. Mangu Khan succeeded Ogdai Khan as Great Khan in 1251, and made hisbrother Kublai Khan governor of China. In 1280 Kublai Khan had been formallyrecognized Emperor of China, and so founded the Yuan dynasty which lasted until1368. While the last ruins of the Sung rule were going down in China, anotherbrother of Mangu, Hulagu, was conquering Persia and Syria. The Mongols displayeda bitter animosity to Islam at this time, and not only massacred the populationof Bagdad when they captured that city, but set to work to destroy theimmemorial irrigation system which had kept Mesopotamia incessantly prosperousand populous from the early days of Sumeria. From that time until our ownMesopotamia has been a desert of ruins, sustaining only a scanty population.Into Egypt the Mongols never penetrated; the Sultan of Egypt completely defeatedan army of Hulagu's in Palestine in 1260.After that disaster the tide of Mongol victory ebbed. The dominions of the GreatKhan fell into a number of separate states. The eastern Mongols becameBuddhists, like the Chinese; the western became Moslim. The Chinese threw offthe rule of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, and set up the native Ming dynasty whichflourished from 1368 to 1644. The Russians remained tributary to the Tartarhordes upon the south-east steppes until 1480, when the Grand Duke of Moscowrepudiated his allegiance and laid the foundation of modern Russia.In the fourteenth century there was a brief revival of Mongol vigour underTimurlane, a descendant of Jengis Khan. He established himself in WesternTurkestan, assumed the title of Grand Khan in 1369, and conquered from Syria toDelhi. He was the most savage and destructive of all the Mongol conquerors. Heestablished an empire of desolation that did not survive his death. In 1505,however, a descendant of this Timur, an adventurer named Baber, got together anarmy with guns and swept down upon the plains of India. His grandson Akbar(1556-1605) completed his conquests, and this Mongol (or \"Mogul\" as the Arabscalled it) dynasty ruled in Delhi over the greater part of India until theeighteenth century.One of the consequences of the first great sweep of Mongol conquest in thethirteenth century was to drive a certain tribe of Turks, the Ottoman Turks, outof Turkestan into Asia Minor. They extended and consolidated their power in AsiaMinor, crossed the Dardanelles and conquered Macedonia, Serbia and Bulgaria,until at last Constantinople remained like an island amongst the Ottomandominions. In 1453 the Ottoman Sultan, Muhammad II, took Constantinople,attacking it from the European side with a great number of guns. This eventcaused intense excitement in Europe and there was talk of a crusade, but the dayof the crusades was past.In the course of the sixteenth century the Ottoman Sultans conquered Bagdad,Hungary, Egypt and most of North Africa, and their fleet made them masters ofthe Mediterranean. They very nearly took Vienna, and they exacted a tribute fromthe Emperor. There were but two items to offset the general ebb of Christiandominion in the fifteenth century. One was the restoration of the independenceof Moscow (1480); the other was the gradual reconquest of Spain by theChristians. In 1492, Granada, the last Moslem state in the peninsula, fell toKing Ferdinand of Aragon and his Queen Isabella of Castile.But it was not until as late as 1571 that the naval battle of Lepanto broke thepride of the Ottomans, and restored the Mediterranean waters to Christianascendancy.XLIX. THE INTELLECTUAL REVIVAL OF THE EUROPEANSTHROUGHOUT the twelfth century there were many signs that the Europeanintelligence was recovering courage and leisure, and preparing to take up againthe intellectual enterprises of the first Greek scientific enquiries and suchspeculations as those of the Italian Lucretius. The causes of this revival weremany and complex. The suppression of private war, the higher standards ofcomfort and security that followed the crusades, and the stimulation of men'sminds by the experiences of these expeditions were no doubt necessarypreliminary conditions. Trade was reviving; cities were recovering ease andsafety; the standard of education was arising in the church and spreading amonglaymen. The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were a period of growing,independent or quasi-independent cities; Venice, Florence, Genoa, Lisbon, Paris,Bruges, London, Antwerp, Hamburg, Nuremberg, Novgorod, Wisby and Bergen forexample. They were all trading cities with many travellers, and where men tradeand travel they talk and think. The polemics of the Popes and princes, theconspicuous savagery and wickedness of the persecution of heretics, wereexciting men to doubt the authority of the church and question and discussfundamental things.We have seen how the Arabs were the means of restoring Aristotle to Europe, andhow such a prince as Frederick II acted as a channel through which Arabicphilosophy and science played upon the renascent European mind. Still moreinfluential in the stirring up of men's ideas were the Jews. Their veryexistence was a note of interrogation to the claims of the church. And finallythe secret, fascinating enquiries of the alchemists were spreading far and wideand setting men to the petty, furtive and yet fruitful resumption ofexperimental science.And the stir in men's minds was by no means confined now to the independent andwell educated. The mind of the common man was awake in the world as it had neverbeen before in all the experience of mankind. In spite of priest andpersecution, Christianity does seem to have carried a mental ferment whereverits teaching reached. It established a direct relation between the conscience ofthe individual man and the God of Righteousness, so that now if need arose hehad the courage to form his own judgment upon prince or prelate or creed.As early as the eleventh century philosophical discussion had begun again inEurope, and there were great and growing universities at Paris, Oxford, Bolognaand other centres. There medieval \"schoolmen\" took up again and thrashed out aseries of questions upon the value and meaning of words that were a necessarypreliminary to clear thinking in the scientific age that was to follow. Andstanding by himself because of his distinctive genius was Roger Bacon (circa1210 to circa 1293), a Franciscan of Oxford, the father of modern experimentalscience. His name deserves a prominence in our history second only to that ofAristotle.His writings are one long tirade against ignorance. He told his age it wasignorant, an incredibly bold thing to do. Nowadays a man may tell the world itis as silly as it is solemn, that all its methods are still infantile and clumsyand its dogmas childish assumptions, without much physical danger; but thesepeoples of the middle ages when they were not actually being massacred orstarving or dying of pestilence, were passionately convinced of the wisdom, thecompleteness and finality of their beliefs, and disposed to resent anyreflections upon them very bitterly. Roger Bacon's writings were like a flash oflight in a profound darkness. He combined his attack upon the ignorance of histimes with a wealth of suggestion for the increase of knowledge. In hispassionate insistence upon the need of experiment and of collecting knowledge,the spirit of Aristotle lives again in him. \"Experiment, experiment,\" that isthe burthen of Roger Bacon.Yet of Aristotle himself Roger Bacon fell foul. He fell foul of him because men,instead of facing facts boldly, sat in rooms and pored over the bad Latintranslations which were then all that was available of the master. \"If I had myway,\" he wrote, in his intemperate fashion, \"I should burn all the books ofAristotle, for the study of them can only lead to a loss of time, produce error,and increase ignorance,\" a sentiment that Aristotle would probably have echoedcould he have returned to a world in which his works were not so much read asworshipped-and that, as Roger Bacon showed, in these most abominabletranslations.Throughout his books, a little disguised by the necessity of seeming to squareit all with orthodoxy for fear of the prison and worse, Roger Bacon shouted tomankind, \"Cease to be ruled by dogmas and authorities; look at the world!\" Fourchief sources of ignorance he denounced; respect for authority, custom, thesense of the ignorant crowd, and the vain, proud unteachableness of ourdispositions. Overcome but these, and a world of power would open to men:—\"Machines for navigating are possible without rowers, so that great ships suitedto river or ocean, guided by one man, may be borne with greater speed than ifthey were full of men. Likewise cars may be made so that without a draughtanimal they may be moved cum impetu inoestimable, as we deem the scythedchariots to have been from which antiquity fought. And flying machines arepossible, so that a man may sit in the middle turning some device by whichartificial wings may beat the air in the manner of a flying bird.\"So Roger Bacon wrote, but three more centuries were to elapse before men beganany systematic attempts to explore the hidden stores of power and interest herealized so clearly existed beneath the dull surface of human affairs.But the Saracenic world not only gave Christendom the stimulus of itsphilosophers and alchemists; it also gave it paper. It is scarcely too much tosay that paper made the intellectual revival of Europe possible. Paperoriginated in China, where its use probably goes back to the second century B.C.In 751 the Chinese made an attack upon the Arab Moslems in Samarkand; they wererepulsed, and among the prisoners taken from them were some skilled papermakers,from whom the art was learnt. Arabic paper manuscripts from the ninth centuryonward still exist. The manufacture entered Christendom either through Greece orby the capture of Moorish paper-mills during the Christian reconquest of Spain.But under the Christian Spanish the product deteriorated sadly. Good paper wasnot made in Christian Europe until the end of the thirteenth century, and thenit was Italy which led the world. Only by the fourteenth century did themanufacture reach Germany, and not until the end of that century was it abundantand cheap enough for the printing of books to be a practicable businessproposition. Thereupon printing followed naturally and necessarily, for printingis the most obvious of inventions, and the intellectual life of the worldentered upon a new and far more vigorous phase. It ceased to be a little tricklefrom mind to mind; it became a broad flood, in which thousands and presentlyscores and hundreds of thousands of minds participated.One immediate result of this achievement of printing was the appearance of anabundance of Bibles in the world. Another was a cheapening of school-books. Theknowledge of reading spread swiftly. There was not only a great increase ofbooks in the world, but the books that were now made were plainer to read and soeasier to understand. Instead of toiling at a crabbed text and then thinkingover its significance, readers now could think unimpeded as they read. With thisincrease in the facility of reading, the reading public grew. The book ceased tobe a highly decorated toy or a scholar's mystery. People began to write books tobe read as well as looked at by ordinary people. They wrote in the ordinarylanguage and not in Latin. With the fourteenth century the real history of theEuropean literature begins.So far we have been dealing only with the Saracenic share in the Europeanrevival. Let us turn now to the influence of the Mongol conquests. Theystimulated the geographical imagination of Europe enormously. For a time underthe Great Khan, all Asia and Western Europe enjoyed an open intercourse; all theroads were temporarily open, and representatives of every nation appeared at thecourt of Karakorum. The barriers between Europe and Asia set up by the religiousfeud of Christianity and Islam were lowered. Great hopes were entertained by thepapacy for the conversion of the Mongols to Christianity. Their only religion sofar had been Shumanism, a primitive paganism. Envoys of the Pope, Buddhistpriests from India, Parisian and Italian and Chinese artificers, Byzantine andArmenian merchants, mingled with Arab officials and Persian and Indianastronomers and mathematicians at the Mongol court. We hear too much in historyof the campaigns and massacres of the Mongols, and not enough of their curiosityand desire for learning. Not perhaps as an originative people, but astransmitters of knowledge and method their influence upon the world's historyhas been very great. And everything one can learn of the vague and romanticpersonalities of Jengis or Kublai tends to confirm the impression that these menwere at least as understanding and creative monarchs as either that flamboyantbut egotistical figure Alexander the Great or that raiser of political ghosts,that energetic but illiterate theologian Charlemagne.One of the most interesting of these visitors to the Mongol Court was a certainVenetian, Marco Polo, who afterwards set down his story in a book. He went toChina about 1272 with his father and uncle, who had already once made thejourney. The Great Khan had been deeply impressed by the elder Polos; they werethe first men of the \"Latin\" peoples he had seen; and he sent them back withenquiries for teachers and learned men who could explain Christianity to him,and for various other European things that had aroused his curiosity. Theirvisit with Marco was their second visit.The three Polos started by way of Palestine and not by the Crimea, as in theirprevious expedition. They had with them a gold tablet and other indications fromthe Great Khan that must have greatly facilitated their journey. The Great Khanhad asked for some oil from the lamp that burns in the Holy Sepulchre atJerusalem; and so thither they first went, and then by way of Cilicia intoArmenia. They went thus far north because the Sultan of Egypt was raiding theMongol domains at this time. Thence they came by way of Mesopotamia to Ormuz onthe Persian Gulf, as if they contemplated a sea voyage. At Ormuz they metmerchants from India. For some reason they did not take ship, but instead turnednorthward through the Persian deserts, and so by way of Balkh over the Pamir toKashgar, and by way of Kotan and the Lob Nor into the Hwang-ho valley and on toPekin. At Pekin was the Great Khan, and they were hospitably entertained.Marco particularly pleased Kublai; he was young and clever, and it is clear hehad mastered the Tartar language very thoroughly. He was given an officialposition and sent on several missions, chiefly in south-west China. The tale hehad to tell of vast stretches of smiling and prosperous country, \"all the wayexcellent hostelries for travellers,\" and \"fine vineyards, fields and gardens,\"of \"many abbeys\" of Buddhist monks, of manufactures of \"cloth of silk and goldand many fine taffetas,\" a \"constant succession of cities and boroughs,\" and soon, first roused the incredulity and then fired the imagination of all Europe.He told of Burmah, and of its great armies with hundreds of elephants, and howthese animals were defeated by the Mongol bowmen, and also of the Mongolconquest of Pegu. He told of Japan, and greatly exaggerated the amount of goldin that country. For three years Marco ruled the city of Yang-chow as governor,and he probably impressed the Chinese inhabitants as being very little more of aforeigner than any Tartar would have been. He may also have been sent on amission to India. Chinese records mention a certain Polo attached to theimperial council in 1277, a very valuable confirmation of the general truth ofthe Polo story.The publication of Marco Polo's travels produced a profound effect upon theEuropean imagination. The European literature, and especially the Europeanromance of the fifteenth century, echoes with the names in Marco Polo's story,with Cathay (North China) and Cambulac (Pekin) and the like.Two centuries later, among the readers of the Travels of Marco Polo was acertain Genoese mariner, Christopher Columbus, who conceived the brilliant ideaof sailing westward round the world to China. In Seville there is a copy of theTravels with marginal notes by Columbus. There were many reasons why the thoughtof a Genoese should be turned in this direction. Until its capture by the Turksin 1453 Constantinople had been an impartial trading mart between the Westernworld and the East, and the Genoese had traded there freely. But the \"Latin\"Venetians, the bitter rivals of the Genoese, had been the allies and helpers ofthe Turks against the Greeks, and with the coming of the Turks Constantinopleturned an unfriendly face upon Genoese trade. The long forgotten discovery thatthe world was round had gradually resumed its sway over men's minds. The idea ofgoing westward to China was therefore a fairly obvious one. It was encouraged bytwo things. The mariner's compass had now been invented and men were no longerleft to the mercy of a fine night and the stars to determine the direction inwhich they were sailing, and the Normans, Catalonians and Genoese and Portuguesehad already pushed out into the Atlantic as far as the Canary Isles, Madeira andthe Azores.Yet Columbus found many difficulties before he could get ships to put his ideato the test. He went from one European Court to another. Finally at Granada,just won from the Moors, he secured the patronage of Ferdinand and Isabella, andwas able to set out across the unknown ocean in three small ships. After avoyage of two months and nine days he came to a land which he believed to beIndia, but which was really a new continent, whose distinct existence the oldworld had never hitherto suspected. He returned to Spain with gold, cotton,strange beasts and birds, and two wild-eyed painted Indians to be baptized. Theywere called Indians because, to the end of his days, he believed that this landhe had found was India. Only in the course of several years did men begin torealize that the whole new continent of America was added to the world'sresources.The success of Columbus stimulated overseas enterprise enormously. In 1497 thePortuguese sailed round Africa to India, and in 1515 there were Portuguese shipsin Java. In 1519 Magellan, a Portuguese sailor in Spanish employment, sailed outof Seville westward with five ships, of which one, the Vittoria, came back upthe river to Seville in 1522, the first ship that had ever circumnavigated theworld. Thirty-one men were aboard her, survivors of two-hundred-and-eighty whohad started. Magellan himself had been killed in the Philippine Isles.Printed paper books, a new realization of the round world as a thing altogetherattainable, a new vision of strange lands, strange animals and plants, strangemanners and customs, discoveries overseas and in the skies and in the ways andmaterials of life burst upon the European mind. The Greek classics, buried andforgotten for so long, were speedily being printed and studied, and werecolouring men's thoughts with the dreams of Plato and the traditions of an ageof republican freedom and dignity. The Roman dominion had first brought law andorder to Western Europe, and the Latin Church had restored it; but under bothPagan and Catholic Rome curiosity and innovation were subordinate to andrestrained by organization. The reign of the Latin mind was now drawing to anend. Between the thirteenth and the sixteenth century the European Aryans,thanks to the stimulating influence of Semite and Mongol and the rediscovery ofthe Greek classics, broke away from the Latin tradition and rose again to theintellectual and material leadership of mankind.L. THE REFORMATION OF THE LATIN CHURCHTHE LATIN CHURCH itself was enormously affected by this mental rebirth. It wasdismembered; and even the portion that survived was extensively renewed.We have told how nearly the church came to the autocratic leadership of allChristendom in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and how in the fourteenth andfifteenth its power over men's minds and affairs declined. We have described howpopular religious enthusiasm which had in earlier ages been its support andpower was turned against it by its pride, persecution s and centralization, andhow the insidious scepticism of Frederick II bore fruit in a growinginsubordination of the princes. The Great Schism had reduced its religious andpolitical prestige to negligible proportions. The forces of insurrection struckit now from both sides.The teachings of the Englishman Wycliffe spread widely throughout Europe. In1398 a learned Czech, John Huss, delivered a series of lectures upon Wycliffe'steachings in the university of Prague. This teaching spread rapidly beyond theeducated class and aroused great popular enthusiasm. In 1414-18 a Council of thewhole church was held at Constance to settle the Great Schism. Huss was invitedto this Council under promise of a safe conduct from the emperor, seized, put ontrial for heresy and burnt alive (1415). So far from tranquillizing the Bohemianpeople, this led to an insurrection of the Hussites in that country, the firstof a series of religious wars that inaugurated the break-up of LatinChristendom. Against this insurrection Pope Martin V, the Pope specially electedat Constance as the head of a reunited Christendom, preached a Crusade.Five Crusades in all were launched upon this sturdy little people and all ofthem failed. All the unemployed ruffianism of Europe was turned upon Bohemia inthe fifteenth century, just as in the thirteenth it had been turned upon theWaldenses. But the Bohemian Czechs, unlike the Waldenses, believed in armedresistance. The Bohemian Crusade dissolved and streamed away from thebattlefield at the sound of the Hussites' waggons and the distant chanting oftheir troops; it did not even wait to fight (battle of Domazlice, 1431). In 1436an agreement was patched up with the Hussites by a new Council of the church atBasle in which many of the special objections to Latin practice were conceded.In the fifteenth century a great pestilence had produced much socialdisorganization throughout Europe. There had been extreme misery and discontentamong the common people, and peasant risings against the landlords and thewealthy in England and France. After the Hussite Wars these peasantinsurrections increased in gravity in Germany and took on a religious character.Printing came in as an influence upon this development. By the middle of thefifteenth century there were printers at work with movable type in Holland andthe Rhineland. The art spread to Italy and England, where Caxton was printing inWestminster in 1477. The immediate consequence was a great increase anddistribution of Bibles, and greatly increased facilities for widespread popularcontroversies. The European world became a world of readers, to an extent thathad never happened to any community in the past. And this sudden irrigation ofthe general mind with clearer ideas and more accessible information occurredjust at a time when the church was confused and divided and not in a position todefend itself effectively, and when many princes were looking for means toweaken its hold upon the vast wealth it claimed in their dominions.In Germany the attack upon the church gathered round the personality of anex-monk, Martin Luther (1483-1546), who appeared in Wittenberg in 1517 offeringdisputations against various orthodox doctrines and practices. At first hedisputed in Latin in the fashion of the Schoolmen. Then he took up the newweapon of the printed word and scattered his views far and wide in Germanaddressed to the ordinary people. An attempt was made to suppress him as Husshad been suppressed, but the printing press had changed conditions and he hadtoo many open and secret friends among the German princes for this fate toovertake him.For now in this age of multiplying ideas and weakened faith there were manyrulers who saw their advantage in breaking the religious ties between theirpeople and Rome. They sought to make themselves in person the heads of a morenationalized religion. England, Scotland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, North Germanyand Bohemia, one after another, separated themselves from the Roman Communion.They have remained separated ever since.The various princes concerned cared very little for the moral and intellectualfreedom of their subjects. They used the religious doubts and insurgence oftheir peoples to strengthen them against Rome, but they tried to keep a gripupon the popular movement as soon as that rupture was achieved and a nationalchurch set up under the control of the crown. But there has always been acurious vitality in the teaching of Jesus, a direct appeal to righteousness anda man's self-respect over every loyalty and every subordination, lay orecclesiastical. None of these princely churches broke off without also breakingoff a number of fragmentary sects that would admit the intervention of neitherprince nor Pope between a man and his God. In England and Scotland, for example,there was a number of sects who now held firmly to the Bible as their one guidein life and belief. They refused the disciplines of a state church. In Englandthese dissentients were the Non-conformists, who played a very large part in thepolitics of that country in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In Englandthey carried their objection to a princely head to the church so far as todecapitate King Charles I (1649), and for eleven prosperous years England was arepublic under Non-conformist rule.The breaking away of this large section of Northern Europe from LatinChristendom is what is generally spoken of as the Reformation. But the shock andstress of these losses produced changes perhaps as profound in the Roman Churchitself. The church was reorganized and a new spirit came into its life. One ofthe dominant figures in this revival was a young Spanish soldier, Inigo Lopez deRecalde, better known to the world as St. Ignatius of Loyola. After someromantic beginnings he became a priest (1538) and was permitted to found theSociety of Jesus, a direct attempt to bring the generous and chivalroustraditions of military discipline into the service of religion. This Society ofJesus, the Jesuits, became one of the greatest teaching and missionary societiesthe world has ever seen. It carried Christianity to India, China and America. Itarrested the rapid disintegration of the Roman Church. It raised the standard ofeducation throughout the whole Catholic world; it raised the level of Catholicintelligence and quickened the Catholic conscience everywhere; it stimulatedProtestant Europe to competitive educational efforts. The vigorous andaggressive Roman Catholic Church we know to-day is largely the product of thisJesuit revival."},{"pageContent":"LI. THE EMPEROR CHARLES VTHE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE came to a sort of climax in the reign of the EmperorCharles V. He was one of the most extraordinary monarchs that Europe has everseen. For a time he had the air of being the greatest monarch since Charlemagne.His greatness was not of his own making. It was largely the creation of hisgrandfather, the Emperor Maximilian I (1459-1519). Some families have fought,others have intrigued their way to world power; the Habsburgs married their way.Maximilian began his career with Austria, Styria, part of Alsace and otherdistricts, the original Habsburg patrimony; he married-the lady's name scarcelymatters to us-the Netherlands and Burgundy. Most of Burgundy slipped from himafter his first wife's death, but the Netherlands he held. Then he triedunsuccessfully to marry Brittany. He became Emperor in succession to his father,Frederick III, in 1493, and married the duchy of Milan. Finally he married hisson to the weak-minded daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Ferdinand andIsabella of Columbus, who not only reigned over a freshly united Spain and overSardinia and the kingdom of the two Sicilies, but over all America west ofBrazil. So it was that this Charles V, his grandson, inherited most of theAmerican continent and between a third and a half of what the Turks had left ofEurope. He succeeded to the Netherlands in 1506. When his grandfather Ferdinanddied in 1516, he became practically king of the Spanish dominions, his motherbeing imbecile; and his grandfather Maximilian dying in 1519, he was in 1520elected Emperor at the still comparatively tender age of twenty.He was a fair young man with a not very intelligent face, a thick upper lip anda long clumsy chin. He found himself in a world of young and vigorouspersonalities. It was an age of brilliant young monarchs. Francis I hadsucceeded to the French throne in 1515 at the age of twenty-one, Henry VIII hadbecome King of England in 1509 at eighteen. It was the age of Baber in India(1526-1530) and Suleiman the Magnificent in Turkey (1520), both exceptionallycapable monarchs, and the Pope Leo X (1513) was also a very distinguished Pope.The Pope and Francis I attempted to prevent the election of Charles as Emperorbecause they dreaded the concentration of so much power in the hands of one man.Both Francis I and Henry VIII offered themselves to the imperial electors. Butthere was now a long established tradition of Habsburg Emperors (since 1273),and some energetic bribery secured the election for Charles.At first the young man was very much a magnificent puppet in the hands of hisministers. Then slowly he began to assert himself and take control. He began torealize something of the threatening complexities of his exalted position. Itwas a position as unsound as it was splendid.From the very outset of his reign he was faced by the situation created byLuther's agitations in Germany. The Emperor had one reason for siding with thereformers in the opposition of the Pope to his election. But he had been broughtup in Spain, that most Catholic of countries, and he decided against Luther. Sohe came into conflict with the Protestant princes and particularly the Electorof Saxony. He found himself in the presence of an opening rift that was to splitthe outworn fabric of Christendom into two contending camps. His attempts toclose that rift were strenuous and honest and ineffective. There was anextensive peasant revolt in Germany which interwove with the general politicaland religious disturbance. And these internal troubles were complicated byattacks upon the Empire from east and west alike. On the west of Charles was hisspirited rival, Francis I; to the east was the ever advancing Turk, who was nowin Hungary, in alliance with Francis and clamouring for certain arrears oftribute from the Austrian dominions. Charles had the money and army of Spain athis disposal, but it was extremely difficult to get any effective support inmoney from Germany. His social and political troubles were complicated byfinancial distresses. He was forced to ruinous borrowing.On the whole, Charles, in alliance with Henry VIII, was successful againstFrancis I and the Turk. Their chief battlefield was North Italy; the generalshipwas dull on both sides; their advances and retreats depended mainly on thearrival of reinforcements. The German army invaded France, failed to takeMarseilles, fell back into Italy, lost Milan, and was besieged in Pavia. FrancisI made a long and unsuccessful siege of Pavia, was caught by fresh Germanforces, defeated, wounded and taken prisoner. But thereupon the Pope and HenryVIII, still haunted by the fear of his attaining excessive power, turned againstCharles. The German troops in Milan, under the Constable of Bourbon, beingunpaid, forced rather than followed their commander into a raid upon Rome. Theystormed the city and pillaged it (1527). The Pope took refuge in the Castle ofSt. Angelo while the looting and slaughter went on. He bought off the Germantroops at last by the payment of four hundred thousand ducats. Ten years of suchconfused fighting impoverished all Europe. At last the Emperor found himselftriumphant in Italy. In 1530, he was crowned by the Pope-he was the last GermanEmperor to be so crowned-at Bologna.Meanwhile the Turks were making great headway in Hungary. They had defeated andkilled the king of Hungary in 1526, they held Buda-Pesth, and in 1529 Suleimanthe Magnificent very nearly took Vienna. The Emperor was greatly concerned bythese advances, and did his utmost to drive back the Turks, but he found thegreatest difficulty in getting the German princes to unite even with thisformidable enemy upon their very borders. Francis I remained implacable for atime, and there was a new French war; but in 1538 Charles won his rival over toa more friendly attitude after ravaging the south of France. Francis and Charlesthen formed an alliance against the Turk. But the Protestant princes, the Germanprinces who were resolved to break away from Rome, had formed a league, theSchmalkaldic League, against the Emperor, and in the place of a great campaignto recover Hungary for Christendom Charles had to turn his mind to the gatheringinternal struggle in Germany. Of that struggle he saw only the opening war. Itwas a struggle, a sanguinary irrational bickering of princes, for ascendancy,now flaming into war and destruction, now sinking back to intrigues anddiplomacies; it was a snake's sack of princely policies that was to go onwrithing incurably right into the nineteenth century and to waste and desolateCentral Europe again and again.The Emperor never seems to have grasped the true forces at work in thesegathering troubles. He was for his time and station an exceptionally worthy man,and he seems to have taken the religious dissensions that were tearing Europeinto warring fragments as genuine theological differences. He gathered diets andcouncils in futile attempts at reconciliation. Formulae and confessions weretried over. The student of German history must struggle with the details of theReligious Peace of Nuremberg, the settlement at the Diet of Ratisbon, theInterim of Augsburg, and the like. Here we do but mention them as details in theworried life of this culminating Emperor. As a matter of fact, hardly one of themultifarious princes and rulers in Europe seems to have been acting in goodfaith. The widespread religious trouble of the world, the desire of the commonpeople for truth and social righteousness, the spreading knowledge of the time,all those things were merely counters in the imaginations of princely diplomacy.Henry VIII of England, who had begun his career with a book against heresy, andwho had been rewarded by the Pope with the title of \"Defender of the Faith,\"being anxious to divorce his first wife in favour of a young lady named AnneBoleyn, and wishing also to loot the vast wealth of the church in England,joined the company of Protestant princes in 1530. Sweden, Denmark and Norway hadalready gone over to the Protestant side.The German religious war began in 1546, a few months after the death of MartinLuther. We need not trouble about the incidents of the campaign. The ProtestantSaxon army was badly beaten at Lochau. By something very like a breach of faithPhilip of Hesse, the Emperor's chief remaining antagonist, was caught andimprisoned, and the Turks were bought off by the promise of an annual tribute.In 1547, to the great relief of the Emperor, Francis I died. So by 1547 Charlesgot to a kind of settlement, and made his last efforts to effect peace wherethere was no peace. In 1552 all Germany was at war again, only a precipitateflight from Innsbruck saved Charles from capture, and in 1552, with the treatyof Passau, came another unstable equilibrium.Such is the brief outline of the politics of the Empire for thirty-two years. Itis interesting to note how entirely the European mind was concentrated upon thestruggle for European ascendancy. Neither Turks, French, English nor Germans hadyet discovered any political interest in the great continent of America, nor anysignificance in the new sea routes to Asia. Great things were happening inAmerica; Cortez with a mere handful of men had conquered the great Neolithicempire of Mexico for Spain, Pizarro had crossed the Isthmus of Panama (1530) andsubjugated another wonder-land, Peru. But as yet these events meant no more toEurope than a useful and stimulating influx of silver to the Spanish treasury.It was after the treaty of Passau that Charles began to display his distinctiveoriginality of mind. He was now entirely bored and disillusioned by his imperialgreatness. A sense of the intolerable futility of these European rivalries cameupon him. He had never been of a very sound constitution, he was naturallyindolent and he was suffering greatly from gout. He abdicated. He made over allhis sovereign rights in Germany to his brother Ferdinand, and Spain and theNetherlands he resigned to his son Philip. Then in a sort of magnificent dudgeonhe retired to a monastery at Yuste, among the oak and chestnut forests in thehills to the north of the Tagus valley. There he died in 1558.Much has been written in a sentimental vein of this retirement, thisrenunciation of the world by this tired majestic Titan, world-weary, seeking inan austere solitude his peace with God. But his retreat was neither solitary noraustere; he had with him nearly a hundred and fifty attendants; hisestablishment had all the splendour and indulgences without the fatigues of acourt, and Philip II was a dutiful son to whom his father's advice was acommand.And if Charles had lost his living interest in the administration of Europeanaffairs, there were other motives of a more immediate sort to stir him. SaysPrescott: \"In the almost daily correspondence between Quixada, or Gaztelu, andthe Secretary of State at Valladolid, there is scarcely a letter that does notturn more or less on the Emperor's eating or his illness. The one seemsnaturally to follow, like a running commentary, on the other. It is rare thatsuch topics have formed the burden of communications with the department ofstate. It must have been no easy matter for the secretary to preserve hisgravity in the perusal of despatches in which politics and gastronomy were sostrangely mixed together. The courier from Valladolid to Lisbon was ordered tomake a detour, so as to take Jarandilla in his route, and bring supplies to theroyal table. On Thursdays he was to bring fish to serve for the jour maigre thatwas to follow. The trout in the neighbourhood Charles thought too small, soothers of a larger size were to be sent from Valladolid. Fish of every kind wasto his taste, as, indeed, was anything that in its nature or habits at allapproached to fish. Eels, frogs, oysters, occupied an important place in theroyal bill of fare. Potted fish, especially anchovies, found great favour withhim; and he regretted that he had not brought a better supply of these from theLow Countries. On an eel-pasty he particularly doted.\"In 1554 Charles had obtained a bull from Pope Julius III granting him adispensation from fasting, and allowing him to break his fast early in themorning even when he was to take the sacrament.Eating and doctoring! it was a return to elemental things. He had never acquiredthe habit of reading, but he would make what one narrator describes as a \"sweetand heavenly commentary.\" He also amused himself with mechanical toys, bylistening to music or sermons, and by attending to the imperial business thatstill came drifting in to him. The death of the Empress, to whom he was greatlyattached, had turned his mind towards religion, which in his case took apunctilious and ceremonial form; every Friday in Lent he scourged himself withthe rest of the monks with such good will as to draw blood. These exercises andthe gout released a bigotry in Charles that had hitherto been restrained byconsiderations of policy. The appearance of Protestant teaching close at hand inValladolid roused him to fury. \"Tell the grand inquisitor and his council fromme to be at their posts, and to lay the axe at the root of the evil before itspreads further.\" He expressed a doubt whether it would not be well, in soblack an affair, to dispense with the ordinary course of justice, and to show nomercy; \"lest the criminal, if pardoned, should have the opportunity of repeatinghis crime.\" He recommended, as an example, his own mode of proceeding in theNetherlands, \"where all who remained obstinate in their errors were burnedalive, and those who were admitted to penitence were beheaded.\"And almost symbolical of his place and rôle in history was his preoccupationwith funerals. He seems to have had an intuition that something great was deadin Europe and sorely needed burial, that there was a need to write Finis,overdue. He not only attended every actual funeral that was celebrated at Yuste,but he had services conducted for the absent dead, he held a funeral service inmemory of his wife on the anniversary of her death, and finally he celebratedhis own obsequies.\"The chapel was hung with black, and the blaze of hundreds of wax-lights wasscarcely sufficient to dispel the darkness. The brethren in their conventualdress, and all the Emperor's household clad in deep mourning, gathered round ahuge catafalque, shrouded also in black, which had been raised in the centre ofthe chapel. The service for the burial of the dead was then performed; and,amidst the dismal wail of the monks, the prayers ascended for the departedspirit, that it might be received into the mansions of the blessed. Thesorrowful attendants were melted to tears, as the image of their master's deathwas presented to their minds-or they were touched, it may be, with compassion bythis pitiable display of weakness. Charles, muffled in a dark mantle, andbearing a lighted candle in his hand, mingled with his household, the spectatorof his own obsequies; and the doleful ceremony was concluded by his placing thetaper in the hands of the priest, in sign of his surrendering up his soul to theAlmighty.\"Within two months of this masquerade he was dead. And the brief greatness of theHoly Roman Empire died with him. His realm was already divided between hisbrother and his son. The Holy Roman Empire struggled on indeed to the days ofNapoleon I but as an invalid and dying thing. To this day its unburied traditionstill poisons the political air.Appendix to Robertson's History of Charles V.LII. THE AGE OF POLITICAL EXPERIMENTS; OF GRAND MONARCHY AND PARLIAMENTS ANDREPUBLICANISM IN EUROPETHE LATIN CHURCH was broken, the Holy Roman Empire was in extreme decay; thehistory of Europe from the opening of the sixteenth century onward in a story ofpeoples feeling their way darkly to some new method of government, betteradapted to the new conditions that were arising. In the Ancient World, over longperiods of time, there had been changes of dynasty and even changes of rulingrace and language, but the form of government through monarch and templeremained fairly stable, and still more stable was the ordinary way of living. Inthis modern Europe since the sixteenth century the dynastic changes areunimportant, and the interest of history lies in the wide and increasing varietyof experiments in political and social organization.The political history of the world from the sixteenth century onward was, wehave said, an effort, a largely unconscious effort, of mankind to adapt itspolitical and social methods to certain new conditions that had now arisen. Theeffort to adapt was complicated by the fact that the conditions themselves werechanging with a steadily increasing rapidity. The adaptation, mainly unconsciousand almost always unwilling (for man in general hates voluntary change), haslagged more and more behind the alterations in conditions. From the sixteenthcentury onward the history of mankind is a story of political and socialinstitutions becoming more and more plainly misfits, less comfortable and morevexatious, and of the slow reluctant realization of the need for a conscious anddeliberate reconstruction of the whole scheme of human societies in the face ofneeds and possibilities new to all the former experiences of life.What are these changes in the conditions of human life that have disorganizedthat balance of empire, priest, peasant and trader, with periodic refreshment bybarbaric conquest, that has held human affairs in the Old World in a sort ofworking rhythm for more than a hundred centuries?They are manifold and various, for human affairs are multitudinously complex;but the main changes seem all to turn upon one cause, namely the growth andextension of a knowledge of the nature of things, beginning first of all insmall groups of intelligent people and spreading at first slowly, and in thelast five hundred years very rapidly, to larger and larger proportions of thegeneral population.But there has also been a great change in human conditions due to a change inthe spirit of human life. This change has gone on side by side with the increaseand extension of knowledge, and is subtly connected with it. There has been anincreasing disposition to treat a life based on the common and more elementarydesires and gratifications as unsatisfactory, and to seek relationship with andservice and participation in a larger life. This is the common characteristic ofall the great religions that have spread throughout the world in the last twentyodd centuries, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam alike. They have had to do withthe spirit of man in a way that the older religions did not have to do. They areforces quite different in their nature and effect from the old fetishisticblood-sacrifice religions of priest and temple that they have in part modifiedand in part replaced. They have gradually evolved a self-respect in theindividual and a sense of participation and responsibility in the commonconcerns of mankind that did not exist among the populations of the earliercivilizations.The first considerable change in the conditions of political and social life wasthe simplification and extended use of writing in the ancient civilizationswhich made larger empires and wider political understandings practicable andinevitable. The next movement forward came with the introduction of the horse,and later on of the camel as a means of transport, the use of wheeled vehicles,the extension of roads and the increased military efficiency due to thediscovery of terrestrial iron. Then followed the profound economic disturbancesdue to the device of coined money and the change in the nature of debt,proprietorship and trade due to this convenient but dangerous convention. Theempires grew in size and range, and men's ideas grew likewise to correspond withthese things. Came the disappearance of local gods, the age of theocrasia, andthe teaching of the great world religions. Came also the beginnings of reasonedand recorded history and geography, the first realization by man of his profoundignorance, and the first systematic search for knowledge.For a time the scientific process which began so brilliantly in Greece andAlexandria was interrupted. The raids of the Teutonic barbarians, the westwarddrive of the Mongolian peoples, convulsive religious reconstruction and greatpestilences put enormous strains upon political and social order. Whencivilization emerged again from this phase of conflict and confusion, slaverywas no longer the basis of economic life; and the first paper-mills werepreparing a new medium for collective information and co-operation in printedmatter. Gradually at this point and that, the search for knowledge, thesystematic scientific process, was resumedAnd now from the sixteenth century onward, as an inevitable by-product ofsystematic thought, appeared a steadily increasing series of inventions anddevices affecting the intercommunication and interaction of men with oneanother. They all tended towards wider range of action, greater mutual benefitsor injuries, and increased co-operation, and they came faster and faster. Men'sminds had not been prepared for anything of the sort, and until the greatcatastrophes at the beginning of the twentieth century quickened men's minds,the historian has very little to tell of any intelligently planned attempts tomeet the new conditions this increasing flow of inventions was creating. Thehistory of mankind for the last four centuries is rather like that of animprisoned sleeper, stirring clumsily and uneasily while the prison thatrestrains and shelters him catches fire, not waking but incorporating thecrackling and warmth of the fire with ancient and incongruous dreams, than likethat of a man consciously awake to danger and opportunity.Since history is the story not of individual lives but of communities, it isinevitable that the inventions that figure most in the historical record areinventions affecting communications. In the sixteenth century the chief newthings that we have to note are the appearance of printed paper and thesea-worthy, ocean-going sailing ship using the new device of the mariner'scompass. The former cheapened, spread, and revolutionized teaching, publicinformation and discussion, and the fundamental operations of politicalactivity. The latter made the round world one. But almost equally important wasthe increased utilization and improvement of guns and gunpowder which theMongols had first brought westward in the thirteenth century. This destroyed thepractical immunity of barons in their castles and of walled cities. Guns sweptaway feudalism. Constantinople fell to guns. Mexico and Peru fell before theterror of the Spanish guns.The seventeenth century saw the development of systematic scientificpublication, a less conspicuous but ultimately far more pregnant innovation.Conspicuous among the leaders in this great forward step was Sir Francis Bacon(1561-1626) afterwards Lord Verulam, Lord Chancellor of England. He was thepupil and perhaps the mouthpiece of another Englishman, Dr. Gilbert, theexperimental philosopher of Colchester (1540-1603). This second Bacon, like thefirst, preached observation and experiment, and he used the inspiring andfruitful form of a Utopian story, The New Atlantis, to express his dream of agreat service of scientific research.Presently arose the Royal Society of London, the Florentine Society, and laterother national bodies for the encouragement of research and the publication andexchange of knowledge. These European scientific societies became fountains notonly of countless inventions but also of a destructive criticism of thegrotesque theological history of the world that had dominated and crippled humanthought for many centuries.Neither the seventeenth nor the eighteenth century witnessed any innovations soimmediately revolutionary in human conditions as printed paper and theocean-going ship, but there was a steady accumulation of knowledge andscientific energy that was to bear its full fruits in the nineteenth century.The exploration and mapping of the world went on. Tasmania, Australia, NewZealand appeared on the map. In Great Britain in the eighteenth century coalcoke began to be used for metallurgical purposes, leading to a considerablecheapening of iron and to the possibility of casting and using it in largerpieces than had been possible before, when it had been smelted with woodcharcoal. Modern machinery dawned.Like the trees of the celestial city, science bears bud and flower and fruit atthe same time and continuously. With the onset of the nineteenth century thereal fruition of science-which indeed henceforth may never cease-began. Firstcame steam and steel, the railway, the great liner, vast bridges and buildings,machinery of almost limitless power, the possibility of a bountiful satisfactionof every material human need, and then, still more wonderful, the hiddentreasures of electrical science were opened to men.We have compared the political and social life of man from the sixteenth centuryonward to that of a sleeping prisoner who lies and dreams while his prison burnsabout him. In the sixteenth century the European mind was still going on withits Latin Imperial dream, its dream of a Holy Roman Empire, united under aCatholic Church. But just as some uncontrollable element in our composition willinsist at times upon introducing into our dreams the most absurd and destructivecomments, so thrust into this dream we find the sleeping face and cravingstomach of the Emperor Charles V, while Henry VIII of England and Luther tearthe unity of Catholicism to shreds.In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the dream turned to personalmonarchy. The history of nearly all Europe during this period tells withvariations the story of an attempt to consolidate a monarchy, to make itabsolute and to extend its power over weaker adjacent regions, and of the steadyresistance, first of the landowners and then with the increase of foreign tradeand home industry, of the growing trading and moneyed class, to the exaction andinterference of the crown. There is no universal victory of either side; here itis the King who gets the upper hand while there it is the man of privateproperty who beats the King. In one case we find a King becoming the sun andcentre of his national world, while just over his borders a sturdy mercantileclass maintains a republic. So wide a range of variation shows how entirelyexperimental, what local accidents, were all the various governments of thisperiod.A very common figure in these national dramas is the King's minister, often inthe still Catholic countries a prelate, who stands behind the King, serves himand dominates him by his indispensable services.Here in the limits set to us it is impossible to tell these various nationaldramas in detail. The trading folk of Holland went Protestant and republican,and cast off the rule of Philip II of Spain, the son of the Emperor Charles V.In England Henry VIII and his minister Wolsey, Queen Elizabeth and her ministerBurleigh, prepared the foundations of an absolutism that was wrecked by thefolly of James I and Charles I. Charles I was beheaded for treason to his people(1649), a new turn in the political thought of Europe. For a dozen years (until1660) Britain was a republic; and the crown was an unstable power, muchovershadowed by Parliament, until George III (1760-1820) made a strenuous andpartly successful effort to restore its predominance. The King of France, on theother hand, was the most successful of all the European Kings in perfectingmonarchy. Two great ministers, Richelieu (1585-1642) and Mazarin (1602-1661),built up the power of the crown in that country, and the process was aided bythe long reign and very considerable abilities of King Louis XIV, \"the GrandMonarque\" (1643-1715).Louis XIV was indeed the pattern King of Europe. He was, within his limitations,an exceptionally capable King; his ambition was stronger than his baserpassions, and he guided his country towards bankruptcy through the complicationof a spirited foreign policy with an elaborate dignity that still extorts ouradmiration. His immediate desire was to consolidate and extend France to theRhine and Pyrenees, and to absorb the Spanish Netherlands; his remoter view sawthe French Kings as the possible successors of Charlemagne in a recast HolyRoman Empire. He made bribery a state method almost more important than warfare.Charles II of England was in his pay, and so were most of the Polish nobility,presently to be described. His money, or rather the money of the tax-payingclasses in France, went everywhere. But his prevailing occupation was splendour.His great palace at Versailles with its salons, its corridors, its mirrors, itsterraces and fountains and parks and prospects, was the envy and admiration ofthe world.He provoked a universal imitation. Every king and princelet in Europe wasbuilding his own Versailles as much beyond his means as his subjects and creditswould permit. Everywhere the nobility rebuilt or extended their chateaux to thenew pattern. A great industry of beautiful and elaborate fabrics and furnishingsdeveloped. The luxurious arts flourished everywhere; sculpture in alabaster,faience, gilt woodwork, metal work, stamped leather, much music, magnificentpainting, beautiful printing and bindings, fine crockery, fine vintages. Amidstthe mirrors and fine furniture went a strange race of \"gentlemen\" in tallpowdered wigs, silks and laces, poised upon high red heels, supported by amazingcanes; and still more wonderful \"ladies,\" under towers of powdered hair andwearing vast expansions of silk and satin sustained on wire. Through it allpostured the great Louis, the sun of his world, unaware of the meagre and sulkyand bitter faces that watched him from those lower darknesses to which hissunshine did not penetrate.The German people remained politically divided throughout this period of themonarchies and experimental governments, and a considerable number of ducal andprincely courts aped the splendours of Versailles on varying scales. The ThirtyYears' War (1618-48), a devastating scramble among the Germans, Swedes andBohemians for fluctuating political advantages, sapped the energies of Germanyfor a century. A map must show the crazy patchwork in which this struggle ended,a map of Europe according to the peace of Westphalia (1648). One sees a tangleof principalities, dukedoms, free states and the like, some partly in and partlyout of the Empire. Sweden's arm, the reader will note, reached far into Germany;and except for a few islands of territory within the imperial boundaries Francewas still far from the Rhine. Amidst this patchwork the Kingdom of Prussia-itbecame a Kingdom in 1701-rose steadily to prominence and sustained a series ofsuccessful wars. Frederick the Great of Prussia (1740-86) had his Versailles atPotsdam, where his court spoke French, read French literature and rivalled theculture of the French King.In 1714 the Elector of Hanover became King of England, adding one more to thelist of monarchies half in and half out of the empire.The Austrian branch of the descendants of Charles V retained the title ofEmperor; the Spanish branch retained Spain. But now there was also an Emperor ofthe East again. After the fall of Constantinople (1453), the grand duke ofMoscow, Ivan the Great (1462-1505), claimed to be heir to the Byzantine throneand adopted the Byzantine double-headed eagle upon his arms. His grandson, IvanIV, Ivan the Terrible (1533-1584), assumed the imperial title of Caesar (Tsar).But only in the latter half of the seventeenth century did Russia cease to seemremote and Asiatic to the European mind. The Tsar Peter the Great (1682-1725)brought Russia into the arena of Western affairs. He built a new capital for hisempire, Petersburg upon the Neva, that played the part of a window betweenRussia and Europe, and he set up his Versailles at Peterhof eighteen miles away,employing a French architect who gave him a terrace, fountains, cascades,picture gallery, park and all the recognized appointments of Grand Monarchy. InRussia as in Prussia French became the language of the court.Unhappily placed between Austria, Prussia and Russia was the Polish kingdom, anill-organized state of great landed proprietors too jealous of their ownindividual grandeur to permit more than a nominal kingship to the monarch theyelected. Her fate was division among these three neighbours, in spite of theefforts of France to retain her as an independent ally. Switzerland at this timewas a group of republican cantons; Venice was a republic; Italy like so much ofGermany was divided among minor dukes and princes. The Pope ruled like a princein the papal states, too fearful now of losing the allegiance of the remainingCatholic princes to interfere between them and their subjects or to remind theworld of the commonweal of Christendom. There remained indeed no commonpolitical idea in Europe at all; Europe was given over altogether to divisionand diversity.All these sovereign princes and republics carried on schemes of aggrandizementagainst each other. Each one of them pursued a \"foreign policy\" of aggressionagainst its neighbours and of aggressive alliances. We Europeans still liveto-day in the last phase of this age of the multifarious sovereign states, andstill suffer from the hatreds, hostilities and suspicions it engendered. Thehistory of this time becomes more and more manifestly \"gossip,\" more and moreunmeaning and wearisome to a modern intelligence. You are told of how this warwas caused by this King's mistress, and how the jealousy of one minister foranother caused that. A tittle-tattle of bribes and rivalries disgusts theintelligent student. The more permanently significant fact is that in spite ofthe obstruction of a score of frontiers, reading and thought still spread andincreased and inventions multiplied. The eighteenth century saw the appearanceof a literature profoundly sceptical and critical of the courts and policies ofthe time. In such a book as Voltaire's Candide we have the expression of aninfinite weariness with the planless confusion of the European world.LIII. THE NEW EMPIRES OF THE EUROPEANS IN ASIA AND OVERSEASWHILE Central Europe thus remained divided and confused, the Western Europeansand particularly the Dutch, the Scandinavians, the Spanish, the Portuguese, theFrench and the British were extending the area of their struggles across theseas of all the world. The printing press had dissolved the political ideas ofEurope into a vast and at first indeterminate fermentation, but that other greatinnovation, the oceangoing sailing ship, was inexorably extending the range ofEuropean experience to the furthermost limits of salt water.The first overseas settlements of the Dutch and Northern Atlantic Europeans werenot for colonization but for trade and mining. The Spaniards were first in thefield; they claimed dominion over the whole of this new world of America. Verysoon however the Portuguese asked for a share. The Pope-it was one of the lastacts of Rome as mistress of the world-divided the new continent between thesetwo first-comers, giving Portugal Brazil and everything else east of a line 370leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, and all the rest to Spain (1494). ThePortuguese at this time were also pushing overseas enterprise southward andeastward. In 1497 Vasco da Gama had sailed from Lisbon round the Cape toZanzibar and then to Calicut in India. In 1515 there were Portuguese ships inJava and the Moluccas, and the Portuguese were setting up and fortifying tradingstations round and about the coasts of the Indian Ocean. Mozambique, Goa, andtwo smaller possessions in India, Macao in China and a part of Timor are to thisday Portuguese possessions.The nations excluded from America by the papal settlement paid little heed tothe rights of Spain and Portugal. The English, the Danes and Swedes, andpresently the Dutch, were soon staking out claims in North America and the WestIndies, and his Most Catholic Majesty of France heeded the papal settlement aslittle as any Protestant. The wars of Europe extended themselves to these claimsand possessions.In the long run the English were the most successful in this scramble foroverseas possessions. The Danes and Swedes were too deeply entangled in thecomplicated affairs of Germany to sustain effective expeditions abroad. Swedenwas wasted upon the German battlefields by a picturesque king, GustavusAdolphus, the Protestant \"Lion of the North.\" The Dutch were the heirs of suchsmall settlements as Sweden made in America, and the Dutch were too near Frenchaggressions to hold their own against the British. In the far East the chiefrivals for empire were the British, Dutch and French, and in America theBritish, French and Spanish. The British had the supreme advantage of a waterfrontier, the \"silver streak\" of the English Channel, against Europe. Thetradition of the Latin Empire entangled them least.France has always thought too much in terms of Europe. Throughout the eighteenthcentury she was wasting her opportunities of expansion in West and East alike inorder to dominate Spain, Italy and the German confusion. The religious andpolitical dissensions of Britain in the seventeenth century had driven many ofthe English to seek a permanent home in America. They struck root and increasedand multiplied, giving the British a great advantage in the American struggle.In 1756 and 1760 the French lost Canada to the British and their Americancolonists, and a few years later the British trading company found itselfcompletely dominant over French, Dutch and Portuguese in the peninsula of India.The great Mongol Empire of Baber, Akbar and their successors had now far gone indecay, and the story of its practical capture by a London trading company, theBritish East India Company, is one of the most extraordinary episodes in thewhole history of conquest.This East India Company had been originally at the time of its incorporationunder Queen Elizabeth no more than a company of sea adventurers. Step by stepthey had been forced to raise troops and arm their ships. And now this tradingcompany, with its tradition of gain, found itself dealing not merely in spicesand dyes and tea and jewels, but in the revenues and territories of princes andthe destinies of India. It had come to buy and sell, and it found itselfachieving a tremendous piracy. There was no one to challenge its proceedings. Isit any wonder that its captains and commanders and officials, nay, even itsclerks and common soldiers, came back to England loaded with spoils?Men under such circumstances, with a great and wealthy land at their mercy,could not determine what they might or might not do. It was a strange land tothem, with a strange sunlight; its brown people seemed a different race, outsidetheir range of sympathy; its mysterious temples sustained fantastic standards ofbehaviour. Englishmen at home were perplexed when presently these generals andofficials came back to make dark accusations against each other of extortionsand cruelties. Upon Clive Parliament passed a vote of censure. He committedsuicide in 1774. In 1788 Warren Hastings, a second great Indian administrator,was impeached and acquitted (1792). It was a strange and unprecedented situationin the world's history. The English Parliament found itself ruling over a Londontrading company, which in its turn was dominating an empire far greater and morepopulous than all the domains of the British crown. To the bulk of the Englishpeople India was a remote, fantastic, almost inaccessible land, to whichadventurous poor young men went out, to return after many years very rich andvery choleric old gentlemen. It was difficult for the English to conceive whatthe life of these countless brown millions in the eastern sunshine could be.Their imaginations declined the task. India remained romantically unreal. It wasimpossible for the English, therefore, to exert any effective supervision andcontrol over the company's proceedings.And while the Western European powers were thus fighting for these fantasticoverseas empires upon every ocean in the world, two great land conquests were inprogress in Asia. China had thrown off the Mongol yoke in 1360, and flourishedunder the great native dynasty of the Mings until 1644. Then the Manchus,another Mongol people, reconquered China and remained masters of China until1912. Meanwhile Russia was pushing East and growing to greatness in the world'saffairs. The rise of this great central power of the old world, which is neitheraltogether of the East nor altogether of the West, is one of the utmostimportance to our human destiny. Its expansion is very largely due to theappearance of a Christian steppe people, the Cossacks, who formed a barrierbetween the feudal agriculture of Poland and Hungary to the west and the Tartarto the east. The Cossacks were the wild east of Europe, and in many ways notunlike the wild west of the United States in the middle nineteenth century. Allwho had made Russia too hot to hold them, criminals as well as the persecutedinnocent, rebellious serfs, religious secretaries, thieves, vagabonds,murderers, sought asylum in the southern steppes and there made a fresh startand fought for life and freedom against Pole, Russian and Tartar alike.Doubtless fugitives from the Tartars to the east also contributed to the Cossackmixture. Slowly these border folk were incorporated in the Russian imperialservice, much as the highland clans of Scotland were converted into regiments bythe British government. New lands were offered them in Asia. They became aweapon against the dwindling power of the Mongolian nomads, first in Turkestanand then across Siberia as far as the Amur.The decay of Mongol energy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is verydifficult to explain. Within two or three centuries from the days of Jengis andTimurlane Central Asia had relapsed from a period of world ascendancy to extremepolitical impotence. Changes of climate, unrecorded pestilences, infections of amalarial type, may have played their part in this recession-which may be only atemporary recession measured by the scale of universal history-of the CentralAsian peoples. Some authorities think that the spread of Buddhist teaching fromChina also had a pacifying influence upon them. At any rate, by the sixteenthcentury the Mongol, Tartar and Turkish peoples were no longer pressing outward,but were being invaded, subjugated and pushed back both by Christian Russia inthe west and by China in the east.All through the seventeenth century the Cossacks were spreading eastward fromEuropean Russia, and settling wherever they found agricultural conditions.Cordons of forts and stations formed a moving frontier to these settlements tothe south, where the Turkomans were still strong and active; to the north-east,however, Russia had no frontier until she reached right to the Pacific.LIV. THE AMERICAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCETHE THIRD quarter of the eighteenth century thus saw the remarkable and unstablespectacle of a Europe divided against itself, and no longer with any unifyingpolitical or religious idea, yet through the immense stimulation of men'simaginations by the printed book, the printed map, and the opportunity of thenew ocean-going shipping, able in a disorganized and contentious manner todominate all the coasts of the world. It was a planless, incoherent ebullitionof enterprise due to temporary and almost accidental advantages over the rest ofmankind. By virtue of these advantages this new and still largely emptycontinent of America was peopled mainly from Western European sources, and SouthAfrica and Australia and New Zealand marked down as prospective homes for aEuropean population.The motive that had sent Columbus to America and Vasco da Gama to India was theperennial first motive of all sailors since the beginning of things-trade. Butwhile in the already populous and productive East the trade motive remaineddominant, and the European settlements remained trading settlements from whichthe European inhabitants hoped to return home to spend their money, theEuropeans in America, dealing with communities at a very much lower level ofproductive activity, found a new inducement for persistence in the search forgold and silver. Particularly did the mines of Spanish America yield silver. TheEuropeans had to go to America not simply as armed merchants but as prospectors,miners, searchers after natural products, and presently as planters. In thenorth they sought furs. Mines and plantations necessitated settlements. Theyobliged people to set up permanent overseas homes. Finally in some cases, aswhen the English Puritans went to New England in the early seventeenth centuryto escape religious persecution, when in the eighteenth Oglethorpe sent peoplefrom the English debtors' prisons to Georgia, and when in the end of theeighteenth the Dutch sent orphans to the Cape of Good Hope, the Europeansfrankly crossed the seas to find new homes for good. In the nineteenth century,and especially after the coming of the steamship, the stream of Europeanemigration to the new empty lands of America and Australia rose for some decadesto the scale of a great migration.So there grew up permanent overseas populations of Europeans, and the Europeanculture was transplanted to much larger areas than those in which it had beendeveloped. These new communities bringing a ready-made civilization with them tothese new lands grew up, as it were, unplanned and unperceived; the statecraftof Europe did not foresee them, and was unprepared with any ideas about theirtreatment. The politicians and ministers of Europe continued to regard them asessentially expeditionary establishments, sources of revenue, \"possessions\" and\"dependencies,\" long after their peoples had developed a keen sense of theirseparate social life. And also they continued to treat them as helplesslysubject to the mother country long after the population had spread inland out ofreach of any effectual punitive operations from the sea.Because until right into the nineteenth century, it must be remembered, the linkof all these overseas empires was the oceangoing sailing ship. On land theswiftest thing was still the horse, and the cohesion and unity of politicalsystems on land was still limited by the limitations of horse communications.Now at the end of the third quarter of the eighteenth century the northerntwo-thirds of North America was under the British crown. France had abandonedAmerica. Except for Brazil, which was Portuguese, and one or two small islandsand areas in French, British, Danish and Dutch hands, Florida, Louisiana,California and all America to the south was Spanish. It was the British coloniessouth of Maine and Lake Ontario that first demonstrated the inadequacy of thesailing ship to hold overseas populations together in one political system.These British colonies were very miscellaneous in their origin and character.There were French, Swedish and Dutch settlements as well as British; there wereBritish Catholics in Maryland and British ultra-Protestants in New England, andwhile the New Englanders farmed their own land and denounced slavery, theBritish in Virginia and the south were planters employing a swelling multitudeof imported negro slaves. There was no natural common unity in such states. Toget from one to the other might mean a coasting voyage hardly less tedious thanthe transatlantic crossing. But the union that diverse origin and naturalconditions denied the British Americans was forced upon them by the selfishnessand stupidity of the British government in London. They were taxed without anyvoice in the spending of the taxes; their trade was sacrificed to Britishinterests; the highly profitable slave trade was maintained by the Britishgovernment in spite of the opposition of the Virginians who-though quite willingto hold and use slaves-feared to be swamped by an evergrowing barbaric blackpopulation.Britain at that time was lapsing towards an intenser form of monarchy, and theobstinate personality of George III (1760-1820) did much to force on a strugglebetween the home and the colonial governments.The conflict was precipitated by legislation which favoured the London EastIndia Company at the expense of the American shipper. Three cargoes of tea whichwere imported under the new conditions were thrown overboard in Boston harbourby a band of men disguised as Indians (1773). Fighting only began in 1775 whenthe British government attempted to arrest two of the American leaders atLexington near Boston. The first shots were fired in Lexington by the British;the first fighting occurred at Concord.So the American War of Independence began, though for more than a year thecolonists showed themselves extremely unwilling to sever their links with themother land. It was not until the middle of 1776 that the Congress of theinsurgent states issued \"The Declaration of Independence.\" George Washington,who like many of the leading colonists of the time had had a military trainingin the wars against the French, was made commander-in-chief. In 1777 a Britishgeneral, General Burgoyne, in an attempt to reach New York from Canada, wasdefeated at Freemans Farm and obliged to surrender at Saratoga. In the same yearthe French and Spanish declared war upon Great Britain, greatly hampering hersea communications. A second British army under General Cornwallis was caught inthe Yorktown peninsula in Virginia and obliged to capitulate in 1781. In 1783peace was made in Paris, and the Thirteen Colonies from Maine to Georgia becamea union of independent sovereign States. So the United States of America cameinto existence. Canada remained loyal to the British flag.For four years these States had only a very feeble central government undercertain Articles of Confederation, and they seemed destined to break up intoseparate independent communities. Their immediate separation was delayed by thehostility of the British and a certain aggressiveness on the part of the Frenchwhich brought home to them the immediate dangers of division. A Constitution wasdrawn up and ratified in 1788 establishing a more efficient Federal governmentwith a President holding very considerable powers, and the weak sense ofnational unity was invigorated by a second war with Britain in 1812.Nevertheless the area covered by the States was so wide and their interests sodiverse at that time, that-given only the means of communication thenavailable-a disintegration of the Union into separate states on the Europeanscale of size was merely a question of time. Attendance at Washington meant along, tedious and insecure journey for the senators and congressmen of theremoter districts, and the mechanical impediments to the diffusion of a commoneducation and a common literature and intelligence were practicallyinsurmountable. Forces were at work in the world however that were to arrest theprocess of differentiation altogether. Presently came the river steamboat andthen the railway and the telegraph to save the United States from fragmentation,and weave its dispersed people together again into the first of great modernnations.Twenty-two years later the Spanish colonies in America were to follow theexample of the Thirteen and break their connection with Europe. But being moredispersed over the continent and separated by great mountainous chains anddeserts and forests and by the Portuguese Empire of Brazil, they did not achievea union among themselves. They became a constellation of republican states, veryprone at first to wars among themselves and to revolutions.Brazil followed a rather different line towards the inevitable separation. In1807 the French armies under Napoleon had occupied the mother country ofPortugal, and the monarchy had fled to Brazil. From that time on until theyseparated, Portugal was rather a dependency of Brazil than Brazil of Portugal.In 1822 Brazil declared itself a separate Empire under Pedro I, a son of thePortuguese King. But the new world has never been very favourable to monarchy.In 1889 the Emperor of Brazil was shipped off quietly to Europe, and the UnitedStates of Brazil fell into line with the rest of republican America.LV. THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE RESTORATION OF MONARCHY IN FRANCEBRITAIN had hardly lost the Thirteen Colonies-in America before a profoundsocial and political convulsion at the very heart of Grand Monarchy was toremind Europe still more vividly of the essentially temporary nature of thepolitical arrangements of the world.We have said that the French monarchy was the most successful of the personalmonarchies in Europe. It was the envy and model of a multitude of competing andminor courts. But it flourished on a basis of injustice that led to its dramaticcollapse. It was brilliant and aggressive, but it was wasteful of the life andsubstance of its common people. The clergy and nobility were protected fromtaxation by a system of exemption that threw the whole burden of the state uponthe middle and lower classes. The peasants were ground down by taxation; themiddle classes were dominated and humiliated by the nobility.In 1787 this French monarchy found itself bankrupt and obliged to callrepresentatives of the different classes of the realm into consultation upon theperplexities of defective income and excessive expenditure. In 1789 the StatesGeneral, a gathering of the nobles, clergy and commons, roughly equivalent tothe earlier form of the British Parliament, was called together at Versailles.It had not assembled since 1610. For all that time France had been an absolutemonarchy. Now the people found a means of expressing their long fermentingdiscontent. Disputes immediately broke out between the three estates, due to theresolve of the Third Estate, the Commons, to control the Assembly. The Commonsgot the better of these disputes and the States General became a NationalAssembly, clearly resolved to keep the crown in order, as the British Parliamentkept the British crown in order. The king (Louis XVI) prepared for a struggleand brought up troops from the provinces. Whereupon Paris and France revolted.The collapse of the absolute monarchy was very swift. The grim-looking prison ofthe Bastille was stormed by the people of Paris, and the insurrection spreadrapidly throughout France. In the east and north-west provinces many chateauxbelonging to the nobility were burnt by the peasants, their title-deedscarefully destroyed, and the owners murdered or driven away. In a month theancient and decayed system of the aristocratic order had collapsed. Many of theleading princes and courtiers of the queen's party fled abroad. A provisionalcity government was set up in Paris and in most of the other large cities, and anew armed force, the National Guard, a force designed primarily and plainly toresist the forces of the crown, was brought into existence by these municipalbodies. The National Assembly found itself called upon to create a new politicaland social system for a new age.It was a task that tried the powers of that gathering to the utmost. It made agreat sweep of the chief injustices of the absolutist regime; it abolished taxexemptions, serfdom, aristocratic titles and privileges and sought to establisha constitutional monarchy in Paris. The king abandoned Versailles and itssplendours and kept a diminished state in the palace of the Tuileries in Paris.For two years it seemed that the National Assembly might struggle through to aneffective modernized government. Much of its work was sound and still endures,if much was experimental and had to be undone. Much was ineffective. There was aclearing up of the penal code; torture, arbitrary imprisonment and persecutionsfor heresy were abolished. The ancient provinces of France, Normandy, Burgundyand the like gave place to eighty departments. Promotion to the highest ranks inthe army was laid open to men of every class. An excellent and simple system oflaw courts was set up, but its value was much vitiated by having the judgesappointed by popular election for short periods of time. This made the crowd asort of final court of appeal, and the judges, like the members of the Assembly,were forced to play to the gallery. And the whole vast property of the churchwas seized and administered by the state; religious establishments not engagedin education or works of charity were broken up, and the salaries of the clergymade a charge upon the nation. This in itself was not a bad thing for the lowerclergy in France, who were often scandalously underpaid in comparison with thericher dignitaries. But in addition the choice of priests and bishops was madeelective, which struck at the very root idea of the Roman Church, which centredeverything upon the Pope, and in which all authority is from above downward.Practically the National Assembly wanted at one blow to make the church inFrance Protestant, in organization if not in doctrine. Everywhere there weredisputes and conflicts between the state priests created by the NationalAssembly and the recalcitrant (non-juring) priests who were loyal to Rome.In 1791 the experiment of Constitutional monarchy in France was brought to anabrupt end by the action of the king and queen, working in concert with theiraristocratic and monarchist friends abroad. Foreign armies gathered on theEastern frontier and one night in June the king and queen and their childrenslipped away from the Tuileries and fled to join the foreigners and thearistocratic exiles. They were caught at Varennes and brought back to Paris, andall France flamed up into a passion of patriotic republicanism. A Republic wasproclaimed, open war with Austria and Prussia ensued, and the king was tried andexecuted (January, 1793) on the model already set by England, for treason to hispeople.And now followed a strange phase in the history of the French people. Therearose a great flame of enthusiasm for France and the Republic. There was to bean end to compromise at home and abroad; at home royalists and every form ofdisloyalty were to be stamped out; abroad France was to be the protector andhelper of all revolutionaries. All Europe, all the world, was to becomeRepublican. The youth of France poured into the Republican armies; a new andwonderful song spread through the land, a song that still warms the blood likewine, the Marseillaise. Before that chant and the leaping columns of Frenchbayonets and their enthusiastically served guns the foreign armies rolled back;before the end of 1792 the French armies had gone far beyond the utmostachievements of Louis XIV; everywhere they stood on foreign soil. They were inBrussels, they had overrun Savoy, they had raided to Mayence; they had seizedthe Scheldt from Holland. Then the French Government did an unwise thing. It hadbeen exasperated by the expulsion of its representative from England upon theexecution of Louis, and it declared war against England. It was an unwise thingto do, because the revolution which had given France a new enthusiastic infantryand a brilliant artillery released from its aristocratic officers and manycramping conditions had destroyed the discipline of the navy, and the Englishwere supreme upon the sea. And this provocation united all England againstFrance, whereas there had been at first a very considerable liberal movement inGreat Britain in sympathy with the revolution.Of the fight that France made in the next few years against a European coalitionwe cannot tell in any detail. She drove the Austrians for ever out of Belgium,and made Holland a republic. The Dutch fleet, frozen in the Texel, surrenderedto a handful of cavalry without firing its guns. For some time the French thrusttowards Ita'y was hung up, and it was only in 1796 that a new general, NapoleonBonaparte, led the ragged and hungry republican armies in triumph acrossPiedmont to Mantua and Verona. Says C. F. Atkinson, \"What astonished the Alliesmost of all was the number and the velocity of the Republicans. These improvisedarmies had in fact nothing to delay them. Tents were unprocurable for want ofmoney, untransportable for want of the enormous number of wagons that would havebeen required, and also unnecessary, for the discomfort that would have causedwholesale desertion in professional armies was cheerfully borne by the men of1793-94. Supplies for armies of then unheard-of size could not be carried inconvoys, and the French soon became familiar with 'living on the country.' Thus1793 saw the birth of the modern system of war-rapidity of movement, fulldevelopment of national strength, bivouacs, requisitions and force as againstcautious manoeuvring, small professional armies, tents and full rations, andchicane. The first represented the decision-compelling spirit, the second thespirit of risking little to gain a little.\"And while these ragged hosts of enthusiasts were chanting the Marseillaise andfighting for la France, manifestly never quite clear in their minds whether theywere looting or liberating the countries into which they poured, the republicanenthusiasm in Paris was spending itself in a far less glorious fashion. Therevolution was now under the sway of a fanatical leader, Robespierre. This manis difficult to judge; he was a man of poor physique, naturally timid, and aprig. But he had that most necessary gift for power, faith. He set himself tosave the Republic as he conceived it, and he imagined it could be saved by noother man than he. So that to keep in power was to save the Republic. The livingspirit of the Republic, it seemed, had sprung from a slaughter of royalists andthe execution of the king. There were insurrections; one in the west, in thedistrict of La Vendée, where the people rose against the conscription andagainst the dispossession of the orthodox clergy, and were led by noblemen andpriests; one in the south, where Lyons and Marseilles had risen and theroyalists of Toulon had admitted an English and Spanish garrison. To which thereseemed no more effectual reply than to go on killing royalists.The Revolutionary Tribunal went to work, and a steady slaughtering began. Theinvention of the guillotine was opportune to this mood. The queen wasguillotined, most of Robespierre's antagonists were guillotined, atheists whoargued that there was no Supreme Being were guillotined; day by day, week byweek, this infernal new machine chopped off heads and more heads and more. Thereign of Robespierre lived, it seemed, on blood; and needed more and more, as anopium-taker needs more and more opium.Finally in the summer of 1794 Robespierre himself was overthrown andguillotined. He was succeeded by a Directory of five men which carried on thewar of defence abroad and held France together at home for five years. Theirreign formed a curious interlude in this history of violent changes. They tookthings as they found them. The propagandist zeal of the revolution carried theFrench armies into Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, south Germany and north Italy.Everywhere kings were expelled and republics set up. But such propagandist zealas animated the Directorate did not prevent the looting of the treasures of theliberated peoples to relieve the financial embarrassment of the FrenchGovernment. Their wars became less and less the holy wars of freedom, and moreand more like the aggressive wars of the ancient regime. The last feature ofGrand Monarchy that France was disposed to discard was her tradition of foreignpolicy. One discovers it still as vigorous under the Directorate as if there hadbeen no revolution.Unhappily for France and the world a man arose who embodied in its intensestform this national egotism of the French. He gave that country ten years ofglory and the humiliation of a final defeat. This was that same NapoleonBonaparte who had led the armies of the Directory to victory in Italy.Throughout the five years of the Directorate he had been scheming and workingfor self-advancement. Gradually he clambered to supreme power. He was a man ofseverely limited understanding but of ruthless directness and great energy. Hehad begun life as an extremist of the school of Robespierre; he owed his firstpromotion to that side; but he had no real grasp of the new forces that wereworking in Europe. His utmost political imagination carried him to a belated andtawdry attempt to restore the Western Empire. He tried to destroy the remains ofthe old Holy Roman Empire, intending to replace it by a new one centring uponParis. The Emperor in Vienna ceased to be the Holy Roman Emperor and becamesimply Emperor of Austria. Napoleon divorced his French wife in order to marryan Austrian princess.He became practically monarch of France as First Consul in 1799, and he madehimself Emperor of France in 1804 in direct imitation of Charlemagne. He wascrowned by the Pope in Paris, taking the crown from the Pope and putting it uponhis own head himself as Charlemagne had directed. His son was crowned King ofRome.For some years Napoleon's reign was a career of victory. He conquered most ofItaly and Spain, defeated Prussia and Austria, and dominated all Europe west ofRussia. But he never won the command of the sea from the British and his fleetssustained a conclusive defeat inflicted by the British Admiral Nelson atTrafalgar (1805). Spain rose against him in 1808 and a British army underWellington thrust the French armies slowly northward out of the peninsula. In1811 Napoleon came into conflict with the Tsar Alexander I, and in 1812 heinvaded Russia with a great conglomerate army of 600,000 men, that was defeatedand largely destroyed by the Russians and the Russian winter. Germany roseagainst him, Sweden turned against him. The French armies were beaten back andat Fontainebleau Napoleon abdicated (1814). He was exiled to Elba, returned toFrance for one last effort in 1815 and was defeated by the allied British,Belgians and Prussians at Waterloo. He died a British prisoner at St. Helena in1821.The forces released by the French revolution were wasted and finished. A greatCongress of the victorious allies met at Vienna to restore as far as possiblethe state of affairs that the great storm had rent to pieces. For nearly fortyyears a sort of peace, a peace of exhausted effort, was maintained in Europe.Inhis article, \"French Revolutionary Wars,\" in the Encyclopaedia Britannica.LVI. THE UNEASY PEACE IN EUROPE THAT FOLLOWED THE FALL OF NAPOLEONTWO main causes prevented that period from being a complete social andinternational peace, and prepared the way for the cycle of wars between 1854 and1871. The first of these was the tendency of the royal courts concerned, towardsthe restoration of unfair privilege and interference with freedom of thought andwriting and teaching. The second was the impossible system of boundaries drawnby the diplomatists of Vienna.The inherent disposition of monarchy to march back towards past conditions wasfirst and most particularly manifest in Spain. Here even the Inquisition wasrestored. Across the Atlantic the Spanish colonies had followed the example ofthe United States and revolted against the European Great Power System, whenNapoleon set his brother Joseph on the Spanish throne in 1810. The GeorgeWashington of South America was General Bolivar. Spain was unable to suppressthis revolt, it dragged on much as the United States War of Independence haddragged on, and at last the suggestion was made by Austria, in accordance withthe spirit of the Holy Alliance, that the European monarch should assist Spainin this struggle. This was opposed by Britain in Europe, but it was the promptaction of President Monroe of the United States in 1823 which conclusivelywarned off this projected monarchist restoration. He announced that the UnitedStates would regard any extension of the European system in the WesternHemisphere as a hostile act. Thus arose the Monroe Doctrine, the doctrine thatthere must be no extension of extra-American government in America, which haskept the Great Power system out of America for nearly a hundred years andpermitted the new states of Spanish America to work out their destinies alongtheir own lines.But if Spanish monarchism lost its colonies, it could at least, under theprotection of the Concert of Europe, do what it chose in Europe. A popularinsurrection in Spain was crushed by a French army in 1823, with a mandate froma European congress, and simultaneously Austria suppressed a revolution inNaples.In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by Charles X. Charles set himself todestroy the liberty of the press and universities, and to restore absolutegovernment; the sum of a billion francs was voted to compensate the nobles forthe chateau burnings and sequestrations of 1789. In 1830 Paris rose against thisembodiment of the ancient regime, and replaced him by Louis Philippe, the son ofthat Philip, Duke of Orleans, who was executed during the Terror. The othercontinental monarchies, in face of the open approval of the revolution by GreatBritain and a strong liberal ferment in Germany and Austria, did not interferein this affair. After all, France was still a monarchy. This man Louis Philippe(1830-48) remained the constitutional King of France for eighteen years.Such were the uneasy swayings of the peace of the Congress of Vienna, which wereprovoked by the reactionary proceedings of the monarchists. The stresses thatarose from the unscientific boundaries planned by the diplomatists at Viennagathered force more deliberately, but they were even more dangerous to the peaceof mankind. It is extraordinarily inconvenient to administer together theaffairs of peoples speaking different languages and so reading differentliteratures and having different general ideas, especially if those differencesare exacerbated by religious disputes. Only some strong mutual interest, such asthe common defensive needs of the Swiss mountaineers, can justify a closelinking of peoples of dissimilar languages and faiths; and even in Switzerlandthere is the utmost local autonomy. When, as in Macedonia, populations are mixedin a patchwork of villages and districts, the cantonal system is imperativelyneeded. But if the reader will look at the map of Europe as the Congress ofVienna drew it, he will see that this gathering seems almost as if it hadplanned the maximum of local exasperation.It destroyed the Dutch Republic, quite needlessly, it lumped together theProtestant Dutch with the French-speaking Catholics of the old Spanish(Austrian) Netherlands, and set up a kingdom of the Netherlands. It handed overnot merely the old republic of Venice, but all of North Italy as far as Milan tothe German-speaking Austrians. French-speaking Savoy it combined with pieces ofItaly to restore the kingdom of Sardinia. Austria and Hungary, already asufficiently explosive mixture of discordant nationalities, Germans, Hungarians,Czecho-Slovaks, Jugo-Slavs, Roumanians, and now Italians, was made still moreimpossible by confirming Austria's Polish acquisitions of 1772 and 1795. TheCatholic and republican-spirited Polish people were chiefly given over to theless civilized rule of the Greek-orthodox Tsar, but important districts went toProtestant Prussia. The Tsar was also confirmed in his acquisition of theentirely alien Finns. The very dissimilar Norwegian and Swedish peoples werebound together under one king. Germany, the reader will see, was left in aparticularly dangerous state of muddle. Prussia and Austria were both partly inand partly out of a German confederation, which included a multitude of minorstates. The King of Denmark came into the German confederation by virtue ofcertain German-speaking possessions in Holstein. Luxembourg was included in theGerman confederation, though its ruler was also King of the Netherlands, andthough many of its peoples talked French.Here was a complete disregard of the fact that the people who talk German andbase their ideas on German literature, the people who talk Italian and basetheir ideas on Italian literature, and the people who talk Polish and base theirideas on Polish literature, will all be far better off and most helpful andleast obnoxious to the rest of mankind if they conduct their own affairs intheir own idiom within the ring-fence of their own speech. Is it any wonder thatone of the most popular songs in Germany during this period declared thatwherever the German tongue was spoken, there was the German Fatherland!In 1830 French-speaking Belgium, stirred up by the current revolution in France,revolted against its Dutch association in the kingdom of the Netherlands. Thepowers, terrified at the possibilities of a republic or of annexation to France,hurried in to pacify this situation, and gave the Belgians a monarch, Leopold Iof Saxe-Coburg Gotha. There were also ineffectual revolts in Italy and Germanyin 1830, and a much more serious one in Russian Poland. A republican governmentheld out in Warsaw for a year against Nicholas I (who succeeded Alexander in1825), and was then stamped out of existence with great violence and cruelty.The Polish language was banned, and the Greek Orthodox church was substitutedfor the Roman Catholic as the state religion.In 1821 there was an insurrection of the Greeks against the Turks. For six yearsthey fought a desperate war, while the governments of Europe looked on. Liberalopinion protested against this inactivity; volunteers from every Europeancountry joined the insurgents, and at last Britain, France and Russia took jointaction. The Turkish fleet was destroyed by the French and English at the battleof Navarino (1827), and the Tsar invaded Turkey. By the treaty of Adrianople(1829) Greece was declared free, but she was not permitted to resume her ancientrepublican traditions. A German king was found for Greece, one Prince Otto ofBavaria, and Christian governors were set up in the Danubian provinces (whichare now Roumania) and Serbia (a part of the Jugo-Slav region). Much blood hadstill to run however before the Turk was altogether expelled from these lands.LVII. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MATERIAL KNOWLEDGETHROUGHOUT the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the opening years of thenineteenth century, while these conflicts of the powers and princes were goingon in Europe, and the patchwork of the treaty of Westphalia (1648) was changingkaleidoscopically into the patchwork of the treaty of Vienna (1815), and whilethe sailing ship was spreading European influence throughout the world, a steadygrowth of knowledge and a general clearing up of men's ideas about the world inwhich they lived was in progress in the European and Europeanized world.It went on disconnected from political life, and producing throughout theseventeenth and eighteenth centuries no striking immediate results in politicallife. Nor was it affecting popular thought very profoundly during this period.These reactions were to come later, and only in their full force in the latterhalf of the nineteenth century. It was a process that went on chiefly in a smallworld of prosperous and independent-spirited people. Without what the Englishcall the \"private gentleman,\" the scientific process could not have begun inGreece, and could not have been renewed in Europe. The universities played apart but not a leading part in the philosophical and scientific thought of thisperiod. Endowed learning is apt to be timid and conservative learning, lackingin initiative and resistent to innovation, unless it has the spur of contactwith independent minds.We have already noted the formation of the Royal Society in 1662 and its work inrealizing the dream of Bacon's New Atlantis. Throughout the eighteenth centurythere was much clearing up of general ideas about matter and motion, muchmathematical advance, a systematic development of the use of optical glass inmicroscope and telescope, a renewed energy in classificatory natural history, agreat revival of anatomical science. The science of geology-foreshadowed byAristotle and anticipated by Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519)-began its great taskof interpreting the Record of the Rocks.The progress of physical science reacted upon metallurgy. Improved metallurgy,affording the possibility of a larger and bolder handling of masses of metal andother materials, reacted upon practical inventions. Machinery on a new scale andin a new abundance appeared to revolutionize industry.In 1804 Trevithick adapted the Watt engine to transport and made the firstlocomotive. In 1825 the first railway, between Stockton and Darlington, wasopened, and Stephenson's \"Rocket,\" with a thirteen-ton train, got up to a speedof forty-four miles per hour. From 1830 onward railways multiplied. By themiddle of the century a network of railways had spread all over Europe.Here was a sudden change in what had long been a fixed condition of human life,the maximum rate of land transport. After the Russian disaster, Napoleontravelled from near Vilna to Paris in 312 hours. This was a journey of about1,400 miles. He was travelling with every conceivable advantage, and he averagedunder 5 miles an hour. An ordinary traveller could not have done this distancein twice the time. These were about the same maximum rates of travel as heldgood between Rome and Gaul in the first century A.D. Then suddenly came thistremendous change. The railways reduced this journey for any ordinary travellerto less than forty-eight hours. That is to say, they reduced the chief Europeandistances to about a tenth of what they had been. They made it possible to carryout administrative work in areas ten times as great as any that had hithertobeen workable under one administration. The full significance of thatpossibility in Europe still remains to be realized. Europe is still netted inboundaries drawn in the horse and road era. In America the effects wereimmediate. To the United States of America, sprawling westward, it meant thepossibility of a continuous access to Washington, however far the frontiertravelled across the continent. It meant unity, sustained on a scale that wouldotherwise have been impossible.The steamboat was, if anything, a little ahead of the steam engine in itsearlier phases. There was a steamboat, the Charlotte Dundas, on the Firth ofClyde Canal in 1802, and in 1807 an American named Fulton had a steamer, theClermont, with British-built engines, upon the Hudson River above New York. Thefirst steamship to put to sea was also an American, the Phoenix, which went fromNew York (Hoboken) to Philadelphia. So, too, was the first ship using steam (shealso had sails) to cross the Atlantic, the Savannah (1819). All these werepaddle-wheel boats and paddlewheel boats are not adapted to work in heavy seas.The paddles smash too easily, and the boat is then disabled. The screw steamshipfollowed rather slowly. Many difficulties had to be surmounted before the screwwas a practicable thing. Not until the middle of the century did the tonnage ofsteamships upon the sea begin to overhaul that of sailing ships. After that theevolution in sea transport was rapid. For the first time men began to cross theseas and oceans with some certainty as to the date of their arrival. Thetransatlantic crossing, which had been an uncertain adventure of severalweeks-which might stretch to months-was accelerated, until in 1910 it wasbrought down, in the case of the fastest boats, to under five days, with apractically notifiable hour of arrival.Concurrently with the development of steam transport upon land and sea a new andstriking addition to the facilities of human intercourse arose out of theinvestigations of Volta, Galvani and Faraday into various electrical phenomena.The electric telegraph came into existence in 1835. The first underseas cablewas laid in 1851 between France and England. In a few years the telegraph systemhad spread over the civilized world, and news which had hitherto travelledslowly from point to point became practically simultaneous throughout the earth.These things, the steam railway and the electric telegraph, were to the popularimagination of the middle nineteenth century the most striking and revolutionaryof inventions, but they were only the most conspicuous and clumsy first fruitsof a far more extensive process. Technical knowledge and skill were developingwith an extraordinary rapidity, and to an extraordinary extent measured by theprogress of any previous age. Far less conspicuous at first in everyday life,but finally far more important, was the extension of man's power over variousstructural materials. Before the middle of the eighteenth century iron wasreduced from its ores by means of wood charcoal, was handled in small pieces,and hammered and wrought into shape. It was material for a craftsman. Qualityand treatment were enormously dependent upon the experience and sagacity of theindividual iron-worker. The largest masses of iron that could be dealt withunder those conditions amounted at most (in the sixteenth century) to two orthree tons. (There was a very definite upward limit, therefore, to the size ofcannon.) The blast-furnace rose in the eighteenth century and developed with theuse of coke. Not before the eighteenth century do we find rolled sheet iron(1728) and rolled rods and bars (1783). Nasmyth's steam hammer came as late as1838.The ancient world, because of its metallurgical inferiority, could not usesteam. The steam engine, even the primitive pumping engine, could not developbefore sheet iron was available. The early engines seem to the modern eye verypitiful and clumsy bits of ironmongery, but they were the utmost that themetallurgical science of the time could do. As late as 1856 came the Bessemerprocess, and presently (1864) the open-hearth process, in which steel and everysort of iron could be melted, purified and cast in a manner and upon a scalehitherto unheard of. To-day in the electric furnace one may see tons ofincandescent steel swirling about like boiling milk in a saucepan. Nothing inthe previous practical advances of mankind is comparable in its consequences tothe complete mastery over enormous masses of steel and iron and over theirtexture and quality which man has now achieved. The railways and early enginesof all sorts were the mere first triumphs of the new metallurgical methods.Presently came ships of iron and steel, vast bridges, and a new way of buildingwith steel upon a gigantic scale. Men realized too late that they had plannedtheir railways with far too timid a gauge, that they could have organized theirtravelling with far more steadiness and comfort upon a much bigger scale.Before the nineteenth century there were no ships in the world much over 2,000tons burthen; now there is nothing wonderful about a 50,000-ton liner. There arepeople who sneer at this kind of progress as being a progress in \"mere size,\"but that sort of sneering merely marks the intellectual limitations of those whoindulge in it. The great ship or the steel-frame building is not, as theyimagine, a magnified version of the small ship or building of the past; it is athing different in kind, more lightly and strongly built, of finer and strongermaterials; instead of being a thing of precedent and rule-of-thumb, it is athing of subtle and intricate calculation. In the old house or ship, matter wasdominant-the material and its needs had to be slavishly obeyed; in the new,matter had been captured, changed, coerced. Think of the coal and iron and sanddragged out of the banks and pits, wrenched, wrought, molten and cast, to beflung at last, a slender glittering pinnacle of steel and glass, six hundredfeet above the crowded city!We have given these particulars of the advance in man's knowledge of themetallurgy of steel and its results by way of illustration. A parallel storycould be told of the metallurgy of copper and tin, and of a multitude of metals,nickel and aluminum to name but two, unknown before the nineteenth centurydawned. It is in this great and growing mastery over substances, over differentsorts of glass, over rocks and plasters and the like, over colours and textures,that the main triumphs of the mechanical revolution have thus far been achieved.Yet we are still in the stage of the first fruits in the matter. We have thepower, but we have still to learn how to use our power. Many of the firstemployments of these gifts of science have been vulgar, tawdry, stupid orhorrible. The artist and the adaptor have still hardly begun to work with theendless variety of substances now at their disposal.Parallel with this extension of mechanical possibilities the new science ofelectricity grew up. It was only in the eighties of the nineteenth century thatthis body of enquiry began to yield results to impress the vulgar mind. Thensuddenly came electric light and electric traction, and the transmutation offorces, the possibility of sending power, that could be changed into mechanicalmotion or light or heat as one chose, along a copper wire, as water is sentalong a pipe, began to come through to the ideas of ordinary people.The British and French were at first the leading peoples in this greatproliferation of knowledge; but presently the Germans, who had learnt humilityunder Napoleon, showed such zeal and pertinacity in scientific enquiry as tooverhaul these leaders. British science was largely the creation of Englishmenand Scotchmen working outside the ordinary centres of erudition.The universities of Britain were at this time in a state of educationalretrogression, largely given over to a pedantic conning of the Latin and Greekclassics. French education, too, was dominated by the classical tradition of theJesuit schools, and consequently it was not difficult for the Germans toorganize a body of investigators, small indeed in relation to the possibilitiesof the case, but large in proportion to the little band of British and Frenchinventors and experimentalists. And though this work of research and experimentwas making Britain and France the most rich and powerful countries in the world,it was not making scientific and inventive men rich and powerful. There is anecessary unworldliness about a sincere scientific man; he is too preoccupiedwith his research to plan and scheme how to make money out of it. The economicexploitation of his discoveries falls very easily and naturally, therefore, intothe hands of a more acquisitive type; and so we find that the crops of rich menwhich every fresh phase of scientific and technical progress has produced inGreat Britain, though they have not displayed quite the same passionate desireto insult and kill the goose that laid the national golden eggs as thescholastic and clerical professions, have been quite content to let thatprofitable creature starve. Inventors and discoverers came by nature, theythought, for cleverer people to profit by.In this matter the Germans were a little wiser. The German \"learned\" did notdisplay the same vehement hatred of the new learning. They permitted itsdevelopment. The German business man and manufacturer again had not quite thesame contempt for the man of science as had his British competitor. Knowledge,these Germans believed, might be a cultivated crop, responsive to fertilizers.They did concede, therefore, a certain amount of opportunity to the scientificmind; their public expenditure on scientific work was relatively greater, andthis expenditure was abundantly rewarded. By the latter half of the nineteenthcentury the German scientific worker had made German a necessary language forevery science student who wished to keep abreast with the latest work in hisdepartment, and in certain branches, and particularly in chemistry, Germanyacquired a very great superiority over her western neighbours. The scientificeffort of the sixties and seventies in Germany began to tell after the eighties,and the German gained steadily upon Britain and France in technical andindustrial prosperity.A fresh phase in the history of invention opened when in the eighties a new typeof engine came into use, an engine in which the expansive force of an explosivemixture replaced the expansive force of steam. The light, highly efficientengines that were thus made possible were applied to the automobile, anddeveloped at last to reach such a pitch of lightness and efficiency as to renderflight-long known to be possible-a practical achievement. A successful flyingmachine-but not a machine large enough to take up a human body-was made byProfessor Langley of the Smithsonian Institute of Washington as early as 1897.By 1909 the aeroplane was available for human locomotion. There had seemed to bea pause in the increase of human speed with the perfection of railways andautomobile road traction, but with the flying machine came fresh reductions inthe effective distance between one point of the earth's surface and another. Inthe eighteenth century the distance from London to Edinburgh was an eight days'journey; in 1918 the British Civil Air Transport Commission reported that thejourney from London to Melbourne, halfway round the earth, would probably in afew years' time be accomplished in that same period of eight days.Too much stress must not be laid upon these striking reductions in the timedistances of one place from another. They are merely one aspect of a muchprofounder and more momentous enlargement of human possibility. The science ofagriculture and agricultural chemistry, for instance, made quite paralleladvances during the nineteenth century. Men learnt so to fertilize the soil asto produce quadruple and quintuple the crops got from the same area in theseventeenth century. There was a still more extraordinary advance in medicalscience; the average duration of life rose, the daily efficiency increased, thewaste of life through ill-health diminished.Now here altogether we have such a change in human life as to constitute a freshphase of history. In a little more than a century this mechanical revolution hasbeen brought about. In that time man made a stride in the material conditions ofhis life vaster than he had done during the whole long interval between thepalaeolithic stage and the age of cultivation, or between the days of Pepi inEgypt and those of George III. A new gigantic material framework for humanaffairs has come into existence. Clearly it demands great readjustments of oursocial, economical and political methods. But these readjustments havenecessarily waited upon the development of the mechanical revolution, and theyare still only in their opening stage to-day.LVIII. THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONTHERE is a tendency in many histories to confuse together what we have herecalled the mechanical revolution, which was an entirely new thing in humanexperience arising out of the development of organized science, a new step likethe invention of agriculture or the discovery of metals, with something else,quite different in its origins, something for which there was already anhistorical precedent, the social and financial development which is called theindustrial revolution. The two processes were going on together, they wereconstantly reacting upon each other, but they were in root and essencedifferent. There would have been an industrial revolution of sorts if there hadbeen no coal, no steam, no machinery; but in that case it would probably havefollowed far more closely upon the lines of the social and financialdevelopments of the later years of the Roman Republic. It would have repeatedthe story of dispossessed free cultivators, gang labour, great estates, greatfinancial fortunes, and a socially destructive financial process. Even thefactory method came before power and machinery. Factories were the product notof machinery, but of the \"division of labour.\" Drilled and sweated workers weremaking such things as millinery cardboard boxes and furniture, and colouringmaps and book illustrations and so forth, before even water-wheels had been usedfor industrial purposes. There were factories in Rome in the days of Augustus.New books, for instance, were dictated to rows of copyists in the factories ofthe book-sellers. The attentive student of Defoe and of the political pamphletsof Fielding will realize that the idea of herding poor people intoestablishments to work collectively for their living was already current inBritain before the close of the seventeenth century. There are intimations of iteven as early as More's Utopia (1516). It was a social and not a mechanicaldevelopment.Up to past the middle of the eighteenth century the social and economic historyof western Europe was in fact retreading the path along which the Roman statehad gone in the last three centuries B.C. But the political disunions of Europe,the political convulsions against monarchy, the recalcitrance of the common folkand perhaps also the greater accessibility of the western European intelligenceto mechanical ideas and inventions, turned the process into quite noveldirections. Ideas of human solidarity, thanks to Christianity, were far morewidely diffused in the newer European world, political power was not soconcentrated, and the man of energy anxious to get rich turned his mind,therefore, very willingly from the ideas of the slave and of gang labour to theidea of mechanical power and the machine.The mechanical revolution, the process of mechanical invention and discovery,was a new thing in human experience and it went on regardless of the social,political, economic and industrial consequences it might produce. The industrialrevolution, on the other hand, like most other human affairs, was and is moreand more profoundly changed and deflected by the constant variation in humanconditions caused by the mechanical revolution. And the essential differencebetween the amassing of riches, the extinction of small farmers and smallbusiness men, and the phase of big finance in the latter centuries of the RomanRepublic on the one hand, and the very similar concentration of capital in theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries on the other, lies in the profounddifference in the character of labour that the mechanical revolution wasbringing about. The power of the old world was human power; everything dependedultimately upon the driving power of human muscle, the muscle of ignorant andsubjugated men. A little animal muscle, supplied by draft oxen, horse tractionand the like, contributed. Where a weight had to be lifted, men lifted it; wherea rock had to be quarried, men chipped it out; where a field had to be ploughed,men and oxen ploughed it; the Roman equivalent of the steamship was the galleywith its bank of sweating rowers. A vast proportion of mankind in the earlycivilizations were employed in purely mechanical drudgery. At its onset,power-driven machinery did not seem to promise any release from suchunintelligent toil. Great gangs of men were employed in excavating canals, inmaking railway cuttings and embankments, and the like. The number of minersincreased enormously. But the extension of facilities and the output ofcommodities increased much more. And as the nineteenth century went on, theplain logic of the new situation asserted itself more clearly. Human beings wereno longer wanted as a source of mere indiscriminated power. What could be donemechanically by a human being could be done faster and better by a machine. Thehuman being was needed now only where choice and intelligence had to beexercised. Human beings were wanted only as human beings. The drudge, on whomall the previous civilizations had rested, the creature of mere obedience, theman whose brains were superfluous, had become unnecessary to the welfare ofmankind.This was as true of such ancient industries as agriculture and mining as it wasof the newest metallurgical processes. For ploughing, sowing and harvesting,swift machines came forward to do the work of scores of men. The Romancivilization was built upon cheap and degraded human beings; modern civilizationis being rebuilt upon cheap mechanical power. For a hundred years power has beengetting cheaper and labour dearer. If for a generation or so machinery has hadto wait its turn in the mine, it is simply because for a time men were cheaperthan machinery.Now here was a change-over of quite primary importance in human affairs. Thechief solicitude of the rich and of the ruler in the old civilization had beento keep up a supply of drudges. As the nineteenth century went on, it becamemore and more plain to the intelligent directive people that the common man hadnow to be something better than a drudge. He had to be educated-if only tosecure \"industrial efficiency.\" He had to understand what he was about. From thedays of the first Christian propaganda, popular education had been smoulderingin Europe, just as it had smouldered in Asia wherever Islam has set its foot,because of the necessity of making the believer understand a little of thebelief by which he is saved, and of enabling him to read a little in the sacredbooks by which his belief is conveyed. Christian controversies, with theircompetition for adherents, ploughed the ground for the harvest of populareducation. In England, for instance, by the thirties and forties of thenineteenth century, the disputes of the sects and the necessity of catchingadherents young had produced a series of competing educational organizations forchildren, the church \"National\" schools, the dissenting \"British\" schools, andeven Roman Catholic elementary schools. The second half of the nineteenthcentury was a period of rapid advance in popular education throughout all theWesternized world. There was no parallel advance in the education of the upperclasses-some advance, no doubt, but nothing to correspond-and so the great gulfthat had divided that world hitherto into the readers and the non-reading massbecame little more than a slightly perceptible difference in educational level.At the back of this process was the mechanical revolution, apparently regardlessof social conditions, but really insisting inexorably upon the completeabolition of a totally illiterate class throughout the world.The economic revolution of the Roman Republic had never been clearly apprehendedby the common people of Rome. The ordinary Roman citizen never saw the changesthrough which he lived, clearly and comprehensively as we see them. But theindustrial revolution, as it went on towards the end of the nineteenth century,was more and more distinctly seen as one whole process by the common people itwas affecting, because presently they could read and discuss and communicate,and because they went about and saw things as no commonalty had ever donebefore.LIX. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL IDEASTHE INSTITUTIONS and customs and political ideas of the ancient civilizationsgrew up slowly, age by age, no man designing and no man foreseeing. It was onlyin that great century of human adolescence, the sixth century B.C., that menbegan to think clearly about their relations to one another, and first toquestion and first propose to alter and rearrange the established beliefs andlaws and methods of human government.We have told of the glorious intellectual dawn of Greece and Alexandria, and howpresently the collapse of the slave-holding civilizations and the clouds ofreligious intolerance and absolutist government darkened the promise of thatbeginning. The light of fearless thinking did not break through the Europeanobscurity again effectually until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. We havetried to show something of the share of the great winds of Arab curiosity andMongol conquest in this gradual clearing of the mental skies of Europe. And atfirst it was chiefly material knowledge that increased. The first fruits of therecovered manhood of the race were material achievements and material power. Thescience of human relationship, of individual and social psychology, of educationand of economics, are not only more subtle and intricate in themselves but alsobound up inextricably with much emotional matter. The advances made in them havebeen slower and made against greater opposition. Men will listen dispassionatelyto the most diverse suggestions about stars or molecules, but ideas about ourways of life touch and reflect upon everyone about us.And just as in Greece the bold speculations of Plato came before Aristotle'shard search for fact, so in Europe the first political enquiries of the newphase were put in the form of \"Utopian\" stories, directly imitated from Plato'sRepublic and his Laws. Sir Thomas More's Utopia is a curious imitation of Platothat bore fruit in a new English poor law. The Neapolitan Campanella's City ofthe Sun was more fantastic and less fruitful.By the end of the seventeenth century we find a considerable and growingliterature of political and social science was being produced. Among thepioneers in this discussion was John Locke, the son of an English republican, anOxford scholar who first directed his attention to chemistry and medicine. Histreatises on government, toleration and education show a mind fully awake to thepossibilities of social reconstruction. Parallel with and a little later thanJohn Locke in England, Montesquieu (1689-1755) in France subjected social,political and religious institutions to a searching and fundamental analysis. Hestripped the magical prestige from the absolutist monarchy in France. He shareswith Locke the credit for clearing away many of the false ideas that hadhitherto prevented deliberate and conscious attempts to reconstruct humansociety.The generation that followed him in the middle and later decades of theeighteenth century was boldly speculative upon the moral and intellectualclearings he had made. A group of brilliant writers, the \"Encyclopaedists,\"mostly rebel spirits from the excellent schools of the Jesuits, set themselvesto scheme out a new world (1766). Side by side with the Encyclopaedists were theEconomists or Physiocrats, who were making bold and crude enquiries into theproduction and distribution of food and goods. Morelly, the author of the Codede la Nature, denounced the institution of private property and proposed acommunistic organization of society. He was the precursor of that large andvarious school of collectivist thinkers in the nineteenth century who are lumpedtogether as Socialists.What is Socialism? There are a hundred definitions of Socialism and a thousandsects of Socialists. Essentially Socialism is no more and no less than acriticism of the idea of property in the light of the public good. We may reviewthe history of that idea through the ages very briefly. That and the idea ofinternationalism are the two cardinal ideas upon which most of our politicallife is turning.The idea of property arises out of the combative instincts of the species. Longbefore men were men, the ancestral ape was a proprietor. Primitive property iswhat a beast will fight for. The dog and his bone, the tigress and her lair, theroaring stag and his herd, these are proprietorship blazing. No more nonsensicalexpression is conceivable in sociology than the term \"primitive communism.\" TheOld Man of the family tribe of early palaelithic times insisted upon hisproprietorship in his wives and daughters, in his tools, in his visibleuniverse. If any other man wandered into his visible universe he fought him, andif he could he slew him. The tribe grew in the course of ages, as Atkinsonshowed convincingly in his Primal Law, by the gradual toleration by the Old Manof the existence of the younger men, and of their proprietorship in the wivesthey captured from outside the tribe, and in the tools and ornaments they madeand the game they slew. Human society grew by a compromise between this one'sproperty and that. It was a compromise with instinct which was forced upon menby the necessity of driving some other tribe out of its visible universe. If thehills and forests and streams were not your land or my land, it was because theyhad to be our land. Each of us would have preferred to have it my land, but thatwould not work. In that case the other fellows would have destroyed us. Society,therefore, is from its beginning a mitigation of ownership. Ownership in thebeast and in the primitive savage was far more intense a thing than it is in thecivilized world to-day. It is rooted more strongly in our instincts than in ourreason.In the natural savage and in the untutored man to-day there is no limitation tothe sphere of ownership. Whatever you can fight for, you can own; women-folk,spared captive, captured beast, forest glade, stone-pit or what not. As thecommunity grew, a sort of law came to restrain internecine fighting, mendeveloped rough-and-ready methods of settling proprietorship. Men could own whatthey were the first to make or capture or claim. It seemed natural that a debtorwho could not pay should become the property of his creditor. Equally naturalwas it that after claiming a patch of land a man should exact payments fromanyone who wanted to use it. It was only slowly, as the possibilities oforganized life dawned on men, that this unlimited property in anything whateverbegan to be recognized as a nuisance. Men found themselves born into a universeall owned and claimed, nay! they found themselves born owned and claimed. Thesocial struggles of the earlier civilization are difficult to trace now, but thehistory we have told of the Roman Republic shows a community waking up to theidea that debts may become a public inconvenience and should then be repudiated,and that the unlimited ownership of land is also an inconvenience. We find thatlater Babylonia severely limited the rights of property in slaves. Finally, wefind in the teaching of that great revolutionist, Jesus of Nazareth, such anattack upon property as had never been before. Easier it was, he said, for acamel to go through the eye of a needle than for the owner of great possessionsto enter the kingdom of heaven. A steady, continuous criticism of thepermissible scope of property seems to have been going on in the world for thelast twenty-five or thirty centuries. Nineteen hundred years after Jesus ofNazareth we find all the world that has come under the Christian teachingpersuaded that there could be no property in human beings. And also the ideathat \"a man may do what he likes with his own\" was very much shaken in relationto other sorts of property.But this world of the closing eighteenth century was still only in theinterrogative stage in this matter. It had got nothing clear enough, much lesssettled enough, to act upon. One of its primary impulses was to protect propertyagainst the greed and waste of kings and the exploitation of noble adventurers.It was largely to protect private property from taxation that the FrenchRevolution began. But the equalitarian formulae of the Revolution carried itinto a criticism of the very property it had risen to protect. How can men befree and equal when numbers of them have no ground to stand upon and nothing toeat, and the owners will neither feed nor lodge them unless they toil?Excessively-the poor complained.To which riddle the reply of one important political group was to set about\"dividing up.\" They wanted to intensify and universalize property. Aiming at thesame end by another route, there were the primitive socialists-or, to be moreexact, communists-who wanted to \"abolish\" private property altogether. The state(a democratic state was of course understood) was to own all property.It is paradoxical that different men seeking the same ends of liberty andhappiness should propose on the one hand to make property as absolute aspossible, and on the other to put an end to it altogether. But so it was. Andthe clue to this paradox is to be found in the fact that ownership is not onething but a multitude of different things.It was only as the nineteenth century developed that men began to realize thatproperty was not one simple thing, but a great complex of ownerships ofdifferent values and consequences, that many things (such as one's body, theimplements of an artist, clothing, toothbrushes) are very profoundly andincurably one's personal property, and that there is a very great range ofthings, railways, machinery of various sorts, homes, cultivated gardens,pleasure boats, for example, which need each to be considered very particularlyto determine how far and under what limitations it may come under privateownership, and how far it falls into the public domain and may be administeredand let out by the state in the collective interest. On the practical side thesequestions pass into politics, and the problem of making and sustaining efficientstate administration. They open up issues in social psychology, and interactwith the enquiries of educational science. The criticism of property is still avast and passionate ferment rather than a science. On the one hand are theIndividualists, who would protect and enlarge our present freedoms with what wepossess, and on the other the Socialists who would in many directions pool ourownerships and restrain our proprietary acts. In practice one will find everygradation between the extreme individualist, who will scarcely tolerate a tax ofany sort to support a government, and the communist who would deny anypossessions at all. The ordinary socialist of to-day is what is called acollectivist; he would allow a considerable amount of private property but putsuch affairs as education, transport, mines, land-owning, most mass productionsof staple articles, and the like, into the hands of a highly organized state.Nowadays there does seem to be a gradual convergence of reasonable men towards amoderate socialism scientifically studied and planned. It is realized more andmore clearly that the untutored man does not co-operate easily and successfullyin large undertakings, and that every step towards a more complex state andevery function that the state takes over from private enterprise, necessitates acorresponding educational advance and the organization of a proper criticism andcontrol. Both the press and the political methods of the contemporary state arefar too crude for any large extension of collective activities.But for a time the stresses between employer and employed and particularlybetween selfish employers and reluctant workers, led to a world-widedissemination of the very harsh and elementary form of communism which isassociated with the name of Marx. Marx based his theories on a belief that men'sminds are limited by their economic necessities, and that there is a necessaryconflict of interests in our present civilization between the prosperous andemploying classes of people and the employed mass. With the advance in educationnecessitated by the mechanical revolution, this great employed majority willbecome more and more class-conscious and more and more solid in antagonism tothe (class-conscious) ruling minority. In some way the class-conscious workerswould seize power, he prophesied, and inaugurate a new social state. Theantagonism, the insurrection, the possible revolution are understandable enough,but it does not follow that a new social state or anything but a sociallydestructive process will ensue. Put to the test in Russia, Marxism, as we shallnote later, has proved singularly uncreative.Marx sought to replace national antagonism by class antagonisms; Marxism hasproduced in succession a First, a Second and a Third Workers' International. Butfrom the starting point of modern individualistic thought it is also possible toreach international ideas. From the days of that great English economist, AdamSmith, onward there has been an increasing realization that for world-wideprosperity free and unencumbered trade about the earth is needed. Theindividualist with his hostility to the state is hostile also to tariffs andboundaries and all the restraints upon free act and movement that nationalboundaries seem to justify. It is interesting to see two lines of thought, sodiverse in spirit, so different in substance as this class-war socialism of theMarxists and the individualistic freetrading philosophy of the British businessmen of the Victorian age heading at last, in spite of these primary differences,towards the same intimations of a new world-wide treatment of human affairsoutside the boundaries and limitations of any existing state. The logic ofreality triumphs over the logic of theory. We begin to perceive that from widelydivergent starting points individualist theory and socialist theory are part ofa common search, a search for more spacious social and political ideas andinterpretations, upon which men may contrive to work together, a search thatbegan again in Europe and has intensified as men's confidence in the ideas ofthe Holy Roman Empire and in Christendom decayed, and as the age of discoverybroadened their horizons from the world of the Mediterranean to the whole wideworld.To bring this description of the elaboration and development of social, economicand political ideas right down to the discussions of the present day, would beto introduce issues altogether too controversial for the scope and intentions ofthis book. But regarding these things, as we do here, from the vast perspectivesof the student of world history, we are bound to recognize that thisreconstruction of these directive ideas in the human mind is still an unfinishedtask-we cannot even estimate yet how unfinished the task may be. Certain commonbeliefs do seem to be emerging, and their influence is very perceptible upon thepolitical events and public acts of today; but at present they are not clearenough nor convincing enough to compel men definitely and systematically towardstheir realization. Men's acts waver between tradition and the new, and on thewhole they rather gravitate towards the traditional. Yet, compared with thethought of even a brief lifetime ago, there does seem to be an outline shapingitself of a new order in human affairs. It is a sketchy outline, vanishing intovagueness at this point and that, and fluctuating in detail and formulae, yet itgrows steadfastly clearer, and its main lines change less and less.It is becoming plainer and plainer each year that in many respects and in anincreasing range of affairs, mankind is becoming one community, and that it ismore and more necessary that in such matters there should be a common world-widecontrol. For example, it is steadily truer that the whole planet is now oneeconomic community, that the proper exploitation of its natural resourcesdemands one comprehensive direction, and that the greater power and range thatdiscovery has given human effort makes the present fragmentary and contentiousadministration of such affairs more and more wasteful and dangerous. Financialand monetary expedients also become world-wide interests to be dealt withsuccessfully only on world-wide lines. Infectious diseases and the increase andmigrations of population are also now plainly seen to be world-wide concerns.The greater power and range of human activities has also made wardisproportionately destructive and disorganizing, and, even as a clumsy way ofsettling issues between government and government and people and people,ineffective. All these things clamour for controls and authorities of a greaterrange and greater comprehensiveness than any government that has hithertoexisted.But it does not follow that the solution of these problems lies in somesuper-government of all the world arising by conquest or by the coalescence ofexisting governments. By analogy with existing institutions men have thought ofthe Parliament of Mankind, of a World Congress, of a President or Emperor of theEarth. Our first natural reaction is towards some such conclusion, but thediscussion and experiences of half a century of suggestions and attempts has onthe whole discouraged belief in that first obvious idea. Along that line toworld unity the resistances are too great. The drift of thought seems now to bein the direction of a number of special committees or organizations, withworld-wide power delegated to them by existing governments in this group ofmatters or that, bodies concerned with the waste or development of naturalwealth, with the equalization of labour conditions, with world peace, withcurrency, population and health, and so forth.The world may discover that all its common interests are being managed as oneconcern, while it still fails to realize that a world government exists. Butbefore even so much human unity is attained, before such internationalarrangements can be put above patriotic suspicions and jealousies, it isnecessary that the common mind of the race should be possessed of that idea ofhuman unity, and that the idea of mankind as one family should be a matter ofuniversal instruction and understanding.For a score of centuries or more the spirit of the great universal religions hasbeen struggling to maintain and extend that idea of a universal humanbrotherhood, but to this day the spites, angers and distrusts of tribal,national and racial friction obstruct, and successfully obstruct, the broaderviews and more generous impulses which would make every man the servant of allmankind. The idea of human brotherhood struggles now to possess the human soul,just as the idea of Christendom struggled to possess the soul of Europe in theconfusion and disorder of the sixth and seventh centuries of the Christian era.The dissemination and triumph of such ideas must be the work of a multitude ofdevoted and undistinguished missionaries, and no contemporary writer can presumeto guess how far such work has gone or what harvest it may be preparing.Social and economic questions seem to be inseparably mingled with internationalones. The solution in each case lies in an appeal to that same spirit of servicewhich can enter and inspire the human heart. The distrust, intractability andegotism of nations reflects and is reflected by the distrust, intractability andegotism of the individual owner and worker in the face of the common good.Exaggerations of possessiveness in the individual are parallel and of a piecewith the clutching greed of nations and emperors. They are products of the sameinstinctive tendencies, and the same ignorances and traditions. Internationalismis the socialism of nations. No one who has wrestled with these problems canfeel that there yet exists a sufficient depth and strength of psychologicalscience and a sufficiently planned-out educational method and organization forany real and final solution of these riddles of human intercourse andcooperation. We are as incapable of planning a really effective peaceorganization of the world to-day as were men in 1820 to plan an electric railwaysystem, but for all we know the thing is equally practicable and may be asnearly at hand.No man can go beyond his own knowledge, no thought can reach beyond contemporarythought, and it is impossible for us to guess or foretell how many generationsof humanity may have to live in war and waste and insecurity and misery beforethe dawn of the great peace to which all history seems to be pointing, peace inthe heart and peace in the world, ends our night of wasteful and aimless living.Our proposed solutions are still vague and crude. Passion and suspicion surroundthem. A great task of intellectual reconstruction is going on, it is stillincomplete, and our conceptions grow clearer and more exact-slowly, rapidly, itis hard to tell which. But as they grow clearer they will gather power over theminds and imaginations of men. Their present lack of grip is due to their lackof assurance and exact rightness. They are misunderstood because they arevariously and confusingly presented. But with precision and certainty the newvision of the world will gain compelling power. It may presently gain power veryrapidly. And a great work of educational reconstruction will follow logicallyand necessarily upon that clearer understanding.LX. THE EXPANSION OF THE UNITED STATESTHE REGION of the world that displayed the most immediate and striking resultsfrom the new inventions in transport was North America. Politically the UnitedStates embodied, and its constitution crystallized, the liberal ideas of themiddle eighteenth century. It dispensed with state-church or crown, it wouldhave no titles, it protected property very jealously as a method of freedom,and-the exact practice varied at first in the different states-it gave nearlyevery adult male citizen a vote. Its method of voting was barbarically crude,and as a consequence its political life fell very soon under the control ofhighly organized party machines, but that did not prevent the newly emancipatedpopulation developing an energy, enterprise and public spirit far beyond that ofany other contemporary population.Then came that acceleration of locomotion to which we have already calledattention. It is a curious thing that America, which owes most to thisacceleration in locomotion, has felt it least. The United States have taken therailway, the river steamboat, the telegraph and so forth as though they were anatural part of their growth. They were not. These things happened to come alongjust in time to save American unity. The United States of to-day were made firstby the river steamboat, and then by the railway. Without these things, thepresent United States, this vast continental nation, would have been altogetherimpossible. The westward flow of population would have been far more sluggish.It might never have crossed the great central plains. It took nearly two hundredyears for effective settlement to reach from the coast to Missouri, much lessthan halfway across the continent. The first state established beyond the riverwas the steamboat state of Missouri in 1821. But the rest of the distance to thePacific was done in a few decades.If we had the resources of the cinema it would be interesting to show a map ofNorth America year by year from 1600 onward, with little dots to representhundreds of people, each dot a hundred, and stars to represent cities of ahundred thousand people.For two hundred years the reader would see that stippling creeping slowly alongthe coastal districts and navigable waters, spreading still more gradually intoIndiana, Kentucky and so forth. Then somewhere about 1810 would come a change.Things would get more lively along the river courses. The dots would bemultiplying and spreading. That would be the steamboat. The pioneer dots wouldbe spreading soon over Kansas and Nebraska from a number of jumping-off placesalong the great rivers.Then from about 1830 onward would come the black lines of the railways, andafter that the little black dots would not simply creep but run. They wouldappear now so rapidly, it would be almost as though they were being put on bysome sort of spraying machine. And suddenly here and then there would appear thefirst stars to indicate the first great cities of a hundred thousand people.First one or two and then a multitude of cities-each like a knot in the growingnet of the railways.The growth of the United States is a process that has no precedent in theworld's history; it is a new kind of occurrence. Such a community could not havecome into existence before, and if it had, without railways it would certainlyhave dropped to pieces long before now. Without railways or telegraph it wouldbe far easier to administer California from Pekin than from Washington. But thisgreat population of the United States of America has not only grownoutrageously; it has kept uniform. Nay, it has become more uniform. The man ofSan Francisco is more like the man of New York to-day than the man of Virginiawas like the man of New England a century ago. And the process of assimilationgoes on unimpeded. The United States is being woven by railway, by telegraph,more and more into one vast unity, speaking, thinking and acting harmoniouslywith itself. Soon aviation will be helping in the work.This great community of the United States is an altogether new thing in history.There have been great empires before with populations exceeding 100 millions,but these were associations of divergent peoples; there has never been onesingle people on this scale before. We want a new term for this new thing. Wecall the United States a country just as we call France or Holland a country.But the two things are as different as an automobile and a one-horse shay. Theyare the creations of different periods and different conditions; they are goingto work at a different pace and in an entirely different way. The United Statesin scale and possibility is halfway between a European state and a United Statesof all the world.But on the way to this present greatness and security the American people passedthrough one phase of dire conflict. The river steamboats, the railways, thetelegraph, and their associate facilities, did not come soon enough to avert adeepening conflict of interests and ideas between the southern and northernstates of the Union. The former were slave-holding states; the latter, states inwhich all men were free. The railways and steamboats at first did but bring intosharper conflict an already established difference between the two sections ofthe United States. The increasing unification due to the new means of transportmade the question whether the southern spirit or the northern should prevail anever more urgent one. There was little possibility of compromise. The northernspirit was free and individualistic; the southern made for great estates and aconscious gentility ruling over a dusky subject multitude.Every new territory that was organized into a state as the tide of populationswept westward, every new incorporation into the fast growing American system,became a field of conflict between the two ideas, whether it should become astate of free citizens, or whether the estate and slavery system should prevail.From 1833 an American anti-slavery society was not merely resisting theextension of the institution but agitating the whole country for its completeabolition. The issue flamed up into open conflict over the admission of Texas tothe Union. Texas had originally been a part of the republic of Mexico, but itwas largely colonized by Americans from the slave-holding states, and it secededfrom Mexico, established its independence in 1835, and was annexed to the UnitedStates in 1844. Under the Mexican law slavery had been forbidden in Texas, butnow the South claimed Texas for slavery and got it.Meanwhile the development of ocean navigation was bringing a growing swarm ofimmigrants from Europe to swell the spreading population of the northern states,and the raising of Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Oregon, all northern farmlands, to state level, gave the anti-slavery North the possibility ofpredominance both in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Thecotton-growing South, irritated by the growing threat of the Abolitionistmovement, and fearing this predominance in Congress, began to talk of secessionfrom the Union. Southerners began to dream of annexations to the south of themin Mexico and the West Indies, and of a great slave state, detached from theNorth and reaching to Panama.The return of Abraham Lincoln as an anti-extension President in 1860 decided theSouth to split the Union. South Carolina passed an \"ordinance of secession,\" andprepared for war. Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texasjoined her, and a convention met at Montgomery in Alabama, elected JeffersonDavis president of the \"Confederated States\" of America, and adopted aconstitution specifically upholding \"the institution of negro slavery.\"Abraham Lincoln was, it chanced, a man entirely typical of the new people thathad grown up after the War of Independence. His early years had been spent as adrifting particle in the general westward flow of the population. He was born inKentucky (1809), was taken to Indiana as a boy and later on to Illinois. Lifewas rough in the backwoods of Indiana in those days; the house was a mere logcabin in the wilderness, and his schooling was poor and casual. But his mothertaught him to read early, and he became a voracious reader. At seventeen he wasa big athletic youth, a great wrestler and runner. He worked for a time as clerkin a store, went into business as a storekeeper with a drunken partner, andcontracted debts that he did not fully pay off for fifteen years. In 1834, whenhe was still only five and twenty, he was elected member of the House ofRepresentatives for the State of Illinois. In Illinois particularly the questionof slavery flamed because the great leader of the party for the extension ofslavery in the national Congress was Senator Douglas of Illinois. Douglas was aman of great ability and prestige, and for some years Lincoln fought against himby speech and pamphlet, rising steadily to the position of his most formidableand finally victorious antagonist. Their culminating struggle was thepresidential campaign of 1860, and on the fourth of March, 1861, Lincoln wasinaugurated President, with the southern states already in active secession fromthe rule of the federal government at Washington, and committing acts of war.This civil war in America was fought by improvised armies that grew steadilyfrom a few score thousands to hundreds of thousands-until at last the Federalforces exceeded a million men; it was fought over a vast area between New Mexicoand the eastern sea, Washington and Richmond were the chief objectives. It isbeyond our scope here to tell of the mounting energy of that epic struggle thatrolled to and fro across the hills and woods of Tennessee and Virginia and downthe Mississippi. There was a terrible waste and killing of men. Thrust wasfollowed by counter thrust; hope gave way to despondency, and returned and wasagain disappointed. Sometimes Washington seemed within the Confederate grasp;again the Federal armies were driving towards Richmond. The Confederates,outnumbered and far poorer in resources, fought under a general of supremeability, General Lee. The generalship of the Union was far inferior. Generalswere dismissed, new generals appointed; until at last, under Sherman and Grant,came victory over the ragged and depleted South. In October, 1864, a Federalarmy under Sherman broke through the Confederate left and marched down fromTennessee through Georgia to the coast, right across the Confederate country,and then turned up through the Carolinas, coming in upon the rear of theConfederate armies. Meanwhile Grant held Lee before Richmond until Shermanclosed on him. On April 9th, 1865, Lee and his army surrendered at AppomattoxCourt House, and within a month all the remaining secessionist armies had laiddown their arms and the Confederacy was at an end.This four years' struggle had meant an enormous physical and moral strain forthe people of the United States. The principle of state autonomy was very dearto many minds, and the North seemed in effect to be forcing abolition upon theSouth. In the border states brothers and cousins, even fathers and sons, wouldtake opposite sides and find themselves in antagonistic armies. The North feltits cause a righteous one, but for great numbers of people it was not afull-bodied and unchallenged righteousness. But for Lincoln there was no doubt.He was a clear-minded man in the midst of much confusion. He stood for union; hestood for the wide peace of America. He was opposed to slavery, but slavery heheld to be a secondary issue; his primary purpose was that the United Statesshould not be torn into two contrasted and jarring fragments.When in the opening stages of the war Congress and the Federal generals embarkedupon a precipitate emancipation, Lincoln opposed and mitigated their enthusiasm.He was for emancipation by stages and with compensation. It was only in January,1865, that the situation had ripened to a point when Congress could propose toabolish slavery for ever by a constitutional amendment, and the war was alreadyover before this amendment was ratified by the states.As the war dragged on through 1862 and 1863, the first passions and enthusiasmswaned, and America learnt all the phases of war weariness and war disgust. ThePresident found himself with defeatists, traitors, dismissed generals, tortuousparty politicians, and a doubting and fatigued people behind him and uninspiredgenerals and depressed troops before him; his chief consolation must have beenthat Jefferson Davis at Richmond could be in little better case. The Englishgovernment misbehaved, and permitted the Confederate agents in England to launchand man three swift privateer ships-the Alabama is the best remembered ofthem-which chased United States shipping from the seas. The French army inMexico was trampling the Monroe Doctrine in the dirt. Came subtle proposals fromRichmond to drop the war, leave the issues of the war for subsequent discussion,and turn, Federal and Confederate in alliance, upon the French in Mexico. ButLincoln would not listen to such proposals unless the supremacy of the Union wasmaintained. The Americans might do such things as one people but not as two.He held the United States together through long weary months of reverses andineffective effort, through black phases of division and failing courage; andthere is no record that he ever faltered from his purpose. There were times whenthere was nothing to be done, when he sat in the White House silent andmotionless, a grim monument of resolve; times when he relaxed his mind byjesting and broad anecdotes.He saw the Union triumphant. He entered Richmond the day after its surrender,and heard of Lee's capitulation. He returned to Washington, and on April 11thmade his last public address. His theme was reconciliation and thereconstruction of loyal government in the defeated states. On the evening ofApril 14th he went to Ford's theatre in Washington, and as he sat looking at thestage, he was shot in the back of the head and killed by an actor named Boothwho had some sort of grievance against him, and who had crept into the boxunobserved. But Lincoln's work was done; the Union was saved.At the beginning of the war there was no railway to the Pacific coast; after itthe railways spread like a swiftly growing plant until now they have clutchedand held and woven all the vast territory of the United States into oneindissoluble mental and material unity-the greatest real community-until thecommon folk of China have learnt to read-in the world.LXI. THE RISE OF GERMANY TO PREDOMINANCE IN EUROPEWE have told how after the convulsion of the French Revolution and theNapoleonic adventure, Europe settled down again for a time to an insecure peaceand a sort of modernized revival of the political conditions of fifty yearsbefore. Until the middle of the century the new facilities in the handling ofsteel and the railway and steamship produced no marked political consequences.But the social tension due to the development of urban industrialism grew.France remained a conspicuously uneasy country. The revolution of 1830 wasfollowed by another in 1848. Then Napoleon III, a nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte,became first President, and then (in 1852) Emperor.He set about rebuilding Paris, and changed it from a picturesque seventeenthcentury insanitary city into the spacious Latinized city of marble it is to-day.He set about rebuilding France, and made it into a brilliant-looking modernizedimperialism. He displayed a disposition to revive that competitiveness of theGreat Powers which had kept Europe busy with futile wars during the seventeenthand eighteenth centuries. The Tsar Nicholas I of Russia (1825-1856) was alsobecoming aggressive and pressing southward upon the Turkish Empire with his eyeson Constantinople.After the turn of the century Europe broke out into a fresh cycle of wars. Theywere chiefly \"balance-of-power\" and ascendancy wars. England, France andSardinia assailed Russia in the Crimean war in defence of Turkey; Prussia (withItaly as an ally) and Austria fought for the leadership of Germany, Franceliberated North Italy from Austria at the price of Savoy, and Italy graduallyunified itself into one kingdom. Then Napoleon III was so ill advised as toattempt adventures in Mexico, during the American Civil War; he set up anEmperor Maximilian there and abandoned him hastily to his fate-he was shot bythe Mexicans-when the victorious Federal Government showed its teeth.In 1870 came a long-pending struggle for predominance in Europe between Franceand Prussia. Prussia had long foreseen and prepared for this struggle, andFrance was rotten with financial corruption. Her defeat was swift and dramatic.The Germans invaded France in August, one great French army under the Emperorcapitulated at Sedan in September, another surrendered in October at Metz, andin January 1871, Paris, after a siege and bombardment, fell into German hands.Peace was signed at Frankfort surrendering the provinces of Alsace and Lorraineto the Germans. Germany, excluding Austria, was unified as an empire, and theKing of Prussia was added to the galaxy of European Caesars, as the GermanEmperor.For the next forty-three years Germany was the leading power upon the Europeancontinent. There was a Russo-Turkish war in 1877-8, but thereafter, except forcertain readjustments in the Balkans, European frontiers remained uneasilystable for thirty years.LXII. THE NEW OVERSEAS EMPIRES OF STEAMSHIP AND RAILWAYTHE END of the eighteenth century was a period of disrupting empires anddisillusioned expansionists. The long and tedious journey between Britain andSpain and their colonies in America prevented any really free coming and goingbetween the home land and the daughter lands, and so the colonies separated intonew and distinct communities, with distinctive ideas and interests and evenmodes of speech. As they grew they strained more and more at the feeble anduncertain link of shipping that had joined them. Weak trading-posts in thewilderness, like those of France in Canada, or trading establishments in greatalien communities, like those of Britain in India, might well cling for bareexistence to the nation which gave them support and a reason for theirexistence. That much and no more seemed to many thinkers in the early part ofthe nineteenth century to be the limit set to overseas rule. In 1820 the sketchygreat European \"empires\" outside of Europe that had figured so bravely in themaps of the middle eighteenth century, had shrunken to very small dimensions.Only the Russian sprawled as large as ever across Asia.The British Empire in 1815 consisted of the thinly populated coastal river andlake regions of Canada, and a great hinterland of wilderness in which the onlysettlements as yet were the fur-trading stations of the Hudson Bay Company,about a third of the Indian peninsula, under the rule of the East India Company,the coast districts of the Cape of Good Hope inhabited by blacks andrebellious-spirited Dutch settlers; a few trading stations on the coast of WestAfrica, the rock of Gibraltar, the island of Malta, Jamaica, a few minorslave-labour possessions in the West Indies, British Guiana in South America,and, on the other side of the world, two dumps for convicts at Botany Bay inAustralia and in Tasmania. Spain retained Cuba and a few settlements in thePhilippine Islands. Portugal had in Africa some vestiges of her ancient claims.Holland had various islands and possessions in the East Indies and Dutch Guiana,and Denmark an island or so in the West Indies. France had one or two WestIndian islands and French Guiana. This seemed to be as much as the Europeanpowers needed, or were likely to acquire of the rest of the world. Only the EastIndia Company showed any spirit of expansion.While Europe was busy with the Napoleonic wars the East India Company, under asuccession of Governors-General, was playing much the same rôle in India thathad been played before by Turkoman and such-like invaders from the north. Andafter the peace of Vienna it went on, levying its revenues, making wars, sendingambassadors to Asiatic powers, a quasi-independent state, however, with a markeddisposition to send wealth westward.We cannot tell here in any detail how the British Company made its way tosupremacy sometimes as the ally of this power, sometimes as that, and finally asthe conqueror of all. Its power spread to Assam, Sind, Oudh. The map of Indiabegan to take on the outlines familiar to the English schoolboy of to-day, apatchwork of native states embraced and held together by the great provincesunder direct British rule.In 1859, following upon a serious mutiny of the native troops in India, thisempire of the East India Company was annexed to the British Crown. By an Actentitled An Act for the Better Government of India, the Governor-General becamea Viceroy representing the Sovereign, and the place of the Company was taken bya Secretary of State for India responsible to the British Parliament. In 1877,Lord Beaconsfield, to complete the work, caused Queen Victoria to be proclaimedEmpress of India.Upon these extraordinary lines India and Britain are linked at the present time.India is still the empire of the Great Mogul, but the Great Mogul has beenreplaced by the \"crowned republic\" of Great Britain. India is an autocracywithout an autocrat. Its rule combines the disadvantage of absolute monarchywith the impersonality and irresponsibility of democratic officialdom. TheIndian with a complaint to make has no visible monarch to go to; his Emperor isa golden symbol; he must circulate pamphlets in England or inspire a question inthe British House of Commons. The more occupied Parliament is with Britishaffairs, the less attention India will receive, and the more she will be at themercy of her small group of higher officials.Apart from India, there was no great expansion of any European Empire until therailways and the steamships were in effective action. A considerable school ofpolitical thinkers in Britain was disposed to regard overseas possessions as asource of weakness to the kingdom. The Australian settlements developed slowlyuntil in 1842 the discovery of valuable copper mines, and in 1851 of gold, gavethem a new importance. Improvements in transport were also making Australianwool an increasingly marketable commodity in Europe. Canada, too, was notremarkably progressive until 1849; it was troubled by dissensions between itsFrench and British inhabitants, there were several serious revolts, and it wasonly in 1867 that a new constitution creating a Federal Dominion of Canadarelieved its internal strains. It was the railway that altered the Canadianoutlook. It enabled Canada, just as it enabled the United States, to expandwestward, to market its corn and other produce in Europe, and in spite of itsswift and extensive growth, to remain in language and sympathy and interests onecommunity. The railway, the steamship and the telegraph cable were indeedchanging all the conditions of colonial development.Before 1840, English settlements had already begun in New Zealand, and a NewZealand Land Company had been formed to exploit the possibilities of the island.In 1840 New Zealand also was added to the colonial possessions of the BritishCrown.Canada, as we have noted, was the first of the British possessions to respondrichly to the new economic possibilities that the new methods of transport wereopening. Presently the republics of South America, and particularly theArgentine Republic, began to feel in their cattle trade and coffee growing theincreased nearness of the European market. Hitherto the chief commodities thathad attracted the European powers into unsettled and barbaric regions had beengold or other metals, spices, ivory, or slaves. But in the latter quarter of thenineteenth century the increase of the European populations was obliging theirgovernments to look abroad for staple foods; and the growth of scientificindustrialism was creating a demand for new raw materials, fats and greases ofevery kind, rubber, and other hitherto disregarded substances. It was plain thatGreat Britain and Holland and Portugal were reaping a great and growingcommercial advantage from their very considerable control of tropical andsub-tropical products. After 1871 Germany, and presently France and later Italy,began to look for unannexed raw-material areas, or for Oriental countriescapable of profitable modernization.So began a fresh scramble all over the world, except in the American regionwhere the Monroe Doctrine now barred such adventures, for politicallyunprotected lands.Close to Europe was the continent of Africa, full of vaguely knownpossibilities. In 1850 it was a continent of black mystery; only Egypt and thecoast were known. Here we have no space to tell the amazing story of theexplorers and adventurers who first pierced the African darkness, and of thepolitical agents, administrators, traders, settlers and scientific men whofollowed in their track. Wonderful races of men like the pygmies, strange beastslike the okapi, marvellous fruits and flowers and insects, terrible diseases,astounding scenery of forest and mountain, enormous inland seas and giganticrivers and cascades were revealed; a whole new world. Even remains (at Zimbabwe)of some unrecorded and vanished civilization, the southward enterprise of anearly people, were discovered. Into this new world came the Europeans, and foundthe rifle already there in the hands of the Arab slave-traders, and negro lifein disorder.By 1900, in half a century, all Africa was mapped, explored, estimated anddivided between the European powers. Little heed was given to the welfare of thenatives in this scramble. The Arab slaver was indeed curbed rather thanexpelled, but the greed for rubber, which was a wild product collected undercompulsion by the natives in the Belgian Congo, a greed exacerbated by the clashof inexperienced European administrators with the native population, led tohorrible atrocities. No European power has perfectly clean hands in this matter.We cannot tell here in any detail how Great Britain got possession of Egypt in1883 and remained there in spite of the fact that Egypt was technically a partof the Turkish Empire, nor how nearly this scramble led to war between Franceand Great Britain in 1898, when a certain Colonel Marchand, crossing CentralAfrica from the west coast, tried at Fashoda to seize the Upper Nile.Nor can we tell how the British Government first let the Boers, or Dutchsettlers, of the Orange River district and the Transvaal set up independentrepublics in the inland parts of South Africa, and then repented and annexed theTransvaal Republic in 1877; nor how the Transvaal Boers fought for freedom andwon it after the battle of Majuba Hill (1881). Majuba Hill was made to rankle inthe memory of the English people by a persistent press campaign. A war with bothrepublics broke out in 1899, a three years' war enormously costly to the Britishpeople, which ended at last in the surrender of the two republics.Their period of subjugation was a brief one. In 1907, after the downfall of theimperialist government which had conquered them, the Liberals took the SouthAfrican problem in hand, and these former republics became free and fairlywilling associates with Cape Colony and Natal in a Confederation of all thestates of South Africa as one self-governing republic under the British Crown.In a quarter of a century the partition of Africa was completed. There remainedunannexed three comparatively small countries: Liberia, a settlement ofliberated negro slaves on the west coast; Morocco, under a Moslem Sultan; andAbyssinia, a barbaric country, with an ancient and peculiar form ofChristianity, which had successfully maintained its independence against Italyat the battle of Adowa in 1896.LXIII. EUROPEAN AGGRESSION IN ASIA, AND THE RISE OF JAPANIT is difficult to believe that any large number of people really accepted thisheadlong painting of the map of Africa in European colours as a permanent newsettlement of the world's affairs, but it is the duty of the historian to recordthat it was so accepted. There was but a shallow historical background to theEuropean mind in the nineteenth century, and no habit of penetrating criticism.The quite temporary advantages that the mechanical revolution in the west hadgiven the Europeans over the rest of the old world were regarded by people,blankly ignorant of such events as the great Mongol conquests, as evidences of apermanent and assured European leadership of mankind. They had no sense of thetransferability of science and its fruits. They did not realize that Chinamenand Indians could carry on the work of research as ably as Frenchmen orEnglishmen. They believed that there was some innate intellectual drive in thewest, and some innate indolence and conservatism in the east, that assured theEuropeans a world predominance for ever.The consequence of this infatuation was that the various European foreignoffices set themselves not merely to scramble with the British for the savageand undeveloped regions of the world's surface, but also to carve up thepopulous and civilized countries of Asia as though these people also were nomore than raw material for exploitation. The inwardly precarious but outwardlysplendid imperialism of the British ruling class in India, and the extensive andprofitable possessions of the Dutch in the East Indies, filled the rival GreatPowers with dreams of similar glories in Persia, in the disintegrating OttomanEmpire, and in Further India, China and Japan.In 1898 Germany seized Kiau Chau in China. Britain responded by seizingWei-hai-wei, and the next year the Russians took possession of Port Arthur. Aflame of hatred for the Europeans swept through China. There were massacres ofEuropeans and Christian converts, and in 1900 an attack upon and siege of theEuropean legations in Pekin. A combined force of Europeans made a punitiveexpedition to Pekin, rescued the legations, and stole an enormous amount ofvaluable property. The Russians then seized Manchuria, and in 1904 the Britishinvaded Tibet.But now a new Power appeared in the struggle of the Great Powers, Japan.Hitherto Japan has played but a small part in this history; her secludedcivilization has not contributed very largely to the general shaping of humandestinies; she has received much, but she has given little. The Japanese properare of the Mongolian race. Their civilization, their writing and their literaryand artistic traditions are derived from the Chinese. Their history is aninteresting and romantic one; they developed a feudal system and a system ofchivalry in the earlier centuries of the Christian era; their attacks upon Koreaand China are an Eastern equivalent of the English wars in France. Japan wasfirst brought into contact with Europe in the sixteenth century; in 1542 somePortuguese reached it in a Chinese junk, and in 1549 a Jesuit missionary,Francis Xavier, began his teaching there. For a time Japan welcomed Europeanintercourse, and the Christian missionaries made a great number of converts. Acertain William Adams became the most trusted European adviser of the Japanese,and showed them how to build big ships. There were voyages in Japanese-builtships to India and Peru. Then arose complicated quarrels between the SpanishDominicans, the Portuguese Jesuits, and the English and Dutch Protestants, eachwarning the Japanese against the political designs of the others. The Jesuits,in a phase of ascendancy, persecuted and insulted the Buddhists with greatacrimony. In the end the Japanese came to the conclusion that the Europeans werean intolerable nuisance, and that Catholic Christianity in particular was a merecloak for the political dreams of the Pope and the Spanish monarchy-already inpossession of the Philippine Islands; there was a great persecution of theChristians, and in 1638 Japan was absolutely closed to Europeans, and remainedclosed for over 200 years. During those two centuries the Japanese were ascompletely cut off from the rest of the world as though they lived upon anotherplanet. It was forbidden to build any ship larger than a mere coasting boat. NoJapanese could go abroad, and no European enter the country.For two centuries Japan remained outside the main current of history. She livedon in a state of picturesque feudalism in which about five per cent. of thepopulation, the samurai, or fighting men, and the nobles and their families,tyrannized without restraint over the rest of the population. Meanwhile thegreat world outside went on to wider visions and new powers. Strange shippingbecame more frequent, passing the Japanese headlands; sometimes ships werewrecked and sailors brought ashore. Through the Dutch settlement in the islandof Deshima, their one link with the outer universe, came warnings that Japan wasnot keeping pace with the power of the Western world. In 1837 a ship sailed intoYedo Bay flying a strange flag of stripes and stars, and carrying some Japanesesailors she had picked up far adrift in the Pacific. She was driven off bycannon shot. This flag presently reappeared on other ships. One in 1849 came todemand the liberation of eighteen shipwrecked American sailors. Then in 1853came four American warships under Commodore Perry, and refused to be drivenaway. He lay at anchor in forbidden waters, and sent messages to the two rulerswho at that time shared the control of Japan. In 1854 he returned with tenships, amazing ships propelled by steam, and equipped with big guns, and he madeproposals for trade and intercourse that the Japanese had no power to resist. Helanded with a guard of 500 men to sign the treaty. Incredulous crowds watchedthis visitation from the outer world, marching through the streets.Russia, Holland and Britain followed in the wake of America. A great noblemanwhose estates commanded the Straits of Shimonoseki saw fit to fire on foreignvessels, and a bombardment by a fleet of British, French, Dutch and Americanwarships destroyed his batteries and scattered his swordsmen. Finally an alliedsquadron (1865), at anchor off Kioto, imposed a ratification of the treatieswhich opened Japan to the world.The humiliation of the Japanese by these events was intense. With astonishingenergy and intelligence they set themselves to bring their culture andorganization to the level of the European Powers. Never in all the history ofmankind did a nation make such a stride as Japan then did. In 1866 she was amedieval people, a fantastic caricature of the extremest romantic feudalism; in1899 hers was a completely Westernized people, on a level with the most advancedEuropean Powers. She completely dispelled the persuasion that Asia was in someirrevocable way hopelessly behind Europe. She made all European progress seemsluggish by comparison.We cannot tell here in any detail of Japan's war with China in 1894-95. Itdemonstrated the extent of her Westernization. She had an efficient Westernizedarmy and a small but sound fleet. But the significance of her renascence, thoughit was appreciated by Britain and the United States, who were already treatingher as if she were a European state, was not understood by the other GreatPowers engaged in the pursuit of new Indias in Asia. Russia was pushing downthrough Manchuria to Korea. France was already established far to the south inTonkin and Annam, Germany was prowling hungrily on the look-out for somesettlement. The three Powers combined to prevent Japan reaping any fruits fromthe Chinese war. She was exhausted by the struggle, and they threatened her withwar.Japan submitted for a time and gathered her forces. Within ten years she wasready for a struggle with Russia, which marks an epoch in the history of Asia,the close of the period of European arrogance. The Russian people were, ofcourse, innocent and ignorant of this trouble that was being made for themhalfway round the world, and the wiser Russian statesmen were against thesefoolish thrusts; but a gang of financial adventurers, including the Grand Dukes,his cousins, surrounded the Tsar. They had gambled deeply in the prospectivelooting of Manchuria and China, and they would suffer no withdrawal. So therebegan a transportation of great armies of Japanese soldiers across the sea toPort Arthur and Korea, and the sending of endless trainloads of Russian peasantsalong the Siberian railway to die in those distant battlefields.The Russians, badly led and dishonestly provided, were beaten on sea and landalike. The Russian Baltic Fleet sailed round Africa to be utterly destroyed inthe Straits of Tshushima. A revolutionary movement among the common people ofRussia, infuriated by this remote and reasonless slaughter, obliged the Tsar toend the war (1905); he returned the southern half of Saghalien, which had beenseized by Russia in 1875, evacuated Manchuria, resigned Korea to Japan. TheEuropean invasion of Asia was coming to an end and the retraction of Europe'stentacles was beginning.LXIV. THE BRITISH EMPIRE IN 1914WE may note here briefly the varied nature of the constituents of the BritishEmpire in 1914 which the steamship and railway had brought together. It was andis a quite unique political combination; nothing of the sort has ever existedbefore.First and central to the whole system was the \"crowned republic\" of the UnitedBritish Kingdom, including (against the will of a considerable part of the Irishpeople) Ireland. The majority of the British Parliament, made up of the threeunited parliaments of England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, determines theheadship, the quality and policy of the ministry, and determines it largely onconsiderations arising out of British domestic politics. It is this ministrywhich is the effective supreme government, with powers of peace and war, overall the rest of the empire.Next in order of political importance to the British States were the \"crownedrepublics\" of Australia, Canada, Newfoundland (the oldest British possession,1583), New Zealand and South Africa, all practically independent andself-governing states in alliance with Great Britain, but each with arepresentative of the Crown appointed by the Government in office;Next the Indian Empire, an extension of the Empire of the Great Mogul, with itsdependent and \"protected\" states reaching now from Beluchistan to Burma, andincluding Aden, in all of which empire the British Crown and the India Office(under Parliamentary control) played the rôle of the original Turkoman dynasty;Then the ambiguous possession of Egypt, still nominally a part of the TurkishEmpire and still retaining its own monarch, the Khedive, but under almostdespotic British official rule;Then the still more ambiguous \"Anglo-Egyptian\" Sudan province, occupied andadministered jointly by the British and by the (British controlled) EgyptianGovernment;Then a number of partially self-governing communities, some British in originand some not, with elected legislatures and an appointed executive, such asMalta, Jamaica, the Bahamas and Bermuda;Then the Crown colonies, in which the rule of the British Home Government(through the Colonial Office) verged on autocracy, as in Ceylon, Trinidad andFiji (where there was an appointed council), and Gibraltar and St. Helena (wherethere was a governor);Then great areas of (chiefly) tropical lands, raw-product areas, withpolitically weak and under-civilized native communities which were nominallyprotectorates, and administered either by a High Commissioner set over nativechiefs (as in Basutoland) or over a chartered company (as in Rhodesia). In somecases the Foreign Office, in some cases the Colonial Office, and in some casesthe India Office, has been concerned in acquiring the possessions that fell intothis last and least definite class of all, but for the most part the ColonialOffice was now responsible for them.It will be manifest, therefore, that no single office and no single brain hadever comprehended the British Empire as a whole. It was a mixture of growths andaccumulations entirely different from anything that has ever been called anempire before. It guaranteed a wide peace and security; that is why it wasendured and sustained by many men of the \"subject\" races-in spite of officialtyrannies and insufficiencies, and of much negligence on the part of the \"home\"public. Like the Athenian Empire, it was an overseas empire; its ways were seaways, and its common link was the British Navy. Like all empires, its cohesionwas dependent physically upon a method of communication; the development ofseamanship, shipbuilding and steamships between the sixteenth and nineteenthcenturies had made it a possible and convenient Pax-the \"Pax Britannica,\" andfresh developments of air or swift land transport might at any time make itinconvenient.LXV. THE AGE OF ARMAMENT IN EUROPE, AND THE GREAT WAR OF 1914-18THE PROGRESS in material science that created this vast steamboat-and-railwayrepublic of America and spread this precarious British steamship empire over theworld, produced quite other effects upon the congested nations upon thecontinent of Europe. They found themselves confined within boundaries fixedduring the horse-and-high-road period of human life, and their expansionoverseas had been very largely anticipated by Great Britain. Only Russia had anyfreedom to expand eastward; and she drove a great railway across Siberia untilshe entangled herself in a conflict with Japan, and pushed south-eastwardlytowards the borders of Persia and India to the annoyance of Britain. The rest ofthe European Powers were in a state of intensifying congestion. In order torealize the full possibilities of the new apparatus of human life they had torearrange their affairs upon a broader basis, either by some sort of voluntaryunion or by a union imposed upon them by some predominant power. The tendency ofmodern thought was in the direction of the former alternative, but all-the forceof political tradition drove Europe towards the latter.The downfall of the \"empire\" of Napoleon III, the establishment of the newGerman Empire, pointed men's hopes and fears towards the idea of a Europeconsolidated under German auspices. For thirty-six years of uneasy peace thepolitics of Europe centred upon that possibility. France, the steadfast rival ofGermany for European ascendancy since the division of the empire of Charlemagne,sought to correct her own weakness by a close alliance with Russia, and Germanylinked herself closely with the Austrian Empire (it had ceased to be the HolyRoman Empire in the days of Napoleon I) and less successfully with the newkingdom of Italy. At first Great Britain stood as usual half in and half out ofcontinental affairs. But she was gradually forced into a close association withthe Franco-Russian group by the aggressive development of a great German navy.The grandiose imagination of the Emperor William II (1888-1918) thrust Germanyinto premature overseas enterprise that ultimately brought not only GreatBritain but Japan and the United States into the circle of her enemies.All these nations armed. Year after year the proportion of national productiondevoted to the making of guns, equipment, battleships and the like increased.Year after year the balance of things seemed trembling towards war, and then warwould be averted. At last it came. Germany and Austria struck at France andRussia and Serbia; the German armies marching through Belgium, Britainimmediately came into the war on the side of Belgium, bringing in Japan as herally, and very soon Turkey followed on the German side. Italy entered the waragainst Austria in 1915, and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in the Octoberof that year. In 1916 Rumania, and in 1917 the United States and China wereforced into war against Germany. It is not within the scope of this history todefine the exact share of blame for this vast catastrophe. The more interestingquestion is not why the Great War was begun but why the Great War was notanticipated and prevented. It is a far graver thing for mankind that scores ofmillions of people were too \"patriotic,\" stupid, or apathetic to prevent thisdisaster by a movement towards European unity upon frank and generous lines,than that a small number of people may have been active in bringing it about.It is impossible within the space at our command here to trace the intricatedetails of the war. Within a few months it became apparent that the progress ofmodern technical science had changed the nature of warfare very profoundly.Physical science gives power, power over steel, over distance, over disease;whether that power is used well or ill depends upon the moral and politicalintelligence of the world. The governments of Europe, inspired by antiquatedpolicies of hate and suspicion, found themselves with unexampled powers both ofdestruction and resistance in their hands. The war became a consuming fire roundand about the world, causing losses both to victors and vanquished out of allproportion to the issues involved. The first phase of the war was a tremendousrush of the Germans upon Paris and an invasion of East Prussia by the Russians.Both attacks were held and turned. Then the power of the defensive developed;there was a rapid elaboration of trench warfare until for a time the opposingarmies lay entrenched in long lines right across Europe, unable to make anyadvance without enormous losses. The armies were millions strong, and behindthem entire populations were organized for the supply of food and munitions tothe front. There was a cessation of nearly every sort of productive activityexcept such as contributed to military operations. All the able-bodied manhoodof Europe was drawn into the armies or navies or into the improvised factoriesthat served them. There was an enormous replacement of men by women in industry.Probably more than half the people in the belligerent countries of Europechanged their employment altogether during this stupendous struggle. They weresocially uprooted and transplanted. Education and normal scientific work wererestricted or diverted to immediate military ends, and the distribution of newswas crippled and corrupted by military control and \"propaganda\" activities.The phase of military deadlock passed slowly into one of aggression upon thecombatant populations behind the fronts by the destruction of food supplies andby attacks through the air. And also there was a steady improvement in the sizeand range of the guns employed and of such ingenious devices as poison-gasshells and the small mobile forts known as tanks, to break down the resistanceof troops in the trenches. The air offensive was the most revolutionary of allthe new methods. It carried warfare from two dimensions into three. Hitherto inthe history of mankind war had gone on only where the armies marched and met.Now it went on everywhere. First the Zeppelin and then the bombing aeroplanecarried war over and past the front to an ever-increasing area of civilianactivities beyond. The old distinction maintained in civilized warfare betweenthe civilian and combatant population disappeared. Everyone who grew food, orwho sewed a garment, everyone who felled a tree or repaired a house, everyrailway station and every warehouse was held to be fair game for destruction.The air offensive increased in range and terror with every month in the war. Atlast great areas of Europe were in a state of siege and subject to nightlyraids. Such exposed cities as London and Paris passed sleepless night aftersleepless night while the bombs burst, the anti-aircraft guns maintained anintolerable racket, and the fire engines and ambulances rattled headlong throughthe darkened and deserted streets. The effects upon the minds and health of oldpeople and of young children were particularly distressing and destructive.Pestilence, that old follower of warfare, did not arrive until the very end ofthe fighting in 1918. For four years medical science staved off any generalepidemic; then came a great outbreak of influenza about the world whichdestroyed many millions of people. Famine also was staved off for some time. Bythe beginning of 1918 however most of Europe was in a state of mitigated andregulated famine. The production of food throughout the world had fallen verygreatly through the calling off of peasant mankind to the fronts, and thedistribution of such food as was produced was impeded by the havoc wrought bythe submarine, by the rupture of customary routes through the closing offrontiers, and by the disorganization of the transport system of the world. Thevarious governments took possession of the dwindling food supplies, and, withmore or less success, rationed their populations. By the fourth year the wholeworld was suffering from shortages of clothing and housing and of most of thenormal gear of life as well as of food. Business and economic life wereprofoundly disorganized. Everyone was worried, and most people were leadinglives of unwonted discomfort.The actual warfare ceased in November, 1918. After a supreme effort in thespring of 1918 that almost carried the Germans to Paris, the Central Powerscollapsed. They had come to an end of their spirit and resources.LXVI. THE REVOLUTION AND FAMINE IN RUSSIABUT a good year and more before the collapse of the Central Powers the halforiental monarchy of Russia, which had professed to be the continuation of theByzantine Empire, had collapsed. The Tsardom had been showing signs of profoundrottenness for some years before the war; the court was under the sway of afantastic religious impostor, Rasputin, and the public administration, civil andmilitary, was in a state of extreme inefficiency and corruption. At the outsetof the war there was a great flare of patriotic enthusiasm in Russia. A vastconscript army was called up, for which there was neither adequate militaryequipment nor a proper supply of competent officers, and this great host, illsupplied and badly handled, was hurled against the German and Austrianfrontiers.There can be no doubt that the early appearance of Russian armies in EastPrussia in September, 1914, diverted the energies and attention of the Germansfrom their first victorious drive upon Paris. The sufferings and deaths ofscores of thousands of ill-led Russian peasants saved France from completeoverthrow in that momentous opening campaign, and made all western Europe thedebtors of that great and tragic people. But the strain of the war upon thissprawling, ill-organized empire was too heavy for its strength. The Russiancommon soldiers were sent into battle without guns to support them, without evenrifle ammunition; they were wasted by their officers and generals in a deliriumof militarist enthusiasm. For a time they seemed to be suffering mutely as thebeasts suffer; but there is a limit to the endurance even of the most ignorant.A profound disgust for Tsardom was creeping through these armies of betrayed andwasted men. From the close of 1915 onward Russia was a source of deepeninganxiety to her Western Allies. Throughout 1916 she remained largely ondefensive, and there were rumours of a separate peace with Germany.On December 29th, 1916, the monk Rasputin was murdered at a dinner party inPetrograd, and a belated attempt was made to put the Tsardom in order. By Marchthings were moving rapidly; food riots in Petrograd developed into arevolutionary insurrection; there was an attempted suppression of the Duma, therepresentative body, there were attempted arrests of liberal leaders, theformation of a provisional government under Prince Lvoff, and an abdication(March 15th) by the Tsar. For a time it seemed that a moderate and controlledrevolution might be possible-perhaps under a new Tsar. Then it became evidentthat the destruction of popular confidence in Russia had gone too far for anysuch adjustments. The Russian people were sick to death of the old order ofthings in Europe, of Tsars and wars and of Great Powers; it wanted relief, andthat speedily, from unendurable miseries. The Allies had no understanding ofRussian realities; their diplomatists were ignorant of Russian, genteel personswith their attention directed to the Russian Court rather than to Russia, theyblundered steadily with the new situation. There was little goodwill among thesediplomatists for republicanism, and a manifest disposition to embarrass the newgovernment as much as possible. At the head of the Russian republican governmentwas an eloquent and picturesque leader, Kerensky, who found himself assailed bythe forces of a profounder revolutionary movement, the \"social revolution,\" athome and cold-shouldered by the Allied governments abroad. His Allies wouldneither let him give the Russian peasants the land for which they craved norpeace beyond their frontiers. The French and the British press pestered theirexhausted ally for a fresh offensive, but when presently the Germans made astrong attack by sea and land upon Riga, the British Admiralty quailed beforethe prospect of a Baltic expedition in relief. The new Russian Republic had tofight unsupported. In spite of their naval predominance and the bitter protestsof the great English admiral, Lord Fisher (1841-1920), it is to be noted thatthe British and their Allies, except for some submarine attacks, left theGermans the complete mastery of the Baltic throughout the war.The Russian masses, however, were resolute to end the war. At any cost. Therehad come into existence in Petrograd a body representing the workers and commonsoldiers, the Soviet, and this body clamoured for an international conference ofsocialists at Stockholm. Food riots were occurring in Berlin at this time, warweariness in Austria and Germany was profound, and there can be little doubt, inthe light of subsequent events, that such a conference would have precipitated areasonable peace on democratic lines in 1917 and a German revolution. Kerenskyimplored his Western allies to allow this conference to take place, but, fearfulof a worldwide outbreak of socialism and republicanism, they refused, in spiteof the favourable response of a small majority of the British Labour Party.Without either moral or physical help from the Allies, the unhappy \"moderate\"Russian Republic still fought on and made a last desperate offensive effort inJuly. It failed after some preliminary successes, and there came another greatslaughtering of Russians.The limit of Russian endurance was reached. Mutinies broke out in the Russianarmies, and particularly upon the northern front, and on November 7th, 1917,Kerensky's government was overthrown and power was seized by the Soviets,dominated by the Bolshevik socialists under Lenin, and pledged to make peaceregardless of the Western powers. On March 2nd, 1918, a separate peace betweenRussia and Germany was signed at Brest-Litovsk.It speedily became evident that these Bolshevik socialists were men of a verydifferent quality from the rhetorical constitutionalists and revolutionaries ofthe Kerensky phase. They were fanatical Marxist communists. They believed thattheir accession to power in Russia was only the opening of a world-wide socialrevolution, and they set about changing the social and economic order with thethoroughness of perfect faith and absolute inexperience. The western Europeanand the American governments were themselves much too ill-informed and incapableto guide or help this extraordinary experiment, and the press set itself todiscredit and the ruling classes to wreck these usurpers upon any terms and atany cost to themselves or to Russia. A propaganda of abominable and disgustinginventions went on unchecked in the press of the world; the Bolshevik leaderswere represented as incredible monsters glutted with blood and plunder andliving lives of sensuality before which the realities of the Tsarist courtduring the Rasputin regime paled to a white purity. Expeditions were launched atthe exhausted country, insurgents and raiders were encouraged, armed andsubsidized, and no method of attack was too mean or too monstrous for thefrightened enemies of the Bolshevik regime. In 1919, the Russian Bolsheviks,ruling a country already exhausted and disorganized by five years of intensivewarfare, were fighting a British Expedition at Archangel, Japanese invaders inEastern Siberia, Roumanians with French and Greek contingents in the south, theRussian Admiral Koltchak in Siberia and General Deniken, supported by the Frenchfleet, in the Crimea. In July of that year an Esthonian army, under GeneralYudenitch, almost got to Petersburg. In 1920 the Poles, incited by the French,made a new attack on Russia; and a new reactionary raider, General Wrangel, tookover the task of General Deniken in invading and devastating his own country. InMarch, 1921, the sailors at Cronstadt revolted. The Russian Government under itspresident, Lenin, survived all these various attacks. It showed an amazingtenacity, and the common people of Russia sustained it unswervingly underconditions of extreme hardship. By the end of 1921 both Britain and Italy hadmade a sort of recognition of the communist rule.But if the Bolshevik Government was successful in its struggle against foreignintervention and internal revolt, it was far less happy in its attempts to setup a new social order based upon communist ideas in Russia. The Russian peasantis a small land-hungry proprietor, as far from communism in his thoughts andmethods as a whale is from flying; the revolution gave him the land of the greatlandowners but could not make him grow food for anything but negotiable money,and the revolution, among other things, had practically destroyed the value ofmoney. Agricultural production, already greatly disordered by the collapse ofthe railways through war-strain, shrank to a mere cultivation of food by thepeasants for their own consumption. The towns starved. Hasty and ill-plannedattempts to make over industrial production in accordance with communist ideaswere equally unsuccessful. By 1920 Russia presented the unprecedented spectacleof a modern civilization in complete collapse. Railways were rusting and passingout of use, towns were falling into ruin, everywhere there was an immensemortality. Yet the country still fought with its enemies at its gates. In 1921came a drought and a great famine among the peasant cultivators in thewar-devastated south-east provinces. Millions of people starved.But the question of the distresses and the possible recuperation of Russiabrings us too close to current controversies to be discussed here.LXVII. THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION OF THE WORLDTHE SCHEME and scale upon which this History is planned do not permit us toenter into the complicated and acrimonious disputes that centre about thetreaties, and particularly of the treaty of Versailles, which concluded theGreat War. We are beginning to realize that that conflict, terrible and enormousas it was, ended nothing, began nothing and settled nothing. It killed millionsof people; it wasted and impoverished the world. It smashed Russia altogether.It was at best an acute and frightful reminder that we were living foolishly andconfusedly without much plan or foresight in a dangerous and unsympatheticuniverse. The crudely organized egotisms and passions of national and imperialgreed that carried mankind into that tragedy, emerged from it sufficientlyunimpaired to make some other similar disaster highly probable so soon as theworld has a little recovered from its war exhaustion and fatigue. Wars andrevolutions make nothing; their utmost service to mankind is that, in a veryrough and painful way, they destroy superannuated and obstructive things. Thegreat war lifted the threat of German imperialism from Europe, and shattered theimperialism of Russia. It cleared away a number of monarchies. But a multitudeof flags still waves in Europe, the frontiers still exasperate, great armiesaccumulate fresh stores of equipment.The Peace Conference at Versailles was a gathering very ill adapted to do morethan carry out the conflicts and defeats of the war to their logicalconclusions. The Germans, Austrians, Turks and Bulgarians were permitted noshare in its deliberations; they were only to accept the decisions it dictatedto them. From the point of view of human welfare the choice of the place ofmeeting was particularly unfortunate. It was at Versailles in 1871 that, withevery circumstance of triumphant vulgarity, the new German Empire had beenproclaimed. The suggestion of a melodramatic reversal of that scene, in the sameHall of Mirrors, was overpowering.Whatever generosities had appeared in the opening phases of the Great War hadlong been exhausted. The populations of the victorious countries were acutelyaware of their own losses and sufferings, and entirely regardless of the factthat the defeated had paid in the like manner. The war had arisen as a naturaland inevitable consequence of the competitive nationalisms of Europe and theabsence of any Federal adjustment of these competitive forces; war is thenecessary logical consummation of independent sovereign nationalities living intoo small an area with too powerful an armament; and if the great war had notcome in the form it did it would have come in some similar form-just as it willcertainly return upon a still more disastrous scale in twenty or thirty years'time if no political unification anticipates and prevents it. States organizedfor war will make wars as surely as hens will lay eggs, but the feeling of thesedistressed and war-worn countries disregarded this fact, and the whole of thedefeated peoples were treated as morally and materially responsible for all thedamage, as they would no doubt have treated the victor peoples had the issue ofwar been different. The French and English thought the Germans were to blame,the Germans thought the Russians, French and English were to blame, and only anintelligent minority thought that there was anything to blame in the fragmentarypolitical constitution of Europe. The treaty of Versailles was intended to beexemplary and vindictive; it provided tremendous penalties for the vanquished;it sought to provide compensations for the wounded and suffering victors byimposing enormous debts upon nations already bankrupt, and its attempts toreconstitute international relations by the establishment of a League of Nationsagainst war were manifestly insincere and inadequate.So far as Europe was concerned it is doubtful if there would have been anyattempt whatever to organize international relations for a permanent peace. Theproposal of the League of Nations was brought into practical politics by thePresident of the United States of America, President Wilson. Its chief supportwas in America. So far the United States, this new modern state, had developedno distinctive ideas of international relationship beyond the Monroe Doctrine,which protected the new world from European interference. Now suddenly it wascalled upon for its mental contribution to the vast problem of the time. It hadnone. The natural disposition of the American people was towards a permanentworld peace. With this however was linked a strong traditional distrust ofold-world politics and a habit of isolation from old-world entanglements. TheAmericans had hardly begun to think out an American solution of world problemswhen the submarine campaign of the Germans dragged them into the war on the sideof the anti-German allies. President Wilson's scheme of a League of Nations wasan attempt at short notice to create a distinctively American world project. Itwas a sketchy, inadequate and dangerous scheme. In Europe however it was takenas a matured American point of view. The generality of mankind in 1918-19 wasintensely weary of war and anxious at almost any sacrifice to erect barriersagainst its recurrence, but there was not a single government in the old worldwilling to waive one iota of its sovereign independence to attain any such end.The public utterances of President Wilson leading up to the project of a WorldLeague of Nations seemed for a time to appeal right over the heads of thegovernments to the peoples of the world; they were taken as expressing the ripeintentions of America, and the response was enormous. Unhappily President Wilsonhad to deal with governments and not with peoples; he was a man capable oftremendous flashes of vision and yet when put to the test egotistical andlimited, and the great wave of enthusiasm he evoked passed and was wasted.Says Dr. Dillon in his book, The Peace Conference: \"Europe, when the Presidenttouched its shores, was as clay ready for the creative potter. Never before werethe nations so eager to follow a Moses who would take them to the long-promisedland where wars are prohibited and blockades unknown. And to their thinking hewas just that great leader. In France men bowed down before him with awe andaffection. Labour leaders in Paris told me that they shed tears of joy in hispresence, and that their comrades would go through fire and water to help him torealize his noble schemes. To the working classes in Italy his name was aheavenly clarion at the sound of which the earth would be renewed. The Germansregarded him and his doctrine as their sheet-anchor of safety. The fearless HerrMuehlon said: 'If President Wilson were to address the Germans, and pronounce asevere sentence upon them, they would accept it with resignation and without amurmur and set to work at once.' In German-Austria his fame was that of asaviour, and the mere mention of his name brought balm to the suffering andsurcease of sorrow to the afflicted.\"Such were the overpowering expectations that President Wilson raised. Howcompletely he disappointed them and how weak and futile was the League ofNations he made is too long and too distressful a story to tell here. Heexaggerated in his person our common human tragedy, he was so very great in hisdreams and so incapable in his performance. America dissented from the acts ofits President and would not join the League Europe accepted from him. There wasa slow realization on the part of the American people that it had been rushedinto something for which it was totally unprepared. There was a correspondingrealization on the part of Europe that America had nothing ready to give to theold world in its extremity. Born prematurely and crippled at its birth, thatLeague has become indeed, with its elaborate and unpractical constitution andits manifest limitations of power, a serious obstacle in the way of anyeffective reorganization of international relationships. The problem would be aclearer one if the League did not yet exist. Yet that world-wide blaze ofenthusiasm that first welcomed the project, that readiness of men everywhereround and about the earth, of men, that is, as distinguished from governments,for a world control of war, is a thing to be recorded with emphasis in anyhistory. Behind the short-sighted governments that divide and mismanage humanaffairs, a real force for world unity and world order exists and grows.From 1918 onward the world entered upon an age of conferences. Of these theConference at Washington called by President Harding (1921) has been the mostsuccessful and suggestive. Notable, too, is the Genoa Conference (1922) for theappearance of German and Russian delegates at its deliberations. We will notdiscuss this long procession of conferences and tentatives in any detail. Itbecomes more and more clearly manifest that a huge work of reconstruction has tobe done by mankind if a crescendo of such convulsions and world massacres asthat of the great war is to be averted. No such hasty improvisation as theLeague of Nations, no patched-up system of Conferences between this group ofstates and that, which change nothing with an air of settling everything, willmeet the complex political needs of the new age that lies before us. Asystematic development and a systematic application of the sciences of humanrelationship, of personal and group psychology, of financial and economicscience and of education, sciences still only in their infancy, is required.Narrow and obsolete, dead and dying moral and political ideas have to bereplaced by a clearer and a simpler conception of the common origins anddestinies of our kind.But if the dangers, confusions and disasters that crowd upon man in these daysare enormous beyond any experience of the past, it is because science hasbrought him such powers as he never had before. And the scientific method offearless thought, exhaustively lucid statement, and exhaustively criticizedplanning, which has given him these as yet uncontrollable powers, gives him alsothe hope of controlling these powers. Man is still only adolescent. His troublesare not the troubles of senility and exhaustion but of increasing and stillundisciplined strength. When we look at all history as one process, as we havebeen doing in this book, when we see the steadfast upward struggle of lifetowards vision and control, then we see in their true proportions the hopes anddangers of the present time. As yet we are hardly in the earliest dawn of humangreatness. But in the beauty of flower and sunset, in the happy and perfectmovement of young animals and in the delight of ten thousand various landscapes,we have some intimations of what life can do for us, and in some few works ofplastic and pictorial art, in some great music, in a few noble buildings andhappy gardens, we have an intimation of what the human will can do with materialpossibilities. We have dreams; we have at present undisciplined but everincreasing power. Can we doubt that presently our race will more than realizeour boldest imaginations, that it will achieve unity and peace, that it willlive, the children of our blood and lives will live, in a world made moresplendid and lovely than any palace or garden that we know, going on fromstrength to strength in an ever widening circle of adventure and achievement?What man has done, the little triumphs of his present state, and all thishistory we have told, form but the prelude to the things that man has got to do."}]
