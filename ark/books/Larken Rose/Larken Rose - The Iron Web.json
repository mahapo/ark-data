PART I image [../Images/image00252.jpeg] JESSICA Carlisle was shocked into consciousness when her radio came on suddenly,her dreams interrupted by a reporter’s phony voice in mid-sentence: “... intoits third week, with no apparent progress toward a peaceful resolution.” Herhand instinctively swung from under the covers, landing on the snooze button,returning her room to relative silence. For the next few minutes, the tiny hintof consciousness in Jessica’s mind struggled to achieve full wakefulness.“It’s your big day, Munchkin,” came her father’s voice from the hall, followedby a knock on her door. “Get a move on.”That’s right, I’m leaving on my trip today, Jessica thought, opening her eyes acrack. “I’m up, I’m up,” was her groggy reply, followed by a muttered, “sortof.” Her mind reviewed the morning agenda she had planned the night before:finish packing by 8:00, leave for the airport at 8:20, get there by 9:00, andmake it through all the checking in and boarding stuff in time for her flight toleave at 11:09. She fully opened her eyes to the familiar sight of her hamster,Brutus, in his cage next to her bed, doing his usual morning mad dash to nowhereon his little wheel. “Good morning, little beastie,” she said to him. “I’ll missyou. I’ll remind the retard again about feeding you.” Brutus continued runningas if she hadn’t spoken.She managed to throw off her covers, sit up and swing her feet off the bed ontothe floor. Her grogginess was falling away as her excitement rose. In a fewshort hours, she would be on her way to California to meet her cousin—therelatively sane member of a weird family—for their long-awaited camping tripnear Sequoia National Park. Jessica had never really been camping before, notwhat she would consider “real camping,” out in the wild without any facilities.But she’d slept outside and cooked outside before, and she didn’t squeal interror at the mere sight of a bug, like some of her school friends. She thoughtshe could probably survive four days and three nights in the wilderness, if aclearing in the woods three miles from a motel could be considered “wilderness.”She and her cousin Peggy were going to roam the area, getting lost on purpose,and then find their way back to camp using the GPS that her father had justgiven her for Christmas. Other than being a little worried about meeting a bearin the wild, she expected the trip to be easy enough. She knew that not many ofher friends would think of it as a great way to spend one’s nineteenth birthday,but it had sounded like a fun adventure to her.Her mom bustled in with a tray of breakfast, including toast, egg, and orangejuice. “Now hush up,” she said immediately, before Jessica could protest. “Iknow you stayed up too late last night and didn’t leave time in your schedulefor breakfast. But I want you to eat something. Just sit down for ten minutesand eat. What’s left to pack?”“Just my bathroom stuff, after I use it.” Jessica submitted gracefully to hermother’s will and picked up the glass of juice. She hated eating breakfast, butshe didn’t want to argue this morning.“We’ll get everything else into the car, then,” said her mom.Jessica forced down half of the breakfast and put the tray aside. On her way tothe bathroom, she stopped at her full-length mirror to survey herself. She’dshowered the night before, to save time in the morning, and let her hair dry inbed. What she saw now was a huge, unruly mass of wavy, dark brown hair, withbrown eyes barely peeking through, and a twisted tangle of baggy, red-and-whiteSnoopy pajamas. “Got some room for improvement, I think,” she muttered toherself, and hobbled toward the bathroom.It took Jessica twenty minutes to transform herself into the perfect picture ofa young American woman: the dark mass of hair tamed into sleek waves framing herslightly freckled face, and just enough makeup to accentuate her features. TheSnoopy pajamas were discarded on the bathroom floor in favor of blue jeans and apink sweater, which casually displayed the contours of a slender, athleticfigure.“The car’s warming up, Munchkin,” her father called up the stairs.Jessica threw on her fur-lined boots, hat, gloves, and coat, kissed her mother,grabbed her bag of bathroom stuff, and ran out to the car. All sleepiness wasgone now, swept away by the biting January wind and the excitement of flying toCalifornia. image [../Images/image00253.jpeg] JASON Reilly peered through the scope, the image gradually becoming more andmore steady, until the crosshairs rested solidly on the target: an empty .223casing sitting atop a cardboard box fifty yards away. Jason felt his heart rateand respiration slow, and steadily increased pressure on the trigger. He alwaysimagined the shot just as it should be, just before the gun fired. The quiet wasshattered, and his M16 jumped from the blast. When the scope steadied again, theshell was nowhere to be seen.“Holy smokes,” commented Miguel, a large, muscular man sitting in a foldingchair nearby, looking downrange through binoculars. “He actually did it.”“I could do that,” said a thinner man standing next to Miguel with his armscrossed, “if I had a few tries.” The second man’s name was Mark, but he wasgenerally called “Red” because of his curly heap of bright reddish-orange hair.Pale-skinned and freckled, he had the demeanor of a class clown with a streak ofarrogance.“From prone, with a bipod, maybe—if you had all day,” answered Miguel, loweringthe binoculars. “But Jay here just did it in one shot from kneeling. That’s someserious marksmanship.”“Yeah, but could you do that in the heat of battle?” Red asked, walking up toJason and giving him a thump on the back with a closed fist. “Could you do itwhen it really counts?”“Ow,” said Jason, flipping the safety on. “I hope I never have to.”Jason came from a long line of police officers, but he was the first in hisfamily to become a federal agent. Although three of his grandparents were Irish,he favored his Italian grandmother with his straight, jet-black hair and oliveskin. Some of his fellow agents had taken to calling him “pretty boy” because ofhis youthful good looks, especially the dark brown eyes framed by long, darklashes that girls envied. Now even his brothers were calling him that, whichannoyed him to no end.“Aw, where’s the fun in that?” Red joked. “What did you join the agency for,anyway, if not to take down some bad guys?”“Pay no attention to mercenary man here, Jay,” Miguel said. “He’s a littleoverly eager when it comes to the idea of gunning people down.”“Yeah, and you should be too, man! Those bastards killed one of our guys—blastedhis head clean off, I hear—with no warning! In this business, you hesitate, youdie, man!” Red aimed his own rifle downrange and peered through the scope.“Oh, like you’d know. You’ve been an agent for what, all of two weeks now?”Miguel joked. “My grandmother has more combat experience than you.” Jasoncracked a smile.“Yeah, well, now that we’re here in Graveston, all that is about to change,” Redsaid, looking down at his own rifle, and Jason thought he detected a hint ofnervousness on Red’s face. “Before you know it, we’ll be mixin’ it up with theterrorists, showin’ ‘em who’s boss.” For a moment, seeing the worry Red wastrying to hide, Jason considered offering a word of comfort to him, but decidedagainst it, doubting he would react well to it. Red’s tough-guy act was a bitoverdone and already wasn’t very convincing. With badly feigned confidence, Redlooked up and added, “I’m ready for whatever those wackos can dish out.” Hepulled the charging handle on his rifle back for dramatic effect, but let go toosoon, causing a round to jam.“Way to go, Rambo,” Miguel snickered, clipping his bipod to his rifle for histurn at the target. image [../Images/image00254.jpeg] BETSY Sharpe—whose real name was Martha, but no one called her that anymore—hadbeen working for Senator Collins for three years now. And even though GrantCollins was no longer merely a senator, but as of two months ago was also thePresident-elect, she still had a hard time fully believing it. Betsy had neverdared to ask if Senator Collins would continue to employ her when he becamepresident, and considering how much of his life she ran these days, it seemedvery strange to her that he had never brought it up either.She was keenly aware of the fact that Senator Collins was not married, and noteven romantically involved with anyone, as far as she knew. And she knew almosteverything about Grant Collins. She knew he always wanted a Grande Americanowith two sugars first thing in the morning, but after dinner, he would takecream instead of sugar. She knew that his waist was 39 inches, his height was 6feet, 3 inches, and he was 26 inches across from shoulder to shoulder. She knewthat his favorite dessert was crème brûlée. She knew that he had come toWashington to make a difference for the better. About the only thing about himshe didn’t know, and couldn’t figure out, was why this personable, intelligent,cultured, successful, and very handsome man was not romantically involved withanyone, and hadn’t been for as long as she had known him. A few times she hadcaught him watching her as she worked, but he had just looked away and laughed,as if his eyes had settled on her for no reason.Grant kept the relationship strictly professional, and Betsy had long ago givenup hope that their relationship might become romantic. He’s still looking forthe perfect woman, she thought. And he deserves the perfect woman. To Betsy, theperfect woman was tall, with sleek blond hair, long slender legs, and a faceboth sophisticated and beautiful. Betsy, on the other hand, was petite andvoluptuous. Her face was sweet and childlike. She didn’t think she fit the billat all.Having worked in Washington for several years now, she had met plenty ofpoliticians and other powerful people, but Senator Collins struck her asdifferent somehow. He was always courteous and kind to her, but never hit on herat all. She wasn’t sure if that was a good sign or a bad sign. But mostly, Grantseemed more decent, more real, than most of the people she had met in politics.“Betsy, can you come in here?” she heard his voice from the other room. “Seewhat you think of my rewrite of this one part.” She saved the file she had beenworking on and went to the door. As usual, there he was, looking like a blondKen doll in a business suit, a fact the media always had fun with. Betsy was 36,and though he was ten years her senior, he looked as young as she did.She was partly proud and partly embarrassed that she had somehow acquired thejob of being a sounding board for his speeches. She was hired as a secretary,something she was trained in and good at, but no matter how often she told himthat she didn’t feel at all qualified to judge or critique political speeches,the senator would always coax her into it again, assuring her that the opinionsof people who were not political junkies were what mattered. So she would giveher honest opinions, and he would always thank her.“Okay, here goes,” the senator began, as Betsy took her usual seat in hisoffice. “Blah, blah, blah,” he muttered, skimming his handwritten notes, “Whereis it? Okay.” He stood up straight, and his casual office demeanor instantlytransformed into his dignified senatorial persona.“There is no reason why we cannot, on the one hand, dispense justice fairly andcalmly, and on the other hand exhibit the firm resoluteness that this situationrequires. Balancing the rights of those accused of wrongdoing with theobligation to protect the public has always been a delicate thing. In manycases, a wait-and­see approach works well. But not here. Those of us who play bythe rules, the law-abiding taxpayers of this country, not only have a right tohave justice carried out swiftly and surely against those who openly thumb theirnoses at the rule of law, but we also have the right, especially in these timesof economic crisis, to not have our tax dollars wasted, day after day, on apolicy that amounts to softness on crime. With no end to this conflict in sight,the do-nothing approach of the present administration is an insult to theAmerican taxpayers in general, and to those in law enforcement in particular.Politicians should not allow political posturing to bind the hands of the menand women in uniform who are out there, putting themselves in harm’s way everyday, doing their best to protect the public. Every day that goes by withoutbringing these terrorists to justice is another day for the criminals to planand prepare for even more acts of violence and lawlessness. Rest assured, whenmy administration takes office, you will see justice done legally and fairly,but swiftly and surely.” Grant stopped and looked at Betsy, waiting for herreaction.“Sounds a little like you’re still campaigning,” Betsy said. She didn’t like tocriticize, but she had learned from experience that the senator could alwaystell when something was on her mind, and would eventually wheedle it out of heranyway. “You already won the election, remember?”“Oh, yeah,” he kidded, “I forgot.” He scribbled down a note on the paper he washolding.“What’s this one for, anyway?” Betsy asked.“Press conference in an hour,” he answered. “Sounds like the Prez fired whoeverwas in charge of the Graveston operation and brought in someone new—his usualattempt to save face. The new people he brings in will do exactly the same thinganyway, of course, but he likes having a never-ending supply of scapegoats.”Grant continued to skim over his notes. “I should include something about thevarious nasty things the terrorists have done recently.”“Like what?” asked Betsy.“Nothing new,” Grant answered, “but there’s been more of it in the last monththan ever before. Let’s see ... a bank robbery or two, a few assaults, hatecrimes, weapons violations, drug-running, counterfeiting.” He thought for amoment, scribbled another note, and then added, “threats against publicofficials.”“That last one might be more likely to win them sympathy,” Betsy said with asmile. Grant looked at her without a word, his face expressionless. “Sorry,couldn’t help myself,” she said, blushing. “Anyway,” she went on, trying tochange the subject, “how many of those were confirmed to be the work of the IronWeb? Wasn’t some of that speculation?”“Not everything’s been confirmed one hundred percent,” he commented casually.“But that doesn’t matter. The point is: they’re nasty and dangerous. People willforget the details anyway, but we need them to get that one point, and notforget it.” For a moment he paused, seeming lost in thought. “Nasty anddangerous,” he repeated for emphasis. “Oh, and that reminds me, be sure toinclude the name of David Singh as the powerful and persuasive leader of thenasties. Actually, put it as Dawud Singh, spelled D-A-W-U-D, thenon-Americanized version of his name, so he sounds more foreign. Oh, and let’sstart using the word ‘anarchist’ more often in what we put out. The ‘extremist’label is getting old. We need something fresher, like ‘anarchist cult’.”Betsy heard a knock at the door. She got up and walked back into her own office,where she found her friend Sandy standing in the doorway. Somehow Sandy hadgotten security clearance, months before, to come into the building whenever shewanted. Betsy had once wondered if it might be the senator’s doing, since Sandywas quite the looker, as well as being a hippie throwback who didn’t always weara lot of clothing. But allowing a security breach just to ogle a pretty womandidn’t seem like Grant’s style— though she could think of several others in thebuilding who would do just that. Maybe instead, Betsy thought, Sandy gotsecurity clearance because she was secretly a CIA asset. If so, it was the bestcover ever. Sandy was not at all bashful about saying what she thought aboutanyone who worked for the government, and it was always less than complimentary.Amazingly, Senator Collins never got angry about it; it even seemed to amuse hima bit.“Hey, Bet,” said Sandy. “I just wanted to stop by and make sure the slave-masterwasn’t going to ruin our lunch plans.” She leaned casually in the doorway intattered blue jeans, her long, straight black hair hanging loose over a low-cuttie-dyed shirt. Betsy glanced at the clock on the wall.“I think we’re still good,” said Betsy. “He’s got a press conference in an hour,and I think I can come right over from that. He told me I could have a fewhours.”“Great,” said Sandy. “I’ll leave you to labor for this oppressive regime while Ipick up Vee from preschool and start cooking.” Betsy said nothing, but wishedher friend would say such things a bit more quietly.“Yes, Betsy,” came Grant’s voice from the other office, “the slave-master saysyou can go.” Betsy cringed. image [../Images/image00255.jpeg] JESSICA Carlisle stood, her arms crossed, looking annoyed as an overweight,pale-faced, red-haired TSA agent clumsily sifted through her belongings. Therereally ought to be a law against super-dweebs rummaging through girls’ stuff,she thought. The kid looked clueless and nervous. Jessica was about to turnnineteen, and she couldn’t imagine this guy being much older than she was. Sothis is who’s guarding the world from terrorists? God help us, she thought.“What’s this?” he asked, holding up a small plastic bottle.“It’s shampoo and conditioner,” Jessica answered, wishing the guy would get hisgrubby hands out of her personal things. She was glad she had at least thoughtto take out the maxi-pads before leaving home. Mother Nature had been niceenough to spare her that necessity for this trip.“It’s not allowed,” the boy said flatly, setting the bottle on a table behindhim and returning his attention back to the purse.“Not allowed? It’s freaking shampoo,” Jessica answered, a little more loudlythan she intended.“It’s on the list of items that aren’t allowed on flights. You should have readthe signs about what you can bring with you,” he said, trying to soundauthoritative.“You’re scared I might hijack a plane with a bottle of shampoo?”“We don’t know that it is shampoo,” he answered. Another TSA agent, this one anoverweight, middle-aged black woman, had come over to watch, and stood silently,her arms crossed, looking disapprovingly at Jessica.“Right. It’s really anthrax juice,” she said sarcastically. “I don’t exactly fitthe profile of a terrorist, do I?” She stood with hands on hips, dark waves ofhair falling over her bright pink turtleneck sweater.“Look, I know you’re kidding, but you’d better be careful what you joke about,”the kid said, lowering his voice a bit. “We’re supposed to report anyone whomakes any sort of inappropriate comments.”“Anyone who makes what?” Jessica bit her tongue. “Fine, just do what you have todo, swipe whatever you want, and let me get on the stupid plane.” For a moment,Jessica thought she saw a hurt look on the guy’s face. It wasn’t hard to guessthat the uniform was about the only thing that made this loser feel important,and getting barked at by a pretty girl probably didn’t help.“I’m just doing my job,” he said in a whiny tone.“Yeah, I know,” she answered more pleasantly. “Well, whoever makes the rules isan idiot.” He handed her her bag and her shoes. “Have a nice day,” she said,trying to sound sincere as she sat down to put her shoes back on. She glanced atthe black woman, who was still watching her with a disgruntled expression. “Nicefriendly service,” Jessica muttered to herself, and got up and walked away.As she headed down the corridor she looked out the huge windows of thePhiladelphia airport and saw the plane that would be taking her away toCalifornia for her big adventure. She couldn’t decide which she was more excitedabout: the trip itself, or getting away from everything and everyone in herpredictable life, even if just for a few days. image [../Images/image00253.jpeg] JASON Reilly’s commanding officer, Gerald Bridges, strode into the room, a bunchof papers in his hand. “All right, quiet down,” he said. “A lot of this will beold news to most of you, but it doesn’t hurt to go over it again.” Bridges wasaround fifty, Jason guessed; a black man with graying hair, but a solid physiqueand a commanding presence. He pulled down an overhead map over the chalkboard,which showed a few hand-drawn lines superimposed on a satellite photo of thesurrounding area.The Graveston Primary School had let them use the room for the day, after acommunication mix-up had delayed the arrival of some of their own trailers.“Here’s us,” Bridges said, pointing to the right side of the map. “This roadwe’re on pretty neatly cuts off this entire area,” he explained, indicating thebulge of land inside the river bend to the west. “The river is wide and fast,and we doubt anyone will be trying to cross it. If they do, we have temporarywatchtowers set up here and here,” he said, pointing to two points on the farside of the river. “The other side of the river is all open fields, with nowhereto hide. Between us and the river, it’s a little unclear just what we’re dealingwith. There are at least five buildings in the area, mostly log cabins, mostlyin the open. There may be a couple more in these wooded areas,” he said,pointing to several blotches of green on the map. “We can’t tell from thesatellite images. Now let’s be clear about this. There are several differentproperties in the area, and not all the owners are members of the Iron Webgroup. Not everyone in there is necessarily a suspect.”“Do we even know who all is in there?” asked Miguel, casually leaning back inhis chair.“No,” said Bridges flatly. “We know a few for sure, and we suspect a few more.Some of these cabins are vacation homes.They could be packed with Iron Web people right now, or there could be people inthere who have nothing at all to do with them. Some of the buildings might evenbe empty. We do know that one of the cabins belongs to David Singh, and that heis there now. The major objective is to get him and the other known lawbreakersinto custody without hurting any innocent people.”Jason spoke up. “Are there hostages?”“So far we’ve seen nothing to indicate that,” Bridges replied, “but of course wewill approach the situation as if that’s a possibility. I wouldn’t put it pastthese people to hide behind their own kids, using them as shields. It wouldn’tbe the first time.”“Have they said anything about kids?” Jason inquired.“Not specifically, but even nutcases know how to reproduce,” Bridges said,bringing chuckles from several agents, “so it’s a definite possibility. Again,we don’t know who all is in there. We’re not even sure which of the buildings istheir headquarters. There may be an underground bunker we can’t see, and itcould be full of armed people. On the other hand, there could be kids orinnocent people who need to be rescued. One of the main things we’re trying tofind out with the satellite images, the planes with cameras, and the spotters onthe ground, is what exactly we’re dealing with here. Until we’re fairly certainwho’s who in there and what the situation is, our instructions are mostly tojust sit it out.”“What’s the overall size of this Iron Web thing?” Red asked. “I mean, it’sspread out all over the country now, right?”“I gotta say, sir,” Jason added, before Bridges could answer, “the info I’veseen about this group has been pretty sketchy. I know the FBI has been watchingthem for some time, but even they don’t seem to know how many there are.”“It’s hard to tell,” answered Bridges, “mainly because this isn’t like the KKKor something, where being a member is a big deal and there are lists ofnames—stuff like that. If someone agrees with the teachings of this group, who’sto say if he’s a member or not? I’ll tell you this: based on the internettraffic the FBI has been monitoring, they have a lot more supporters than we’dlike. At this point, it’s in the tens of thousands. Then again, any kid can goonline and say ʻthe government sucks.’ Usually it’s just words. The number ofpeople who would do the kinds of things the group talks about, I mean theviolence and open lawlessness, is a lot lower than the number of people whomight anonymously sympathize with them. And that brings up another importantpoint here. A fair number of the people who live around here, even outside ofthis area, are somewhat sympathetic to these guys. I don’t expect it to be aproblem, but keep it in mind. It seems that a bunch of like-minded people weregoing around buying up properties in this county, one at a time, trying to maketheir own little wacko kingdom here. And in the last election, the guy they putup for sheriff almost won. If that had happened, this would be a lot harder.”“Don’t take this the wrong way, boss,” Miguel said, “but what are we even doinghere? I mean, this standoff stuff sounds more like FBI business. How is thisstill ATF jurisdiction?”Bridges frowned. “I can’t seem to get a straight answer to that myself. There’spolitical stuff going on, and I don’t pretend to understand it all. For the mostpart, this is the FBI’s game now, though Homeland Security is overseeing a lotof it. They’ve only got about as many agents here as we do, but at the momentwe’re just here to assist, and to deal with whatever weapons are found once thesituation is under control.”“Well, we still have the search warrant to serve, right?” asked Red.“Technically, no,” answered Bridges. “The original search warrant is now void.The window for serving it ran out a long time ago. Of course, once we think wecan get in without getting shot at, we’ll get another one.” He saw Jason raisehis hand, and pointed to him. “Jason?”“Any hint yet that they might be willing to come out at some point?”“Negotiations are ongoing, but from what I’ve heard, it sounds unlikely,” saidBridges. “You gotta remember, these people don’t believe in law. They make theirown rules and they don’t care what the rest of the world thinks about it. Ifthey feel like killing someone, like they killed the agent serving the searchwarrant the first time, then they do it. Government, law and order,civilization—they don’t respect any of it. They just do whatever they want—theirso-called philosophy isn’t any more complicated than that. They’re not likely togo along with any deal. Even if they agreed to anything, I wouldn’t trust themto do what they promise anyway.”“So, what are we waiting around for?” Red demanded.“Sorry to disappoint you, Red, but the higher-ups want this solved without ashootout,” Bridges replied. “We don’t want another Waco here. So we bide ourtime, keep our eyes and ears open, and wait for further instructions. That’sall.”The feeling of a vague menace just out of sight beyond the nearby hills madeJason uneasy. They didn’t even know what they were dealing with, who thesepeople were, how many there were, what weapons they might have, and what theymight be capable of. And at the moment, Jason didn’t think that sitting aroundwaiting was going to make him feel any better about the situation. But for thetime being, it seemed there wasn’t anything else to be done. image [../Images/image00254.jpeg] BETSY knocked on the door of Sandy’s apartment, heard the approach of smallfootsteps, and the door opened just a crack. “Who goes there?” came a smallvoice from inside, and a sliver of the angelic little face of Veronica, Sandy’sfive-year-old daughter, peeked out. “Aunt Betsy!” she exclaimed. The doorclosed, there was the sound of a chain being undone, and then the door swungwide open.Betsy stepped in and picked up the child, wondering how much longer she’d beable to do that. Then she looked at her little grinning face with mock surprise.“Who let this rodent in here? Out you go,” she said, swinging the child in thedirection of the door. The little girl let out an ear-shattering squeal ofdelight. “I’m not a rodent! I’m Veronica!” she screamed.“She never gets tired of that one, does she?” came Sandy’s voice from thedirection of the kitchen. Then she appeared, holding a large spoon. “The slopneeds about five more minutes. Take off your coat and wash up.”“Your slop is the best,” Betsy commented, putting Veronica down and closing thedoor behind her. “You’re the best cook I know, in fact. I don’t know how Carlosever let you get away.”“Well, he didn’t exactly let me get away,” said Sandy, walking back into thekitchen. “It didn’t quite take a restraining order against him, but it wasclose.”Betsy hung up her coat. “Aw, he wasn’t that bad, Sandy. He was nice. And I thinkhe really loved you. You don’t give anyone a fighting chance.”“Almost lunchtime, Vee,” Sandy said loudly, after her daughter had run offsomewhere. “Make sure you quick go find some dirt to roll around in.” Then, in alower voice, she added, “He was too much of a deadbeat. I don’t need to besupporting three people. Not nearly as bad as Vee’s dad, though.”The approaching pitter-patter of feet ended that discussion. Betsy could hardlyremember all of Sandy’s long line of boyfriends, stretching back to theirteenage years. The abusive one, the drug addict, the womanizer, and then somewho were really decent guys. But more often than not, they were obsessed withSandy, and just wouldn’t go away when she was fed up with them. She seemed toattract that type. And it didn’t work well, because Sandy didn’t work onrelationships. She did exactly what she felt like doing.“What’s for lunch?” Veronica asked eagerly.“Mud and worms,” Sandy answered matter-of-factly.“Spaghetti!” Veronica screeched with glee.“Hook up a generator to that thing, and the world’s energy crisis is solved,”Betsy commented as the two women walked back to the kitchen.“Did you just call my lovely daughter ‘that thing’?” asked Sandy with a show ofdismay.“I sure did,” answered Betsy, leaning against the doorway, watching Sandy cook.“She’s a beautiful thing. Hey, Vee,” she said, taking the little girl’s hand.“Shall we go wash up together?”They did, and then Betsy returned to her place in the doorway. “So, how’s life?”she asked Sandy.“Yeah, it’s been a whole, what, three days since you’ve been here?”“Yeah, it’s crazy. I thought campaigning was the worst, but this president-electstuff is crazy, too. Seems like we’re working every day, all day. And sometimesall night.”“Oh, really? Doing what?” Sandy asked facetiously, raising one eyebrow. “Nevermind, it’s better if I don’t know.”“Oh, get your mind out of the gutter. It’s not what you’re thinking,” saidBetsy, and then quietly added, “unfortunately.”“Oh, man, Bet,” said Sandy. “You’ve really fallen for Mr. Emperor, haven’t you?”“Well, yeah, I guess,” Betsy answered, a bit hesitantly. “But I’m sure nothing’sgoing to come of it.”“That’s a good thing, believe me. You don’t want to end up married to one ofthose power-happy slimeballs.”“Sandy!” Betsy protested, but with a small giggle. “Why can’t you even considerthe possibility that Grant is a good guy?”“Oh, now it’s ‘Grant’?” Sandy responded, tasting the bubbling sauce. “Not‘Senator Collins’ anymore? But I’ll tell you why. It’s because of what theydo—what they all do.”“Who says one of them can’t be different?” Betsy objected.“I’m not talking about personality, I’m talking about the job. What do they doday in and day out? They take money from everyone else, whether we like it ornot, and whether we can afford it or not, and then they give it away howeverthey want, whether to lazy people to buy their votes, or to huge corporations toget their campaign contributions. And then they take credit for beingcompassionate and generous. The whole game is nothing but a fraud. They’re justa bunch of con men ripping people off.”“Well, I’m not thrilled with a lot of what they do, but don’t you think thatsome of it is necessary? Some of the programs actually do some good.”“That’s debatable, but even if it were true, that doesn’t make it okay,” Sandysaid. “If I steal your purse and give a hundred bucks of your money to somehomeless guy, is that a good thing?”“Well, it’s good for the homeless guy, but the stealing isn’t good.”“Exactly. That’s exactly my point,” Sandy said emphatically. She sprinkled insome spices, stirred for a few minutes, and tasted the sauce again. “Thegovernment shouldn’t be robbing us, even to do good stuff, especially those ofus struggling to make ends meet, which is almost everyone these days. Charityhas to be voluntary, or it’s not charity,” she added, “and government is nevervoluntary. Ergo, no government program or handout can ever be good.”“This coming from the girl who was a devout communist back in college,” Betsyremarked. “I agree, charity has to be voluntary, but don’t you think that peopleare entitled to something just because they’re people? What about the people whofall through the cracks of private charities? What about people that nobodywants to help?”“When I was a good little commie, that’s exactly how I thought,” said Sandy asshe poured the sauce over the pasta. “But we didn’t really think things throughall the way. We used to stay up half the night discussing the greatness of theidea, and trying to figure out why it wasn’t working in the real world. But wedidn’t really want to know, because it felt good to be part of a radicalmovement, and we didn’t want to let go of it. We didn’t want to look too hard atwhat we were actually advocating, which happened to be massive authoritarianviolence disguised as compassion, and happened to be almost exactly the same asthe system we were protesting.”“So now you’re Miss Capitalist instead?” Betsy mocked.Sandy laughed. “Not quite. I guess you’d call me a libertarian, although youknow I don’t like labels.” She was quiet for a moment, thinking and stirring.Then she went on, “You know I gave up on political philosophy for a long time.When I figured out that liberals were just as authoritarian as conservatives, Ididn’t feel like I fit anywhere in the picture. But you know me. I’m all about‘live and let live.’ What I didn’t realize back in college was that no party, noadministration, no government will ever be for that. Whichever group isn’t inpower whines about how rotten the one in power is. But if you give the power tothe other one, a week later they’ll be just as bad.” She took her seat at thetable. “‘Left’ and ‘right’ are completely meaningless to me. There is freedom,or there is tyranny. All the other political garbage you hear, including fromyour boss, is meaningless bullshit.”Just then Veronica appeared in the doorway. “That’s a dollar!” she shoutedhappily.“Dang it!” Sandy said. “No fair sneaking up on me.”Betsy cracked up. “You pay her a buck every time you swear? When did thatstart?”“Yeah, about a week ago. It’s straightening me out a bit, and she’s already gother college fund.”“Yeah, I’ll bet,” Betsy said, tousling the child’s golden curls. “Look,” shewent on, “I agree with a lot of what you say, but if that’s all true, we’ve gotto change things somehow. And I still think Grant is a good guy. I think hemeans well, even if I don’t like everything he proposes. I mean, I have to dealwith a lot of senators, lobbyists, and the rest of the circus. For most of them,I agree completely that they’re nothing but conniving crooks. It’s all posturingand persuasion, to see what they can get for themselves. But Grant, he justisn’t like that, not really.”“I wonder if you’d still say that if you didn’t have the hots for him,” Sandysaid, beginning to dish out the spaghetti.Betsy was too exhausted to feign indignation. “Yeah, well, he’ll be in the WhiteHouse soon, and I doubt he’ll be taking me with him, much less gettingromantically involved with me. I’m just not first lady material.”“Well, let’s have some spaghetti and forget about him for a while,” suggestedSandy. image [../Images/image00255.jpeg] JESSICA Carlisle woke up, pushed her long hair away from her face, and tried toguess how long she had been asleep. The constant, steady hum of the jet enginesdroned on, reminding her that she was still on a plane. It had been many yearssince she had flown. She barely remembered it at all, having been just a kid atthe time. That was back before it was a crime to bring shampoo onto an airliner,she thought to herself.She gazed out the window. What looked like farmland with scattered patches ofwoods was barely visible through a thin sheet of clouds below her. Still halfasleep, her eyes followed what she thought was a soaring bird, until sherealized it was another plane, far below hers but still above the wispy clouds.She had almost no depth perception of such huge distances up here. She wonderedwho might be on that tiny little speck, and where they might be going.She thought of the days when people had to cross all this with horse and wagon.Now a person could nap for a few hours and wake up a thousand miles away. Itsure made things easier, but somehow it also made the world seem less exciting.There weren’t enough unknowns anymore; not enough undiscovered wonders.Some of her friends could not understand her desire to go camping in thewilderness when she could afford a “real vacation.” They thought camping was forpoor people who couldn’t afford Europe or the Bahamas. One of her friends hadlaughed and said, “but Jess, what if you chip a fingernail?” Jessica chafedunder that “pampered rich kid” image they seemed to have of her. But it was truethat she’d never had any real hardship in her life, and pretty much goteverything she wanted.Jessica wanted to experience life without all the stuff around her—just her andnature. Her cousins, the weird family, spent a lot of time camping, hiking,horseback riding, and even hunting. Jessica didn’t approve of hunting, but asidefrom that, their family seemed to have something that others didn’t. They didn’tdepend on civilization so much. Maybe that was what she wanted. To know that shecould get along without all the trappings. At least this might make her friendsstop kidding her so often about being a spoiled rich kid. Her family wasn’t allthat rich, anyway. Her dad had worked really hard to become a fairly successfulbusinessman. But these days, she pondered, with the economy sinking lower monthby month, if you weren’t about to lose your house, you were considered rich.One of her best friends had had to leave the private school they had attended inher senior year, because her parents couldn’t afford it anymore. The folks ofanother friend from her neighborhood had lost their home and moved into a tinylittle apartment miles away. It seemed to Jessica that things kept going frombad to worse for most people, and she felt more than a little guilty that sheseemed to be one of the few who so far hadn’t suffered much because of it.She gazed out the window, wondering how many of the people she knew could evenafford an airline ticket anymore. Still in a daze, Jessica scanned the blue sky,and her eyes rested on the far-off vapor trail of another plane. Her eyes lazilyfollowed it as it drifted slowly closer. Had her dad been there, she thoughtabsent-mindedly, he probably could have already told her the make and model ofthe plane, even though it was barely more than a dot. She couldn’t understandwhy anyone would want to know that much trivia about one subject, but her dadwas the king of airplane buffs.As her eyes followed the small moving shape, suddenly something about it didn’tseem right. In an instant Jessica was fully awake from her daydreaming, her eyeswide. It wasn’t an airplane. What before had looked like a distant, slowlydrifting airliner was now a gigantic wingless bullet approaching at horrifyingspeed. Her mind raced to find some non-threatening explanation for what she wasseeing, but couldn’t. Was that a missile?! She found no words, and couldn’t evenmanage a scream, in the time it took to watch the glistening object streaktoward the front of the plane.She was in the second-to-last row, and had a clear view all the way down thefuselage. There was only a split second between when she lost sight of theobject from her window and when a ball of blinding yellow light appeared, insidethe plane, many rows ahead of her, accompanied by what could only be describedas a “thump.” It didn’t sound like an explosion, because the shock wave hadincapacitated her eardrums. She didn’t flinch, or duck, or scream. It was toounreal to respond to at all. The orange fireball rolled down the fuselage towardher, engulfing everything in a fraction of a second. It couldn’t be real. Itwasn’t possible. The last thing Jessica saw was the upper half of an elderlywoman, eyes and mouth wide open, flying through the air toward her at a hundredmiles an hour. image [../Images/image00253.jpeg] JASON Reilly was just zipping up his pants, stepping out of the little bathroomin one of the ATF trailers, when he heard the sound: a distant boom that didn’tsound like any ordnance he could think of. He ran outside into the brightsunlight, grabbing his rifle which he had left leaning against the front of thetrailer, and looked around frantically. It took only a moment to notice four orfive other agents looking up into the sky, their hands shielding their eyes fromthe sun.Looking almost straight up, he could see a bright light—though he couldn’t tellwhether it was reflection or fire that he was seeing. He squinted, and severaljagged shapes took form, none of them recognizable. After a few seconds herealized, by the increasing size of the objects, that whatever they were, theywere not flying, but falling. And they were directly overhead.Finally he could make out what had to be the fuselage of a large passengerplane. The entire front end of the plane was missing, and half the left sidewall was gone. Half of the left wing was also missing, and what was left of itwas on fire. The plane rolled as it tumbled, seemingly in slow motion.Panic suddenly set in as Jason became convinced that the plane was going to landright on top of them. He froze, unsure of which way to run. The vast size of theplane, as damaged as it was, made the thing seem to lumber slowly along. It wasdirectly overhead, but now Jason could see that it was still moving horizontallyas well as downward, from the momentum it still had from its former path. As itrolled again, now only a hundred yards above him, Jason watched with horror ashe saw three lifeless bodies, one of which seemed to be missing some limbs, fallout of the hole in the fuselage.Still frozen where he stood, unable to believe that what he was seeing was real,Jason watched what was left of the spinning plane careen directly toward thecabins on the other side of the hills. As it dropped out of sight, it must havecaught the wind for a moment, because the nose end—though the nose itself wasgone—lifted up, as if coming in for a landing. Then the plane rolled onto itsback and was gone. Three seconds later, the deep rumble of the impact shook theground around him.A business jacket, smoking a bit, fluttered to the ground at Jason’s feet.Looking up again, he could see an assortment of papers and effects drifting downfrom the otherwise clear sky. What on earth had happened? What had he justwitnessed?“Snap out of it,” he heard Bridges yelling. “Miguel, get D.C. on the radio,right now. Red! Jason! Find the bodies that fell over there behind that grove oftrees. I think there were three. No one crosses the barricade line. I don’t knowwhat the hell just happened, but I want you all alert and ready for anything.Johnson, get on the phone and get the local fire and ambulance out here.”Still in a surreal daze, as Bridges continued to bark out orders to others,Jason set off at a jog, Red ahead by a hundred feet or so, toward where hethought the bodies would have landed. He didn’t want to imagine what they mightlook like when they found them. image [../Images/image00254.jpeg] BETSY Sharpe was back in the office after a relaxing visit with Sandy. She satin her usual chair in Grant’s office, legs crossed and hands neatly folded onher knees, ready to listen intently to a draft of Grant’s next press release. Hewas still looking at his notes and thinking, so Betsy gazed out the window atthe overcast sky and the lights of Washington twinkling below. His office had anice view. Thank goodness the days are getting longer now instead of shorter,she thought. She disliked going home from work in the dark.“Let’s see. Okay, let’s start here,” Grant decided, and cleared his throat. “Thecriminals today are often better equipped than our brave men and women in lawenforcement, and that in itself is a crime. I believe it is the responsibilityof those who hold public office, both to make sure our police have the resourcesand equipment they need to do what they do, and to make sure the criminals donot have the resources and equipment they need to do what they do. There is noreason why—”The door swung open with a slam, and Betsy and Grant both spun around to see ayoung man at the door, breathless. “Turn on the news,” he panted. “Something hashappened in Graveston.”Betsy jumped up, almost falling over her chair, and turned on the largetelevision recessed into the wall. The news was already on.The well-dressed, handsome male reporter was speaking without emotion. “—assumethere were no survivors. The flight originated in Philadelphia, with a stop inChicago, and was on its way to California when the event occurred. White Housesources say, based on intelligence gathered so far, that they believe this maybe the doing of the group calling itself the Iron Web—a domestic terroristorganization which, until now, has been considered by Homeland Security to be arelatively minor threat.” Next to the reporter appeared a high-altitude aerialview of unidentifiable, smoking wreckage. “Authorities say they have been unableto reach the crash site so far, as it is inside the area affected by the ongoingstandoff between federal authorities and members of the Iron Web group. Butagain, there are not expected to be any survivors.”Grant turned off the television. “Get the director of the FBI on the line,” heordered. “I want to know what they know, not just what they’re telling thepress.” Betsy was still in shock. There hadn’t been any significant terroristattacks in the country since 2001, but the image of that demolished planebrought back all of the memories. Had the plane been headed for some othertarget, like downtown Los Angeles? Had it been shot down? Were there still otherplanes, heading toward other targets around the country? At that moment, Betsywanted to be anywhere other than in Washington, D.C. “Betsy!” Grant’s voicesnapped her out of her trance.“Director of the FBI, right,” she said, hurrying to her desk and reaching forthe phone.PART II image [../Images/image00255.jpeg] JESSICA was conscious of the pain before she was conscious of anything else.Some delayed survival instinct, combined with the memory of the last thing shehad seen, made her tense up, causing an agonizing bolt of pain to shoot up herleft leg. She heard a faint whimper, and realized it was her own voice. Her mindraced to determine her situation. Was she still on the plane? Had the plane hitthe ground yet? She couldn’t see a thing. Was she blind? Was she dead?A light broke through her frantic thoughts, and the real world slowly came intofocus. She was in a dark room, and there, silhouetted in an open doorway, wasthe outline of a stocky man. “She’s awake,” the figure said. He started towardher, then halted, as if in indecision. “Don’t be afraid,” he said. “You’re okay.Well, not exactly okay, but you’ll live.” After a quiet pause, the figure movedcautiously closer. “Can you hear me?” The voice was low and soft. Jessica triedto answer, but couldn’t.Another figure stepped into the doorway: an elderly woman, her gray hair up in abun, dressed in an old-fashioned green print dress and holding a lantern. As shecame closer, Jessica could just make out her wrinkled but smiling, kindly facein the lamplight. “Just relax, dear. You’re probably still in shock.” The oldlady sat down next to the bed and put her hands on Jessica’s. “If you can’t talkor move yet, don’t worry. You’re going to be fine. You just relax.”Jessica tried to ask what had happened, but the only word to escape her lips wasa raspy, “Plane?” The voice didn’t even sound like her own. Her eyes teared upfor a moment, suddenly recalling, all too vividly, the horrible sight of thatmicrosecond of carnage just before she had blacked out. How could anyone havesurvived that?“Terrible, terrible thing,” the man said. She could see his face now. He wasold, with gray hair, mustache, and beard. The lines on his face evidenced alifetime of smiles and laughter, but he wore no smile now. The eyes behind hisround glasses were friendly and comforting. He reminded Jessica of some fatherlycharacter from a movie that she couldn’t remember. “It just came crashing downall around,” he continued, “and—” he stopped short. “Were you alone on theplane?” What an odd question, she thought. “I mean, were you with anyone?” Thenshe realized what he was getting at, and shook her head. Was she the onlysurvivor? “Well, don’t think about it now,” he added quickly, attempting asmile. “You’re pretty banged up, but my sister here, this is Heather, she’s anurse, and she tells me that the parts that matter came out okay.”Heather laughed softly. “What he means, dear, is that your back is fine, andthere’s no sign of any serious internal damage. And of course, your lovely facewill be just fine in a day or two.”As she spoke, she lit two candles by the bedside, and Jessica could finally seethat she was lying in a big, old-fashioned four-poster bed under a huge quilt.“You did a real number on one of your ankles, but I don’t think it’s broken. Youmight have some cracked ribs; it’s hard to tell. Other than that, and a fairnumber of scratches and bruises, you seem to be in one piece.” Heather shook herhead. “I would never have believed anyone could live through that. Anhonest-to-goodness miracle, if you ask me.”Jessica had seen the explosion, but had been unconscious for the fall. How manythousands of feet was it? How could anyone have survived that? Yet here she was.Then Jessica had another thought. Why was she here, in what looked like a logcabin, and not in a hospital?“If you feel up to it,” the old woman continued, “you really should eatsomething now. We’ve kept you hydrated pretty well, but you haven’t eaten foralmost two days.” She had been unconscious for that long? Only then did Jessicanotice how famished she was. She nodded weakly, and Heather left the room.“My name is Benjamin Frank—you can call me Ben—and this little cabin is myhome,” the elderly man said. Then he looked down and furrowed his brow a bit.“You’re probably wondering why you’re still here, and not in a hospital.” Herubbed his short beard. “I’m afraid there’s something you need to know.”Jessica just looked at him, too weak to ask a question. “Like I was saying,” Bencontinued, “you made it through the crash in one piece, but I’m afraid yourordeal isn’t quite over. You picked a really bad spot to have a plane crash.” Hegave her a wry smile. “I suppose you’ve heard of the whole mess with the IronWeb thing and all, and the standoff with the government?” Jessica nodded. “Well,that whole mess is smack dab between my property and the rest of civilization.”Jessica’s eyes widened. She’d never had a clear picture of where exactly thestandoff was, and in fact hadn’t paid much attention to the story at all.Suddenly it wasn’t just a five-second snippet on the news; it was for real. Itoccurred to her that, had her luck been just a little bit worse, she could havelanded right inside the terrorists’ compound. What would have happened to herthen? She didn’t even want to think about it.“We’re on a sort of peninsula, in a wide bend in the river,” said Ben, “and theonly way out of here is right through the area where all the trouble is. Wehaven’t dared to go out since the thing started.”“Are we safe h-here?” Jessica managed to ask, her voice still raspy. “I mean,how far away are the terrorists?” She looked around the room, as if expectingheavily armed extremists to appear at any moment. Were they miles away, or yardsaway?“We’re fine here,” replied Ben in a soothing voice, patting Jessica’s hand.“Nothing has been happening for weeks now. All the same, we’ve stayed here thewhole time. We’ve got plenty of food stored up, so you don’t need to worry aboutthat. Unfortunately, we’ve lost all communications. The phone lines have beencut, as well as the electric lines. One of my neighbors has a cell phone, butthere’s no reception in this area.”“My folks,” Jessica remembered frantically. “Do they know? Do they know I’malive?”“For now, we have no way to communicate anything to the outside world,” Bensaid, shaking his head sadly. Seeing the anguish on her face, he added, “I’llsee what I can do.”How could this be happening? Jessica thought. Ben hadn’t really answered herquestion: exactly where were the terrorists? How far away were they, and werethey likely to come this way? They must have been the ones who shot down theplane. Wouldn’t they be likely to come and examine the wreckage? Wasn’t theresome other way for her to get out of here? She wondered if she could even walk.And if they did show up at the cabin, what would happen then? She wondered for amoment if Ben had a gun, but then decided that even if he did, he certainlycouldn’t hold off an entire group of violent terrorists. And how many of themwere there? How could Ben be so sure that they were safe here, or was he justsaying that to try to keep her from worrying?The old lady bustled back into the room with a tray. The smell of chicken soupmade Jessica’s mouth water. “Here you go,” Heather said cheerfully. “It’s alittle cliché, I know, but chicken soup really is about the best medicine youcould get right now.” Jessica eagerly tried to sit up, but a jolt of pain fromher leg made her gasp. Heather put the tray down on a small table and went tohelp her. Jessica tried again more slowly, and Heather propped her up with somepillows and set the tray across her lap. Jessica carefully took a spoonful ofsoup and felt the warmth of it diffuse through her body. At that moment, itseemed like the best thing she’d ever tasted. image [../Images/image00253.jpeg] JASON Reilly listened quietly as his fellow agents talked. “I can’t believe theystill won’t let us go in,” Red barked, practically frothing at the mouth. “Weget to go pick up the pieces of the people they killed, but we can’t go in andget the guys who did it?” Jason remembered the images of the bodies they hadrecovered that had fallen out of the plane. Two were intact, but the third wasbadly mangled, with a face that hardly looked as if it could ever have beenhuman. The image, which he tried in vain to force out of his mind, filled himwith horror and anger. He understood Red’s frustration.After the news reports hit, more agents were brought in, both FBI and ATF, andmore trailers were set up, but still they were not allowed to go in. Agentspaced like caged tigers, enraged at the mass murder that had happened beforetheir very eyes, and at their inability to carry out some righteous retribution.Their hopes rose when two Bradley armored vehicles were brought in, but theBradleys were just parked alongside the road.Jason and Red were admiring the Bradleys when Agent Bridges came striding up andsaid, “Jason, Red, got a job for you.”“What is it?” Red asked.“Get in the car,” said Bridges, “I’ll brief you on the way.” They followedBridges to a large black SUV.“Are we going in?” Red asked with an eager smile on his face.“Yeah, the three of us are storming the compound, right now,” Bridges said,watching Red for a reaction. “No, dumb-ass. We’re visiting a neighbor, see if heknows anything.” Jason climbed in the back as Bridges and Red got in the front.“What kind of neighbor: friendly or hostile?” Jason asked.“The guy is one of those militia nuts,” Bridges answered, “so don’t expect awarm welcome. But the file says he’s all talk. He’s got a bunch of guns, but wedon’t expect any trouble.”“Hey, I’m ready for all the trouble he can dish out,” Red said, holding up theMP5 he was carrying.“Look, Rambo,” Bridges said sternly, “he’s not gonna like us to begin with, sojust shut up and let me do the talking. You two are there for decoration, that’sall. Keep your mouth shut, and maybe you’ll learn something.”Jason looked out the window at rolling fields of long, dry grass, punctuated byclumps of low, scrubby evergreens. Mountains rose in the distance.“I pictured this place as nothing but sand and cactuses,” Jason commented. He’dnever been to Arizona before, and he’d imagined it as one big desert. “I didn’texpect there to be any woods here.”“Well, live and learn,” Bridges responded.Jason remembered his mom telling him that if he brought back some pine nuts, shewould make him some pesto. He wondered which trees the pine nuts came from, andif they were in season now. Jason held on as the SUV bumped on the unpaved road.No wonder all these people drive pickups, he thought. They turned onto a longdriveway which passed through a grove of low pine trees and out into a clearing,in the middle of which stood a cabin. Shingles were sliding off the roof, and ametal pole held up one corner of the front porch.“Wow, classic redneck pad,” commented Red derisively. “Why is it the paranoidkooks always live in these dumps?”“I’d be pretty pissed at the world if that was my house,” Jason said.Bridges chuckled. “Yeah, well, let’s hope he’s in a good mood.”The car stopped, and the three got out. There was only the one small cabin inthe clearing, and beyond that, a small structure which Jason assumed was anouthouse. A forties-style pickup truck, which seemed to be more rust than metal,stood next to the cabin, sporting a gun rack. As they scanned the area, Redassumed a combat pose.“Lower your damn gun,” Bridges barked at him. “If you walk up there like that,he might just blow your damn head off.”The three of them walked up to the cabin and onto the front porch, which saggeda little under their weight. Bridges knocked on the door. It opened immediately,but only a few inches. Jason guessed that whoever it was had heard them comingand had been waiting by the door, probably armed. He tried to look as relaxedand friendly as possible, so as to avoid being shot.“Yeah?” came a gruff voice from inside.“Mr. Samuels?” Bridges inquired, in his deep, official-sounding voice.“Who wants to know?” responded the voice, in a less-than­friendly tone.“I’m Special Agent Gerald Bridges, from the ATF, and I’d like to ask you somequestions.”“About what?” snapped the voice.“About some of your neighbors, and the group calling itself the Iron Web.”“Unless you got a warrant, get off my property.” The door closed a bit, but notall the way.“Look, it’s just a few questions, and it’s not about you,” Bridges explained.“If you were a suspect, we’d have to tell you that. And you probably know thatalready.” Jason thought that that was a clever, seemingly offhand way tocompliment the guy, to maybe soften him up a little.“Yeah, I do know my rights,” the voice replied belligerently, “and I have theright to tell you to get the hell off my property.”“Look, we only need a few minutes if you’ll just talk to us,” Bridges said inhis best “nice cop” voice. “Otherwise my bosses are going to get a subpoena or awarrant, and that’ll be a big headache for all of us.”“A warrant?” the voice laughed. “Based on what? Did you bastards get around tomaking it illegal to not like the feds?” The door opened enough for Jason to seethe man’s face. He was an elderly black man, with gray hair and beard, and awrinkled, angry-looking face.“All right, then, a subpoena,” said Bridges.“Ya know,” the old man said, “if you bastards cared at all about theConstitution—”“Oh, here we go,” Red muttered, rolling his eyes.The man continued: “—you’d be informing me of my Fifth Amendment rights, nottrying to sneak around them. Subpoena or no, I don’t have to say a word to you.You and I both know that. Now piss off.” He slammed the door, and they couldhear his footsteps walking away.“Well, that went well,” Jason remarked.Bridges turned and walked off the porch, and the others followed. “It’s what Iexpected, but I was told to try anyway.”“So, do we go get the subpoena thing?” Red asked.“No, that was a bluff, and he knew it,” replied Bridges, getting back into theSUV.“I’ve never seen a black neo-Nazi before,” joked Red.“He’s not a neo-Nazi,” responded Bridges. “Did he look like a white supremacistto you?” he asked, shooting a glance at Red.“The guy doesn’t even have a criminal record. He is one of those militia types,though. He probably thinks we can’t wait to come take his guns and put him in aconcentration camp, or something.”“I can’t keep all the different kinds of kooks straight,” Red commented, lookingout the window. Smiling, he added, “They all look the same to me.”“Watch it, Red,” said Bridges, starting the engine. image [../Images/image00254.jpeg] BETSY looked up to see Grant Collins striding into the office. “Well,” he said,“we got the go-ahead from Langley to say it was Iron Web people who set off thatbomb in the Arkansas school last week.”“And was it?” Betsy asked.“Hey, if the CIA says that’s what happened, we say that’s what happened,” Grantanswered. “Besides, who else would have done it?” He began rifling through astack of notes and papers. “Oh, and there are lots of minority students at theschool, so let’s emphasize the possible racial aspect of it.”“I thought no one was killed. Wasn’t the school empty?”“Yeah, but the angle will still work,” Grant said. “Nicely integrated school.Now all those students have to be relocated. It’ll set the kids back.”“Press conference or press release?” Betsy asked, wondering which template tobring up on her computer.“Written,” came the answer. “I’m too tired to face the damn press in personright now.”“Want anything about the plane crash in there?”“Of course. We’ll be reminding the public of that every time we say a word inthe next month or so, at least. ‘The same group responsible for the heinousattack and murder of’ blah, blah, blah. You know the wording we want.”“Sure,” Betsy said, looking up her special file of catch phrases.“Speaking of which,” Grant went on, “we need a good title for the ring-leaderdown there. Something easy to remember, simple but distinctive, that we can useover and over again until it sticks in people’s minds. Something like, ‘DawudSingh, the guru of mayhem, and his brainwashed followers.’ But use somethingother than ‘mayhem.’ It makes him sound too much like a comic book villain.” Hethought for a moment, but then did a backhand wave at Betsy, and said, “Anyway,see what you can come up with.”“Got it,” Betsy said.“Now if only we could find a way to blame the economy on the terrorists,” hesaid, glancing at the front page of the newspaper on his desk. “That wouldreally be something. ‘Terrorists hijack Dow Jones, crash it into the ground’.”The joke was in bad taste, but it took an effort for Betsy not to snicker at it.“Actually, there might be something there,” he added. Betsy gave him a skepticallook. “No, I mean something like, ‘at a time when many are feeling the strain ontheir checkbook, terrorists have no qualms about destroying property andscamming people.’ I don’t know, play around with that. See if you can make itsound less contrived.”“That’s a tall order,” Betsy replied.“Well, to tell the truth,” Grant said, “the black market is growing by leaps andbounds, and it’s hard to tell how much of that is Iron Web influence, and howmuch is just people trying to get out of paying taxes while the economy isfaltering. But talking about it will only encourage people to jump on thebandwagon, so it may be best to leave that one alone.”Grant stood still for a moment, as if in thought. “If I went down to Graveston,and made an appearance, think it would look presidential, or just seem likegrandstanding?”“Grandstanding,” answered Betsy. “Unless you plan on charging in and killingthem all yourself, single-handedly.”“Sorry, my schedule’s too busy for that, at the moment,” he said. “Maybe I coulddo my own version of Dumb-ass Dukakis in a tank.”“What?”“Michael Dukakis. I guess you wouldn’t remember. He was running for president.He wanted to look tough for a PR picture, but just looked like some sort ofmoronic bobble-head, peeking out of an M1,” Grant said. Seeing Betsy’squestioning expression, he added, “never mind, doesn’t matter. I won’t be goingdown there.”“Oh,” Betsy said, suddenly remembering, “you got another letter from the NRA,asking again for a policy statement on that bill they’ve proposed.”“Don’t they know the election already happened? Now they’ll have to live withwhat they endorsed. Considering the alternative, who else were they going toback? Cops, military, hunters—all of their organizations endorsed me. It’s alittle late now for them to be complaining.”“Are we just going to ignore it?” she asked.“Do we have one of those great say-nothing, generic responses, about gunrights?”“I think so,” Betsy said, starting a computer word search, “or at leastsomething I can make into one.”“Run it by me before you send it,” he said, and with a smile added, “I want tomake sure it doesn’t actually say anything substantive that we’d have to defendlater.” image [../Images/image00255.jpeg] JESSICA Carlisle thought that this was what it must be like to be old. Eachslow, painful step took real effort and concentration. Heather had bandaged herankle tightly, but still she could hardly bear weight on her foot. Ben walkedpatiently beside her, supporting her weak side as they made their way throughthe grove of trees beside his cabin. She had been there for three days now, butthis was the first time she had ventured outside, having been unable to walk atall until today. She was quite comfortable around Ben and Heather now, andsomehow their lack of worry made her feel less concerned with the events goingon nearby. Her biggest concern was that Ben still had been unable to find a wayto get word to her parents that she was still alive. It pained her to imaginethem assuming that she was dead. She tried not to think about it too much.She was enjoying being outside, in spite of the pain. It was so warm here,compared to Pennsylvania, and the breeze carried the fresh aroma of pine. Shefelt a little silly in the old-fashioned print house dress Heather had givenher. It was pale blue with flowers, and it made her feel about a hundred yearsold. But the clothes she had been wearing when the crash happened were so torn,and so saturated with dirt and blood— blood which may not have all beenhers—that she had asked Heather to throw them away. Aside from her underwear—which had also seen better days, but which she didn’t think anyone would beseeing anyway—the gold necklace she wore was the only thing of hers she stillhad. The thought of going back to the crash site to look for her luggage seemedworse than just giving up everything she had brought along.Despite the discomfort, Jessica managed to take in the beauty of the place. Thebright sunlight slanting through the evergreen twigs and branches as the breezeshook them made the world around her seem to sparkle. Patches of ferns swayedgently in the breeze, and chipmunks jumped from one lichen-covered rock toanother. It was like one of those old classic animated movies, only real, andfar more beautiful.“Good, good,” she heard Ben’s deep voice beside her, after a few minutes ofmeandering along in peaceful silence. “You’re healing just fine. Keep walkingand you’ll be good as new in no time.” Jessica glanced back behind her, andrealized with some disappointment what a short distance she had covered. “If youcan make it over to the koi pond,” Ben said, “you can have a rest.”As they rounded the corner of the cabin, Jessica gasped in wonder at theminiature Garden of Eden that opened up before her. Tucked into the cornerformed by the two wings of the log house was a garden of large rocks, splashingwaterfalls, and dark little pools. Growing in the spaces between the rocks weremore varieties of fern than Jessica had ever seen before, along with spikyswirls of aloes, miniature ones and huge ones, dark striped ones and pale ones.Several Japanese maples covered the garden with a light, twiggy canopy, whiletheir delicate, star-shaped leaves decorated the rocks, plants, and pools belowwith little splashes of deep red. If it looked this glorious in winter, shethought to herself, it must be truly amazing in the spring.Jessica saw two stone benches near the largest of the pools, and decided shemust make it to them before she could rest. As she limped along the flagstonepath in short steps, she was startled by a sharp noise like the plucking of abanjo string. A small frog she hadn’t noticed leapt from the path in front ofher feet into one of the pools, making a tiny splash. Jessica laughed. Thisplace made the pain seem somehow farther away, and less real. Reaching one ofthe benches at last, she sat down with a great sigh of relief, as Ben sat downon the other bench, facing her.“Wow, this place is beautiful,” Jessica said. Then she remembered why she wasthere. “You’re sure we’re safe out here?” she asked.“What do you mean?” Ben replied.“The terrorists,” she said, surprised that he couldn’t guess what she meant.Then something occurred to her. “Do you know any of them? Like, do they evercome over here?”“Well, the government has been pretty vague about just who it thinks theseterrorists are,” he answered, “but a few of my neighbors probably fit the bill.”Jessica was puzzled. Why would this nice, kind man put up with living near suchpeople? She had learned from previous conversations that Ben was an ardentpacifist. He had built this house ten years ago to be closer to his sister, whohad retired from nursing. But as nice as this place was, she thought to herself,when terrorists moved in next door, she would have moved away as fast aspossible.“Do they ever bother you?” she asked.“They have a beef with the government. They don’t have a beef with me, and theywouldn’t have one with you, either,” he said with apparent confidence.“But how can you be so sure? I never paid much attention to the stories on thenews,” she admitted, “but I know those people have done horrible things to a lotof people, not just the government.”“Like what?” he asked, seeming genuinely curious.How could he, of all people, not know? Jessica wondered. Maybe he just lived inthis beautiful place and never went anywhere or turned on the news. She couldhardly blame him for that.“I don’t really remember,” she said. “I thought their neighbors all hated them,though. I’ve heard about schools and other buildings being blown up, and banksbeing robbed, and— and don’t they pick on minority people?”“They’ve never given me any trouble,” Ben said.Jessica heard the rustle of leaves, looked up, and jumped at the sight of afigure—little more than a silhouette, with the sun behind it—of a man carryingwhat Jessica thought was a machine gun. For a split second, she was convincedthat it had to be one of the Iron Web crazies; they had come here after all, andwho knew what they would do? She clutched the arm of the bench tightly.Her panic quickly evaporated, however, when the figure stepped into the light,and she had to suppress a giggle of relief. He was just a boy—no more than 16,Jessica guessed—with a slight build and a smiling baby face that reminded her ofElvis, from the silly old movies her mother liked.It took her a moment to notice that he really was carrying a gun, and it surelooked real. Was it just a paint-ball gun? If not, what was this kid doingcarrying a machine gun around? Or was it a hunting rifle? Jessica knew next tonothing about guns, but this one reminded her of war movies. This boy was noterrorist—his face alone convinced her of that—but what was he doing toting ascary-looking rifle like that around? Just being around guns made heruncomfortable. The only gun she’d seen in real life was at a party when a friendof a friend had brought out his dad’s handgun to show to some people. Nothingbad had happened, and that kid wasn’t a criminal or anything, but it madeJessica uneasy to think of the capacity for destruction that such a small thingcould have.“Uncle Ben,” called the boy in a sing-song voice that matched his youthful face.He carefully put the rifle down, leaning it against the corner of the cabin. Inhis other hand he held a shopping bag.“Joshua,” Ben answered with a smile, and, turning to Jessica, added, “Here’s oneneighbor of mine you sure don’t need to worry about. Everything going okay?” heasked, turning back toward the boy.“We’re all hangin’ in there,” he answered, and Jessica wondered who “we”referred to. “And I’m guessing this is Miracle Girl,” the boy added, looking atJessica.“That’s what some people have been calling you,” Ben explained, “for survivingthat crash. Most of the people around here saw the plane go down. Some stilldon’t believe that anyone could have survived it.”“I hardly believe it myself,” Jessica commented.“That pile of rubble—I can’t believe anything could have come out of thatalive,” Josh said. “And here you are, up and about. Amazing.”“She hasn’t been back to the crash site yet,” Ben said, “and she was unconsciouswhen we got her out.” Turning to Jessica he added, “I and a few of my neighbors,including Josh here, made a sort of temporary cemetery down there, the day afterwe brought you back here. I expect when things are settled down here, thefamilies will come and exhume the bodies, but in the meantime, we couldn’t justleave them there like that.”“It was a mess,” Josh said, but Jessica didn’t want to think what the rest ofthe plane, and the rest of the passengers, must have looked like when they hadpulled her out. She was also surprised that anyone would ask a kid his age tohelp deal with such death and destruction like that. She didn’t want to picturethis happy kid having to sift through smoldering debris and dead bodies. “Ican’t believe you’re alive, but I’m glad you are.” He held out his hand, and sheshook it.“Thanks,” she responded, straightening her dress, being suddenly conscious of itagain. “Now if I can just get home without getting killed by some terrorist,I’ll be content.”“No terrorists around here,” the boy said, which seemed odd to Jessica.“Don’t forget Halen.” The voice came from behind Jessica, and she turned—withjust a twinge of pain—to see another man, this one probably around 25 years old,tall and thin, with longish light brown hair, and a face that reminded her ofNicolas Cage, from her favorite movie, “Con Air.” “If anyone around here is aterrorist, it’s gotta be Halen.” He turned to face Jessica. “He killed a U.S.senator with his bare hands, ya know,” he said, gritting his teeth and clenchinghis fists for dramatic effect. Then his face instantly returned to its priorcheerful state. “Hey, pops,” he said to Ben.“Good morning, Douglas,” Ben said, with a disapproving look. “I was just tellingJessica here about my neighbors, explaining that she has nothing to fear. Andyou’re not really helping.”“Yeah, these hills are just crawling with diabolical terrorists,” said Doug,looking around with mock suspicion. “Can’t you tell? Better call in the feds tosave us all.” He casually flopped down onto one of the empty benches. Jessicawasn’t sure what to make of his antics. He seemed to be making fun of thesituation as if it wasn’t really that serious. But based on what little she hadheard, it sounded deadly serious.“Oh, I almost forgot,” Joshua cut in, and held out the bag he was stillcarrying. “Heather wanted me to bring some stuff over. She said you were aboutmy sister’s size. My sister’s away right now. Normally she’d kill me if I lookedin her drawers, but I think she’d want you to have clothes.” Jessica cautiouslyaccepted the bag, and peered in. It was full of clothes—clothes made thiscentury, she thought, and then felt a bit guilty for thinking that. Heather hadbeen considerate enough to think of this, in the midst of everything else goingon around them.Jessica rummaged a little, then pulled out a one-piece bathing suit. Doug burstout laughing, and gave Josh a gentle punch in the head. “You think she’s goingswimming in January, you knuckle-head?”Josh blushed. “I just grabbed a pile of stuff,” he said timidly, looking theother way, “I didn’t stop to pick and choose.”“I hope you didn’t forget the lingerie,” Doug taunted. “But then, Susan isn’treally the same size as Miracle Girl here, not everywhere,” he continued.Jessica could feel his eyes assessing her, and she kept rummaging withoutlooking up. “I meant that as a compliment,” Doug quickly added.“Mind your manners, Doug,” said Ben sharply.“I wanted to ask, what’s the news out there sayin’ about all of this?” Joshasked Jessica after a brief, awkward silence. Jessica suspected that he was moreeager to change the subject than he was to hear about the news. “How are theyreportin’ all this outside of here? Like, how did they say it started?” Jessicafound Joshua’s thick southern accent amusing, and wondered where he was from.“I didn’t really pay much attention,” she admitted. “I heard something about ashootout. They said a terrorist killed a police officer or something. I forget,exactly.” She pulled a pink knitted top out of the bag that reminded her of herlost pink sweater. She set it aside and kept looking through the bag.“I was there when it started,” said Josh eagerly. “I can tell you exactly how itwent down.” He glanced over at Ben, as if expecting Ben to stop him. Ben noddedslightly, and Josh continued. “Me and Keith were out shootin’—we have a rangeset up on the hill. Well, we see Deputy Dog comin’ up—”“Deputy Dog?” Jessica asked, looking up.“Harold Doggis,” answered Ben. “Somewhat unfortunate name for a deputy.”“So he drives up,” Josh continued, “and Keith walks to meet him, and I follow alittle behind. Keith can be a bit of a wise-ass, ya know. And he’s still holdin’his AR. Deputy Dog says old lady Sellers says she saw kids smoking pot in herwoods, and said she saw them run across the road and over yonder, into the woodsover there on Keith’s property.” Josh pointed over the hills beyond Ben’s cabin.“Well, Dog wants to check it out, but Keith says, ‘Where’s your warrant?’ Dogdon’t like that, and says he don’t need no warrant. Has some legal excuse—Iforget what. Anyway, Keith’s still standin’ there, holding the rifle— notpointing it at Dog or nuthin’—but he says Dog ain’t comin’ on his propertywithout a warrant. You know how Keith is,” he added, turning to Ben.At this point Jessica stopped looking through the bag of clothes and gave thetale her full attention. She had expected him to tell about some scary group ofstrangers coming and setting up a terrorist headquarters. But it seemed as ifthis sweet-faced boy might actually be personally familiar with the terrorists,at least one of them, maybe even sympathetic to them.Noticing her eyes on him, Josh blushed a little and lost his train of thought.Jessica smiled inwardly. If she could have this effect on a boy with her bruisedface, no makeup, and wearing an old lady’s house dress, she guessed she wasn’tdoing too badly.“Then Dog says he’s gonna arrest Keith for obstruction of justice,” said Josh,finding his place again. “Keith just says, ‘No, you ain’t.’ Dog says, ‘You’reunder arrest.’ Keith says, ‘No, I ain’t.’ Then they both just stand there, notsayin’ a word, for maybe five minutes. It looks like Dog is tryin’ to decidewhat to do. After a while he walks to his car and calls Deputy Dawson— we onlygot three cops for the whole town here. Even when Dawson shows up, they juststand around, like they don’t know what to do. It looked to me like Dawson wastryin’ to talk Dog into just walkin’ away. Dawson’s okay. Better than the othertwo, at least. Dog keeps pointin’ at Keith, saying, ‘You’re under arrest,’ buthe doesn’t do nuthin’. At this point the cops are out on the road, wouldn’t evenstep on the property again. I don’t know how long they were there—a longtime—but eventually Dog says, ‘This ain’t over,’ and they get in their cars anddrive away. I haven’t seen the local cops back since then.”“As best I can tell from the folks I’ve talked to,” Ben said, taking up thestory, “Mr. Doggis was boiling mad—felt as if Keith had made a fool of him. Hecalled the feds—Doggis has a buddy in the FBI—but they said there was nothingthey could do. Not their jurisdiction. I don’t know whose idea it was, butapparently some days later they got Mrs. Sellers—elderly lady who lives acrossthe road over the hill, and not the friendliest soul—to say she heard machineguns being fired over here.”“We ain’t never had machine guns,” Josh cut in. Jessica glanced at the riflestill leaning against the cabin, which she had assumed before was a machine gun.“The cops know what we got, and know it’s all legal,” Josh went on. “Old LadySellers doesn’t know what she’s talkin’ about. Plus, she’s as deaf as she ismean.”“Anyway,” Ben continued, “based on her word, the ATF showed up a few days laterwith a search warrant, wanting to look for machine guns. Somehow they got ajudge to sign off on a warrant for this whole neighborhood, including all six ofthe houses inside the river bend. Well, Keith said no way. The road into heregoes through his property. So they can’t get back here unless he lets themthrough.”“This part I saw,” Josh eagerly cut in again. “I was in Keith’s house, lookin’out the window. Keith was out front, and there had to be thirty feds, dressedall in black, all holdin’ MP5’s and M16’s, and a couple things I didn’trecognize. They all stood there for the longest time, but Keith wouldn’t backdown. I could see his hands shakin’. He was either scared to death or mad ashell—maybe both. But he didn’t back down, and he didn’t make a move. They weretalkin’ for a while, but I couldn’t hear much. I think Keith was sayin’ thattheir warrant was no good. They were arguin’ about the right of way orsomething. But I heard it when the fed up front—the guy in charge, I guess—saidthat they were comin’ in whether Keith liked it or not. Well, Keith pulls outhis Glock—doesn’t aim it at them, just holds it pointin’ down. But man, theydidn’t like that. They all got their guns up, screamin’ at him to put his down.I thought Keith was a goner for sure. Then the guy in charge says he’s gonnacount to three, and if Keith doesn’t drop the gun, the guy’ll shoot him. I guessKeith thought he was bluffin’, because he just stands there while the guycounts. Well, when he gets to three, he shoots. It was a quick burst, maybe fouror five rounds. But it hits Keith in the side and shoulder, and spins himaround. I think I saw two other agents fire a round or two, but I don’t know whohit him. But as soon as they started shooting, the lead ATF guy, the guy incharge, half his head just explodes—really gross. Then I hear this huge boomcoming from way off to the right. The bullet got there before the sound did. Iguess that was Halen with his 50 cal, but I don’t know where he was. Maybe onhis roof. I never saw him. Keith managed to stagger inside, and I ran to helphim. We both hit the deck, and I didn’t look up again. I thought for sure they’dall be crashin’ through the doors any second and kill us both.”The reality of where Jessica was really started to sink in. Despite the pleasantscenery and polite company, she suddenly felt foolish for having been rummagingthrough clothes a moment before, looking for something fashionable, as if thatwas of any importance right now. It was one thing to read a story like this inthe newspaper. It was another to hear it from someone who had been in the middleof it.“Halen later told me that he did shoot the ATF agent who had shot Keith, which Iwish he hadn’t done,” said Ben, shaking his head.“Halen told you it was him?” Josh asked. “I mean, I knew it had to be, but Inever came right out and asked him. He must have been hiding somewhere, watchingeverything through a scope. But he had to, Uncle Ben. Keith would’ve been agoner.”“He said that after the first shot, the feds were looking around, trying tofigure out where the shot had come from,” Ben said. “They started to back off,back to their vans, so Halen didn’t shoot again. He said he had no choice; itwas either kill the guy, or let them kill Keith.”“Did Keith survive?” Jessica cut in, with a tone of surprise.“Yeah. That freak got hit with three bullets,” Josh said, “but they were allflesh wounds. He’s still not in the best shape, but he’s up and around againnow. Man, he never fired a shot at them, never even raised his gun. I saw thewhole thing. And they tried to blow him away. I’m glad Halen took out that guy.The bastard deserved it.”“Well, it hasn’t exactly helped the situation,” Ben replied. “But Halen told me,and I sure do believe it, that he could have killed all thirty of those ATFguys, before they would even have known where he was, and before they could havetaken cover. So I’m at least glad he didn’t do that.”“I don’t want to sound ignorant, here,” interjected Jessica timidly, “but what’sthe ATF?”“Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,” Ben explained. “A while backthey added something else to their name, something about explosives, but mostpeople still call them the ATF. They’re the agency that enforces the federal gunlaws.”“Yeah, the completely unconstitutional federal gun laws,” said Josh. “Bunch offascists. Ever hear what happened over in Waco?”“Sort of. I don’t know much about it,” Jessica said, and realized she had beensaying that about a lot of things recently.“Pretty horrible stuff,” Josh commented. “Ask Doug here some time. He knows moreabout it than anyone I know.”“Basically, the feds murdered almost a hundred men, women and children,” Dougsaid cavalierly. “Called them a cult and said they were dangerous. Thenterrorized, tortured and killed almost all of them, and threw the rest inprison. Then they destroyed or covered up all the evidence. Some time I can giveyou all the details, but you might not want to hear them.” The term “conspiracytheory” came into Jessica’s mind, but since she knew nothing at all about whatDoug was talking about, she kept her mouth shut.“Anyway,” Ben continued, “after the standoff with Keith, the feds backed off,set up their blockade, and brought in more men and equipment. We’ve all beenstuck here ever since.”“Every once in a while one of the feds’ helicopters flies over,” Josh added,“but that’s about all that’s been happening around here since then.”“That’s it? That’s what started all this?” Jessica said, somewhat surprised. Shehad been waiting for the point in the story when the terrorists got involved,but it sounded as if the story was over. “So who’s the Iron Web? Where arethey?”“In the feds’ imaginations, mostly,” Josh remarked with obvious disdain.“Isn’t there a David somebody?” Jessica asked. “The news kept mentioning him astheir leader.”“David wasn’t even there,” Doug said with a hint of exasperation. “He hadnothing to do with it. And he’s not the leader of anything. They just don’t likehis book, so they’re using this event to try to paint him as some dastardlyvillain, even though he had nothing to do with what went down.”“I never heard about any book,” said Jessica. “I just kept hearing that he wasthe leader of this group that’s doing bad things all over the country.”“David wouldn’t hurt a fly,” said Josh indignantly. “And he wouldn’t tell anyoneelse to, either.”“Okay, folks,” Ben said, slapping his hands on his knees and standing up. “AsJessica’s de facto doctor here, I’m gonna cut this short. She needs her rest,mental and physical.” Jessica noticed that she was rubbing her leg, which hadbeen hurting more and more as she sat there, though she had been too absorbed inthe conversation to pay much attention to the pain. “Let’s get you inside, andget the weight off that leg. There’ll be plenty of time to chat later.”“Yeah, probably a good idea,” she replied. Ben took her arm to help her up, andJosh, who was closer than Doug, quickly grabbed the bag and took her other arm.“Thanks for the clothes,” she said to Josh as she rose painfully to her feet. Hesmiled, blushed again, and looked away. Josh was quickly endearing himself toher, and she could hardly imagine him firing that scary-looking rifle hecarried.They all walked around to the front of the cabin, and then Josh and Doug saidgoodbye and headed off into the woods. As Ben opened the front door, the soundof distant, blaring music started up from over the hills. “What on earth isthat?” Jessica asked. image [../Images/image00253.jpeg] JASON sat in a folding chair in front of his trailer, watching the slowlysloping, grassy hill in front of him, just as he had done the two days prior,without anything happening. “I fight authority, authority always wins.” Thechorus of the song repeated in a loop, over and over again, from twoloudspeakers high atop thirty-foot poles at each end of the line of trailers.Somewhere on the other side of that hill, only a few hundred yards away, werethe cabins where the terrorists were hiding out. But with all the agents andtrailers now lining the road, the chance of anyone coming out seemed extremelyremote. Jason had to fight the urge to doze off in the warm sun.“I fight authority, authority always wins.” The music droned on.“Man, why do we have to hear this stuff, too?” Jason asked, as Red walked up.“I’m overdosing on John Cougar.”“It’s only been on for twenty minutes so far,” Red said. “Better get used to it.Besides, we take shifts, so we can get away from it,” Red said with a smile.“They can’t. It’ll wear them down, you’ll see. Basic psy-ops stuff. And if youthink it’s loud from here, step in front of the speakers for a second. They’respecial speakers designed to focus all the sound in one direction.”“Well they don’t work, unless someone decided to aim them at me,” Jason saidwith some annoyance. “What’s the point, anyway?”“To wear the wackos down. They won’t be able to sleep, or relax. After a coupledays of this, giving up will start looking better and better to them. They didthe same thing at Waco, but with some other song. I forget what it was.”“Yeah, and that turned out real well, didn’t it?” Jason said flippantly. “Ifsomeone did this to me, I think I’d probably shoot them.”“I fight authority—” the music ended with a loud “smack.”“We blow a circuit or something?” Red asked. In the middle of his sentence, adeep boom like the crack and rumble of thunder came echoing over the hills infront of them. In the distance Jason could hear the other loudspeaker blaring onfor a few more seconds, until it too fell silent, followed by another distantboom.“Oh, my God, look at the speaker,” Jason said, pointing at what was left of thebox atop the nearer pole, about a hundred feet away. Broken plastic and wireswere hanging off of it. “They shot it.” Red brought his rifle up, and pointed itaround in the general direction of the compound. “From the delay, it had to befrom really far away,” Jason reasoned. “Damn, someone in there has some seriousfirepower. It had to be 50 cal.” He looked over at Red, who was squintingsuspiciously toward the hills. “Well, at least we can have some peace and quietnow,” Jason said, sitting back in his chair.“You think this is funny?” Red said with genuine anger. “How do you know theyweren’t shooting at us?”“First of all, they can’t see us over that hill,” Jason answered. “They couldonly hit the boxes because they’re way up on those poles. Second, what are thechances that they’d aim at us, and instead just happen to hit two foot-wideboxes from three hundred yards away? And I can’t really say I blame them. It wasgetting on my nerves, and we’re on the quiet side.”“I’m telling Bridges,” Red said, and walked off. Jason snickered at how much thestatement sounded like a child saying, “I’m telling mom,” but he also knew thatthe incident needed to be reported, and he was glad Red was doing it. image [../Images/image00254.jpeg] BETSY once again found herself sitting uneasily, a forced half smile on herface, as her friend took verbal swings at the next President of the UnitedStates.“What’s so extreme and unreasonable about having the cops just go after peoplewho hurt other people, and leave everyone else alone?” asked Sandy.“It’s just too simplistic,” Grant answered calmly. “Your ideas sound good intheory, but in the real world, you and I both know that a lot of people make badchoices, and some of those choices hurt other people, as well as themselves.”“So Big Brother gets to decide what all the good choices are, and force them oneveryone?”“No, the people are the ones deciding, through their elected representatives,”Grant replied. “The representatives make laws to tell everyone what society willand will not tolerate.”“It’s not society who kicks down the doors and drags people off to prison forsmoking a joint. It’s the pigs who work for the politicians.”Unable to remain silent any longer, Betsy blurted out, “God, Sandy, would youplease shut up now?”Grant burst out laughing, and said, “Don’t worry about it. She can say what shethinks. I’m not going to hold what your friends think against you.” His voicewent back to his official, slightly condescending politician tone, as hecontinued. “Again, it’s fine to believe in ideals like that, but they just don’twork on a practical level. If we want society to work smoothly, and for us toall get along, we need a set of rules that everyone has to follow, whether theyagree with all of the rules or not. I hope you would at least agree that, whileit’s fine to try to change laws you don’t like through the democratic process,as long as it is the law, we all have an obligation to abide by it.”“Hmm,” Sandy hesitated, looking skeptical. “Maybe Betsy’s right; I’d better shutup now.”“Well, what do you think the world would be like if everyone decided for himselfwhich laws to follow and which to ignore?” Grant persisted. “Fairly chaotic,don’t you think?”“Actually,” Sandy opined, “I’d say that a whole lot of the chaos we havetoday—death, oppression, and injustice—comes from people making, obeying, andenforcing stupid laws.”“Well, the people have the power to change the law whenever they want,” cameGrant’s retort. “That’s what elections are for.”Seeing Sandy roll her eyes, and expecting some less-than-polite statement fromher, Betsy cut into the conversation again. “I must admit, it doesn’t usuallyseem like the people have much of a choice. I mean, most of the time it seemslike people just vote for the guy they dislike a little bit less than the otherguy.” Suddenly remembering who she was talking to, she quickly added, “presentcompany excepted,” which brought another chuckle from Grant.“Well, what do you suggest?” Grant asked. His chair was tilted back, and helooked as if he was enjoying himself. “This is how democracy works. It’scertainly not perfect, but do you know of any better system? How do they put it?‘It’s the worst system of government, except for all the other ones’? Somethinglike that.”“Not to get nit-picky, here, your Highness,” Sandy said, making Betsy cringe,“but this isn’t supposed to be a democracy. It was supposed to be aconstitutional republic, where individuals have unalienable rights, whether themajority likes it or not. Majority rule is not freedom. Majority rule is twowolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.”“Benjamin Franklin. Very good. But I have a controversial question for you, LadyLiberty,” Grant said, causing an involuntary snicker to escape from Betsy. “Ifthe Constitution is the law of the land because ‘We the People’ said so, what if‘We the People’ change our minds? What if tomorrow ‘We the People’ decide thatsome new system—pure democracy, socialism, a dictatorship, whatever—would betterserve the country’s needs? Are you going to tell the people that you will decidewhat’s best for them, whether they like it or not?” Betsy looked at Sandy, whohad no immediate answer. “One way or the other,” Grant continued, “someone hasto make the rules. And wouldn’t it be best if everyone had a say in how thathappens, and in what the rules will be?”“Well, to be fair, the majority has been wrong lots of times,” Betsy offered,coming to her friend’s defense. “The majority in this country thought slaverywas okay for many years. Lots of stupid, unfair things have had majority supportin the past.” There was a pause, and Betsy suddenly felt self-conscious. Shenever went head-to-head with Grant like that. “I admit, I don’t know what to doabout it,” she added quickly. “How can there be a system that does the rightthing, even if the general public is stupid or malicious? It doesn’t seempossible.”“In theory, that’s what representative government is supposed to do,” Grantresponded. “It reflects the values of society, but also serves as a check on mobmentality and a guard against one group oppressing another.”“Except that government is the biggest oppressor of them all,” Sandy said.“Power always corrupts. Whoever you put there will be the new biggest problemaround. That’s why the focus should be on limiting the power itself, to give noone enough power to oppress the people. That’s what the Bill of Rights was allabout.”“But if the government has no power, how can it protect people?” Grant asked.“Would you disarm the police because you fear government corruption, leavingthem unable to do the job of protecting people from the criminals out there? Ifyou take away the military’s planes and tanks, for fear of them being usedagainst you, aren’t you simply inviting some foreign invader to come here andoppress us far more?”“This is giving me a headache,” Betsy said, in part because she had a lot ofwork to do and wanted to get back to it. “It sounds like we’re doomed, whetherwe have a huge, all-powerful government, or a puny, weak one.”Sandy spoke up. “Well, if I had to choose, I gotta go with Thomas Jefferson. Ashe said, ‘I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too muchliberty—’ ”Grant interrupted her to finish the quotation: “—than to those attending toosmall a degree of it.” Sandy and Betsy both stared at him in surprise. image [../Images/image00255.jpeg] JESSICA sat in the recliner in Ben’s living room, while the battery-poweredradio played in the background. Even during the day, the cabin seemed fairlydark with no electric lights. The events that Joshua had described kept turningover in her mind: the police shooting Keith, and then the agent getting killed.That was pretty bad, but there had to be more to the story than that. She triedin vain to recall what she had heard on the news about it before she had gottenon that plane. If she’d ever dreamed that she would end up in the middle of theIron Web story, maybe she would have paid some attention to it. She knew therehad to be something more going on here than what Josh had described.At that point, however, Jessica was far less interested in understanding thesituation than she was in getting away from it, and back home again. She wasthinking of going back to her room for a nap when the words from the radiosuddenly caught her attention. “We have an update on the incident on Flight422. Two members of the group calling itself the Iron Web have been identifiedas those who—”Ben walked quickly over to the radio, though seeming as if he was trying to lookcasual, and switched it off. Looking slightly uneasy, he turned to Jessica andsaid, “I think it would be best if you weren’t constantly reminded of ... that.”“I was just thinking of taking a nap anyway,” Jessica said, though Ben’sbehavior made her, for the first time, a little suspicious. Ben helped her toher feet, and helped her hobble to her room and climb onto the bed.“When you get up,” Ben said, “Heather will probably have some lunch ready forus. Sweet dreams,” he said, and closed the door.Jessica, though tired, lay awake for a while. Her imagination wouldn’t let hersleep, wondering just where the terrorists were, how many there were, what theylooked like, and so on. Ben didn’t seem at all scared of them, but maybe thatwas only because they knew him. Maybe they wouldn’t be so tolerant of a strangerin their midst.After a while she gave up the attempt to sleep, sat up in bed and looked aroundthe room. Slowly she stood up, holding onto a bed post. Even a few minutes inbed made her muscles feel stiff and sore. She took a few steps to the door, andnoticed the sound of whispering on the other side. Putting her ear against thewood, she listened.Ben’s voice was whispering, “ ... to explain that?”“She’s going to find out sooner or later,” came Heather’s quiet reply.“She won’t understand,” Ben said, his voice rising a bit. “For now it’s bestthat she doesn’t know, for her own sake.”“Don’t you think her parents have a right to know that she’s alive?” Heatherasked.“For the time being, it’s better if they think she’s dead. If word gets out whathappened here—it’s just not safe. You know that.”Hadn’t Ben said there were no communications? Now it sounded as if they werekeeping her presence here a secret on purpose. Why would they do such a thing?Jessica wondered.“She’s an innocent kid,” Heather pleaded. “I wish there was a way to get heraway from all this, before things get really bad. Why not use the tunnel thatthe kids dug?”Jessica heard Ben sigh. “It’s not just a matter of getting her out. You knowthat. We can’t let her leave here, knowing what she knows.”Jessica’s mind raced. Couldn’t let her leave? Why not? She still had a hard timebelieving that Heather or Ben meant her any harm, but they were obviouslykeeping something from her, and keeping her from getting home, away from all ofthis mess. She started to get worried, and a little scared.“Well, I have to run now,” Ben said in a more natural tone of voice. After amoment of silence, Jessica looked through a crack between the boards of thedoor, and saw Ben standing there, putting on a black jacket. Then he putsomething around his neck. It took her a moment to recognize it as a whitepriest’s collar. “I haven’t worn this in a while,” she heard him say, “but itjust might keep things a little more civil.” With that, he walked out of theroom. Was he off to visit the terrorists? Hearing Heather’s footsteps, Jessicasuddenly feared that she would come check on her, so she staggered back to herbed, as quickly and quietly as she could.What could it all mean? Was she being held hostage? Who was Ben going to see?Was he more friendly with the terrorists than he was letting on? Was he one ofthem? She considered trying to escape, but there was no way, not with her legthe way it was. She made up her mind to confront Ben when he got back. She wasgetting more and more nervous and suspicious, trying to make sense of it all,but she still couldn’t believe that Ben would intentionally do anything to hurther. image [../Images/image00253.jpeg] JASON sat in his uncomfortable metal chair as other agents talked and milledaround. “Have a seat, and pay attention,” Agent Bridges said, as he walked intothe meeting room and tossed his clipboard onto the desk. “Well, we just gotword, the guys up top want to up the pressure a bit.”“We’re going in?” Red asked with obvious enthusiasm.“Sort of,” Bridges replied. “As things stand now, they’re too comfortable inthere. I’m sure you’ve all heard by now what they did to our speakers. So we canadd destruction of government property to the list of charges against them. Thepoint is, who knows how long they can stay in there like that? At the same time,we don’t want to charge in with guns blazing. Well, maybe Red does,” hecorrected himself, and several agents snickered. He pointed at the map on thewall. “Here’s the deal. On the north end of the area is a single cabin all byitself. It’s right on the edge of these woods, which back up to the river. Wejust got a new search warrant, just for that one cabin. Tonight, if all goeswell, we’re going to execute the warrant. The plan is to sneak across the riverin small boats. The woods aren’t that deep, maybe a hundred yards, and we havesnipers on that side who can see if anything is moving before we go in. So wecross the river, make our way through the woods, and take control of that onecabin.”“I’m in,” answered Red. “How many are going?”“As best we can tell, the only one who is usually in that cabin is an elderlyman. So we won’t need an army division for this, and the fewer we use, the lesslikely we’ll be to get noticed before we get there. I’m suggesting just six goin at first, which is the minimum number I like to use for any search. Once wesecure the area, we’ll bring more across. Volunteers?” A dozen hands shot up.“Miguel, Sam, Red, Cliff, Jack, you’re in,” Bridges said, pointing them out.“Jason, think you’re ready for your first taste of action?”“Chomping at the bit, sir,” Jason answered, getting a few chuckles in reply. Intruth, he was a little nervous about the idea. It was starting to sound morelike a military incursion than a normal search and seizure, and he wasn’t surethe team really had enough experience at that sort of thing.“Then you’re the sixth,” Bridges said. “Again, we don’t expect much resistanceat that one cabin, but always be ready. You never know what’s going to happen,or what might go wrong. Keep alert, and do everything the way you were trainedto do it.” He looked at his watch. “You six be back here in two hours, and we’llgo over the details. We’ll go in just after dark. That’s all for now.” Bridgespicked up his papers and walked out of the room, as if he had somewhereimportant to be. The other agents got up and wandered outside.“It’s about time,” Red said to Jason, as they stepped out into the brightsunlight again. “I was getting sick of standing around doing nothing.”Jason didn’t say anything as they walked back toward his trailer. As a smalltown cop, he had been involved in only two raids, both for drugs, and nothinghad really happened. But there was always that uncertainty, and it was evenworse here. Who knew what they could expect from the people in there?On the grass in front of Jason’s trailer was the box he had put down whenBridges had called them all to the meeting. He sat down cross-legged next to it,and opened it. He took out six empty 30­round magazines and laid them on thegrass, brought out the metal ammo box full of .223 rounds and opened it. Then,methodically, he started pushing the rounds into the clips, one by one. Hewondered to himself if any of these bullets would ever end up killing a person.He sincerely hoped not. He offered a silent prayer as he loaded the bullets:Please, God, let me make the right decisions.“You ain’t even loaded yet?” Red asked, standing over him, his hands on hiships. “Ya know, they got things that’ll do a whole clip in about two seconds.”“I like doing it myself,” Jason responded. “Besides, we aren’t going in foranother few hours.”“Scared?” Red asked in a mocking voice.“A little nervous,” Jason said without shame. “And I suppose you’re not?”“Heck, no. I’ve got nerves of steel,” Red said unconvincingly.“Yeah, right. Just don’t freak out on me if things go bad.”“We’re only raiding some old guy’s house,” Red replied. “Think he’ll meet usRambo-style, a Gatling gun in each hand?”“It’s not him I’m worried about,” Jason said, continuing to load the magazines.“Jay, you got nothing to worry about,” came Miguel’s voice from behind them.“You’re the best shot here.” He put his arm around Red’s shoulders, shaking him.“Here’s the guy I don’t want next to me. I’d be more scared of him hitting me byaccident than of the damn webbies hitting me on purpose.”“Webbies?” Jason asked.“The Iron Web knuckle-heads,” Miguel explained. “That’s what we’re calling themnow.”“We don’t even know how many there are in there,” Jason said, looking up. “Wehave no idea what kind of weapons they have, legal or illegal. For all we know,we could go in there and meet a hundred end-of-the-world crackpots with grenadesand sniper rifles. Or we could sneak in and start stepping on land mines andbooby-traps. We don’t know what’s in there.”“Gonna go cryin’ home to your mommy, Pretty Boy?” Red teased, in a voice thatmade Jason want to slug him.“No, shit-head,” Jason said, getting angry, “but it would be nice to livethrough this.”“Hey, it’s not like we’re invading the whole compound,” said Miguel. “It’s onelittle house, off on the outskirts in the woods. Some old guy isn’t likely tohave mines and booby-traps in his woods.”“Yeah, you’re probably right. I’d just rather be prepared. It beats beingcaptured and tortured to death by a bunch of sadistic, inbred rednecks,” Jasonsaid, trying to smile.“Woah, man,” Red said, “you’re starting to sound like me.”“Heaven forbid,” came Jason’s response. After a moment of silence, he added,“Did you hear what they did to the IRS guy over in Idaho? They were doing asearch—”“Yeah,” Red interrupted excitedly, “and one of them got captured. The webbiestied him up to a big-ass cross out front of their little hideout, naked.”“That’s bullshit,” Miguel said. “I think I even know the guy who started thatrumor, just to mess with us.”“No, man, it’s true,” Red said confidently.“Oh, you were there?” Miguel asked mockingly. “So how come it never made thenews?”“Maybe they didn’t want to embarrass the agent by telling everyone whathappened,” Red suggested.“Yeah, or maybe it really is all a complete crock,” Jason said, hoping he wasright.“Either way, the damn webbies ain’t takin’ me alive,” Red said.“You’re right,” responded Miguel. “If I was on their side, you’d be the firstone I’d shoot.” With that, Miguel walked away toward the trailer where he wasstationed.Having filled a magazine, Jason slid it into one of the pockets on the carryingcase of his M16. At that moment he wanted more than anything for this mission tobe over and done with. He gazed absent­mindedly toward the rolling hills again.His mind in a peaceful daze, it was almost twenty seconds before his brainnoticed what his eyes were looking at. A tiny figure, only the top half visible,was moving over the hill toward him. He jumped up, rifle in hand, which made Redjump, too. Then Red saw the approaching figure, and raised his rifle in itsdirection.“What the hell are you doing?” Jason shouted, thinking Red was about to fire.“I’m just getting a better look through the scope.”“Well, get the binoculars.”“He’s got his hands up,” Red said, ignoring the instruction. “I think it’s apriest.”“So stop pointing a gun at him, and go get Bridges,” Jason said.“He just left. I overheard him saying he was going into town for a minute. Wecan handle this. Let’s go.” Red set off at a jog in the direction of theapproaching figure, and Jason followed, not feeling as if he had much of achoice.By that time the figure was easy to make out: a stocky, gray-haired elderly man,dressed like a priest, his hands high, walking at a slow but steady pace. Whenhe was about a hundred feet away, Red yelled out to him, bringing his rifle tothe ready. “Keep your hands high, and turn around.” The man complied. “Slowlywalk backwards, towards us, keeping your hands where we can see them.” Red wasstill shouting, though the man by now wasn’t far away at all. “Okay, now down onyour knees, and hands behind your head.” Again, the man complied, without aword. “Don’t move a muscle,” Red barked at him. “Check him for weapons,” he saidto Jason in a loud whisper.Jason put his own rifle down and walked forward, feeling a little awkward andembarrassed. He patted down the priest, and mumbled, “Sorry about this, Father,”in the man’s ear, hoping Red wouldn’t hear. He stood up again, and said, “He’sclean.” He walked over and picked up his rifle. He looked at Red, who wasstarting to tremble a bit, his rifle still aimed at the priest’s head. Gettingworried, Jason decided he had better take charge. “I’ll stay here with him. Yougo get a call in to Agent Bridges.” After a moment’s hesitation, Red obeyed, andwent running off toward the trailers, though Jason was sure that other agentswould have noticed what was happening by now, and would already have Bridges onthe line anyway.For a minute, Jason and the priest didn’t move, the priest on his knees with hishands on his head, and Jason holding his rifle pointed at the ground with thesafety still on. A gentle breeze made the long grass wave. Jason suddenly feltvery foolish, and said, “You can put your hands down.” The man did. “And you canstand up, and turn around.” When the man did, instead of furious indignation,Jason saw a friendly expression on the man’s face.“I’m Father Benjamin Frank,” the man said, and held out his hand. “And I think Ican be of some help here.”Still feeling self-conscious, Jason finally shook the man’s hand, but all hecould think of to say was, “Agent Reilly.” The two of them stood there insilence for a while, the priest looking content and comfortable, but Jasonfeeling more and more silly. “Look,” he finally said, “I’m sorry about all that,but we’re all a bit on edge here, with everything that’s been going on.”“Quite understandable,” the man replied.It seemed like forever that they stood in silence until the old man spoke again.“Well, you picked a good day for working outside.” Jason faked a smile, but saidnothing.The center of town was only half a mile away, but it seemed like an hour, duringwhich neither man said anything, before Jason finally saw Red and Bridgesapproaching. Bridges walked up, his right hand outstretched to the priest. “I’mAgent Gerald Bridges, and I’m in charge here. How can I help you?” he asked asthe two shook hands. Jason glanced at Red, whose expression said that he wasn’tat all pleased with Bridges’ friendly treatment of this man.“I’m Father Benjamin Frank. As you probably know by now, my house is over by thewoods to the right there,” he said, turning and pointing over the hill behindhim. “I wanted to come out and see if there’s any way I can help work thissituation out peacefully.”“Well, are they ready to surrender?” Bridges asked with a smile.“I haven’t talked to them yet. I came here first. I was thinking I could be asort of go-between. These people know who I am, and they trust me. I’ve neverbeen a negotiator or anything like that, but I’d be happy to take messages backand forth.”“I’m not sure that will work,” Bridges responded skeptically, his hands on hiships. “In a situation like this, we don’t want a lot of movement back and forth,though maybe we can set up radio communication. Why don’t you come inside withme, so I can make a couple calls, and see if we can work something out.” AsBridges and the priest walked away, Jason could just hear Bridges saying, “Iappreciate your willingness to do this.” Jason and Red headed back toward theirown trailer.“You’re sure he didn’t have any weapons on him?” Red asked suspiciously.“Look around,” Jason said, indicating the numerous trailers, and dozens of armedagents milling about. “If he came out here with a rocket launcher, he stillwouldn’t have a chance. Besides, Red, not everyone in the world is a bad guy.”“Well, I’d be careful of that guy,” Red said, squinting his eyes in thedirection Bridges and the man had gone. “Mark my words. He may seem nice, but Ibet he just came out to do some spying, to see what we got out here. I bet he’sone of them. And I’m not sure he’s really a priest.”“We’re not exactly hiding what we have out here,” Jason replied. “And I doubtBridges took him in to show him all our tactical plans. Relax.” After a momenthe added, “Do you think he’s the guy who lives in the cabin that the searchwarrant is for? He said his cabin was over that way.” Jason pointed to theright, over the hills.“Maybe,” answered Red. “Maybe they have a spy among us, and knew what we wereplanning, and he came out to foil the plan.”“Or maybe, if it is his house, we lucked out,” Jason suggested. “Maybe Bridgeswill want to keep him out here, to make it easier while we’re in there doing thesearch.” image [../Images/image00254.jpeg] BETSY sat in the audience, watching her boss in action. “Contrary to what somecritics have dishonestly claimed,” Grant Collins was saying to a group ofreporters, “this Act does not make it illegal to criticize the government. Farfrom it. For obvious reasons, it is already unlawful to specifically encouragepeople to break the law or to tell people to engage in violent rebellion. Norational person would condemn such just and necessary laws, and this act merelystrengthens those already existing laws by closing loopholes that have beenexploited by those who seek to undermine our democratic system of government.Whether it be jihadists of the Middle East or domestic terror groups here,extremist radicals have long exploited our freedoms, including our freedom ofspeech, by hiding what is clearly the advocacy of lawlessness and violence undera thin veil of protected political speech. Well, no more. As the bipartisancommittee which proposed this bill has repeatedly explained, this is not aboutcensoring anyone’s opinions, or criminalizing dissent. Every American has theright to protest any law or policy, or to criticize the government as often andas loudly as he likes. But what freedom of speech does not guarantee, and whatthis bill will put an end to, is the open advocacy of lawlessness, murder andmayhem.”“Senator Collins,” a young male reporter with curly black hair spoke up, “I havehere the actual wording of the proposed bill, and the definition of the types ofspeech prohibited includes the following: quote, any message, spoken or written,the likely result of which would be the incitement of the violation of any law,by either passive or forceful means, end quote. Isn’t that definition a bitoverly broad? I mean, who is going to decide what is likely to make people wantto break the law?”“Precise definitions and questions about gray areas are matters which will bedecided by the federal courts, not by me,” the senator answered. “The point is,it is high time we stopped allowing hate speech, threats of violence, and theopen advocacy of lawlessness to tear the fabric of this country apart. This actdoes not outlaw any opinion, or the expression of any opinion. It onlystrengthens the already-existing laws which prohibit trouble-makers andscofflaws from intentionally inciting criminal acts and violence.”“I would like to get your opinion on a couple of examples,” the young reportercontinued quickly. “Do you personally think that uttering the followingstatements would constitute a crime under the new law? Quote, if the machine ofgovernment is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injusticeto another, then, I say, break the law, end quote. And one more. Quote, just asit is the duty of all men to obey just laws, so it is the duty of all men todisobey unjust laws, end quote. Would such statements be illegal under the newlaw?”“Again, I’m not going to bicker about specifics here, or paint myself as the onewho will make such decisions,” Grant said dismissively. “I am becomingPresident, not Emperor. If disputes arise about exactly what the law covers, thecourts will have to clarify such matters.”“Do you know who said that?” the reporter asked.“Excuse me?” Grant replied.“The quotes I read,” the reporter explained, “do you know who said them?”“Not off hand,” said Grant, starting to look annoyed.The young man smiled mischievously, and said, “The first was Henry DavidThoreau; the second was Martin Luther King, Jr.”“Let me say this,” Grant said, smiling but clearly irritated. “Clever littleverbal stunts and trick questions like that one— however misleading they maybe—will be considered legal, protected speech as long as I’m President.”“Mr. President,” came the voice of a female reporter, over top of the otherquestions being shouted.“I’m only calling on you because you called me that,” responded Grant with asmile, pointing at an attractive blonde.“Would you consider the book, Weaving an Iron Web, written by David Singh, toconstitute the type of speech that this new law would forbid?” she asked.“Like I said, that would ultimately be for the courts to decide, but if you askme personally, yes, I would say so,” he answered.“And just a quick follow-up, sir,” the blonde reporter went on. “While we waitto see how the courts will apply this law, as you said they would, how do weknow in the meantime what is or isn’t against the law to say?” Several otherreporters murmured in agreement.“Let me put it this way,” Grant answered with a wry smile. “If there’s somethingthat may or may not be interpreted as a threat against the government, or anincitement of people to commit violence or break the law, I advise you not tosay it.”“Fair enough,” the reporter said with a chuckle.PART III image [../Images/image00255.jpeg] JESSICA had dozed off without realizing it. The sound of the front door openingawakened her. Before she had fallen asleep, she had spent an hour lying in bed,psyching herself up to confront Ben about what she had overheard. She got upand, feeling a bit stiff and sore again, walked over to her bedroom door,peering through the crack to make sure it was Ben returning. She saw him takeoff his priest’s collar. Then he reached under his shirt and pulled out someelectronic device with wires attached. She didn’t know what it was, but thisseemed as good a time as any to confront him, so she swung the door open. Shesuddenly wondered if the device was a pacemaker, and was worried she hadstartled him. But Ben just raised a finger to his lips to keep her quiet, andproceeded to violently rip the wires out of the device he was holding, whichconfused Jessica even more.“I was out visiting the feds,” he said. “I volunteered to be a go-between, amediator, between them and—” he paused, “—and the people they’re after. The onlyway they’d let me come back was if I was wearing a wire.” He held up the devicehe had just destroyed. “I didn’t go out there to spy on them, and I didn’t comeback here to spy for them.” He threw the bundle in the wastebasket in disgust.“To them, everything is a war game; it’s all surveillance, propaganda,manipulation, deception. I was hoping that for once they might be open to someactual communication. I knew it was a long shot, but I wanted to try anyway.”“Ben?” Jessica began, trying to muster her courage. She could feel her heartbeating faster, and she almost changed her mind, but she was determined to sayit. “What is it that you’re not telling me?” Ben just looked at her quizzically.“I heard you and Heather talking. What aren’t you telling me? Are you keeping meas a hostage or something? Are you using me to make some deal with theterrorists, or with the government?”Ben looked down at the floor, shook his head, and gave out a long sigh.“Jessica,” he began, “what’s going on here is—the world isn’t what you think itis.”“You’re with them, those Iron Web guys, aren’t you?” she blurted out, almostinvoluntarily. “I heard you say you weren’t going to let me leave.” She wastrying to sound confident and indignant, but she was trembling, and inside justfelt scared.“Relax,” Ben said with a sigh, “you’re in no danger.” After a pause he added,“Well, that’s not exactly true. You’re in no danger from me, and in no dangerfrom any terrorists.”“How can you say that?” Jessica demanded. “They shot down my plane!” Ben thoughtfor a moment, then said, “Just have a seat, Jessica. Let me see if I can find anewscast.”She sat down on the couch, puzzled. Ben sat down in his armchair, and began tofiddle with the radio on the table next to him. He found a newscast, and theywaited a few minutes for the top stories.“I don’t understand what the news is going to tell me about why you’re keepingme here,” said Jessica.Ben shushed her. “Listen to this,” he said.The voice on the radio was speaking: “ ... now believe there may have been athird hijacker on the plane. Again, as we reported last hour, the Department ofHomeland Security has issued a statement saying that they now believe that thecrash of Flight 422 was caused, not by a scuffle or shootout on the plane aspreviously suspected, but by the terrorists taking over and then intentionallydestroying the aircraft, perhaps with a bomb. In related news, five members ofthe same group have been arrested in Idaho, on charges that—” Ben turned thevolume down.“Now they’ve hijacked a plane?” Jessica asked. “Shooting one down wasn’tenough?”“No, that was your plane they were talking about,” said Ben.“No it wasn’t,” she contradicted. “The one I was on was shot down. It wasn’thijacked. I saw the missile that hit us.”“I know that,” Ben said patiently. “Heather and I saw the missile hit, too. Andone of our neighbors saw the plane that fired it.”“It came from a plane?” Jessica asked with surprise. “I saw the missile, but Ididn’t see where it came from. I was picturing someone on the ground with one ofthose bazooka things shooting it. What kind of plane was it?”“He’s no plane buff, but my neighbor said it was a fighter jet.”“So the terrorists have jets and missiles now? Where did they get them? Is thisan invasion or something?” She thought for a moment, and then pointed at theradio. “Are you sure that that was about the plane I was on?” she asked. “Whywould the government think it was hijacked? This might be the middle of nowhere,but how could they just miss a jet flying around shooting missiles? Don’t theyhave radar, or satellites or something, to see that sort of thing?”“Yes, it was your plane. Flight 422, like the reporter just said. And the factthat they said it was hijacked doesn’t mean that they think it was hijacked,” hesaid.“What do you mean?”“I mean, maybe some people in the government would rather the public thought theplane was hijacked, even if the people in government know it wasn’t.”“Why would they want that?”“Because the image of scary terrorists taking over a plane and crashing it fitstheir agenda. Telling the truth doesn’t.”“Well, what is the truth?”“Good question,” Ben muttered, almost as if to himself. For a while the room wasquiet. “The truth is that a fighter jet shot down a passenger plane with amissile, and someone in the government is telling the media that the plane washijacked and blown up from inside by Iron Web terrorists. That’s what we know.What we don’t know is why.”Then Jessica remembered what she had heard Ben and Heather whispering.“Why didn’t you tell me this before?” she asked then. “And why don’t you want meto leave? I heard you say you thought it was better if my parents thought I wasdead.” Ben’s explanation seemed honest so far, but it was only making Jessicamore confused.“I don’t know anything for sure,” Ben answered, “but we do know this: The newshas confidently reported that there were no survivors. Only a handful of peoplein the world know differently. Whatever motive the government has for lyingabout this, you’re the only one who can—”Jessica jumped as the front door swung open with a bang. Looking up, she saw atall man, dressed in ragged, dull greens and browns, a look of angry urgency onhis unshaven face, and a rifle in his hands. She jumped at the sight. They hadcome at last, she thought. The terrorists had come to finish her off!“They’re coming through the woods,” the man barked. “Let’s go!” Jessica satstunned, unable to figure out what was going on. Who was this person? By thelooks of him, he certainly wasn’t police. Was he a neighbor warning them thatthe terrorists were coming? Or was he one of the terrorists himself? He surelooked the part, but then his words wouldn’t make any sense. “Now, right now!”the man yelled. “Drop everything, come on!” The urgency of the command broughtJessica to her feet, despite her uncertainty. Ben rose from his chair, looking,not surprised, but stern and angry. Seeing Jessica’s confusion, he took her handand pushed her firmly but gently toward the frightening stranger. The tall mangrabbed her arm, and pulled her out the door, a few steps ahead of Ben. Jessicaheard Ben’s voice behind her: “My sister, I have to—” His words were cut shortby several deafening gunshots. She turned her head to see Ben standing in themiddle of his own living room, a look of surprise on his face, one hand on hisneck, a heavy stream of blood running between his fingers, and another spot ofred spreading through the cloth of his shirt at his lower abdomen. Jessica frozein horror. The stranger dropped her arm, and she wobbled unsteadily in thedoorway. The next instant, an even louder blast came from immediately behindher, and the picture window beyond Ben shattered. Jessica screamed and crumpledto the ground, eyes closed and ears covered, as three more explosions burst inrapid succession from the stranger’s rifle behind her. Then his strong handsgrabbed her again and pulled her away from the house.He dragged her along at a run for a few yards, then suddenly dropped to theground with her. “That house, over there,” he barked, right in Jessica’s ear,pointing off into the darkness. “As fast as you can. Don’t stop, don’t turnaround. Go!” Jessica scrambled to her feet and ran like a hunted deer. Anotherseries of three gun blasts made her cup her hands over her ears. She heardyelling behind her, and more gunshots. Adrenaline coursed through her body andshe felt no pain or soreness. She dropped her hands and ran as fast as she everhad before, expecting at any moment to feel the sting of a bullet in her back.It was only about a hundred yards to the lamplight in the window of the otherhouse, and no one seemed to be following her, but it still felt like aneternity. She could hear only her own breath and distant voices, angry andurgent. A silhouette appeared in the doorway ahead of her.“In here,” a voice said, followed by “douse the light.” Jessica ran through thedoor, almost tripped over a chair, and collapsed to the floor exhausted. “Whathappened?” asked the voice. “What happened?” the voice said again. It took her amoment to realize that the question was directed at her.“I was—we were just—” she started, but she could hardly speak. She was tremblingall over, and she felt completely drained of energy, as if that run had takeneverything out of her. She heard two muffled voices talking, but she couldn’thear what they were saying. She felt a blanket being wrapped around her, andsomeone on each side of her. “Ben was shot,” she managed to say. She rememberedthe last image she had seen of Ben, and began crying silently. “We have to goback. Ben—he’s bleeding. Someone shot him.” She remembered that awful flow ofblood, and knew that no one could survive that, but tried to cling to some hopefor Ben. “There was—there was someone else. A man came in. He told us to run. Hesent me here. He’s still back there.” For a moment she hoped that the strangerwould somehow be able to save Ben. Everything seemed so unreal. How could thisbe happening? image [../Images/image00253.jpeg] JASON crouched in the darkness, inside a group of bushes, breathing hard andtrying to get his bearings. What had gone wrong? Frantically, he tried to goover everything in his head. It was the old priest’s house after all, but theyhad sent the priest back home wearing a wire, without telling him about thesearch warrant. He couldn’t have known about the raid ahead of time, and AgentBridges was back at the trailers and could hear what was going on by way of thewire the old man was wearing. How could it have gone wrong?The six of them had quietly crossed the river in two inflatable boats withtrolling motors. They had turned off the motors as they neared the other side,and paddled as quietly as they could to the bank, where they had tied up theboats. Then they had crept quietly through the woods without incident. Aboutthirty feet from the cabin, Jack had quietly checked radio contact. Then theyhad crept closer, until Jason could see the old man and the girl through the bigpicture window. He could still picture the girl: a pretty face in a sea of darkhair—hardly a person he’d expect to find in a terrorist stronghold. She and theold man had been talking to each other, and then they had both looked away fromhim and stood up, and had begun moving across the room away from him. By thenthe girl was in front of the old man, and all he could see was the old man’sback.He’d heard some yells from around the right side of the building, though hecouldn’t tell if they had come from his fellow agents or from someone else. Thensomeone behind him and to his right, maybe Red, had yelled, “He has a gun!” andthen the gunfire exploded. For a moment Jason had trained his scope on the oldman, but saw that he was unarmed, and that he had already been shot. But wherewas the shooting coming from? Had the terrorists discovered the wire on thepriest, and killed him for it?After the first gunshots, everything turned to chaos, with windows shatteringand gunfire on all sides. After almost a minute of confused pandemonium, Jasonhad heard screams which convinced him that Miguel and Sam had been hit, andmaybe others, as well.Now he crouched in the shadows of the undergrowth, trying to make sense of itall, and trying to figure out what to do next. How badly wounded were theothers? Was anyone dead? Was there still a threat? If so, where was it? Heturned in every direction, but couldn’t make out much of anything. There werestill occasional gunshots, but they were less frequent and farther away. Itsounded as if whatever was going on was on the other side of the building. Heforced himself to jump to his feet, and, in a low crouch, as quickly and asquietly as he could, made his way through the dark underbrush to the left sideof the building, hoping to flank whomever he might find out front.Once he was out of the field of light coming from the large picture window, hehad to go by moonlight. The shadows of the trees and bushes made mysteriousshapes everywhere. He saw something move and almost fired a shot beforeidentifying the shape as a cat running through the woods. He got around to theside, his back up against the log cabin, and slid along toward the front. Hisheart was beating like a sledgehammer as he prepared to look around the corner.Things were quiet for ten seconds, and he made his move, spinning around thecorner, rifle at the ready.For a fraction of a second, he saw only two things in the dim light: an angrysneer on an unshaven face, and the butt of a rifle heading for his own face. image [../Images/image00254.jpeg] BETSY noticed that every few days, another new person was being added to SenatorCollins’ staff. She walked through the array of cubicles, realizing she didn’tknow the names of half the people there. But she found comfort in being able topass through them all, and enter Grant’s inner sanctum, where most of the timeit was just him and her, as it was back when he was a new senator and she washis entire staff. Walking into the office, she heard Grant talking on the phone.“Yes, I know that,” he was saying with a tone of frustration, “but the penaltyprovisions are still mush.” There was a pause. “That’s not what I’m saying. Wedon’t want the wording to sound too punitive, but the penalties have to beclear, and right now they’re not.” There was another pause. “I don’t mind usingthe word ‘fine,’ but it would soften the effect if it was phrased as a reductionin the benefit amount, or something like that. It sounds less like we’re hittingthem on the head.” Another pause. “Okay, let me know what you come up with,” hesaid, and hung up the phone.“What was that all about?” asked Betsy.“The proposed health care bill,” Grant answered. “It’s important how thesethings are worded, even if hardly anyone ever reads the damn things.”“I thought you didn’t get involved in the legalese nitpicky details,” Betsysaid, hanging up her coat and bag. “Isn’t that what the lawyers are for?”“This isn’t about the technicalities,” he answered, “it’s about perception, andperception is everything.” He sat down on the front of her desk, as she sat downin her chair. “Think of it this way,” he continued, sounding like someone givingan economics lecture. “I can either tell you that I’ll give you a dollar if youdo what I want, or I can tell you that I’ll take a dollar from you if you don’tdo what I want. Which sounds nicer?”“The first one,” she answered. “The incentive is a reward instead of apunishment.”“Or so it would seem. But when we say it, it’s actually a punishment either way,because whatever government gives away, it has to first take via taxes. ‘I’lltax you less if you do this’ means exactly the same thing as ‘I’ll tax you moreif you don’t do this,’ but the way people perceive it is drastically different.Giving out tax credits sounds benevolent. Imposing fines sounds malicious. Nevermind that when we do it, they’re the exact same thing.”“So you want the health care bill to sound like it’s rewarding people for doingthe right thing instead of punishing them for doing the wrong thing,” Betsysaid, “even though there’s really no reward at all. Just a bigger punishment ifthey don’t do what we want, and a smaller one if they do.”“Exactly. After all, it is law we’re talking about here. We’re not just making asuggestion, or asking nicely. We’re using the power of government to make thingswork the way we want them to work. Even if it’s made to look nice, the lawalways has to coerce people into doing things the way we want them to.”“But it seems so manipulative,” Betsy said.“And it is,” Grant replied, standing up again and walking toward his desk. “Lawis always manipulation. It’s just a question of what it will manipulate, how itwill manipulate it, and to what end.”“It sounds pretty shady when you put it that way,” Betsy said.“It’s only shady when the other guy does it,” Grant said with a smile. “When wedo it, it’s necessary for the common good. When we do it, it’s called tax cuts.When they do it, it’s giveaways to the rich. When we do it, it’s nationalsecurity. When they do it, it’s war-mongering. You know how it works.”Betsy feigned a smile, but this type of talk always made her uncomfortable. Shehad never had particularly strong political beliefs either way, but she wantedto believe that what she did somehow contributed something good to society. Andtalk like this only made her feel more like someone involved in a giant scam.She could hear Sandy’s voice in her head, saying “Told ya so.”Her thoughts were interrupted by the door to the office swinging open, and apage running in. “Turn on the news,” the messenger said. “Something elsehappened in Graveston.”Wondering what it could be this time, Betsy jumped up and turned on the TV,cutting into the news broadcast in mid-sentence: “ ... tells us that a thirdremains in critical condition. According to Veronica Milton, spokesperson forthe ATF, several agents were in the process of serving a search warrant—not atthe main compound, but at one of the outlying buildings—when an unknown numberof heavily armed members of the group calling itself ‘The Iron Web’ opened fireon them. Details are sketchy, but sources inside the ATF believe that it was adeliberate ambush, set up in advance by the terrorists. There is already wordthat the agent in charge on the scene, Gerald Bridges, may be reprimanded, orpossibly even dismissed, for failing to predict or properly prepare for such anevent, a miscalculation that may have cost three federal agents their lives.We’ll have more details as the story unfolds. In other news, the Dow JonesIndustrial Average has lost another—”Betsy turned off the television, and the room went silent. She turned towardGrant, who was gazing out the window, his hands in his pockets. “It’s such ashame,” she said, which seemed to snap Grant out of a trance. “Is it ever goingto be over?”“It will be when I take office,” he said grimly. “That I promise.”“What could make people do that?” Betsy asked, looking back at the blank screen.“Whatever complaints they have, how can they possibly justify this sort ofthing, even to themselves?”“That’s the challenge, isn’t it?” Grant said, turning toward her. “Gettinginside other people’s heads. What must the world look like to them, in order forthem to behave this way?”“I’m not sure I even want to know,” she replied. “It’s like the suicide bombersin the Middle East. Whatever their beef is, how can they possibly think thatmore killing is going to help anything? How can they possibly think it’s a goodthing?”“When people build up enough hatred, and feel their cause is just, there’s notelling what lengths they’ll go to, what pain and suffering they’ll inflict onothers in the name of that cause,” Grant said. “That’s pretty much the story ofhuman history.”“How can it possibly be a just cause to destroy a great country and replace itwith chaos? How can anyone think that?” said Betsy.“I don’t know,” Grant said. “It looks more like insanity than a politicalphilosophy, doesn’t it?”“Yes, it does,” said Betsy. But internet watchers said more people every daywere sympathizing with David Singh and his followers—and Iron Web symbols werepopping up everywhere. More and more people were being drawn into this dangerousinsanity, no doubt driven to it by economic desperation and frustration with thesocial turmoil plaguing the country. For a moment, Betsy wished that thegovernment would throw aside law and civil rights, just long enough to destroythat nest of vipers. image [../Images/image00255.jpeg] JESSICA and the others—whom she had recognized as Doug and Joshua after her eyeshad adjusted to the dark—had huddled just inside the open door on the floor,with Jessica in the middle, lights off, not making a sound, for what seemed tothem like an hour—Jessica still shaking, all of their ears trained on the woodsoutside. There was a scary moment when Jessica rested her hand on her ankle, andfelt the warm wetness of blood soaking her pant leg. She was astonished that shecould have been hit without noticing it. She pulled up her jeans to look at it,but she couldn’t see the wound for the blood, and she looked away again. “Wegotta stop this bleeding, now,” Josh whispered. “Ya got something clean?” Dougglanced around, thinking. Then he took off the flannel overshirt he was wearing.“Try this,” he whispered. For a few minutes, the boys were busy sopping bloodand cutting the long sleeves off the shirt with a penknife. Then Josh whisperedto Jessica, “Just a shrapnel wound. No bullet in there.” They wrapped it astightly as they could in the shirt sleeves.Now the three of them sat in silence, eyes and ears straining for any sign oflife outside, hostile or friendly. Jessica was surprised by how well she couldsee with nothing but moonlight for illumination. “Doug, where’s that nightvision scope you got last Christmas?” Josh whispered.“It’s back at Keith’s house, and I ain’t going out there to get it,” came thenervous response.All eyes were glued in the direction of Ben’s cabin. Jessica kept imagining thatshe could see things moving out there. “I really should go get the first aidkit,” Doug volunteered after a while, gesturing at Jessica’s leg, the make-shiftbandage already soaked with blood. Doug crept off into the shadows of the house.Only then did Jessica notice the rifle leaning against the wall next to Josh,but it didn’t make her feel any more comfortable. How had she ended up in asituation like this? She was a teenage girl from a middle class family, going toa boring school in a boring little town. And now she was in the middle of a gunbattle in the wilderness of Arizona. This couldn’t really be happening. Shesuddenly felt completely alone, trapped in a strange world, surrounded bystrangers, with no idea what was going on and no idea how to get out. Her lastconversation with Ben kept playing over in her mind. “Whatever motive thegovernment has for lying about this, you’re the only one who can—” I could goout there and tell everyone the truth, she thought. I can prove that thesepeople didn’t hijack my plane. Why don’t they want me to tell the world thatthey didn’t do it?“I see something,” Josh whispered, and moved slowly to pick up his rifle.“Someone’s coming.” Jessica peered into the dark, and she could see it too: anindistinct—but this time very real—dark figure, about a hundred yards away,moving toward them. “Stay down,” Josh said, getting into a crouched firingposition, “in case I have to shoot.” The figure was still approaching, butseemed to be injured, because it was moving slowly and awkwardly. “I thinkthat’s Halen, and he’s carrying something,” Josh said at last. Jessica wassuddenly filled with hope. Could it be the stranger bringing Ben to safety? Herhopes waned again as he approached. There was no way that what he was carryingwas big enough to be Ben. Josh lowered his rifle, and whistled between histeeth.“Move it, I’m coming in,” said the approaching figure. Josh and Jessica stood upto make way, and for the first time Jessica felt pain in her leg where she hadbeen hit. They backed inside, followed by the figure. It was the tall, scruffyman Jessica had seen back at Ben’s cabin—Halen, Josh had called him. And he wascarrying a body, but it wasn’t Ben’s. “They’ve backed off, I think; I’m goingback to make sure,” Halen said, gently laying the still body on the floor. “ThenI have to get something from my house. Keep your eyes peeled. Don’t shoot atanything unless you’re sure it’s not me. I’ll be back.” With that, he steppedback out the door and disappeared, without a word about the body he had justleft with them. Jessica wondered if it was dead, but didn’t dare to move closeenough to find out. And who was it? Only she and Ben had been at the cabin whenhe showed up. Who else was there to rescue?“It’s a damn fed!” said Josh, who had apparently been wondering the same thing.In the moonlight coming through the windows, Jessica thought she could see somesort of government agent’s uniform on the body.“Who the hell is that?” Doug’s voice, coming from the darkness beyond the bodyon the floor, made Jessica and Josh both jump. They hadn’t heard him come backwith the first aid kit.“Halen’s alive,” Josh said, “and he brought us a present.”“Just what I always wanted,” Doug responded sarcastically. “Is he dead?”“No, I don’t think so,” answered Josh. “I don’t see any blood.”“Got any rope?” Doug asked. Jessica and Josh both gave him a suspicious look.“Not to hang him, bonehead,” he said to Josh. “To tie him up. If he’s not dead,eventually he’s going to wake up.”“It’s your house,” Josh said. “Don’t you have any?”“Oh, wait, I might.” With that, Doug disappeared again into the shadows.“I’ll close the door, and then let’s get farther inside,” Josh said. “Your leg,”he suddenly remembered. Jessica looked down. It was throbbing with pain now, butit didn’t appear to be bleeding much anymore. Creeping carefully on her kneesaround the body on the floor, she picked up the first aid kit and took it overto the couch against the far wall. With a grimace, she pulled off the oldbandage, afraid of what she might find. She hadn’t dared to look when Doug andJosh had first bandaged it. To her surprise, it was just a straight two-inchscratch. From all the blood she had expected something much worse. She startedworking on bandaging it with what she could find in the first aid kit. Her otherankle, the sprained one, was throbbing, too. She was astonished that she’d feltno pain during her sprint from Ben’s house to here; now she wasn’t sure shecould even stand up.Josh sat in a chair, his rifle in his hands, pointed in the general direction ofthe figure on the floor. “Come on, Doug,” he murmured to himself, “hurry up.” image [../Images/image00253.jpeg] JASON thought, just for a moment, that he was in his bed back at his parents’house, until he turned his head and felt the rope scratch against his neck. Ashe regained consciousness, the pain in his head made him wince. Opening hiseyes, he saw four faces looking down at him, barely visible in the dark room,which was lit only by two candles, one on each side of his bed. He tried to situp, but found that his hands, feet, and neck were all tied.To his left were the faces of two young men, one of them hardly more than achild, looking almost as scared as he was. At the foot of the bed was the girlhe had seen through the window—dirty, disheveled, and frightened, but still veryattractive for all that. He still had no idea who she was, but found himselfrelieved to see her alive. He saw no malice in those three younger faces—onlyfear and bewilderment.To his right was another face he recognized: the face he had seen for a splitsecond before everything had gone dark. There was no fear in that face. Therewas no feeling at all. That face scared him. “Where am I?” Jason asked, hisvoice hoarse. “I’m a federal agent, you know; you can’t keep me here.” He wastrying to sound authoritative, but his voice sounded thin and weak in his ownears.“We know who you are,” the man said in a gruff voice. “We’re still trying todecide what to do with you.”“You don’t scare me,” Jason responded, but it was a lie. At last he was face toface with a real terrorist.“That wasn’t a threat. If I was going to kill you, it would have been a loteasier to do it hours ago,” said the man. There was a light knock at the door.The girl and the two younger men jumped at the sound. “It’s Keith,” the olderman said, standing up to open the door. “I told him to bring some food and waterover.”In walked a muscular man in a dirty T-shirt and jeans, carrying some bottles ofwater and a paper bag. Jason recognized Keith Anderson from the mug shots thelocal police had shown them. So Anderson was alive and walking around, thoughJason thought he could see the bulge of bandages under the T-shirt. Andersonlooked about 30, with short, sun-bleached hair and a tanned, angular face. WhatJason noticed most were his hard, unforgiving blue eyes— eyes that bespoke ahard life. The taller man took a bottle of water from Anderson, twisted off thecap, and brought it over to Jason.“How do I know it’s not poisoned?” Jason asked. In response, the man calmlypulled out a handgun from his waistband, pulled back and released the action,chambering a round, and then just stood there, looking at Jason, the gun at hisside. “Okay, okay, I get it. If you wanted to kill me, you would have already.”The man put the gun back in its holster without a word, and held the bottle toJason’s mouth, and he drank.“Why are we feeding this jackboot anyway, Halen?” Keith asked. “He came here tokill us.”“We came here to arrest you, and let the law deal with you,” Jason said, tryingnot to sound scared. “We didn’t come here to kill you.”“Oh, great,” Keith said sarcastically. “So you only came here to take us awayand throw us in prison. And, of course, to kill us if we resisted. Why?”“Because you broke the law,” Jason said angrily.“Whose law?” Keith asked. For a moment Jason wasn’t sure what he meant by that.“The laws of the United States, of course,” said Jason. “I guess you don’trecognize that authority,” he added flippantly.“Not these days, I don’t, nor does anyone with half a brain,” responded Keith.“But exactly what laws are you talking about?”“The federal firearms laws,” Jason answered.“In this country, the law of the land is the Constitution,” Keith declared, “andnot only does it not authorize any federal gun control laws, it specificallyprohibits them. And any law contrary to the Constitution is no law at all. Eventhe Supreme Court has admitted that. On top of all that, we didn’t even breakany of your stupid gun laws. But tell me this: if the laws of your preciousUnited States of Bullshit said that no one was allowed to have any guns at all,would it be okay for you to kill or lock up anyone who refused to comply?”“I have to enforce whatever the laws are,” Jason answered. “If you don’t likethem, challenge them in court, or get Congress to change them. You can’t justignore them and expect to get away with it.”“That’s not what I asked,” Keith said, handing out bottles of water and granolabars to the others. “If all guns were banned outright, would you lock people up,and let them ask some paid-off, politically appointed judge to decide theirfate, because they refused to be disarmed?”“Look, I don’t make the laws,” said Jason. It felt more than a little weird tobe having a political discussion with strangers while tied to a bed. “There’ssome of them I don’t like much myself. But it’s not my job to decide what thelaw should be. I just enforce it.”“Yeah, you and the jackboots of every other tyrannical regime in history,” Keithsaid with disgust. “You’re just following orders and doing your job, just likethe Nazis did. And you think that that somehow releases you from allresponsibility.” He turned to Halen. “Why are we even letting this bastard live?Does he deserve pity just because he failed to kill us, and managed to gethimself knocked out? How much pity do you think he would have shown us if hestill had his gun?”“I didn’t come here to kill anyone!” Jason interjected angrily. To have thesepeople calling him a Nazi was too much to bear.“Doug, Josh, why don’t you and the girl go keep watch outside, and send David inhere?” Halen said in a low voice. David? Jason thought. David the “King ofChaos,” as the media had called him? Jason was sure this meant that he was goingto be tortured, or worse. Glancing at the girl’s expression as she left theroom, he guessed that she was thinking the same thing. He wondered again who shewas. She still didn’t seem to fit in here at all, but they didn’t seem to betreating her like a hostage.After they left, the room was silent for several minutes. Jason, still unable tomove, looked back and forth between Keith and Halen, hoping to find the smallesthint of human feeling, but he got only cold stares from Keith, and no expressionat all from Halen. Jason didn’t want to imagine what sadistic character theseguys were calling in to deal with him. But whatever Jason expected, the man whowalked through the door a few minutes later was not it. He was a tall man with ahandsome, youthful face, and the dark skin and black hair of someone from Indiaor the Middle East. He was casually dressed in blue jeans and a V-neck sweaterover a dress shirt, perfectly clean and well-groomed. He didn’t look angry, oreven worried. His dark brown eyes were friendly as he greeted Jason cordially.“I’m David Singh,” he said. “Jason—it’s ʻJason,’ isn’t it?—I’m sorry about yourpresent situation, but my friends here had to assume you were dangerous.”Despite his looks, he had no accent. He casually took a seat in a chair besidethe bed. “You and your fellow agents came here uninvited and armed to myfriend’s home, and set off this tragic chain of events.” His voice was neitherangry nor accusatory, but sounded instead as if he was simply reporting a fact.“I wasn’t there, at the first encounter or at the recent incident, so I don’tknow exactly what happened at either,” he continued. “I do know that someone,either you or the people you came here with, just shot and killed my goodfriend, Father Benjamin Frank, a man who was a threat to no one.” He paused, butJason had nothing to say. “What you may not know,” David went on, “is that oneof you also shot my wife. She was washing dishes at our kitchen sink, in ourhouse, which is a couple hundred yards east of Ben’s cabin. A bullet camethrough the wall and hit her.”“Is she okay?” Jason asked with sincere concern. He was surprised then to see asmile growing on David’s face.“Yes, she’s okay,” he said softly, “and I was hoping you would ask that first.Many, were they in your position, would think first of justifying their ownactions, or at least of denying guilt. She was only hit in the leg. It wasnothing serious.”“I don’t know what all happened,” Jason explained truthfully, “but I never fireda shot.” He could see no reason not to tell them that much, though he wasreluctant to say much more, for fear of giving them something they could use totheir advantage.“Well, that might be a good sign,” David replied, “but you are certainly notblameless. You came to our little enclave here with your fellow mercenaries, andinvaded one of our homes. One of you killed Ben, and had that stray bullet beenjust a couple of feet higher, you would have killed my wife also.”“I tell you, I never fired a shot,” Jason insisted. “I never even saw anyone Iconsidered a threat, until this guy,” he nodded his head toward Halen, “knockedmy lights out.”“This may seem like a strange discussion to be having in these circumstances,”David said, “but let me ask you this—and I want you to think hard before youanswer. No one here invaded your property, or anyone else’s. We leave otherpeople alone. We don’t take your money, we don’t tell you how to live your life.So why is it that you and your fellow agents couldn’t just leave us alone, too?Why did you feel the need to come here like this?”For a long while, Jason couldn’t think of any answer. He’d been told that thiswas the headquarters of the anarchistic cult that was terrorizing the country.And the man speaking to him was supposed to be the leader of a nationwideterrorist movement. But somehow he couldn’t imagine the man he was looking atbeing involved in any of those heinous things. Had the media gotten it wrong?Could this be the wrong David Singh?Finally he said, “Well, it started because Anderson over there resisted a searchwarrant, and an agent was killed.”“Mr. Anderson tried to keep armed invaders off his property.”“Look,” Jason said, becoming exasperated, “you talk as if it makes no differencewhether it’s legal or not. The laws apply to everyone, even if—”“Why?” David interrupted. For a moment Jason hesitated, at a loss for an answerto the seemingly silly question. “I’m asking you to really think about this,”David said, looking very sincere. “Why do I have an obligation to obey whateverthe politicians in Washington decide? Are they gods? Who made them my masters?”“They represent the will of the people,” Jason said. “The rules they come upwith are what society wants. And everyone has to obey the rules, whether theylike them or not—” Jason again struggled for an explanation, and finally settledon, “—or there would be chaos.”“That’s what you’ve been taught to believe,” David said softly. “That’s theexcuse every tyrant uses for what he does: that he’s just trying to maintain lawand order. But what chaos do you think this little group of people would havecaused, had you just left us alone?”“We had reason to believe that there were illegal weapons on the premises,”Jason answered.“No, you didn’t,” David responded, though still in a friendly voice. “That wasthe excuse you put on paper, but the real reason you came here was to make anexample out of him,” he pointed at Keith, “because he refused to submit to anunjustified invasion of his privacy and property. Isn’t that right?”“I don’t know all of the background details, and I didn’t do the application foreither warrant, this one or the first one,” Jason explained. “Someone else did,and a judge approved it. It was just my job to help execute the warrant. That’sall.”“And if something is your job, does that mean you don’t have to decide whetherit’s right or not?” David asked calmly. “As long as you get paid to do it, it’snot your fault if what you are doing is evil?”Jason was trying to think of a retort when David stood up and walked over to thebed. He began untying Jason’s right hand, as he continued speaking. “Everyone,always, is personally responsible for the choices he makes and the actions hetakes. It’s just a shame so many people hide behind the excuses of ʻauthority’and ʻrules’ to try to evade that responsibility.” He walked around to the otherside, and started untying Jason’s left hand. “You believe so strongly inenforcing whatever your masters tell you to enforce. They call it ʻlaw,’ andthey tell you that because it’s ʻlaw,’ disobeying it is automatically evil, andenforcing it is automatically good.”When both of Jason’s hands were free, David began untying the rope around hisneck. Jason saw Keith and Halen glance at each other, as if they didn’t fullyapprove of David’s actions. With Jason’s feet still tied, David walked back tothe chair and sat down again, crossing his legs and folding his hands in hislap. “Tell me, Jason, can you think of any law, past or present, in this countryor any other, which would have been completely immoral to enforce, andcompletely righteous to resist?”“Sure,” Jason said, thinking of things he had read before about various foreignregimes.“And the men who enforced those immoral laws, what do you think of them? Didthey fully understand what they were doing? Were they all evil?”“No,” said Jason. “I’m sure some were, but I think most people think they’re inthe right. Some people just don’t know when they’re on the wrong side.”“Very true, very true,” David answered. After that, both men were silent forseveral minutes.David stood up and said, “Halen, Keith, can I talk to you for a second?” Allthree walked out of the room, leaving Jason alone. A moment later, the girlwalked in with a bowl of soup. She set it on the table, and frowned at Jason’sfeet. “I don’t know how you can sit up and eat with your feet tied like that,”she said. She looked around for something to support his back, and found a fewpillows.“That’s fine,” he said. “I can sit like this.”He smiled at her as he took the soup, and the girl smiled back.“You don’t exactly seem like you fit in here,” Jason said. “What’s your name?”“I don’t think I should speak to you,” she whispered, somewhat apologetically.“They warned me not to.”“Why would they do that? Surely you haven’t done anything wrong?”“No, but ... ” Her brow furrowed again. It looked as if she wanted to tell himsomething, but she was seriously conflicted. “I just don’t know,” she hesitated.“I don’t think being innocent makes me any safer. I mean, Ben was innocent,wasn’t he? That didn’t stop you guys from killing him. You would probably havekilled me too if Halen hadn’t dragged me out of there. Ben was a pacifistpriest, for God’s sake! How could anyone want to kill him? As kind as he was tome, I’m sure he never hurt anyone. How could you just kill him like that?” Asshe spoke, her voice rose higher with emotion, and tears began spilling down herface.“Please!” Jason said, grabbing her hand, wishing he knew her name. “I didn’tkill Ben! I don’t know who did, but I never would have shot at that man! Or atyou, either. I don’t know who did. I swear to God it was never meant to happenthat way. Please believe me.”She drew her hand away. “I just don’t feel safe anywhere,” she said.Their voices had grown louder as they spoke, and suddenly the door opened again.Jason heard Halen say gruffly, “Who the hell sent her in there alone?” as he andDavid entered the room. David stood at the foot of the bed while Halen threw anunreadable glance at Jason and escorted Jessica out. Jason seethed. He couldjust imagine those vicious-looking men grilling her about what she had said tohim. As if I would do anything to hurt her, he thought.“Well,” David said, “I’ve persuaded the others here to do for you what youwouldn’t do for us. We’re going to leave you be.” After David untied Jason’sfeet, Keith walked into the room, holding a rifle. The sight scared Jason,despite David’s words, but then he recognized the rifle as his own M16 with thecamouflage covers on it. To Jason’s amazement, David took his rifle from Keith,and handed it back to him. Jason grabbed the magazine in one hand and pressedthe magazine release button. Looking down, he saw that the magazine was full.This guy had just handed him a loaded rifle. Why? Surely these people wouldn’thave made a mistake like that. Did they want him holding a loaded gun when theyshot him, so they could claim self-defense?“Now we just have to figure out the best way to get you back out of here,” saidDavid.“Just like that?” Jason replied suspiciously. “You’re letting me go? What’s thecatch?”“Don’t come back,” David said. “You only get one warning here.”“And you don’t deserve that,” said Keith.The three of them walked down the hall to the living room, where the otherswere. The lights were still off; Doug and Josh were watching at the windows. Thegirl was curled up on the couch with a warm blanket and pillow, apparentlyasleep. Halen sat on the couch next to her, his attention trained on thewindows.“So,” David quietly asked Jason, “how do we get you out safely?”“Simple. Just tell the negotiator that I’m coming back, or I’ll talk to himmyself,” said Jason. “He’ll let the team know.”“What negotiator?” asked several voices.“I know someone in here is negotiating with the feds out there.”The whole group looked around at each other quizzically, and everyone shooktheir heads. “There were never any negotiations,” said David. “They’ve neversaid a word to any of us.”Jason was sure he’d heard Bridges talking about negotiations with David Singh.“I’m going out to keep watch,” said Halen, and left. The younger men left, too.Keith seemed reluctant to leave David and the girl alone with Jason.“I don’t want to go until I know what’s going on with that girl,” said Jasonsuddenly, nodding toward Jessica. “I don’t think she’s here by choice, and Iwant to get her to safety.”“What makes you think she’ll be safe out there?” David asked.“Why wouldn’t she be?” said Jason. “Look, this place is about as unsafe as youcan get. You guys should get on the radio with that negotiator and surrenderright now. I don’t know how many of my team died back there, but no matter whatI go back and tell them, those guys will be out for blood now. You all need tosurrender right now. You may not get another chance.”Jason thought he was probably saying too much, but he didn’t care now. “If youall choose to sit here and get exterminated, that’s your choice,” he went on,with growing passion. “But I don’t want to leave anyone here who’s not choosingto stay here. Not her, and not those younger guys either. If you’ve filled theirheads with some conspiracy theory to make them think that federal agents are adanger to innocent people, then you’ll be responsible when they get killed!”“Hypocritical bastard!” Keith spat out. “Who came onto my property and shot me?Who killed our friend Ben, who only wanted this to work out peacefully? And whois it you’re warning us about right now—your goddamned buddies who are ʻout forblood’! You said it yourself! We’ve never shot at anyone who didn’t shoot first,and we didn’t kill your sorry ass, either. So don’t tell me you assholes aren’tdangerous!”“Okay, okay!” Jason broke into the tirade. “I get it, man! But listen to me. Noone’s going to hurt those teenagers if they go out there with me and surrender,right now. I swear to God.”“I know you sincerely believe that, Jason,” said David. “And I know that youjust want this girl to be safe. So do we. We have reason to believe that shewouldn’t be safe out there. But you’re right. It’s not safe here anymoreeither.”Everyone was silent for a while. Jason looked at Jessica again. In the heat ofargument, the men’s voices had risen, and Jessica’s dark eyes were wide opennow. She sat up on the couch and wrapped the blanket around herself.“I want to tell him,” she said, looking at David, “if he’ll promise not to tellthem.”“Well, I think that’s your choice,” said David. He looked at Jason. “I want youto promise—to give us your word of honor—that you won’t tell anyone she’s here.If it gets out that she’s here, she’ll be dead.”Jason looked at Jessica, and she seemed less alarmed by the statement than hewas.“What are you talking about?” Jason asked. “Are you saying—”“It wasn’t a threat,” David interrupted, looking from Jason to Jessica. “Thethreat to her life is not from in here, but from out there.” Jason had lost allsense of direction, but assumed that David was pointing in the direction of theATF and FBI trailers.“What are you talking about?” Jason asked again. “Are you saying that thegovernment would kill this girl? You people are nuts.”“Jessica? Do you understand yet? Do you understand what Ben was hiding fromyou?” David asked. “Why he couldn’t let you leave?”Jason watched her face intently. She furrowed her brow, as if deep in thought,and said nothing for a while. Then she looked up at Jason.“My name is Jessica Carlisle,” she said. “And I’m the only survivor of thatplane crash—the one the news said nobody survived. The plane I was on was shotdown by a missile. I saw it with my own eyes. The government lied when it saidthe plane was hijacked by terrorists. And I’m the only person who can prove thattheir story is a lie.”“If the people who shot down that plane find out that a witness is still alive,”David went on, “they will do anything to silence her and anyone she’s talked to.We will all die.”Jason’s eyes went from David to Jessica to David in utter consternation. Hecould see the honesty in Jessica’s eyes, but he just couldn’t believe what hewas hearing. “Is this some sort of mind game you’re playing?” he askedsuspiciously. “We know who hijacked the plane. We have the cockpit recordings.”David sighed and looked away. Jessica got up from the couch, and stood in frontof Jason. She took his face in her hands, and he could see her beautiful browneyes beginning to tear up. “Look at me,” she said. “Do you think I’m someterrorist trying to trick you? I was on that plane. Jessica Carlisle fromAbington, Pennsylvania— you can look it up in the airline records. I was flyingto California to go camping with my cousin. The plane was shot down by amissile. I saw it. I watched it coming. I watched it hit the plane. I watched itblow people apart like they were made of paper.” A tear rolled down her cheek.“By some miracle, I’m still alive. I’m not sure how, and I’m not sure why. Butif I die now, the truth will die with me. If you tell anyone I’m here, you’ll bekilling me, and everyone else here. Promise me you won’t do that.”He was still confused, but he saw the honesty in her eyes. “I promise,” he saidquietly. image [../Images/image00254.jpeg] BETSY sat at a table in the little diner, across from Sandy, watching throughthe window. In the pools of light from the street lamps, she could see snowfalling from the dark sky, leaving a thin layer of white on the cars andsidewalks.“Earth to Betsy,” came Sandy’s voice, and Betsy turned to see the waiterstanding at the table.“Oh, sorry,” Betsy said, snapping out of her daze. “Just the usual, Tom. Housesalad and a coffee.” The waiter nodded and walked away. She looked in her purseto see how much cash she had. “I keep forgetting to ask,” Betsy said to Sandy,“how’s your money situation?”“Oddly, it’s pretty good,” Sandy answered. “I got a job painting a nursery for acouple that lives a few blocks from me. It’s their first kid, and the nursery isbigger than this whole room,” she said, indicating the diner. “She wants agarden mural, and we’ve spent weeks already picking out all the flowers andplants she wants in there. So I’m set for a couple months at least.”“If I ever find out you needed money and didn’t tell me, I’m going to kill you,”Betsy said in a friendly voice. “You know that, don’t you?”“I know, I know. Well, I have hardly any expenses these days, since lover-boyleft, and as—” she cut her words short. “Oh, great,” she said in a quietervoice. “My favorite Nazi.” Betsy turned to see a familiar police officer walkinginto the diner. His name was Curtis Walters, and he stood well over six feettall, as well as being significantly overweight. He had beady, squinting eyesand short, graying hair. Betsy guessed that he was about fifty years old.Betsy had been present at several confrontations between Curtis and Sandy in thepast, and wasn’t looking forward to another one. She had never seen Curtis beingopenly hostile toward Sandy. Instead, he almost always had a smile on his face,but his constant condescending manner and insistence on pestering Sandy everychance he got bugged Betsy almost as much as it did Sandy. For a moment shehoped he wouldn’t notice them, but that hope faded in a single second, as heturned toward them, smiled broadly, and started walking over, thumbs hooked inhis waistband, looking down his nose at the two women.“How’s my favorite anarchist?” he asked with exaggerated inflection, loud enoughfor everyone in the diner to hear.“Constitutionalist, Harold. There’s a difference,” Sandy answered, soundingbored already. For some reason unknown to Betsy, Sandy always called Curtis“Harold.” She assumed it was just to get on his nerves.“Hey, I believe in the Constitution too,” Curtis said, still smiling andspeaking loudly. “I just don’t think it says what you think it says.”“Then maybe you should read it sometime,” Sandy said, looking to see if thewaiter was coming. Maybe if their food arrived Curtis would go away, Betsythought. Or maybe not.“Well, you see, I’m not a know-it-all like you, so I let the judges decide whatthe Constitution means. That’s their job, after all, and I’m pretty sure theyhave more experience at that than either of us. Wouldn’t you agree?”“Harold, what do you want?” Sandy asked in exasperation. “Shouldn’t you be outbeating up some black people or something?” The smile on Curtis’ face faded justa bit.“Ya know, one of these days your mouth is going to get you into a lot oftrouble,” he said, his tone still friendly, but his smile obviously forced.“Stop threatening me, you fascist pig,” Sandy said bluntly but calmly. It tookan effort for Betsy to refrain from smiling.“Well, you ladies enjoy your meal,” Curtis said as the waiter walked up withtheir food. “I’ll be nearby, keeping the place safe.” With that he swaggeredaway.Tom rolled his eyes as he set the plates down in front of the women. “Yeah, if acrook comes in, he’ll talk him to death,” he remarked quietly. The women smiledat him.“I know he’s an obnoxious jackass,” Betsy almost whispered, leaning over towardSandy, “but do you really think it’s a good idea to talk to a cop like that?”“How should I talk to him?” Sandy asked. She dumped a packet of raw sugar intoher coffee. “Just because a moron has a badge and a gun doesn’t mean he’s not amoron, and it doesn’t mean I shouldn’t treat him like the moron he is.”“True, but I think he bothers you just because he knows he can get a reactionout of you,” Betsy suggested. “Maybe if you just ignored him, he’d leave youalone.”“Maybe. But you know, I almost feel obligated to give him a hard time,” Sandysaid, smiling. “If I don’t, who will?” They began digging into their salads.Some movement at the other end of the diner near the cash register caughtBetsy’s attention, and she gestured for Sandy to look. There were enough otherpeople in the diner that it was difficult to hear all the words, but OfficerWalters was talking to a middle-aged man who was nervously clutching what lookedlike a backpack. The man had a foreign look—Middle Eastern, or maybe Indian.“I said, do you mind if I take a look?” Curtis was saying, his hands on hiships, towering head and shoulders above the other man.“I didn’t do anything, sir,” said the man with a thick Indian accent.“Then you won’t mind me looking in the bag,” Curtis said, reaching for it.Betsy was surprised to see Sandy suddenly stand up and head across the room at afast walk. “Sir!” she said loudly. “You don’t have to let him search you. Youhave the right to refuse.”Curtis turned on Sandy, his smile gone, and his face turning a little red. “Goback to your seat, Sandy, and don’t make me arrest you for obstruction ofjustice,” he said sternly.“Justice, my ass,” Sandy said. “You’re betting that he doesn’t know his rights.He’s obviously from somewhere else. He probably has no idea what the FourthAmendment is, and you know it.”“I’m warning you to stay out of this. If you interfere with me doing my duties—”“It’s not your duty to violate people’s rights, dumb-ass,” Sandy almost yelled,but she stopped a few feet from Curtis. The Indian man was still looking scared,barely visible to Betsy behind Curtis. “Sir?” Sandy said to the nervous man, ina much more friendly voice. “In this country, the police have no right to searchyou unless—”“I’m giving you a lawful order, Sandy,” Curtis interrupted. “You will step back,go back to your table, and let me deal with this.”“Sir, just ask him,” Sandy said in a pleading voice, not moving. “Ask theofficer if you have to give him the bag. Ask him what happens if you refuse.”“I don’t want any trouble,” the man said.“Just ask him, please,” Sandy begged. “Just ask him whether you have a choice.”The man looked back and forth between Sandy and Curtis. Curtis was obviouslyfuming, but seemed reluctant to follow through on his threat to arrest Sandy.Betsy thought that was probably because over a dozen other people in the dinerwere now watching intently. “Just ask him whether you have to,” Sandy pleadedagain.Finally, in a very timid voice, the man said, “Sir, I mean no disrespect, but isshe correct? Do I have to give you my bag?”“I was just asking if I could look at it,” Curtis replied feebly. “If you’ve gotnothing to hide, then—”“Answer his question!” Sandy commanded, looking right at Curtis. Betsy marveledat the sight of her slender little friend standing up to a man who towered overher by more than a foot, and looked to be at least three times her weight—like asapling challenging a full-grown oak tree. The diner was perfectly quiet now,and all eyes were on Sandy and Curtis.“If you’re not doing anything wrong—” Curtis began again, but after glancingaround the room, changed his tone of voice. “No, you don’t have to give it tome. I was just asking if you would agree to let me look.” Betsy watched theIndian man’s eyes widen. It was as if he was having a revelation, as if he waswitnessing a miracle.“I apologize, sir,” the man said, lowering his head, “but what is in this bag isvery personal, and I do not wish to give it to you.” Then he looked up timidly,but Curtis just looked away.“Fine, fine,” Curtis said finally, with a dismissive wave of his hand, andturned toward the counter, as if to escape the situation.There was a long silence, and no one moved. The man looked as if he was ready toleave, but hesitated, still unable to believe what had just happened. Then ayoung black woman, around twenty, at one of the tables, stood up and startedclapping. “Way to go, girl,” she shouted to Sandy. After a moment, four otherswere clapping and smiling too at what they had just witnessed. At the same time,there were a dozen or so looks of confusion or disapproval. By then the man wassmiling, and, with his head up, walked out of the diner, giving a nod of thanksto Sandy as he passed.As Sandy walked back toward Betsy, a dozen or so people started talking, mostlyin lowered voices, some obviously objecting to what had happened, some obviouslycelebrating it, and others trying to figure out what they had just witnessed.Betsy heard someone say, “What if the guy had had a bomb in there?” Sandy satdown, a broad smile on her face, though Betsy could see that her hands wereshaking. After a moment, as the sound level continued to rise, Curtis alsoturned and walked out, without a glance at Betsy or Sandy.“Ya know, even though you’re out of your mind,” Betsy said, “that was prettydarn impressive.”“All that is necessary for evil to triumph—” Sandy began.“—is for crazy hippie chicks to do nothing,” Betsy concluded, and gave Sandy apat on the shoulder. image [../Images/image00255.jpeg] JESSICA and the others sat in patio chairs in the garden area outside the frontdoor of the house, which was closed in on either side by forward extensions ofthe building. It was a large and relatively new house. Doug had explained toJessica that his parents had built this recently as a winter getaway home, andhe was allowed to live there year round in exchange for looking after the place.Around the house were assorted rock gardens, paths, and short decorative stonewalls, including one which closed in the patio where Jessica sat. Beyond thewall was a large rock garden, and beyond that was the lawn, with the grasscontinuing out of sight over the rolling hills beyond.David and his wife were talking together quietly in the corner to Jessica’sright, and Keith was nearby whittling a piece of wood with a large huntingknife. Halen had been coming and going, and said that the feds were nowhere tobe seen in any direction. He had looked everywhere for Heather, but had found notrace of her, and was beginning to think she’d been captured. Dawn was on itsway, and the sky was just starting to lighten a bit. She could just see Joshlying at the top of the slope, a hundred yards ahead of her, watching for anyoneapproaching from that direction.Jason now sat in a metal patio chair twenty feet in front of Jessica, facing thehills. His elbows were on his knees, his head hung down, as if he was deep inthought. He hadn’t said anything for quite a while, and Jessica wondered what hemight be thinking. The night before, just after Jason had regainedconsciousness, when Halen sent her, Josh, and Doug out of the room, she was surethat she’d never see him again— not alive, anyway. When she later found out thatthey had decided to just let him go, and had even given him his gun back, shewas even more confused than before. It seemed to her that the more she saw, theless she understood what was going on.She sat in her chair, trying to make sense of it all, as the sky in front of herslowly began turning from gray to orange. It had been years since Jessica hadseen a sunrise. Except for her short nap on the couch, she hadn’t slept for aday and a half. But though she was physically exhausted and in considerablepain, she wasn’t sleepy. From the woods and fields all around them, a chorus offrogs and crickets was making a happy racket.She desperately tried to fit the pieces together in her mind. A part of her hadstill been waiting to meet the vicious group of hardened criminals callingitself the Iron Web. But she was beginning to think that maybe the people she’dmet were all there was. Halen still made her uneasy. She remembered the thingsDoug had said before about him killing someone—a senator, wasn’t it?—and she hadno trouble imagining it to be true. And Keith also seemed like a bit of a loosecannon. But though those two made her nervous, she wasn’t afraid they would doanything to harm her. Were there scarier members of this elusive terrorist cultlurking around here somewhere, or was this it? She had a hard time reconcilinghow she had heard the situation reported in the news with what she had seensince being here.And she kept thinking about David. It hadn’t even occurred to her for a whilethat this could be David Singh, the ‘David’ the media had talked about—theleader of the so-called terrorist group. He didn’t seem threatening in theleast. In fact, his way of speaking and his demeanor, not to mention his Indianlooks, reminded her of Gandhi. He seemed to actually love other people, evenstrangers—even armed invaders. Furthermore, he didn’t seem to be the leader ofanything, not in the sense of a commander. A teacher, maybe. But he certainlywas no malicious schemer inciting violent actions from a bunch of brainwashedadherents. Then again, maybe his power was in being able to hide maliciousmotives under a façade of kindness. But she had a hard time believing that.She looked over at him, sitting on a wooden bench in the corner, holding hiswife’s hand and speaking in soft whispers to her. Only an hour earlier she hadmet David’s wife, Tasha, for the first time. Tasha was a stunning Filipinobeauty with the face of an angel and straight black hair down to her waist. Shewore a colorful flowery dress that looked as if it came from a tropical island.When she spoke at all, she spoke softly, and seemed very shy. She had a bandageon one leg, but walked with only a slight limp, and even her limp was graceful.“If you walk out right past David’s garden shed, way over there,” Keith wassaying to Jason, pointing over the hill Josh was lying on, “you’ll still bebehind the last rise, so they won’t shoot you by accident. Halen can be on hisroof with the scope. He’ll radio us if the coast is clear. You got this hugewhite flag, so hopefully they won’t shoot you, but if you—”“I’m not going,” Jason said suddenly. Everyone looked at him.“What?” Jessica heard herself say.“I was up all night thinking about it,” Jason answered. “I’m not exactlythrilled about the situation, but I’m not going back.”“Why not?” asked David, who didn’t seem particularly surprised by Jason’sdeclaration.“Well, what are my choices?” Jason asked. “I go out there, and I have to saywhat I saw in here. Even if I don’t mention Jessica, I have to tell themsomething: who’s in here, how many of you there are, what weapons you have,which buildings you’re in. I know the guys out there. Like I said, with agentsdown already, they’ll be out for blood. And if they knew how few of you thereare in here, they’d probably come in with guns blazing. If I tell them thetruth, you’re all dead. And if I lie, my career is over, and they might evenprosecute me for it.”He paused for a minute. “And if what you say is true, if Jessica was really onthat plane—and I don’t want to believe it, but I can’t think of a reason notto—and if it was really shot down, then I just—I don’t know. Ya know, I don’tbuy your attitude, thinking you’re above the law, and thinking you can dowhatever you want, but ... you’re not ... ,” he hesitated again. “You’re not whoI imagined would be in here.” He looked at Jessica. “And if I go out, and justwalk away, and never say anything about it, and then things go badly—I’d feellike a coward.”“Nothing like a pretty girl to bring out a little courage in a guy,” Keithlaughed, still whittling away at the hunk of wood.“True,” David said, glancing at his wife with a smile. “But I, for one, am quiteimpressed. You show concern for those you were taught to hate, and told todestroy.”“At least the pretty ones,” Keith added snidely.“Well, even that is a good sign,” David responded. After a pause, he added,“Your decision also makes me feel better about something else.” He turned toface Jason. “If you leave, and they somehow find out that Jessica was here, evenif we’re all dead by then, then to them you yourself become an inconvenientwitness.”“I don’t buy all the conspiracy stuff that you believe,” Jason said, “and I’mnot so distrustful of everyone in government as you are, but I gotta say, whatI’ve seen and heard here bugs me. I don’t pretend to know what all is true andwhat isn’t, but something’s not right here.”“Wow, that’s the understatement of the year,” remarked Keith.“Bottom line is, I can’t in good conscience leave here without Jessica,” Jasonsaid, “and I can’t leave here with her, either.”Jessica started as Halen appeared next to her from inside the house. She hadn’theard a sound. Though she still found him to be very intimidating, she wasbeginning to be glad to have someone like him on her side. Then she wondered,when had she decided whose “side” she was on? And based on what? The answer tothat was actually quite simple, she realized. At this point, she wasn’t at allscared of what the people now sitting around her might do, however misguided orcriminal they might be, but she was deathly afraid of what the people beyondthose hills might do, even if they did it with the best of intentions and afeeling of righteousness.“Let me guess,” she heard Jason saying to Halen. “That was you who took out ourspeakers.” She saw Jason point toward the house, and she turned to see anenormous rifle leaning against the wall, which Halen must have just put downthere.“Try some Metallica next time,” Halen said, taking a seat near David and Tasha.What on earth were they talking about? Halen seemed to be joking, but there wasno smile on his face. She wondered if he even knew how to smile.“Got a question for you,” Halen said, looking hard at Jason. “If saving Jessicameant ending your career, would you do it?”“Yes,” he answered without hesitation, and Jessica looked at him with surprise.“But I suspect that either way, my career as a fed is over anyway.”“Jessica can’t just walk out there,” Halen continued. “We all know that. Nor canshe just go home, even if we had a way to get her there, which we don’t. Shecan’t just turn up alive without anyone noticing. However, there might beanother way.” By now Jessica was listening intently. “If we can get Jessica toMexico, and she can get her story on tape, and get it to the media, after thatit wouldn’t do the feds any good to kill her.”“How exactly are you going to get her to Mexico?” Jason asked with obviousskepticism.“Well, the hardest part will be getting her out of here without being seen,”Halen answered. “The only way I can think of is the tunnel. It won’t be easy toget to, and I don’t know what we’ll find at the other end, but there’s an oldtunnel the kids dug years ago.”“Yeah, Bernie and I dug it when we were little,” explained Doug. “It goes fromour old clubhouse to underneath the road bridge. But will that be far enough?”“I don’t know,” Halen said flatly. “If we can follow that drainage ditch up intothose woods, I think we’d be in the clear. Or rather, you’d be in the clear,” hesaid, looking at Jason and Jessica.“You’re not coming?” Jessica asked, her hopefulness dropping several notches.“No,” Halen answered. “I can’t walk away from this, but I’ll get you as far asthe woods, if I can. From there, it’s gonna be up to you, Jason, to get hersafely to Mexico. If you make it out of here without being seen, no one will belooking for either of you out there. But you’ll have to find a way across theborder.”“I can do that,” Jason said.“Then we’ll go just after dark tonight,” Halen said, standing up. “I have somestuff to get ready in the meantime. You two go inside and get some sleep.” Withthat, he walked into the house.After that the group was quiet, and Jessica sat, deep in thought, wondering ifshe was up to the challenge of escaping from here, like some fugitive criminal,and traveling to Mexico. She had always talked about wanting to have anadventure, but this was way beyond anything she had ever imagined.Some movement out in the field in front of the patio suddenly caught herattention. She watched as a doe and two young deer trotted into view just beyondthe garden, not a hundred feet away, from around the right corner of the house.The young ones frolicked without a care across the dew-covered grass. The motherfroze for a moment, looked toward the people on the patio, twitched her tail afew times, and led her young ones onward, out of sight around the far corner ofthe house. Jessica looked back at the others, and they had seen, but saidnothing, as if that sort of thing was commonplace here. In that moment, shefound it hard to believe that her situation was as serious as she knew it was.She thought to herself that if she could have frozen time for the outside world,and stayed here forever, rather than face what lay ahead, she probably wouldhave done it. image [../Images/image00253.jpeg] JASON woke up, still sitting in a chair out on the patio. He had nodded offwithout realizing it. The sun was now setting behind the house, which cast along shadow that covered the patio and garden. Throughout the day they haddiscussed their escape plan, and Jason thought it sounded at least somewhathopeful.“Who did they tell you was in here?” Doug asked. It took Jason a moment torealize that the question was directed at him.“What?” said Jason.“Who did they tell you was in here? What were you expecting?”Jason thought for a minute. “I don’t know what I expected to find here, but thiswasn’t it,” he finally answered. “They told us David Singh was in here, themastermind behind all the terrorism that’s been going on, and some of hisfollowers. No one knew how many.”“God, you don’t put much effort into finding out who someone is before you gotry to kill them, do you?” Keith asked, admiring the chunk of wood he hadwhittled down to almost nothing.“I wasn’t trying to kill anyone,” Jason said defensively. “But I also don’tthink I can thumb my nose at the law and get away with it.” At that moment hesuddenly did not feel at all comfortable about being on such friendly terms withthe people he was supposed to be investigating, if not arresting.“Even if you have a problem with Keith,” Doug said, “which almost everyonedoes,” he added with a smile, at which Keith threw a large wood chip at him,“what did the rest of us do? You laid siege to the whole neighborhood. Like,what did Ben ever do? For that matter, what did I ever do? I don’t even own agun.”“Sissy,” Josh said to Doug with a smile. Doug picked up the wood chip and threwit at Josh, but missed.“But you’re a member of the group, aren’t you?” Jason asked. “Except forJessica, you’re all part of the Iron Web thing, right?”“The Iron Web is not a group of people.” Jason turned around, and saw that itwas David who had spoken. Jason hadn’t noticed him there, sitting quietly in thecorner. “I know it’s hard to put aside what you’ve been told over and overagain,” David went on, “but it’s not some secret club that one gets membershipin. It’s just a concept.”“Like a religion or something?” Jason asked, puzzled. “Some church that saysit’s okay to break the law, not pay your taxes, and act like you can do whateveryou want?” He was still feeling as if he shouldn’t be too friendly with thesepeople.“Man, open your damn eyes,” Keith said calmly. “After all you’ve seen here, youstill believe what your jackboot bosses tell you?”David continued in a calm voice. “The Iron Web concept isn’t nearly thatcomplicated. It’s no more complicated than this: I own me, and you own you. Ihave no right to take your time, your efforts, or your property, unless youvoluntarily choose to deal with me. And the reverse is also true. However manypeople you get together, and whatever you call your club—a gang, a government,or a soccer team—you have no right to take what is mine unless I choose to giveit to you. We can make any deal that’s agreeable to both of us, but no one hasthe right to take what I produce, what I earn, and what I have acquired bytrade, without my consent.”“Well, so far I agree,” Jason said.“No, you don’t,” Keith commented with a tone of contempt.“What do you mean, no I don’t?” Jason responded. “Don’t tell me what I—”“Sorry, but he’s right,” David said softly. “Think about it for a moment. Do youbelieve in taxation?”“Well, I’d like there to be less,” Jason said, “but as long as—”“I mean in principle,” David continued. “For example, do you believe that thegang that calls itself the IRS has the right to steal a chunk of what I earn,whether I agree to it or not?”“I’ve heard about the claims that the tax is unconstitutional,” Jason said, “butthe courts—”“I’m not talking about its legality,” David cut in. “I’m asking, on aphilosophical level, do you believe that government has a right to demand apercentage of what each of us earns?”Jason thought for a moment, and then said, “Well, yeah, I guess I do. Like Isaid, I wish they’d take a lot less, and spend it better, but by living in thiscountry you agree to pay the taxes that fund the—”“Oh, brother.” This time it was Doug interrupting with annoyance. “How on earthdoes standing on this continent somehow count as agreeing to be continuallyrobbed? What if I decided that, by living in this country, you’re ʻagreeing’ tolet me slug you in the face?”“Look, that’s how the system works,” Jason said, starting to get angry. “If youdon’t like it, you can try to elect someone who—”“That’s the point,” David said, his voice still low and steady. “If I ownmyself, I don’t need anyone else’s permission to keep what I earn. I don’t needany government, any law, anything or anyone to say it’s okay. If I ownmyself—and I do—I’m the only one who has the right to decide what is done withmy efforts, my time and my property. If I need someone else’s permission,whether it’s one person or the population of an entire country, it means Ibelong to them, not to me. It means I am their slave. I’m not. I own myself.”“But taxation isn’t slavery,” Jason argued. “It’s the way we all chip in for thethings that we can’t buy individually, like roads and police.”“Police like you?” Doug asked, and chuckled. “Gosh, why wouldn’t I want to payyou for the privilege of having you do an armed invasion of my property?”“We can get into this later,” David said, as if trying to defuse the buildingtensions. “The point is, the Iron Web symbol gives people who believe that everyindividual owns himself, and that no one owns anyone else, a way to express thatbelief, a way to tell others that he believes that. Using this symbol, peoplewho believe in true freedom can create a network, through which they can tradeand make deals, without intrusion and interference by all the federal, state andlocal bureaucrats and thieves.”“In other words, it’s a way to do things under the table, so you don’t have topay taxes,” Jason commented, still sounding indignant.“Among other things, yes,” David answered. “Now, you view that as some horriblesin, because—like most people—you believe that everyone has a moral obligationto hand over a portion of what he earns to the politicians and bureaucrats. Andyou think it’s a crime— a sin, really—for anyone to try to get around thatsupposed obligation. In short, you believe we all belong to the politicians—thatwe are their slaves—and that they have the right to take from us whatever amountthey decide, for whatever reason they decide.”“It’s the people that decide,” Jason objected. “You can run for office if youthink you could—”“I own myself already,” David interjected. “I don’t need a law that says so. Idon’t need any election to say so. You see, I’m so extreme that I believe thatall men are endowed with the same unalienable rights, including the right tolife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”“Well, the Founders you’re quoting believed in taxes.”“It is true that they gave their new government the power to tax,” Davidreplied. “It was one of several fatal departures from the philosophy of theDeclaration of Independence. In reality, the government they set up with theConstitution violated the principles of the Declaration almost as much as KingGeorge did. Anyway,” he continued, shaking his head, “I keep getting off point.I was trying to tell you what the Iron Web is, whether you philosophically agreewith it or not.” He picked up a stick, and cleared the leaves off of a piece ofsoil in the garden, and made nine dots, in a three-by-three grid.“Imagine just nine people who share this belief—who don’t think they needanyone’s permission to associate and trade with others. They all display thesymbol of the Iron Web, so people who share the belief can find each other. Anyof them can make deals with each other. This guy might hire that guy to mow hislawn. This guy sells a car to that guy.” David began drawing lines in the dirt,from one point to another, as he spoke. “It makes a giant network—a blackmarket, really—that is just about impossible to break. If you do the math, justnine people make thirty-six different ways for people to trade. The governmentcan eliminate an individual, by locking him up or killing him,” he explained,crossing out one of the points, “but it does nothing to the rest of the web. Asthe number of people involved rises, the number of combinations risesexponentially. If you had a million people doing this, there is nothing in theworld that any government could do to stop it, or to control it, or tax it, nomatter how intrusive or vicious government became. The system can’t beinfiltrated, because there is no system. The organizers can’t be discovered andshut down, because there are no organizers. It’s not some gang or club. It’s anidea. The idea that people—each person owning himself, and each knowing that heowns himself—can circumvent and defeat any parasite class that tries to controland exploit them.” David dropped the stick on the ground and sat back in hischair. “That’s what the Iron Web means.”“It still just sounds like a way to break the law, and to get out of payingtaxes,” Jason remarked.“And it is. Again, you view that as a horrible thing, because you view obedienceto authority as a virtue, because you think the politicians have a legitimateright to rule the rest of us. As a result, you think that it’s inherently evilto disobey their commands, their ʻlaws,’ including the ones that say that youand I aren’t allowed to trade without telling the politicians about it andgiving them a cut. Some of us think that’s insane. And by using this symbol tofind each other, we can try to avoid all the regulators, inspectors, licensingbureaucrats, tax collectors, and all the other busybodies who stick their nosesinto other people’s business,” David said. “In other words, it’s a way to try tolive free, even in a world of slaves and masters.”“So you don’t believe in licenses, either? Anyone should be allowed to do brainsurgery in his spare time?” Jason asked sarcastically.“Yes, if the doctor and patient both agree,” David answered. “The other side ofowning one’s self is being responsible for one’s own actions and choices. If I’mstupid enough to let some average Joe cut my head open, then it’s my own faultif I die from it. If I decide to build my own house out of one-by-two pieces ofbalsa wood, and it falls over, it’s my fault, and my loss. No one has the rightto tell me that I can trade only with whomever they think I should trade with.”“I still don’t buy it,” Jason said, shaking his head. “You want America to befull of substandard housing that falls over, and back-alley brain surgeons?You’d never know who was for real. It would be chaos.”“In nature and in human society, from uncontrolled chaos an amazing ordernaturally flows,” David explained. “From controlled and managed order,destruction and disaster flow. We’re all trained to think that civilizationcomes from the institutions of authority and government controlling everyone andeverything. Not even close. Civilization comes from individuals recognizing therights of other individuals. It comes from mutually voluntary interaction, wherewe all treat each other like equals. If you want to see what comes from theinstitutions of authority and government, try visiting a war zone, or a publichousing project.”“The guy is a mercenary for the parasites,” Keith cut in. “He’s never going tounderstand.”Jason was beginning to hate that man. He ignored the insult and spoke up again.“I don’t buy this whole philosophy, but what I really don’t understand is howyou get from this to advocating violence. Why all the guns? Don’t the people youshoot at own themselves, too? How does that work?” It came out sounding moresarcastic and bitter than he had intended.“If I own myself, and what I acquire by work or trade,” explained David, “then Ihave the right to protect that property, just as I have the right to protect mylife. In fact, whatever I work for or produce is a part of my life, because Iused up a piece of my life acquiring it. And if someone tries to take it from meby force, I have the right to use force to stop him. Would you tell someone whois being car-jacked, ʻYes, it’s your car, but you have no right to stop anyonefrom taking it from you’? Of course not. That makes no sense. The right ofownership has to include the right to defend what you own from any and allintruders and thieves, or the right is meaningless.”“Okay, I see your point, but I think you’re making things simpler than theyare,” Jason said. “The utopia you’re describing sounds nice, but it wouldn’twork in the real world. In the real world, there has to be a set of rules, andsomeone has to enforce them.”“Incidentally,” David said, “what I’m describing here is just what I personallybelieve. Even the others here don’t agree with me on everything. Keith here is aConstitutionalist. He wants the country to have a government the way theFounders envisioned it, whereas I don’t think even that small amount ofauthority is legitimate. And Ben was a pacifist. He understood the right ofself-defense, but for himself, he refused to resort to violence for any reason.How ironic that he was the first to die: probably the only one here who wouldn’thave resisted. The point is, this isn’t some monolithic cult of people who haveall memorized some set of religious teachings. Even in this small group righthere, we’ve got some major differences of opinion. But we get along with eachother because we all agree that people should be left in freedom so long asthey’re not attacking or defrauding anyone else.”“And what if someone does rob or murder someone? What if some guy claims to be acertified brain surgeon and kills someone who believed him?” Jason asked. “Yourprinciples sound good, but if there’s no government to enforce them, what goodare they?”“We all have the right to defend ourselves, and others, from violence andfraud,” said David. “We don’t need government or any special authority forthat.”Jason had never heard such an idea, and didn’t know what to say. After a periodof silence, Doug asked Jason, “Can I ask you a question?”“Yeah,” said Jason.“Why did you come to our homes with guns drawn?”“To serve a search warrant. You know that,” Jason replied.“Yeah, I know that,” Doug retorted. “I’m asking what the moral justificationwas, not the legal excuse. Personally, I’d need a really damn good reason beforeI’d go invade someone else’s property and aim a gun at him. Someone showed you apiece of paper and told you to do it. That was your justification?”“A judge decided that there was probable cause to think that we would findillegal weapons here,” Jason said, starting to feel defensive again.“What kind of illegal weapons?” Doug asked.“Machine guns.”“You mean like the one you brought with you?” Doug asked, pointing at the rifleleaning against Jason’s chair. The question caught Jason off guard, and he saidnothing for a moment. “Do you see anything odd about that?” Doug asked. “I don’teven own a gun, but I’ve been shooting a few times. I’ve never aimed a gun at ahuman being. I don’t even like to hunt. But let’s pretend we actually hadmachine guns here. Let’s pretend I had an M16, just like the one you have. Let’ssee if I have this straight. You came to my property, carrying a machine gun,when I hadn’t hurt or threatened anyone, based on the rumor—the false rumor, bythe way—that I might have my own M16 here, the same kind of gun you broughthere. Doesn’t that seem just a bit hypocritical to you?”All Jason could think of to say was, “I’m authorized to have a machine gun.” Inthe midst of the debate, it again struck him as curious that these people daredto let him have his loaded rifle with him all this time.“All that means is that some politicians said you can have one, and said wecan’t,” David said calmly. “Would you accept that double standard with otherrights, too? If they said you could speak your mind, but we aren’t allowed to,would you come in here to arrest us for saying what we think? What other rightsdo you have that we don’t? Aside from it not even being true, all your bossesalleged was that we were doing something that you do every day: possessingmachine guns. And for that you invaded our property with guns drawn, and some ofyou even shot at us, and one of you killed Ben. And then you wonder how we canpossibly justify having guns to defend ourselves. If we showed up at your ATFoffices, guns drawn, demanding for you to surrender your guns and let us takeyou away and put you in cages, would you feel justified in defending yourself?If we started shooting at you, wouldn’t you return fire?”“It wasn’t supposed to be a shootout!” Jason said, almost shouting. “It was justsupposed to be a search.”“A few days ago I had to search for my car keys,” David said. “I didn’t think tohave a machine gun with me. You brought guns here because you intended totrespass on our properties and rummage through our houses and belongings,whether we wanted you to or not. Isn’t that right?”When Jason didn’t speak, Doug broke in. “When you come onto my property, armedand with the intent to do something against my will, when I haven’t done a damnthing to anyone, don’t pretend that I’m the bad guy and you’re the noble hero.You’re not.”“I didn’t say I was a hero,” Jason replied, feeling more and more uneasy. Hedidn’t want to admit it, but he knew they had a point. If anyone ever tried todisarm him, he wasn’t just going to go along with it quietly.After a moment of silence, David spoke up again. “If your friends came chargingover that hill right now, would you use that rifle on us?” He pointed to therifle leaning against Jason’s chair.Jason immediately said “No,” and meant it. After a moment, he added, “But nowthat you mention it, it’s probably better if you take it. If they did show upright now, it would look better if I’m unarmed.”“Instead of them finding you sitting around chatting with known terrorists,”Doug said with a smile, “with a rifle handy, and doing nothing about it?”“Something like that,” Jason responded, and had to chuckle. “God, this is somessed up.” The group got quiet again.Doug stood up. “I’m going in to see what the news is saying,” he said, andwalked into the house.Jason thought of his parents, and wondered how they were handling this. Whatwould the news be reporting about him? Would they say he was likely dead, orassume that he was being held as a hostage? For his parents’ sake, he hoped forthe latter.He jumped at a loud thud right next to him, and looked up to see Halen standingthere, looking even less cheerful than usual. Looking down at the table besidehim, Jason saw some sort of handheld electronic device, next to a tiny blackobject with a wire sticking out of it.“Was this your doing?” Halen asked bluntly. Jason looked at Halen, and back atthe objects on the table. It took a moment before he figured it out.“A bug?” Jason asked. Then he shook his head. “No way. I didn’t bring thathere.”“Then how the hell did it get in here?” Halen asked, leaning over, his faceinches from Jason’s. “Did you stay here because of your conscience, or did youstay to be a spy?”“I don’t know how it got here,” said Jason, trying to think. “Sometimes they canshoot them in with a dart gun, but it would be inside a little missile-lookingthing.”“It wasn’t,” Halen said flatly, still inches from Jason’s face.“They might have snuck it up here on foot,” Jason suggested, starting to feelnervous. “I don’t know.” He knew he hadn’t done it, but he also knew that, toeveryone else, he was the obvious suspect.“I have enough motion sensors and infrared cameras set up around here now that Iseriously doubt they brought it in on foot,” Halen answered.“Has anyone come here in the last few days that you didn’t know really well? Ormaybe they snuck it in weeks ago,” Jason said, trying to come up with someexplanation that might get him off the hook.“I do regular sweeps of the place,” Halen said, “and this was not hereyesterday.”“Where exactly was it? Was it inside or out?” Jason asked, but Halen just staredat him. “Look, I can see why you suspect me, and why you don’t believe me when Isay I didn’t do it. But I didn’t.” He pointed at Jessica. “If nothing else, Iwouldn’t put her at risk that way.”“The bug was out at the side porch, where we hardly ever go, so I doubt the fedscould hear anything through it,” Halen said, finally standing up straight, whichgave Jason a feeling of relief. “And that is the only thing that makes me thinkthat you didn’t do it,” Halen added. “You would have put it in a more usefullocation.” Jason glanced over at Jessica, who had a hand over her mouth and alook of shock on her face. He thought he could guess what she was thinking: didthe bug mean that the feds now knew she was here?“No, it’s disabled now,” Halen said to Jessica, as if he were thinking the samething. “And I doubt they heard anything out where it was.”“Oh, man,” Jason said, remembering something from many months earlier. “Halen,how small a thing will your motion detectors detect?”“Anything bigger than a rabbit, they’ll pick up,” Halen said.“I think I know how they did it. Can you show me where it was?” Somewhatreluctantly, Halen agreed.Jason followed Halen into the house, down the stairs to the basement, out theback door and around to the left, to a small side porch that he hadn’t seenbefore. Halen pointed to where he had found the bug, in the corner on top of theconcrete slab of the porch.“Yeah,” Jason said, thinking to himself. “They would have gone for the frontporch, but there’s that little wall and the garden. Here they have a straightshot,” he said, pointing to the grass which came up level to the porch. “Monthsago,” he began explaining, “I saw them playing around with a tiny littleremote-control car, I mean like this.” He put his hands about four inches apart.“It even had a camera on board, infrared, so they could see what it saw. Theyprobably snuck it in at night.” He thought about the perimeter of the house.“Yeah, I think this was the only place they could get it to. There are walls andgardens everywhere else. It can’t go over anything that rough. It could justbarely handle the grass here, I think.” Halen seemed satisfied with the theory,and went in through the porch door, Jason following. “It wasn’t even an agencything,” Jason said. “It was one guy I know, electronics geek, who had made ithimself out of various parts.”“Well, they actually did us a favor,” Halen said. “It tells us they probablydon’t have any other bugs in here, or they wouldn’t have bothered going to allthat trouble just to put another one in a useless location. But also,” he added,as the two of them walked through the living room and out onto the patio again,“it gives us a way to send them a message. I didn’t destroy the thing, I onlydisconnected the battery. If we need a way to give them information, or a littlemisinformation, now we have it. I’ll have to think of the best—”“Jessica, come quick!” they could hear Doug’s urgent voice calling behind them.Halen and Jason turned and stepped back into the living room, where Doug wasfiddling with the radio. “I think you should hear this,” he was saying toJessica, as she rushed into the room from the patio. He turned up the volume onthe radio.The voice on the radio sounded exhausted and depressed: “Nothing will bring herback. I can’t even describe the pain we feel— a huge emptiness, like everythinggood has gone out of our lives.”Jason watched Jessica’s face as it took on a look of profound anguish. “It’s mydad,” she choked out, beginning to tear up.“She was so beautiful, gifted, and just ... good,” her father’s voice continued,with some difficulty. “What kind of monsters cut short a life like that?” Therewas a short pause. “To think of all the other families who are having to gothrough this is just incomprehensible.” His voice took on a grim, angry tone:“All we can do now is whatever it takes to make sure no one else ever has to gothrough this.”A male reporter’s voice then spoke up. “Again, that was the father of JessicaCarlisle, a young woman just out of high school, just one of the hundred andseventy-eight people whose lives ended as a result of the hijacking of Flight422. Comments from the relatives of other passengers on that flight have rangedfrom fury at the terrorists to pity for them. But one thing they all share isthe conviction that, whatever it takes, we cannot ever allow this to happenagain. This is Brian Folden, reporting for KTC News just outside—” The radioshut off with a loud click. Jason watched with a feeling of helplessness asJessica broke down and wept.“Doug, come with me,” Halen said, and walked out of the room with him. Jasonknew it had been for Jessica’s sake, and thought better of Halen because of it.Jason went to Jessica and put his arm around her shoulders, gingerly, not surewhether she wanted comfort from the likes of him. “We’re going to get you out ofhere,” he said. “You’ll get back home. You’ll see your folks again. I’ll get youout of here alive,” he said. “I promise.”After a few minutes of silence, during which Jessica regained her composure,Halen walked into the room and said, “Time to go.” Jason turned to see Halenstanding there, dressed in his ragged greens and browns, holding a crossbow witha scope on it.Halen turned to Jessica and held up a small backpack. “This is for you,” hesaid. “Granola bars, beef jerky, and all the money we could find. I want you tohave it in case we get separated. I couldn’t pack much more or it would hamperyou.” Jessica nodded and snapped the straps together. “This one’s for you,Jason,” Halen said. “Yours is just food.” Then he handed Jessica a ragged, darkgreen flannel shirt. “Wear this over your clothes until you get to the woods,”he instructed. “Then throw it away. Jason, you’ll blend in well enough at nightas you are. Besides, if we’re spotted, the uniform might keep you from gettingshot. Are we ready?”Jason nodded, trying to look confident and hopeful for Jessica’s sake. “It’sbeen nice visiting,” he said with a smile, “but I’m ready to get the hell out ofhere.” There were quick, awkward goodbyes all around, and then Halen led Jasonand Jessica down the stairs to the basement and out the back of the housethrough the glass sliding door. Jason felt an unseasonally warm breeze on hisface.“Stay close on my tail,” Halen said quietly. “Move when I move, stop when Istop.” He flipped a switch on the scope on his crossbow, and only then did itoccur to Jason that it was a night vision scope. “Let’s go.” He set off at aquick walk around the house, and Jason and Jessica hurried to keep up.The sky was almost black, but there was enough light to see a little. Theywalked right out into the open field, bearing a bit to the right. They creptsingle file, Halen in front, Jessica in the middle, and Jason bringing up therear. Suddenly Halen stopped. “I can see people over the hill, just the tops oftheir heads,” he said in a low voice, scanning the horizon through the scope.“Keep going, but crouch down.”They were approaching a house, which Jason believed to be Halen’s. It was lit onthe far side with floodlights, but the side facing them remained dark. As theygot closer, Jason could hear a couple of voices over the rise. He didn’trecognize either of them. The lights were on inside the house, and he could seeshadows moving around inside. Looking around, Jason noticed a small squarestructure, about a hundred feet closer to them than the house.By now Halen had the crossbow hung across his back by its strap, and wascat-crawling, smoothly and steadily, toward the little shed, which Jason assumedto be the clubhouse Doug had mentioned. Suddenly, when they were only aboutthirty feet from the clubhouse, Halen dropped down flat on the ground and laymotionless. Jason saw Jessica do the same, and he followed suit. It was a momentbefore he heard voices approaching, and two agents came around the corner of thehouse.“The guy just gets on my nerves,” one of the agents was saying casually, as theystrolled around the house. “He’s such a brown­noser, even worse with the new guythan he was with Bridges.” Jason’s head was on its side, but he could see thelight from a flashlight dancing around the area. He prayed the light wouldn’tland on him.“It’s not gonna get him anywhere, anyway,” the other agent was saying, as theywalked closer. “Reynolds is just as disgusted with him as you are.” By now thevoices sounded right on top of them, less than ten feet away, but Jason didn’tdare to look up. He closed his eyes and tried to relax, desperately hoping theagents would keep going.“I doubt the guy will last long,” said the first agent. “I don’t know anyone whoactually trusts him.” It sounded to Jason, to his great relief, as if the agentshad gone past and were heading around the far side of the house. After thevoices faded, he looked up and saw that the coast was clear.Halen was up and crawling again, and quickly disappeared into the darkness ofthe clubhouse, followed closely by Jessica. Jason scrambled in as quickly as hecould. It was nothing more than a kids’ fort, about six feet square, with onedoor, facing the way they had come, and windows cut in the other three walls.The three of them barely fit inside it, and Halen motioned for Jason and Jessicato back up against the wall.After scratching around in the dirt, Halen pulled up the corner of an old,dirt-encrusted piece of carpet. From beneath that he lifted atwo-foot-by-two-foot square of plywood. Then he disappeared down into theground, quickly and silently. Jason felt for Jessica’s hand, and she went innext, as he helped lower her into the hole. When she disappeared from sight, hefollowed, carefully arranging the board and carpet so they would close over topof the hole just the way they had been.Except for the dim green glow the night vision scope cast on Halen’s face, thethree of them were now in complete darkness. “It’s a long tunnel,” Halenwhispered, “and it wasn’t made for grown-ups. It’ll be a few hundred yards ofcrawling. Just take your time, and feel your way along. Take rests when you needto. There’s no hurry at this point.”With that, the three of them set off, crawling slowly through the darkness,feeling their way across the cool soil and rock of the tunnel. The tunnel hadmany twists and turns, which Jason assumed was from the kids having to dig theirway around various rock formations.“You doing okay?” he asked Jessica in a whisper, after several minutes ofcrawling in silence.“Yeah, I’m fine,” she answered.It seemed to Jason as if they kept going for half an hour, through the seeminglyendless weaving tunnel, far beyond the distance he had expected it to be. Butthen, he realized, judging distance in a situation like this was nearlyimpossible.“Almost there,” he heard Halen whisper. “Don’t say a word until the end.” Everybreath and every brushing against the walls sounded incredibly loud in the tightspace. Jason just hoped no one on the outside could hear any of it. Afteranother twenty feet or so of crawling, they all stopped. Jason could see a thinsliver of dim light ahead, with Halen’s and Jessica’s silhouettes in front ofit.After a moment of complete silence, Halen said, “I don’t hear anyone. I have tobreak the boards loose to get out.” Jason didn’t like the sound of that, butjust crouched patiently. He heard the creak of rusty nails being pulled throughold wood, and wondered how Halen was doing it. After the first board came free,light poured in, seeming a lot brighter to their straining eyes than it reallywas. Halen carefully drew the board into the tunnel and laid it alongside thewall.Looking through the hole as Halen worked on the next board, Jason could see whatlooked like the underside of a small bridge, going over a drainage culvert. Theroad was just above them, and it was about a four-foot drop into the ditchbelow. To the left, he could just see the river. Much of the area outside seemedto be lit by artificial lights, though under the bridge was still relativelydark.The second board came free, allowing enough space for them to pass through.After sliding the board into the tunnel, Halen leaned through the hole and hunghis head down, looking both ways. He sat up again, nodded at Jason, andnoiselessly dropped into the gully, bringing his crossbow to the ready andscanning from side to side.Jason held both of Jessica’s hands as she backed out of the hole and down intothe gully. Jason followed, and the three of them sat under the bridge for a fewminutes. Compared to the tunnel, it felt brightly lit and completely exposed,but they didn’t hear any voices nearby. Uphill, the drainage ditch continued,slowly curving out of sight to the right. It was just a swale, only two or threefeet deep and about ten feet wide. The floodlights from the nearby trailers litthe ground on both sides of it, but the bottom of the ditch was in shadow.“It’s about a hundred yards up that ditch to the woods,” Halen said in a lowvoice. “Stay low, out of the light.” He suddenly stopped talking, and the threeof them froze. There was the sound of an approaching car, and then somethingthat sounded big rumbled over the bridge above them. Halen looked at Jessica.“Are you ready for this?” She nodded, but Jason thought she looked scared todeath. “I can’t cover you from in front of you, so Jason, you’re going first.Jessica, you’re second. When we get close to the woods, as soon as I know you’llmake it, I’m turning back. Good luck.”Jason got on his stomach and started doing an army crawl, pulling himself alongwith his elbows, his legs dragging behind. Once he was out from under thebridge, he felt even more exposed than before. He felt better if he looked onlyat the ground in front of him, crawling inch by inch.After ten feet or so, he rolled onto his side and twisted his head to look backand see how Jessica was doing. She was only a few feet behind, but then Jasonnoticed with horror that someone was walking over the bridge, rifle in hand. Hetried to think of some way to signal Halen without drawing the man’s attention.Before he could do anything, the man turned straight toward him, and wassquinting into the ditch straight at him. Jason didn’t feel hidden at all, butfor a moment the man didn’t seem to notice him. Jason thought he recognized theface, and tried desperately to put a name to it. The man reached behind his backand pulled out a flashlight. Turning it on, he aimed it directly at Jason,blinding him.“It’s me,” Jason whispered loudly, putting his hands up. “It’s Jason. Don’tshoot.”“What the hell are you doing down there?” the man asked from the bridge. “Aren’tyou the guy they captured?” His voice also dropped to a whisper. “Did youescape?” Jason’s mind raced, trying to decide what to say. He glanced down andsaw Jessica lying face down in the ditch, not moving.“Turn off the light,” Jason whispered, “and I’ll tell you what’s going on.” Itsounded silly after he had said it, but the other agent still seemed morecurious than alarmed.“Look, just come on up here, man,” the agent began, but then the light from hisflashlight landed on Jessica and he stopped. “Who the hell is that?” he asked,his voice rising. For a moment Jason thought of saying she was a hostage he hadrescued, but he knew he couldn’t let them get Jessica into custody. His mindraced, trying to think of a way out of this.“I got her out, too,” Jason said. “But listen, you can’t tell anyone.” Hestruggled for the right words to say. “I can’t explain why right now. Please,turn off the light.”But the agent walked to the edge of the bridge, leaned over, and shone hisflashlight at the area below him, where Halen was lying on his back, hiscrossbow raised and pointed at the agent.“Nick, wait!” Jason said, suddenly remembering the agent’s name. “Don’t move!Don’t make a sound!” For a moment the agent obeyed, frozen in indecision, anexpression of panic on his face.“Don’t do it,” Halen said, as the agent began reaching for his weapon. “Dropit!” he yelled, as Nick brought his rifle up.“Over here!” the agent yelled, bringing his rifle up to his shoulder. There wasa loud click and a sound like a hammer hitting wood, and the agent toppled offthe bridge with a crossbow dart stuck into his forehead. As he fell, his lastreflex squeezed the trigger and a rifle blast shattered the stillness.“Shit!” Halen shouted, standing up. “Back into the tunnel, right now!” Jasonjumped to his feet as Jessica did the same, and now he could see the line oftrailers along the brightly lit road, and a half-dozen armed agents now runningtoward them. “Jessica first!” Halen shouted, and, grabbing her by the waist, allbut threw her up into the opening of the tunnel. “Use this to see,” he said,handing her the spent crossbow. “Fast as you can, don’t wait for us.”By then Jason was under the bridge, and after picking up the dead agent’s rifle,Halen gave Jason a leg up into the hole. Jason blindly crawled as fast as hecould into the pitch blackness, not sure how far ahead Jessica was. He heardgunfire far behind him, but kept going. He scrambled and crawled, his knees andhands scraping painfully against the rocks. He was still hearing occasionalgunshots, but now they sounded a hundred miles away.Ignoring the pain, Jason crawled on as fast as he could, until he crashed rightinto Jessica, who sat motionless in the tunnel.“What is it?” Jason asked in a whisper.“We’re here,” came the answer. “Now what?”It amazed him how much shorter the tunnel had seemed on the way back. Jasonstood up and felt the board above him. Carefully lifting it a bit, he heardfar-off talking and shooting, but nothing that sounded nearby. He pushed as hardas he could, and the carpet and board flew back out of the way. He scrambledout, looked around, saw no one, and put his hand down to help Jessica up.“I think Halen’s coming,” she said as she crawled out of the hole. “Or someoneis coming,” she added. Jason and Jessica peered into the blackness. They couldhear a scuffling sound coming closer. “Halen?” Jessica whispered into thetunnel, but got no response. Looking terrified, Jessica raised the crossbow atthe hole.When Halen’s head suddenly appeared out of the hole, Jessica was aiming thecrossbow right at his face. Halen cracked a smile. “Good girl,” he said,climbing out, “but crossbows aren’t semi­automatic.” She seemed puzzled for amoment, before apparently realizing that the crossbow, having been fired, had nodart in it.“Our cover is blown anyway, so just run,” Halen said, pointing downhill into thedarkness. “Go!” Jason and Jessica jumped out of the clubhouse and startedrunning. At first Jason held back, not wanting to leave Jessica behind, but wassoon amazed to find that he could barely keep up with her. He glanced back onceand saw Halen following a hundred feet behind. Rounding the corner of the houseat last, Jason could just see Doug and David standing on the patio. As theyreached them, they collapsed to their knees, panting.“You okay?” David asked anxiously. “We heard gunshots. What happened?” Keithstepped out of a nearby bush, lowering his rifle.“We’re okay,” Jason answered breathlessly. “Halen’s right behind us.” The wordswere just out of his mouth when Halen walked around the corner, seemingperfectly relaxed, and not even out of breath. “Well, it almost worked,” Jasonsaid with a sigh.“You did good,” Halen said to Jason, slapping him on the shoulder. “We didn’tget out, but we all got back alive, at least.”“I hate that Nick had to die,” Jason said, trying not to make it sound like acriticism.“I waited as long as I could,” Halen said. “It was him or me. I’m sorry it hadto be either. Even one casualty is always one too many,” he said, and droppedthe rifle he was holding onto the ground.“Only one?” Jason asked. “What about the gunfight?”“I was shooting the ground,” Halen said. “It was just to buy you guys some time.They weren’t about to charge across an open field, thinking someone was shootingat them.”“Well, they know about the tunnel now,” said Jason.“Yeah,” Halen said. “It won’t help them much, since both ends are in theirterritory. But it’s useless to us now, too. Goddamn it. If that one guy hadn’tbeen there, you’d be long gone by now.” Halen looked up at Jason. “Do you thinkthey recognized you?”“Well, from the quick look I got, I recognized two of them,” Jason answered. “Soyeah, they probably recognized me, too.”“Well, I guess that makes you one of us now,” Halen said grimly. “I have to say,though, I’m pretty impressed with you. You could have gotten away yourself, butyou stayed and did the right thing.”“Fat lot of good it did,” Jason remarked. image [../Images/image00254.jpeg] BETSY looked up to see Sandy in the office doorway, and her eyes widened withsurprise. Sandy wore an elegant ankle-length, deep blue dress with a sweetheartneckline and black high-heeled shoes. “Where are you going, all dressed up likethat?” Betsy asked.“I can’t do lunch today,” Sandy said. “I’m off to prison.”“It’s about time, you radical,” Betsy kidded.“No, really,” Sandy said, “I’m visiting a guy in prison.”“Your choice of men out here isn’t bad enough?” Betsy joked. “Now you’re tryingthe prisons?”“It’s a guy I know from way back,” Sandy replied. “He’s not a boyfriend. I knewhis sister for years. He’s at a state pen in New Jersey. I have an hour until mytrain leaves,” she added, sitting down in the nearest seat.“What’s he there for?” Betsy asked.“He got caught with a bunch of weed, and got five years. He’s just over halfwaydone there. Thought I’d go cheer him up a bit.”“That dress ought to do it,” Betsy said. “Really, Sand, are you sure it’s a goodidea? Is it safe and all?”“It’s low security there,” she assured Betsy. “The murderers and psychos theykeep somewhere else. Most of the people there are just there on drug charges.”“Oh, so you’ll just be hanging out with drug dealers,” Betsy said skeptically.“Well, in that case—”“No offense, Bet, but I think selling drugs is a lot more respectable thanworking for the government.”For once, Betsy was actually offended. “And pushing drugs to kids in theplayground,” she retorted, “is that more respectable than what I do?”“Oh, you know that stereotype is a crock,” Sandy said with disgust. “Justpropaganda to vilify people who sell or use drugs, and to justify using violencein the fascists’ glorious crusade against them. Try living in a poorneighborhood, with no education, no jobs around, with a wife and kid to feed,and see what you’ll do for money.” Sandy sat down in the chair opposite Betsy’sdesk.“Okay, I’m sorry,” said Betsy, who didn’t like arguing with people she caredabout. “But it’s still not exactly a respectable profession. You know that drugsruin a lot of people’s lives.”“Not nearly as many as the war on drugs does,” came the retort from Sandy.“We’ve got over a million guys in prison in this country, just for gettingcaught with drugs. A lot of them have wives, kids, people depending on them. Andthey’re doing ten or twenty years locked up for selling a little dope orsomething. How much does that help society?”“I know, I know. You already convinced me that drug laws don’t really help, butare we supposed to just ignore the problem?”“Ignoring it would be better than this!” said Sandy vehemently. “Carlton, theguy I’m visiting today, he tells me that guys in prison are still getting drugs,I mean on the inside. You got these guys in a locked box, under constantsurveillance, with no privacy, getting searched constantly, and they stillmanage to get drugs. If they can’t keep drugs out of their own damn prisons, whywould anyone imagine they could keep them out of an entire country? It’s justidiotic, and they know it. They don’t do it because they hate drugs, or becausethey care about addicts; they do it for the power it gives them. The shreddingof the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and so much of the other illegal garbage thegovernment does today evolved out of the war on drugs. Drugs were just theexcuse for increasing their power.”“I’m still not so sure that legalizing it wouldn’t just give us a few millionaddicts instead,” Betsy remarked.“Well, I know it’s politically incorrect to say this, but people have a right tobe addicts. If they steal to buy drugs, or endanger others by driving drunk,that’s another story. But if they sit at home frying their own brains, nobodyhas a right to stop them. And anyway, the drug abuse epidemic that thepoliticians say would happen is pure bunk. Did ending alcohol prohibition makeeveryone into a drunk? No. What did it do? It immediately ended all of theMafia’s involvement in rum-running and moonshining. As libertarians like to ask,when’s the last time two liquor stores had a shootout? All of the drug-relatedviolence occurs because it’s illegal. Repeal those laws, and the price willdrop, the danger of overdose will all but disappear, and the shootouts and gangactivity will end overnight. And don’t think the bastards in office don’t knowthat. They love the crime, and the violence, and the rest of it. It gives themsomething to point at and say, ‘This is why we need more power and money, tofight against this.’ They make sure things keep going just the way they are,knowing it can never be solved, and not wanting it to be solved. Then they gohome and have a drink, or a snort of cocaine. Hypocritical bastards.”“Wow, you’re really on a soapbox today,” said Betsy, laughing. “Maybe you’reright, but I don’t know how you can be so sure about their motives. You justassume that everyone here is an evil schemer. What if some of them just thinkit’s the right thing to do? What if they really think that trying to stamp outdrugs is good for society?”Sandy sighed. “I know I rant and rave a lot. It’s just, being here, inWashington, I can’t just ignore it the way I used to. It’s in my face everyday.” She sighed as she smoothed the soft blue fabric of her dress. “But toanswer your question,” she said, “I think these guys might have some goodmotives when they’re running for office, but once they’re in, once they get aninsider’s view of how it all works, they really can’t miss the truth. Inside themachine, people learn fast what the game is really about, and it’s not aboutgood intentions and helping people.” Just then Grant walked through the door.Sandy looked at Betsy with a big smile, and added in a cheerful voice, obviouslymeant for Grant to hear, “It’s about ruling the world.” She stood up to leave.“Are you trying to corrupt my loyal subjects again, Sandy?” Grant asked,countering her insolent gaze with a friendly smile.“Would I do such a thing?” she answered with feigned surprise. Then she sashayedout the door in a swirl of deep blue silk and sleek black hair.“Wow,” Grant said. “She’s a vision today. What happened to the ripped bluejeans?”“She’s going to prison to cheer up a friend,” said Betsy.PART IV image [../Images/image00255.jpeg] JESSICA sat on the living room couch, feeling restless and nervous, wondering ifshe’d ever get back home again. Her sprained ankle was throbbing, and she hadscratches and bruises all over herself from crawling through the tunnel.Halen had told everyone that he had decided not to reactivate the bug thegovernment had sent in. He explained that whatever false message they mightsend, pretending to have more people and more weapons than they really had, orpretending to have fewer than they really had, there was no telling how the fedswould react. And he didn’t want the feds hearing anything about Jason orJessica, or himself, for that matter, and didn’t think it would help to make upany fictional hostages or civilians. In the end, he explained to the group, hehad decided that the best message to send would be to tie the bug to an arrowand use his compound bow to launch it out toward the trailers, as a way ofsaying, “You can’t spy on us that easily.” So that’s what he had done.Now they were spread out through the house again. Tasha came into the livingroom with a pot and placed it on top of the wood stove. “Would you be goodenough to watch this for me, Jess?” she asked. “It’s just some frozenvegetables.” She made a face that told Jessica she didn’t think much of boiledfrozen vegetables, but it was the best she could do.“Of course,” said Jessica. She got off the couch and sat next to the wood stove.“Something smells good.”“I’m cooking steaks on the camp stove in the kitchen,” Tasha said, smiling.“Doug has a whole deep-freeze full of food downstairs, which has kept frozen sofar, despite the lack of power. But there’s not a fresh vegetable or a freshbottle of milk in this whole neighborhood, not since about a week ago.” Then shelaughed softly. “We’re probably the only ones who care, anyway,” she said. “Ithink these men could live happily on cold Dinty Moore beef stew, right out ofthe can.” Her laughter was like silver bells, Jessica thought. Tasha was themost graceful person she had ever seen.Jessica smiled. “I’m sure David appreciates good food, doesn’t he?” she asked.“Oh, yes,” Tasha answered. “We do our own special blend of Indian, Filipino, andAmerican cuisine at home. But there’s not much I can do with what Doug hashere.”“I’m sure you’re doing better than I would,” said Jessica.Tasha smiled and went back to the steaks.From the next room came the sound of Doug playing an acoustic guitar. David camein and took a seat across from Jessica.“How are you feeling?” he asked.“Kind of sore all over,” she admitted, “but still breathing.”“All of this must seem awfully strange to you,” David said sympathetically.“Yeah, it still doesn’t seem real. It’s like I landed in a completely differentworld. All this legal and political stuff—it’s just way over my head.” Shethought for a moment, and then smiled. “There was this guy in my class at schoolwho insisted that the government has some supercomputer somewhere that alwaysknows where everyone is, and knows everything about everybody. He was alwaysgoing on and on about the government secretly implanting computer chips in ourheads, monitoring and controlling our thoughts.” She looked at David, and for amoment wondered whether he was going to tell her it was all true.David just smiled. “Those of us who want freedom in the world are a minority,and every minority movement will have its share of those people,” he said.“People who think outside the box are, by definition, not normal, and the truthis, most people will accept almost anything as true, if it fits what they wantto think. But let me ask you this: What do you think happens when anoverwhelming majority of the people believe something utterly ridiculous?”Jessica frowned in thought for a minute, then said, “Well, it wouldn’t be seenas ridiculous. Like when almost everyone believed the world was flat. Back then,everyone thought the ones saying it was round were the crazy ones.”“Yes,” said David. “So in most people’s minds, the truth-tellers would be put inthe wrong-and-crazy category right along with the people who really are wrongand crazy.”“Yeah,” said Jessica. “I guess the majority can get away with believinganything, as long as they all believe it together. It’s so easy to think whateveryone else thinks, whether it’s right or not. I’m sure I do plenty of thatmyself, without noticing.”“You have a good mind, Jessica,” said David, smiling again. “Did you go topublic school?”“Private,” she answered. “A school founded by the Quakers.”“I see,” said David. “A very intelligent man once said, ‘When you find yourselfagreeing with the majority, it’s time to stop and reflect’.”“That was Mark Twain!” said Jessica, proud of having actually known that bit oftrivia.“Indeed it was,” said David. “So, back on the subject of conspiracy theories,some people are a little too willing to think outside the box, to the pointwhere they begin to think everything outside the box is true. And of course it’snot, any more than everything inside the box is true. This gives rise to thestereotypical conspiracy nut. But many of those bizarre conspiracy theoriesbegin with a grain of truth. You see, even those hard-core wackos don’toverestimate how heartless, devious, and power-happy people in government canbe; it’s just that sometimes they overestimate the competence of tyrants. If thepeople in power could directly monitor and control us all, they would be doingit already, without a doubt. They’re always trying to come up with new ways tospy on us and control our actions, but they simply don’t have the manpower ortechnology to pull off some of the conspiracies that some people believe in.Ironically, I think those wackos may actually be helping the tyrants by givingeveryone the impression that they can do such things, which keeps all thenonconformists scared and paranoid.”“I guess I always just believed what I saw on TV and read in magazines,” saidJessica. “I thought people who said the media was lying were crazy. But now Iknow for a fact that they lie, at least sometimes, because they lied about theairplane I was on.” She lifted the pot lid a little and looked in. The water wason the brink of boiling.“Well, yes, of course they lie when they have to,” David said. “But lying can becomplicated and hard to control. So most of their mind control is just goodold-fashioned propaganda, and that, all by itself, is amazingly powerful. Theway people’s thoughts and minds can be controlled with mere words is astounding.It’s a field of thought I’ve accidentally learned a lot about recently.” Helooked at Jessica, as if considering something, and then said, “Can I do alittle test on you?”“Sure, I guess,” she answered.“I just want to ask you some simple questions, and I want you to answer asquickly as you can. Don’t stop to think. Justtell me the first thing that comes to mind. Okay?”“Okay.” Jessica nodded, with just a hint of apprehension.“Is it bad to commit murder?” David asked.“Yes.”“Is it bad to eat fish?”“No.”“Is it bad to steal?”“Yes.”“Is it bad to drive a Corvette?”“No.”“Is it bad to break the law?”“Yes.”“Okay, we’re halfway there. Now, why is it bad to commit murder?”“Well,” Jessica said, hesitating for a moment, “because it’s wrong to takesomeone else’s life from them. Life is precious.”“Good. Next question. Why is it bad to steal?”Jessica thought for a moment, trying to quickly spit out whatever came into herhead. “It just is. If something belongs to someone else, you can’t just take it.I can’t really describe why.”“Good enough. Last one. Why is it bad to break the law?”“Because,” she began, but hesitated. “We all have to obey the law. If everyonewent around stealing and killing—”“Wait, wait,” David interrupted. “I didn’t say which laws I meant. I didn’t saythe laws against murder and theft. I just asked if it’s bad to break the law. SoI ask again, why is it bad to break the law, regardless of what law we’retalking about?”“Well,” she began. “Well, there have to be rules, and we all have to follow therules, sort of like Jason was saying.” After a moment, she added, “It’s the onlyway we can all get along and live together in peace.”“Okay, now we get to the important part,” David said. “What should those rulesbe?”She thought for a moment. “Well, no killing and no stealing, for starters.Respect each other’s property. Basically, live and let live, and don’t hurtother people.”“Excellent answer,” David said. “Now for the most important question anyone willever ask you: Are those what the rulesshould be because some politicians said so, or because the universe says so?”“The universe? I don’t quite know what you’re asking,” Jessica said.“I’m asking whether murder is bad, whether stealing is bad, and whether weshould all treat each other with respect—live and let live, as you said—becausesomeone in government told us to, or because that’s just how people shouldbehave?”“The second one. That’s just how people should behave. It’s what works well foreveryone.”“Agreed. Now, who writes the law?”“What do you mean?”“I mean, who makes what everyone calls the law? Who makes up those rules?”“The politicians and lawyers, I guess. The government.”“Not God? Not the universe?”“No.”“And if they wrote a law saying that murder is a good thing, would it become agood thing?”“Of course not.”“If the law said that stealing was okay, would it be okay?”“No.”“If the law said that instead of your live-and-let-live idea, we should attackand rob each other, would that be good?”“Of course not,” she said with a slight smile.“Okay, this time you’re allowed to think before you answer.” He spoke in a slow,steady tone as he asked the question again: “Is it bad to break the law?”She considered the question, which didn’t feel like the same question as before.“It depends what the law is,” she answered.David’s serious expression morphed into a smile. “And, last but not least, whodecides whether a law is a good law or a bad law, and whether or not you shouldobey it?”“Well, if it protects good people from bad people, it’s a good law—if it makessociety more peaceful and happy—” Jessica was quiet for a long time.“And who decides whether or not a law does that?” David asked. Jessica justlooked puzzled. “Congress decides whether to enact a law, the courts decidewhether to uphold it, and the police decide whether to enforce it, but whoactually decides whether it’s a good law or a bad one?” Jessica was stillthinking, and after another minute, David added, “In other words, who ultimatelydecides whether or not you should obey that law or break it?” He waited for amoment in silence as she pondered the question. “I know you know the answer,” hesaid with a smile. “You’re just afraid to say it.”“I guess,” said Jessica slowly, “I guess that’s a decision that each of us makesfor ourselves. So I guess ... I decide.”“Welcome to humanity,” David said with a smile, giving her a pat on theshoulder.“But what about the people who think—” began Jessica, but she was interrupted byJosh bursting through the front door.“They’re coming!” he said, out of breath. “They’re coming straight at us!”“Two Bradleys heading this way,” came Halen’s voice from upstairs. “Stay out ofsight.”Jessica was shocked out of the comfortable conversation, and found herselfdesperately looking around, wondering where to go and what to do. Then she heardHalen shout from upstairs, “Wait, they stopped.” After a pause, he added,“They’ve parked the Bradleys sideways, one on each side of the road coming in,just this side of David’s house. I think they were just moving the front lineup. I don’t think they’re coming here yet.” Despite his words, it was a longtime before anyone dared to move. Finally, Halen came walking down the stairs.“They shut the engines down,” Halen said in a low voice. “They just wanted to upour stress levels a bit.”“It’s working,” said Jessica, and she looked down at her trembling hands. Thenshe smelled something burning. “Darn it!” she said, “I scorched the vegetables.”“Just so we’re clear,” Halen went on, as the others all came into the livingroom, “when they try to come in—and they will, sooner or later—who here isfighting, who’s hiding, and who’s running?” Jessica knew that “wait and see”would only last so long, and then they’d all have to make a decision, butHalen’s bluntness made her uncomfortable. She wasn’t about to pick up a gun andstart shooting, but what else was she going to do? Hide? Where? Run? To where?Some of the others seemed unsure as well. “Tactically speaking,” Halen said,after a moment of silence, “it’s best if we stick pretty much together, butwithout bunching up.” Halen looked from face to face. “Okay, next question: whohere is ready to pick up a gun?”“Got mine,” Josh said, holding up his rifle. He looked nervous but determined.“If I have to,” Doug said, self-consciously folding his arms.“I’m just a spectator,” Jason said. “I won’t be shooting at anyone.”“Really not looking forward to it,” said David, “but willing and able ifabsolutely necessary.”“You know me,” Keith said, the grin on his face not quite concealing hisconcern.“Two lookouts at all times,” Halen said. “Combined, the two upstairs cornerrooms have a view of almost everything.”“What about the back?” asked Doug.“They’re not that creative, or that competent,” Halen said, “though I’ll keep aneye out that way. They’d have to come across the river and through the woods.”“To grandmother’s house we go,” Doug added flippantly.“When they come,” Halen went on, “it will be from the front, inside or hidingbehind the armor.”“What are we supposed to do against Bradleys?” Josh asked in a slightlyquavering tone.“Nothing,” Halen said bluntly, “but they’ll have to get out of them at somepoint. You can’t do a room-to-room search with a Bradley.”“No, but I bet you can flatten a house with one,” Doug said, “if you have enoughtime.”“What about the rest of us?” Jessica asked, and looked at Tasha for support. “Isthere a bomb shelter or anything?”“Not in here,” Halen answered. “I have one, but they’ve taken over my housealready. Just do what you can to keep your heads down. If bullets start flying,stay close, but don’t get in the way.”This discussion was too much for Jessica. They were standing around talkingabout what to do once a full-scale shootout with the government began. How couldthey be so matter-of-fact about it? This was unbelievable, and terrifying.“What’s the point of this?” she demanded suddenly, trying desperately to soundless frightened than she was. “Are you guys really going to hold off the federalgovernment by yourselves? Won’t they just send in more until they crush you? Wecan’t escape, we can’t talk to them, and we can’t win—isn’t surrender our bestchance?”“It may be our best chance to live a bit longer,” said Halen. “But some of uswould rather resist to the bitter end than ever beg those bastards for mercy.There is always a chance that some help is on the way, and I will hold onto thathope as long as I’m alive. If no help is coming, then I just want to take out asmany of those thugs as I can before I die.”“I have to tell you,” Jessica said timidly, reluctant to say it, “that I’mthinking of going out there and surrendering myself, and taking my chances outthere, before it’s too late.”“Josh, Keith, can you take first watch?” Halen asked, as if he hadn’t heardJessica. I’m so pathetic to him, he doesn’t even want to acknowledge me, shethought. “We’ll do two-hour shifts,” said Halen. “Doug, Jason, David, and Tasha,stay on the first floor, but out of sight. Jessica.” She jumped as Halen saidher name. “Come downstairs with me.” image [../Images/image00253.jpeg] JASON sat on the living room floor next to Doug. They’d pulled the cushions offthe couches and chairs and put them on the floor to sit on. The lights were off,but the curtains were open. They were all quietly alert. After about half anhour, Tasha crept to the kitchen and brought back the steaks on a platter withknives and forks.“Here’s meat, anyway,” she said. “We should probably eat if we can. Thevegetables got burnt, but that was no great loss; they were just frozen ones.”“Are you dissin’ the awesome cuisine I got here?” said Doug with mockindignation. Tasha managed a weak smile. Jason could see that she was quiteshaken, but hiding it well.The steak was good and everyone ate as much as they could, but the stressdampened all their appetites.Jason considered how strange it felt to be awaiting something like this withouta gun at his side, but he knew it was better this way. At this point therewasn’t anyone on either side he was willing to shoot at. So he waited nervouslyin the living room, hoping that somehow this thing could be resolved withouteveryone in there dying, but unable to imagine how that could come about.Several times he had considered going out by himself, and if not for Jessica, hewould have done so. He considered taking her out there and lying about who shewas, but he knew they wouldn’t get away with it long enough to escape. Eventhough he couldn’t imagine what good he could do from where he was, he wasn’twilling to just walk away from her.He knew full well what was going to happen now: “scorched earth” policy all theway. The feds had lost five agents now: the one who was killed after shootingKeith, the three who died as a result of the raid on Ben’s place (the third hadeventually died at the hospital), and then Nick, whom Halen had killed with thecrossbow. Jason wished he knew exactly which agents had died from the raid onBen’s house, but the media hadn’t mentioned their names. Now those who remainedout beyond the barricades, if unleashed, would show no mercy. The only thingleft that might make them show a little restraint was if they thought theremight be innocent hostages inside. They probably still didn’t know about Jessicabeing there. Only Nick had seen her, and he was dead. Jason, on the other hand,had probably been recognized by at least a couple of other agents, who nowprobably considered him a traitor. He couldn’t very well now claim that he wasbeing held prisoner, nor did he have a good explanation, without mentioningJessica, for why he hadn’t come out when the supposed “terrorists” had releasedhim. And though he was still skeptical about what David and the others wereclaiming, he was no longer sure he’d be safe out there himself if they everfound out about Jessica being there. None of the options felt good.“I’m surprised they haven’t sent in a radio or something,” David was saying. “Iwould have expected them to be trying to persuade us to come out and beg theirforgiveness.”“Maybe they don’t want us coming out,” Doug said. “Or maybe they just don’t wanttheir thugs talking to us and finding out who’s really in here.”“You may be right,” David replied. “They’ve had to tell quite a few whoppers todemonize us enough to get away with what they’re doing. That’s just a basicmilitary tactic: you’ve got to make your army despise the enemy, or they mightnot shoot at him.”Jason said nothing, but felt a twinge of shame, knowing that the tactic Davidwas describing had worked perfectly on him. Though it was vague, he could stillrecall the general image he’d had of the people in here before meeting them:malicious, violent people with no respect for other people or their property.But that description was sounding less and less like the people in here, andmore and more like the people out there. He assumed that his fellow agents meantwell, as he did, and that they thought they were doing the right thing, butsomeone somewhere in the chain of command wasn’t being straight with them.Bridges, for instance, had struck him as a straight-up guy, but someone had beenfeeding him false information through those nonexistent “negotiations.” Theagents out there were facing a fictional enemy, he thought.“And while they tell everyone that we’re the scum of the earth,” Doug said,“they tell each other that they’re the righteous heroes saving the day. It’spathetic.” Jason wondered if Doug intended that as a personal attack. It feltlike one. But thinking back to the discussions that he and his fellow agents hadhad, the way they had talked about the “webbies” and their cult leader, and theway they portrayed themselves as the enforcers of justice and order, he realizedthat Doug was right. How willing he had been to believe what he was told.“If we had a way to send a message to all the people with guns out there,” Davidsaid, waving in the direction of the government trailers, “what would you wantto tell them?”Without hesitation, Doug snapped, “Burn in hell, you Nazi pigs.”“I’m sure that would win them over,” David said with a smile.“Well, really,” Doug said, “as I’ve said a million times before, if we treatthem with respect and act all civilized, all it does is legitimize what they’redoing, and make it seem okay. You’ve said it yourself, David: if we don’tidentify evil as evil, and show it for what it is, we’re basically giving ourblessing to their thuggery. Those bastards don’t deserve to be treated with anyrespect. Calling them ʻsir,’ and treating their control-freak plans as if theydeserve polite, reasoned rebuttal instead of vicious condemnation, only givestheir crap respect it doesn’t deserve. They should be treated like the crooksthey are.”“You may be right, Doug,” said Tasha, “but it doesn’t help to use that kind oflanguage. It’s not the way to win allies.”“Nothing will win over the stupid American people at this point,” Doug replied.“Unless we scare the hell out of the tyrants, nothing is going to change. Havinga nice rational debate is never going to do it. No offense, David.”“It only makes us look bad, and makes it easier for people to hate us and thinkwe’re a bunch of scary extremists, when they hear talk like that,” Tasharesponded, her voice low and soft, as it always was. “We should be above that,so anyone paying attention can see that we’re the ones with reason on our side.”Because of Tasha’s stunning looks, and how little he had heard her speak, Jasonhad imagined Tasha to be some sort of obedient, submissive “mail order bride.”But, though she spoke softly, Tasha had no accent, and her words conveyed alevel of education and intelligence that Jason had not expected.“It’s already hard enough to get people to want freedom,” David added. “Weshouldn’t be turning people off by sounding bitter and uneducated, even if theanger is completely justified, which it is, in this case.”“Winning over the masses is a lost cause,” Doug replied, throwing his hands inthe air. “It doesn’t matter how politely and logically it’s explained to them;the American people don’t want real freedom, and they hate anyone who does.Forget trying to convince them. The majority will never be on our side, and wedon’t need them.”“Well, it sure would help to have more of them, like right now, for instance,”David remarked. “And we are seeing more and more people paying attention.”“Too little, too late,” Doug retorted. “The only way we’ll stop the beast is toscare the hell out of its pawns. They don’t care what’s right, or what’s true.They never even think about that stuff. They will do what they’re told, nomatter who it hurts, unless it hurts them. It’s like that guy said about theNazis: if occasionally one of them didn’t make it home, it might have made adifference. It might have made the thugs think twice about what they were doing,and whether it was worth it. As long as being a fascist is a comfortable andsafe occupation, the beast will have a never-ending supply of unthinking thugs.”Doug suddenly looked over at Jason, as if just remembering he was there. “Nooffense,” Doug said with a smile.“None taken,” said Jason, which wasn’t quite true. Of course he cared about whatwas right, and what was true. Of course he didn’t want to hurt innocent people.The whole reason he was in law enforcement was to catch the bad guys so theycouldn’t hurt people. Jason saw the world differently, but that didn’t make hima heartless bastard. Then Jason remembered when he’d first seen David. David’seyes seemed to look right through everything superficial and see the goodness ofhis heart. He felt safe with David, and wanted to listen to him. Doug and Keithjust made him feel defensive.“If you think anyone who disagrees with you is a heartless, evil bastard,” saidJason, “how are you different from the guys out there who think you’re a bunchof terrorists?”“Good point, Jason,” said Tasha. Then, addressing Doug again, she said, “I thinkif we give up on trying to win the rational debate, we’ve lost already. If wecan’t win the hearts and minds of people, hopefully including the people whowork for the government, then what’s the point?”“The point is to achieve freedom for the few people who actually want it,” Douganswered. “How much has sitting around talking actually accomplished? Peoplehave been teaching about freedom for hundreds of years. Most people neverlisten. Yeah, this extremist here,” he said, pointing at David, “has gotten alot of people thinking about stuff they had never thought about before, but inthe end, what good will that do? When has polite talk ever reduced tyranny?”“Not very often, unfortunately,” David admitted.“Not ever,” Doug replied emphatically.“Not by itself, maybe,” David continued, “but even when it comes down to arevolution, it matters how many people are on the side of freedom, and thatdepends on words. As I’ve said before, I think it was more Thomas Paine thanGeorge Washington who won the American Revolution. He didn’t convince amajority, but he did convince a lot of people, enough to win their freedom—for awhile anyway.”“You see how clueless Americans are today,” Doug said, his voice rising a bit.“How many do you think could even begin to comprehend Paine’s Common Sensepamphlet? If Paine were alive today, the public would hate him; he’d either bein prison, or dead.”A smile appeared on David’s face. “If he were alive today, he’d be dead?”“Oh, shut up,” said Doug, trying not to smile himself. “You know what I mean.”Tasha spoke up again. “But if Thomas Paine just called the king vulgar names,what good do you think that would have done? If he had cursed and used morevicious language, would that have won over more people, or fewer? All the angryrhetoric, even if justified, is counterproductive.”“I just think it’s too late in the game to be trying to win over any more of thesheep,” Doug said.“Well, I hate to make your point for you,” David commented, “but alcoholprohibition is a pretty good example of a few hostile, impolite people managingto do what no amount of reason and talk could.”“Exactly!” Doug exclaimed. “Tarring and feathering a few damn revenuers, andlynching a few, forced the monster to give up the prohibition racket. When havewords ever done that? It worked because no one dared to be a revenuer. It becameunenforceable, and the feds had to repeal it and pretend it was their idea. It’sno different now. Unless being a federal thug becomes a lot more dangerous,they’ll keep right on doing whatever they want. When we see a few IRS crooks, orATF, or DEA, or whoever, hanging from the trees in D.C., then we might seefreedom coming back. Not before.”“It’s just not good,” Tasha responded, shaking her head as if the words hurther. “Lowering ourselves to their level isn’t the answer. Sometimes revolutioncan be accomplished by non-violent means. Gandhi did it that way.”“Oh, come on,” Doug said. “Using force in self-defense isn’t putting ourselveson their level.”“You don’t hang people from trees in self-defense,” Tasha answered, with a flashof fire in her eyes that startled Jason. “When you talk like that, people see usas the aggressors. It just feeds the claim that we’re nasty terrorists.”“It doesn’t matter what the sheep think of us,” Doug insisted. “It only matterswhether we let freedom completely die here, because we’re so concerned with whatother people think about it.”“Well, as one who still wants to see this settled without violence,” David cutin, “I must admit, our current situation doesn’t give me a lot of hope thatwe’re going to win the battle of ideas.”“And we shouldn’t have to,” Doug said. “You said yourself, the rights we havedon’t depend upon any law, any election, or popular opinion. We have the rightto defend our freedom, whether the sheep out there understand that or not.”“True,” David agreed. “It would just be a lot easier if more people wanted to befree.”“Yeah, well, they don’t,” said Doug flatly.“No, they don’t,” Tasha said with a sigh.After that the room fell silent, and Jason was left wondering what his fellowagents would think if they could have heard this. What would Agent Bridgesthink? Jason wasn’t even sure what to think of it himself. image [../Images/image00254.jpeg] BETSY hung up her coat and sat down at her desk to see if she could get a thingor two finished before Grant arrived. She was supposed to be off today, butGrant had just called her and said that something had just happened that hewanted to respond to. “Don’t bother with office clothes,” he said, “the placeshould be pretty empty. You know I’d just come to your apartment if I could,” headded apologetically. Betsy understood. They didn’t want any rumors going aroundabout the President-elect and his voluptuous little secretary. She looked up asGrant walked in, whistling a tune. “You’re in a good mood today,” she commented.“Did you read the Sunday paper yet?” he asked, plopping the one he was holdingonto her desk. Betsy picked it up, but Grant gave her the report without waitingfor her to read it. “Halford just got indicted on all sorts of juicy stuff.”“Well, at least you’re being a good sport about it,” Betsy said wryly, scanningthe story. The words “bribery,” “extortion,” and “fraud” popped off the page ather.“Good thing he didn’t beat me in that last senatorial election. Imagine how muchmore exciting it would have been if this had come out right after he waselected,” Grant said, opening his briefcase and arranging his papers.“If it had come out during that election, it might have made things a lot easierfor you,” Betsy commented.“Hey, he spent double what I did on that campaign,” Grant remarked, “and I gotdouble the votes he did. It was easy enough. I guess the people knew the guy wasa crook before the FBI figured it out.”“Well, it says here they’ve been investigating him for quite a while,” Betsysaid. She put the paper down and looked at Grant. “Do you ever wonder if they’reinvestigating you?” Grant looked up from his papers, his eyebrows raised, butdidn’t say anything. “I don’t mean you did anything that needs investigating,”she added quickly. “I mean, don’t you think they snoop on all congressmen, atleast a little?”“I’m sure they do, and that’s just fine with me,” Grant declared. “It makes melook good—Mr. Squeaky Clean.”“Sure you don’t have even one little skeleton in your closet?” she asked.“If I did, don’t you think my opponents would have found it before now?” hereplied.“A non-denial denial,” she responded.“Very observant,” he said with a smile, “but ultimately what matters isn’twhether I did anything or not, but only whether the public believes I did. It’sa slight advantage to actually not be a crook, but not as much as you mightexpect. Public image has very little to do with reality. It’s easy to make anhonest guy look like a crook, and vice versa. It’s a question of who has thebest spin doctors.”“You don’t think Americans are savvy enough to see the spin for what it is?”Betsy ventured. “You just said they figured out Halford before the FBI did.”“That doesn’t mean they’re savvy,” said Grant. “It just means they’re willing tobelieve bad stuff about politicians. And Halford wasn’t a very good liar.”Grant glanced at some papers, and put them aside. “Case in point,” he said. “Theelection of 2008. Half the country was convinced that Barack Obama was theSecond Coming. Based on what? What did they know about him, or about what hebelieved? Not a damn thing. It was all emotion, all packaging, all spin. And yetyou had millions of honest people working their fingers to the bone to give thatman an enormous amount of power. Same thing with Bill Clinton. The charm andcharisma trump everything else.He seemed like a swell guy, so the public gave him the White House. Twice, even.And look at Reagan. Even people who hated his policies loved the guy.Conservatives have been desperately looking for another one like him ever since.Those who run for public office learned a long time ago that if you give thepeople substance, you only confuse them and scare them away. If you give themempty, feel-good fluff, they will flock to you in droves.”“And is that what you gave them?” she asked, half teasing.“Absolutely. I would have lost by a landslide if I had spent time trying toexplain the details of the policies I was proposing. The real stuff goes in oneear and out the other. Only very general concepts will remain in most people’sminds: tough on crime, cares about the poor, will fix the economy. And I couldhave created that image no matter what policies I was actually proposing.”“That’s a pretty sad statement about the country, isn’t it?” Betsy asked. “Itsounds as if the people are just falling for whatever sales pitch soundsbetter.”“That’s exactly what they’re doing. It’s what they’ve done for hundreds ofyears, and will probably keep right on doing forever. Every time there’s a pollabout economics, or political philosophy, or anything like that, the Americanpeople demonstrate that they don’t know anything about anything. They don’tthink anything because they don’t know anything. But you can still feel things,no matter how ignorant you are, so that’s what they do, and that’s what everyonerunning for office panders to: the emotions and feelings of the electorate.”“So what’s to stop a complete tyrant from gaining power here, if he has a slickenough PR team and knows the right buttons to push to play on people’semotions?”“Nothing,” Grant said. “Absolutely nothing.” Betsy hoped he was going to saysomething else, something a bit more comforting, but he didn’t. image [../Images/image00255.jpeg] JESSICA sat in a chair in the corner of the basement, waiting for Halen tospeak. Halen sat on the couch that faced the back window and sliding glass doorof the basement, and he seemed deep in thought. She had nervous flutters in herstomach as she waited for him to chew her out for being such a stupid coward.Then she thought how silly it was to feel nervous about this man’s disapprovalwhen she might not live another day. But she did want his approval, sherealized, very much.Halen was still a little intimidating, yet she felt safest when she was nearhim. The things he did seemed like magic to her: always in the right place atthe right time, never missing a shot, like some invincible movie hero. Surely ifshe just stayed near him, he would never let her come to harm. But she knew thatshe was thinking with her feelings, not her brain. She felt a visceralattraction to this man who had saved her life, to his raw power and amazingskill. But her conscience recoiled in horror at his ability to kill people withno apparent feeling at all. Even if it was necessary and justified, how could areally good human being remain so unaffected?“You don’t really know someone until they have complete control over you, untilyou’re completely at their mercy,” Halen began, startling her out of herthoughts. “When they can do whatever they want and get away with it, that’s whenyou can see who they really are.”For a moment Jessica felt nervous, wondering if he was talking about theircurrent situation, just the two of them alone in the basement, but then Halenwent on: “I’ve spent a total of eight months in someone else’s custody—one monthas a prisoner of war in Bosnia, before I escaped; two months in a militaryprison, until it was decided that I was justified in knocking out my commandingofficer; and five months in a Texas state prison, about a thousand years ago,for getting caught with some weed.”That’s not so bad, Jessica thought, having expected to hear about a murder ortwo.“And I learned more when I had hardly any freedom at all than I did during allthe times when I could do pretty much whatever I wanted. Mostly what I learnedwas not about the criminals. They were pretty predictable, whether it was thesadistic psychos or the pathetic dope dealers. No, the fascinating ones were theones who had been given power, power to control other human beings—the sort ofpeople you would be surrendering yourself to if you go out there.”She had already been trying to imagine what would happen if she did go out. Evenif they didn’t know she had been on the plane, would she be thrown in prisonjust for being there, as a suspected terrorist? Even if it all got sorted out inthe end, she dreaded the thought of even a day in prison; scenes from all theprison movies she’d ever seen raced through her head.“Some of the guards I knew were pretty normal, just doing a job without thinkingabout it, not really caring one way or the other what happened—callous, but alsorelatively harmless, ambivalent morons doing what they were trained to do. But alot of them weren’t there by accident. A lot of people gravitate toward thosejobs, not because of the pay or the prestige, since there isn’t much of either,but for the power trip it gives them. They get to rule over their little land ofmake-believe, where they are the kings with lots of subjects to push around.”“Now, in this country they can’t get away with as much as the movies would leadyou to believe, at least not anymore. They can’t usually get away with torture,rape, murder, that sort of thing.” Hearing him say that made her feel a littlebetter. “No, it’s not usually that blatant, but the essence of it is the same:what they love the most, what they live for, is the feeling of being abovesomeone else. And the only thing that makes them feel high is making someoneelse feel low.”“But the people who want that, there is no one lower than them. And I thinksomewhere inside, they know it. Every prison guard on a power trip, every copwho likes pushing people around, every husband who beats his wife—they do itbecause deep down inside, they know they’re worthless piles of shit. But insteadof trying to make themselves better, they focus all their energies on trying tomake sure that someone else is beneath them, under their control, subservientand inferior to them. And any job that pretends to give someone authority, evenjust a little or even just in certain ways, is the perfect excuse for thesepeople to let their inner sadistic scumbags come out and play.”“Something I learned very quickly after being captured in Bosnia, which I shouldhave noticed even in state prison, is that the fastest, surest way to makesomeone into a tyrant is to bow before him, grovel in front of him, and beg forhis kindness. Ironically, the POWs where I was did a lot better if we were a bitconfrontational, even verbally abusive to the guards. Yeah, they’d put us in thecan, or starve us for a while, or do a little torture, but as long as we didn’ttreat them like our superiors, they couldn’t break us. More often than not,they’d be scared of us. Someone who acts like a slave will be treated like aslave. Someone who acts like a bulldog, well, the best a tyrant can do is killhim. Ayn Rand called it ‘the sanction of the victim.’ If you give the impressionto your oppressor that you accept, or even approve of, his oppression of you,things will only get worse. Whatever else happens, never tell someone that youaccept that he has the right to rule you. Never. You will make him into amonster, and you will make yourself into a slave.”After a long silence, Halen suddenly turned and looked right into Jessica’seyes, startling her. He continued in a low but firm voice. “If you go out thereand beg mercy from them, what you will find, with very few exceptions, is thatthe entire system—the politicians, the judges, the government lawyers, the cops,down to the lowest bureaucrat—is nothing but a giant club for those people, thepeople whose only desire is to have others beneath them.” Had he stoppedspeaking right then, Jessica already would have given up any thought ofsurrender, but she didn’t want to say anything yet. She was fascinated by hiswords, wondering what horrific experiences lay behind them. So she continued tolisten quietly.“Those are not good people,” he continued. “If you plead for mercy from a goodperson, he’ll want to help you. He’ll feel empathy, relate to your humanity, andwant to minimize your suffering. Not people in government. Most of them arefundamentally different beings. If you plead to them for mercy, that is whatthey live for. What they want is to have others groveling beneath them. Ratherthan wanting to help, they will prolong your fear and suffering just as long asthey can, because it is your helplessness, and the power they can hold over you,that gives them their jollies.”Jessica found the thought disturbing, and had a hard time believing thateveryone inside the system was like that. “I know some people like that myself,”she said, “and I’m sure there are lots of them in the government. But isn’tthere anyone in the system who can be trusted, any way to get to someone whomight do the right thing?”“You mean the good guy in the system, who at the end of the movie arrests allthe corrupt guys? That guy?” Halen asked, one eyebrow raised.“Yeah, that guy,” Jessica replied with a sigh, hanging her head in hopelessness.“No such thing?”“Not anymore,” he answered. “Not for a very long time now. One of their besttricks is to have all those courts, all those agencies, all those checks andbalances, to give the impression that people can go to them for justice. But inthe end, it’s no more helpful than if the Mafia had an I.A. unit.”“I.A.?”“Internal Affairs,” Halen responded. “The cops who are supposed to investigatecops. Once in a blue moon they’ll put on a show of hanging some jackboot out todry, when they can’t find a way to cover up what he’s done.”“Like when they get caught on video, like the clips of police brutality all overYouTube?”“Yep, like that. It’s a lot harder to get away with lying about something whenit’s on tape. But when it comes right down to it, every government is in thebusiness of controlling and extorting the peasants. If you work for the systemand get in the way of that agenda, you won’t be there for long.”“But what’s the alternative?” Suddenly Jessica shivered, missing the warmth ofthe wood stove upstairs. Halen looked suddenly concerned. He went to a shelf andtook down a thick, dark gray blanket, motioned her onto the couch, and wrappedit around her. She laughed a little. “Everyone here treats me like a princess.”“Your injuries were pretty serious,” Halen said gruffly, sitting down on theother end of the couch. “We need you to get your full strength back. Now, whatwere you just saying?”Jessica was suddenly so happy in the warmth of the blanket, with Halen closebeside her, that she lost her train of thought. She resisted the urge to snuggleup against him. “Oh, yeah, I was saying, maybe they’re all corrupt, maybethey’re all on a power trip, but what are we supposed to do about it? You can’tjust shoot any cop who does something you don’t like.”“Well, shooting a few might make them think twice before being so obnoxious,” hesaid. “But no, I’m not suggesting that everyone just gun down cops andbureaucrats on a whim. But what people don’t understand is that government onlygives us two choices: unquestioning obedience or mortal combat. They’re the oneswho will escalate everything to violence to get their way. Every law is a threatof force. Whatever the law is, if they catch you disobeying, they’ll take yourstuff or throw you in jail, or both. They don’t negotiate, and they can’t bereasoned with. They worship legislation, as if their laws are divine commandsfrom the gods, no matter how stupid those laws may be. ‘Hey, I don’t make thelaw, I just enforce it.’ Sound familiar? You either do as you’re told or theyhurt you. And if you resist at all, then things get really nasty, really fast,like you see here.”“But don’t some courts still limit what the cops can do?” Jessica asked. “Imean, I heard about what started this, the search warrant. I’m no lawyer, but itsounds pretty lame to me. They talked some grouchy, confused old lady intosaying she thought she heard a machine gun, and they all come storming in?That’s not right. Don’t you think there’s a chance a court would agree? I mean,instead of having a shootout over it?”“I doubt any court would do the right thing in this case,” Halen said. “Theyhave too much at stake. But even if they did, so what? Are we supposed to justlet them do an illegal search, in the hopes that later some court will say itwas wrong?”“Well, the outcome might have been better. I’m not saying it’s okay for them todo it, but it seems like resisting just makes everything worse.”“In the short term, it does,” he explained, “but in the long term, things willget a thousand times worse if no one resists. If they have no right to dosomething to begin with, then we have the right to stop them from doing it. Ifsome night you’re out walking and someone attacks you, and you have a gun, doyou let him rob you, let him beat you up, let him rape you, and then go to courtthe next day and sue him? Or do you stop him from doing it in the first place,if you have the means to do so?”“You’re right,” she replied. “It’s just that scaring off a mugger is a lotdifferent than having a shootout with the cops.”“Resisting rotten cops is a lot more dangerous,” he said, “but in principle,it’s exactly the same. The Fourth Amendment doesn’t say that we have the rightto sue cops if they invade our homes without a good reason. It says we have theright to have them not do it in the first place. And that means we have theright to stop them from doing it if we can. Of course the control freaks won’tapprove, and will paint us as the scum of the earth for daring to decide forourselves what our rights are, and what government is allowed to do to us. Andthese days most Americans will agree with them. We’re taught that it’s a virtueto bow to authority, and even taught that if authority does us wrong, our onlycivilized recourse is to beg some other authority to protect us from the firstone. But if you’re not allowed to defend your rights, by force if necessary,then they aren’t rights at all. If it’s up to government to decide what rightswe have, then we have no rights at all. You might as well ask a carjackerwhether you have the right to keep your own car.”“But don’t the courts sometimes limit what the cops can get away with, at leastto some extent?” Jessica asked. “I mean, I’m not saying they do a good job of itall the time, but isn’t there sometimes some justice there? I’ve heard on thenews things about how the Supreme Court rules on what cops are allowed to do andwhat they’re not allowed to do. Years ago a friend of my brother’s got bustedfor having pot, and the court said that the cops broke the law somehow, and sothey couldn’t prosecute him for it. I forget the details, but don’t the courtsstill rule against the cops sometimes?”“Sometimes,” Halen said. “But even when a court slaps their hands, whatdifference does it make? The cops don’t get prosecuted. They always get awaywith it, or even get promoted. Even when some judge says, ‘You shouldn’t havedone that,’ who cares? They already did it, and they’ll do it again. If everyonce in a while they lose a drug case or something, they don’t care. Because thepower they get from breaking the rules far outweighs any adverse consequencesthey will ever face.”“Can’t they get fined or something, or maybe fired?” Jessica asked, still tryingto cling to the hope that the justice system really might provide justice oncein a while.Halen’s expression suddenly turned angry. “Lon Horiuchi shot Vicky Weaver in thehead and killed her while she was standing in the front doorway of her own home,holding her baby.” He spoke through clenched teeth, nearly spitting the wordsout, and Jessica shrank away in fear. She had no idea what he was talking about.“The damn feds did their pretend investigation. That murdering bastard Horiuchididn’t get prosecuted. He didn’t get fined. He got promoted, and gunned downmore innocents at Waco. And the few who survived the killing fields in Waco,including the little old ladies, were arrested and thrown in prison. And evenafter they were all acquitted of the bogus murder charges against them, thatpiece-of-shit federal judge—Smith, I think it was—had most of them locked up foryears and years, just for living in a place that the feds decided to invade fora publicity stunt.”Jessica had never seen Halen angry, and it made him a whole lot scarier than healready was. Halen seemed to sense her alarm. At least he stopped talking for aminute, took a few deep breaths, and calmed himself down. “Sorry, but there’s somuch that most people never hear, never know about. For every example of policeabuse or political corruption that makes the news, there are a hundred that younever hear about. The number of lives ruined, the number of people harassed,robbed, locked up—if you knew just the cases I’ve seen first hand, it would makeyou sick. There are a whole lot of people who have learned the hard way just howlittle our justice system cares about justice. The system cares about one thing,and one thing only: its own power. It would be nice if all that stuff we learnedin school about checks and balances, separation of powers, due process, rule oflaw—it would be nice if all that stuff was real, but it’s not. The only languagetyrants understand is violence. It’s the only way they know how to communicate,and unfortunately, it’s the only response they pay any attention to.”“I wish I could say that you’re wrong about that,” Jessica said, “but I know afew stories myself, just from people I know, that pretty much prove what you’resaying. I’m sure they’re nothing like the ones you know about, but they’re badenough.”Despite the raw, intimidating power, both physical and emotional, that this manexuded, Jessica suddenly felt safe enough to say what she truly felt. “I don’twant you to be right. I want you to be some nasty criminal that I can dismiss asa dangerous wacko. I want to be able to say that what you do is unjustifiable,and that you should be locked up. Because if what you say is true—and I wish Icould prove you wrong, but I can’t—then I don’t know what to think. If thingsare really that bad, if the system is completely corrupt and broken and it’sreally time for another American Revolution or something, well, that idea justscares the hell out of me.” She took a deep breath. “I guess what I’m saying is,I wish you didn’t make this much sense, because I’m starting to agree with you,and it’s freaking me out.” She made a feeble attempt to smile.Halen’s face slowly morphed into a real smile, and he said, “I like you. You’rea good kid.” Somehow hearing him say that made her feel a little better, thoughshe wasn’t thrilled about the “kid” part. “And I think you’re now officially aterrorist,” he added.“Bummer,” she replied. Both of them were quiet for a while, as Jessica tried toprocess a new image of Halen in her mind. As blunt as he usually was, she hadn’texpected him to be nearly so articulate or sophisticated. This was not just someunthinking angry thug, killing anyone he didn’t like. In a way, it would havebeen easier for her if he had been.“I think there was food upstairs before I asked you down here,” said Halen,getting up suddenly. “Let’s get you some food and warmth.”Back upstairs, Doug and David made a place for Jessica closest to the woodstove, and Tasha brought her a plate of steak. Halen settled in a chair by thewindow, watching. “Keith’s coming,” he said.Keith’s expression was grim and sad, and his clothes were covered with freshdirt. He squatted next to Halen and they spoke quietly. image [../Images/image00253.jpeg] JASON sat looking out the upstairs window toward the rolling hills out front,feeling a bit uneasy about taking a turn keeping watch. What was the point ofwatching? So he could warn the people here when his fellow agents were comingin? If he saw them coming, he wasn’t even sure whether he’d say anything or not.If the agents could take everyone by surprise, they might be able to bring themall in without any bloodshed. That’s what he would have wanted when this allstarted. To bring them in with no one hurt, and let them have their day incourt. But he knew now that that wouldn’t be good enough, not for the people inhere, who weren’t about to accept any government court’s decision about theirfate, nor for the people out there, who, because of the agents they had lostalready, now most likely intended to slaughter everyone in here.David sat next to Jason in another chair, staring out the same window. Jasonwondered whether he had come along to keep him company, or to keep an eye onhim.He found it really strange that these people would so easily trust him, evenenough to hand him a loaded gun. He didn’t feel like a prisoner; he was now hereby choice. But the complete contempt for the law shown by these people made himuneasy. They seemed to believe in no rules at all, as if every person could justmake up his own rules. What if someone decided to go on a killing spree, or roball his neighbors? A world without rules brought to mind a Mad Max type ofexistence. And yet these people, in many ways, seemed perfectly kind andreasonable otherwise. No, these people weren’t the problem, but if theirphilosophy were adopted by people with bad intentions, people with no regard forhuman life, then what?“Can I ask you something?” David’s voice brought Jason out of his thoughts.“Every chance I get, I ask cops this question. Of course, you don’t have toanswer, and even if you do, I’d never tell anyone what you said without yourpermission.” David looked directly at Jason. “Do you believe that?”“Yeah, I guess. What’s the question?”“What’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen a fellow police officer do?” Davidasked.Jason didn’t have to ponder that one for long. The question alone instantlybrought back the images of a night about two years before. But he wonderedwhether he should tell David about it. It wasn’t exactly a shining example of“law and order” at work.“You can leave out names and details, if that makes it any easier,” Davidsuggested.“It was a couple years ago,” Jason began, and paused. Other than a few fellowcops, he had never spoken of this to anyone. He had tried not to think about iteither, because the memory made him feel so dirty and ashamed. He felt as if hewas making a confession. It occurred to him that he had not been to confessionin three years, and there was a good chance he wouldn’t be alive much longer.Suddenly he felt compelled to make this confession, at least to another humanbeing. “I wasn’t a fed yet, and I had only been a cop for six months. It wasnight, and my partner and I were cruising around.” As he told the story, theimages came back to him as vividly as if it had happened yesterday. He was gladthat both he and David were supposed to be staring out the window, so he didn’thave to look at him as he spoke.“There was a little house over on the edge of town, the poorest part of it. I’mdriving through there with my partner and we see a cruiser sitting in front of ahouse. We thought we’d just see what was going on and if the officer neededassistance. The front door’s open, so we come into the house. It’s mostly dark,but we hear noises and find the other cop in a corner room, and there’s this kidon the floor, maybe fourteen or fifteen years old, bleeding from his face. Theother cop tells us we can go, that he has it under control. We’re about to leavewhen the kid says, ʻDon’t leave me,’ or something like that. I turn around andsee the cop hit the kid right in the face, backhanded, with his gun in his hand.The kid is just lying there on his back, hardly moving at all, but he’s stillconscious. The cop says something like, ʻYou still haven’t told me what I wantto hear.’ I was just standing there, not knowing what to do. My partner wastrying to pull me away. I asked what the kid had done. The cop just says, ʻGetlost, rookie,’ or something like that. The kid tries to say something again, andthe cop hits him again. Both eyes are swelling up, he’s bleeding from his noseand his forehead and around his eyes. He’s not fighting back at all, not eventrying to block the guy’s punches. He’s just a scrawny little kid, and he knewit would be pointless to resist. I just stood there, and every ten or fifteenseconds the cop hits him, right in the face, closed fist and all. The cop wasn’teven mad. That’s what really bugged me. I mean, I could understand if he justhad a fight with a guy, or a chase or something. But he’s just calmly squattingthere over this young black kid, every once in a while hitting him like that. Ididn’t know what else to do, so I asked if we should just take the kid in. And afew times I asked what the kid had done, but he wouldn’t say.”Jason paused for a long time, the images of that night clear as day in his mind.“And I was just a cop in a little town. This wasn’t some big city or something.Even after being there just a few months, I knew maybe half of the people wholived there. I didn’t know this kid, but I knew other people on the street.After a while, my partner convinced me to go out of the room, but we stayed atthe front door until the other cop came out. I didn’t know what he would do ifwe just left, so I at least stayed there for a while. Then the other cop comesout and we all leave.”“Did you ever find out what it was all about?” David asked.“Yeah. The thing bugged me for a long time, and finally I brought it up again tomy partner. And he just says, ʻDidn’t you know? The kid filed a complaintagainst that cop.’ I thought he meant he filed a complaint after getting beatup, but my partner said no, he’d filed a complaint with the department earlierbecause the cop had been going after his older sister, basically stalking her.That’s why he beat the kid up, for reporting that to the department.”“Did anything ever come of it?”“A while later the chief interviewed my partner and me, and we told him whathappened, though we tried to make it not sound quite as bad as it was. The chieftalked to the cop, I guess, but nothing happened to him. And the cop must haveknown what we told the chief, but he didn’t seem to care. He wasn’t mad at us oranything. He just treated it like it was no big deal.”Jason paused for a moment and let out a long sigh. “But the image of that kid,”he said, shaking his head, “so completely helpless, and so completely hopeless,not even trying to fight back, like he knew that he had to just let it happen,even if it meant dying. There was nothing he could do, and you could see it inhis face. I mean, I’ve seen plenty of fights and injuries worse than that, butthere was something about that kid, and that situation. You just don’t treatother human beings like that. You shouldn’t even treat an animal like that, justhurting it for fun. That’s messed up. And that look of helplessness, like he waswaiting for me to save him.”“Maybe in a way, you did,” David said gently. “If you hadn’t stayed, it mighthave been worse.”“It’s funny you say that,” Jason said, “because a year or so later, I met thekid again. I didn’t even recognize him at first, but he comes up to me, a bigsmile on his face, and thanks me. I asked, For what? He says, for saving him,for not leaving him there alone with that cop. Man, that made it hurt even more.I didn’t even lift a finger to stop the guy. All I did was stand around like adamn coward, and here this kid was thanking me for it, as if I was some greathero. I didn’t even know what to say. I don’t remember what I said to him, butit was probably something stupid, and then I just walked away.”“After the department let it slide, did you do anything else about it?” Davidasked.“Nope. Never brought it up again, until now.”“If you came on a scene like that, but the guy doing the hitting wasn’t a cop,would you have stopped him?”“Of course. I’d have his sorry ass in handcuffs in half a second for assault andbattery,” Jason answered without hesitation. David said nothing, and he didn’thave to. Jason silently asked himself the obvious question: Why would he let acop do that, but no one else? Shouldn’t cops be better than that? Aren’t theysupposed to be the good guys, protecting everyone else from things like that?“It’s a cop thing, you know,” Jason said at last. “It’s just, we’re together dayin and day out, feeling like it’s us against the world. It’s like being on afootball team or something. You gotta look out for the guys on your team, nomatter what.” He gazed out the window at the rolling hills. “So that’s what wedo, even when we shouldn’t.”“Thank you for honestly answering my question,” David said. Then, after a longsilence, he asked, “Any chance of a career change for you if you ever make itout of here? There’s a lot you could do for justice without a badge, you know.”“I don’t know,” Jason answered. “Being a cop is what I know, but I also know afew guys who quit because of what it was doing to them. One guy used to tell meall the time, the more you fight the criminals, the more you become like them. Idon’t quite buy that completely, but he has a point. How far do we stretch therules to go after the rule-breakers?”“Ever consider being a private security guard?” David asked.“Nah. I’d feel like a complete loser,” Jason said. “It’s a running joke amongcops that security guards are just the losers who couldn’t hack it being realcops, or couldn’t make it through the police academy.” He looked up at David.“Besides, wouldn’t that still make me a fascist pig?”“If all you do is protect people, their rights and their property, and if you doit because they agreed to hire you for that, there’s nothing wrong with that,”David said.“How is that different from being a cop?” Jason asked.“Because,” David explained, “being a cop is about acting as the enforcement armof something else, something called government, that pretends to have the rightto do things that normal people have no right to do: tax, regulate, andotherwise mess with people who haven’t hurt anyone. Everyone has the right toprotect himself and his property against thieves and attackers. If someonechooses to hire someone else to do it for him—to do what he himself has a rightto do—that’s perfectly fine. No one imagines the private security guard to havemore rights than his employer, or more rights than anyone else, or even morerights than he had before he got the job. Like everyone else, he has the rightto use force to protect people from violence and fraud; he does not have theright to commit violence or fraud. In the case of a private security guard,everyone can see that. In the case of government agents, people imagine them tohave some rights and powers the rest of us don’t have, as if they are somethinghigher than normal human beings.”“These days, I don’t think many people think cops are better than everyoneelse,” Jason commented.“I don’t mean that they think you’re actually better people. I mean theybelieve, however good or bad a person you are, that by being employed by peoplecalling themselves government, you somehow acquire the right to do things thatyou didn’t have the right to do before, and that most other people still don’thave the right to do.For example, if I made someone pull over and demanded a hundred bucks from himbecause his tail light was broken, he’d probably slug me, and rightfully so. Butwhen someone with a badge and a uniform does it, people perceive it to belegitimate, even necessary. If I told my neighbor he had to give me a thousanddollars a year for the privilege of living in his own house, he’d call the copson me. But when people claiming to be authority do it, and call it ʻpropertytaxes,’ it’s accepted by almost everyone as perfectly legitimate, and the onewho resists it is seen as the crook. Most of the laws cops enforce aren’t aboutprotecting individuals, they’re about robbing and controlling individuals whohaven’t attacked or robbed anyone. And cops are not paid by willing customers.They are paid by taxpayers, who have no choice in the matter. Yes, sometimescops actually stop people from committing real crimes—the kind that havevictims. But most of the time, you get paid with stolen money to oppress thevery people you helped to rob.”“Well,” Jason chuckled, “at least you’re honest about what you think. I justfeel like you’re missing something, but I can’t quite put my finger on it. Like,what if some private person or some gang wanted to hire me to go rob people forthem, and we both agreed to it voluntarily? You wouldn’t think that was okay,would you?”“No, because I don’t think that anyone has the right to rob people. Not you, notthe Mafia, not the government. And if they have no right to do it, they have noright to hire you to do it for them. The point is, you make an exception forgovernment. What you do in the name of government, I don’t believe you would dofor any civilian, no matter how much money he offered you, and I believe that’strue of most cops. If you didn’t also believe that being a cop gives you extrarights, you wouldn’t do it. For example, if some millionaire said to you, ʻIdon’t like my neighbors having guns, and I’ll pay you $100,000 to go disarmthem,’ would you?”“No. That would be illegal, not to mention unjustified.”“How about if they said, ʻI want to hire you to go take money from my neighborsto pay for my kid’s schooling’? Would you?”“No,” Jason replied. “Again, that would be illegal and immoral.”“But all ʻlegal’ means is that the government told you to do it. The way peopleview law these days, whether something is ʻlegal’ or not depends only on whogave the order. If the people who call themselves ʻgovernment’ do it, it’slegal. If anyone else does, it’s not. But whether the order itself is good orevil, and whether anyone should obey it, has nothing to do with who gave theorder. If you pay someone to commit murder or armed robbery, that’s a bad thing,even if you call it ʻlaw’ when you do it. Wouldn’t you agree?”Halen’s voice from downstairs interrupted them. David stood up and said, “Well,our watch is over. I’ve got something I have to do, but I hope we can continuethis discussion later.” He paused for a moment and smiled. “Wouldn’t it be funif we could include the guys out there in this conversation?” he asked, pointingtoward the hills.“Yeah, that would be interesting,” Jason admitted. image [../Images/image00256.jpeg] BETSY was approaching the senatorial office building, on her way back fromanother lunch at Sandy’s, when she noticed a crowd of a few dozen people millingaround out front, though it was below freezing outside. As she got nearer, sherecognized a few other people who worked in the building.“Margaret,” she called to someone she recognized, “what’s going on? Fire drill?”“No one seems to know for sure, but it’s some security thing they’re doing,” thewoman responded, huddled tight inside her hooded coat. “It’s been going on forhalf an hour already. They take two or three people at a time, and that’s onlyevery ten minutes or so. At this rate, we’ll be out here forever.”“Was there a bomb threat or something?” Betsy inquired. “Is anyone hurt?” As sheglanced around, she saw many disgruntled faces, but no one looked frightened.“I’m not sure,” answered the woman. “Some people are saying it’s just someemergency exercise or something. I’m sure glad I wore my heavy coat today. Theydidn’t tell us a thing about this.”For the next twenty minutes, Betsy stood around with the others, wondering whatwas going on. She asked a few other people if they knew anything about thesituation, but they didn’t.“Martha Sharpe?” It was so rare that anyone called Betsy by her true name thatit took her a moment to even notice. “Martha Sharpe?” A tall, dark-skinned manin a police uniform was calling her name and looking around at the crowd.“Over here, officer,” Betsy said, raising her hand. “I’m Martha Sharpe,” shesaid, and wondered what he wanted. No one else was being called by name.“Come with me, Ms. Sharpe,” the man said, now close enough that he didn’t haveto shout. With some difficulty, Betsy followed him through the crowd, as he ledher into the lobby, which was also full of people, and past the securitycheckpoint into the wide hall beyond. “Senator Collins asked that we get youthrough this as quickly as possible,” the man said, his voice much lower now,the roar and bustle of the crowd behind them.“Get me through what?” Betsy asked. “I don’t even know what’s going on.”The man stopped at an unmarked door, and opened it. “You’ll need to leave yourbag out here,” he said, indicating a chair sitting in the hall next to the door,“and any cell phones or other electronic devices.” Betsy complied, and the mangestured for her to go inside. Instead of following her in, he stayed outsideand closed the door, and she heard the door lock. It was a small room, with twofolding metal chairs and an old metal desk. Betsy was the only one in the room,but there was another door on the far wall. She sat down and waited for someoneelse to come in, still wondering what this was all about.She sat there quietly for at least ten minutes, feeling a little nervous, thoughshe couldn’t say why. Finally she stood up and checked the door she had come in.It was locked. She walked to the other door, and knocked on it lightly. “Hello?Anyone there?” Maybe they had just forgotten her, or didn’t know that she wasstill in there. She cautiously tried the door knob, and it too was locked.She wasn’t scared, but she was beginning to be quite annoyed. She knew thatpeople who worked in a building like this had to expect a fair amount ofinconvenience due to security measures, but she didn’t like being locked in aroom alone with no means of communication. What if there had been a fire, orsome other real emergency? What if she had to use the bathroom? She was prettysure this violated some building code or personnel code, and it just feltinsulting.The door in front of her swung open, making her jump a little, and two men inDepartment of Homeland Security uniforms walked in. “Sit down, ma’am,” one ofthem said, and Betsy thought his tone none too polite. She took a seat in thechair again, and looked at the two men. The one who sat down at the desk, theone who had spoken to her, looked about forty, with short black hair, almost ina crew cut, and glasses. He was carrying a folder, which he opened up and laidon the desk, and started looking through. The other man was a bald, stocky blackman, probably about thirty, who stood with his back to the wall and his armscrossed, a grouchy expression seemingly permanently imprinted on his face.Neither of the men seemed happy to be there.“Name and Social Security number,” the man at the desk said. It took Betsy amoment to realize that it was meant as a question.“Martha Sharpe, but I usually go by ‘Betsy.’ My Social Security number is218-77-5523.” The man wrote something down, and didn’t say anything else for afew minutes as he read something. Betsy was beginning to feel as if her time wasbeing wasted.“When’s the last time you traveled outside the country?” the man asked, notlooking up.Betsy had to think for a moment. “I went to Canada, it must have been about tenyears ago. And a few years before that, I went to Mexico with my family, butonly for—”“You’ve never been to Egypt?” the man asked, interrupting.“No,” answered Betsy, wondering what the reason for the question was. The manjotted down some notes.“In case you’re not aware of this,” the man said casually, “it’s a crime to lieto a federal agent.”“I am aware of that, and I didn’t lie,” Betsy said, a little irritated and alittle suspicious. Did they have her confused with someone else? Why would theythink she had ever been to Egypt?“I didn’t say you did,” the man said. “I was just putting you on notice.” Helooked through his papers some more. “Do you own a gun?”“No,” she answered truthfully. The man scribbled something down. “Can I ask whatthis is about?” she asked, after a long pause.“Just answer the questions,” the man said curtly. Betsy was getting more andmore annoyed with this rude treatment. “Have you ever advocated that someonebreak the law?”“I don’t think so,” she answered, trying to think back to something she mighthave said, or even written, back in her college days. “Not that I remember.”“Think carefully, ma’am, because it’s a very broad question,” the man said,looking up at her for the first time. “It might have been something minor. Forexample, did you ever joke to someone that they should cheat on their taxes alittle? Or did you ever help someone get some pot? Or did you ever say youwished someone would kill some politician or cop, even if you were justkidding?”“I don’t know,” Betsy said, her voice giving away her growing exasperation. “Howam I supposed to remember everything I’ve ever said or joked about?”“So, you may have advocated that someone break the law at some point in thepast?” the man asked, his pen poised to write down her response.“Probably. I don’t know.” The more her mind raced, trying to guess what thismight be about, the more on edge she became. “I might have told someone to hurryup when they were already driving the speed limit. I might have told someone tocreep through a red light at an empty intersection at three in the morning.Heck, I might even have told someone to cut the label off a mattress, that labelthat says ‘not to be removed under penalty of law’.”“This is not a joke, ma’am,” the man said, his face still dead serious. “Youranswers are being recorded.”“Well, then, my official answer is, How the hell should I know?” She suddenlythought of Sandy. Boy, would she have a few things to say about this. “Look,”she said, trying to calm herself, “I understand why you have to make sure peopleare who they say they are, and do background checks and things like that, but Ialready went through all this. Everyone who works here already did. They had to,to get jobs here. You must know that.”“This is not an employee screening test. We’re conducting an investigationregarding a matter of national security,” the man said with added emphasis.“That’s all you need to know.” image [../Images/image00252.jpeg] JESSICA sat in the basement with Halen, remembering back to when she had firstseen him, in the doorway of Ben’s cabin, barking out orders. He had seemed sowild, dangerous, and scary at the time. But now, despite having heard him talkso openly about killing people, both as a soldier in war and on his own, he washer biggest comfort. For his part, he tolerated her presence and seemed to enjoyshowing her things and conversing with her. But she searched in vain for anyglimmer of affection in his eyes, or any trace of the warm approval she was usedto seeing in the eyes of boys and men.He sat cross-legged on the floor, with a few small boxes and other things infront of him, doing something with bullets. It seemed to Jessica that he wasunloading and then reloading what she assumed were gun cartridges. He looked upand, as if sensing her curiosity, tossed something shiny to her, which shebarely caught. “Just trading out ball ammo for hollow point,” he said. Shewasn’t sure what that meant, but she looked at the bullet she was holding, andit had a hole in the front of it, with what looked like a star design inside.“Ball ammo makes a little hole; hollow point makes a big hole,” Halen explainedcasually. Jessica wasn’t eager to learn more on the subject. “While we’re downhere,” Halen said, as if remembering something, “Doug’s folks used to have asatellite phone, which he thinks might still be around somewhere, if you want todo a little rummaging.”She stood up and looked around. “What does it look like?”“A big handset, made of yellow plastic,” he answered. “He says it’ll be hard tomiss if it’s still here.”Jessica walked over to a dresser and started going through drawers one by one.“In case you’re wondering,” Halen suddenly said, continuing to load bullets intomagazines, “I didn’t learn how to kill because I think it’s fun. I hate it. It’slike having the job of killing rabid dogs, only a thousand times worse.” Jessicawas uncomfortable just thinking about such things. “Real life isn’t like themovies,” Halen continued. “In the movies, the bad guy is always so obviouslyevil that when he dies, in some spectacular finale, everyone stands up andcheers. That’s not how it works in real life. In real life, the people who haveto be fought or even killed to protect the innocent are hardly ever truly evilthemselves. Instead, their sin is usually just being stupid, and doing whatthey’re told. Guys like Jason. He’s a nice guy, right? His heart’s in the rightplace. But it’s only by a twist of fate that he’s here with us, and not on theother side of those hills waiting for an order to attack us. There’s no glory inkilling someone like him. But sometimes it’s him or you. Sometimes it’s him orsome other innocent person. Authority changes many good people into agents ofevil, and sometimes they have to be destroyed. Whether this country is headedfor absolute tyranny or freedom, the road there won’t be pretty.”Jessica glanced up from the drawer she was going through, and saw an expressionon Halen’s face that looked both powerful and profoundly sad at the same time.“Imagine this,” he continued. “You’re standing in a nice living room, and ahandsome young man walks in—blond hair, blue eyes—and kisses his pretty wife andcute kid goodbye as he heads off to work.” He paused for a moment. “It’s 1942Germany, and the young man works for the Nazis. He’s going off to work, ready toherd the masses of soon-to-be-dead Jews into the cattle cars on the trains. Heprobably won’t actually kill anyone himself. He’s just one cog on one wheel ofthe machine.” He looked down at the floor, and stopped loading magazines for amoment, as if remembering something. “And there you are, with a gun in yourhand,” he said. Then he looked up, straight into Jessica’s eyes. “Would you killhim? Could you?”“Just shoot him, right there?” she asked. “No, I couldn’t.” She didn’t hesitate,because it was the honest answer. But was it an answer she should be proud of,or ashamed of? She wasn’t sure. She closed the last dresser drawer and went tothe closet.“What if you could be there, a couple hours later, when he’s helping to herd afew hundred more innocents off to their deaths, would you wish you had? If youcould watch the people dying in the gas chambers, or being lined up beside theditch and shot. The people who did that—if you could have gone back to the daybefore and killed them, killed them all, would you?”The thought terrified Jessica. “I don’t know,” she said, looking for a lightswitch in the closet. “Maybe I should, but I really don’t think I could.”“That’s because you’re a decent person,” Halen said, which surprised her. “Butthis is where the belief in ‘authority’ leads. Good people don’t want to useviolence. They want to get along, and treat others with respect. But not thestate. The state uses violence for everything it does. Every law is a command,and if people disobey, force is used to make them comply. And good people don’twant to resist, especially not with violence. Even if they don’t like the law,even if they think it’s unjust, the last thing they want to do is kill some poorpawn who is just doing what he was told.”Halen tossed a full magazine aside and picked up the next one. “It would be somuch easier if only bad people did bad things, but through the belief in‘authority,’ otherwise good people routinely become agents of evil. Even theatrocities of Hitler’s regime, Stalin’s regime, and all the others, were theresult of a few truly evil people, and thousands upon thousands of merelyobedient people. The real villains aren’t stupid enough to go to the front linesthemselves. That’s what compliant subjects are for. But the result is that thegood people of the world are left with a horrible choice to make: either let thebad stuff happen, or kill people who are merely misguided or ignorant. Mostpeople choose the first option, and mankind has suffered unspeakable horrorsbecause of it.”“You don’t make the future sound very bright,” Jessica remarked, rummagingthrough the boxes on the closet floor.“Because of the belief in authority, it won’t be. Whether in the end tyrannywins or freedom wins, either way, a lot of good people will suffer and a lotwill die in the process. Basically good people will be killing basically goodpeople. That’s what every war is. The average soldier who fought for Hitler wasno different from the average American soldier. He loved his country. He valuedlaw and order, and took pride in following his orders, doing what he was told todo, and doing it well. But his nationalism and pack mentality—and most of all,his unshakable faith in authority—rendered him blind to the evil he wascommitting. It’s the same with every army, and every cop. Above all else, theytake pride in their ability to obey without question, as if it’s a virtueinstead of the most heinous sin a person can commit.” He tossed another magazineaside.“Most people who commit evil are not guilty of hatred or malice,” he continued,“they’re just morally negligent. They don’t take the time to question what theyare told. They hurt other people—rob them, harass them, imprison them, even killthem—just because they were told to. And not only don’t the obedient takeresponsibility for their own actions, they don’t even see what they do as beingtheir own actions. They pretend they are just tools of something called ‘law,’and they judge themselves based only on how well they obey orders, neverquestioning whether they should obey those orders at all.”The image of the fat kid at the airport, trying to look authoritative in his TSAoutfit, popped into Jessica’s head. It hadn’t been his idea to inconvenienceher, but he did anyway, because that’s what the rules told him to do.“Tell me this,” Halen continued. “If you hadn’t hurt anyone, but someonebelieved it was his duty to capture you and put you in a cage for the rest ofyour life, and kill you if you resisted, what would you do?”“Defend myself, or try to get away, I guess,” she said. The question didn’treally seem hypothetical: she had done nothing wrong, yet her life was now indanger.“And what if you were trapped? What if your only choices were to kill the guy orto let him lock you up forever? Could you kill him?”“I don’t know. I hope I never have to make a decision like that.” She paused fora moment, finding the discussion more uncomfortable than ever. “I agree withwhat you’re saying— the innocent should be protected, even if it takes violenceto do it. I just don’t really know if I could do it myself.”“Well, the way things are going now, you may soon have to decide between killingone of those order-obeying drones out there, or letting him kill you.” Havingfound nothing of interest in the closet, Jessica walked out into the room again.Halen paused for a moment, looking right into her eyes. “Let me put it this way.Would you rather let your mother and father lose their daughter, or would yourather kill another human being in order to save their kid?”Jessica suddenly remembered her father’s voice on the radio, and had to fightback tears. Her family’s grief was like a knife in her heart. “Well, I don’tknow how to shoot, even if I wanted to,” she said, knowing it was a cop-out.“And I’m not sure if I could do it anyway.”“Well, I can help with the first part,” Halen said, perfectly seriously. “Butmaking the choice is something only you can do.”“God, I can’t believe I’m talking about killing cops—killing anyone,” she said,throwing her hands in the air. “I just want my nice easy life back.” She forcedherself not to cry. Of all the people she could think of, Halen was the lastperson she wanted to break down into tears in front of. “How did I get into allthis? This all seems unreal.”“You’re learning first hand that people don’t just decide to make themselvesinto revolutionaries,” he replied. “They are made into revolutionaries byothers. They’re usually just people who wanted to mind their own business and beleft alone, but came to the point where they realized that things were badenough that someone had to do something, and that ‘someone’ was them. Andbecause most good people dislike conflict and violence, they usually wait untilit’s too late before they decide to do anything.”Halen stood up, and in one smooth movement picked up a rifle off the couch nextto him, hit a button to drop the magazine out and caught it with his other hand,and then pulled back the action to make sure the chamber was empty. Then withboth hands he held the rifle out toward Jessica, the barrel pointing to herleft. “Time for a crash course,” he said. She stood still for a moment, beforereluctantly walking toward him. When she started timidly reaching for the rifle,he pulled it back a bit. “First of all, don’t ever point it at anything oranyone you don’t intend to kill.” He paused for a moment, as if to let thatmessage sink in. “Safety’s on the left. Try looking through the scope. Aim itout the window.” She cautiously accepted the rifle, scared that it might go offat any moment. She held it up the way she had seen people do it in the movies.It felt awkward and heavy.“I can’t see anything,” she said, the scope showing nothing but blackness. “Oh,wait,” she added, adjusting the gun a bit. “Okay, I was too far back.”“Keep the butt of it snug against your shoulder,” Halen said, standing behindher and bringing the rifle up a bit. “Keep your finger off the trigger untilyou’re ready to fire.” Jessica jerked her finger away from the trigger. “It’snot loaded,” he said patiently, “but always treat a gun as if it is.”“Would this thing flatten me if I fired it?” she asked.“It’s only .223,” he responded, but she had no idea what that meant. “It gives alittle kick, but it won’t knock you over. Just hold it snug, but not too tightagainst your shoulder.” Halen adjusted the rifle a bit, and repositionedJessica’s left hand farther forward. “The most important thing for accuracy isnot to jerk the trigger. When you’re ready to fire, give the trigger a steadysqueeze, not a sudden yank.” Jessica was already feeling the fatigue of holdingthe rifle up, and lowered it. “It’s a shame you don’t have time for some realpractice,” Halen added, “but somehow I don’t think it would be a good idea to gooutside and start shooting at cans right now.”“Is this, like, a machine gun?” she asked, feeling self-conscious about herignorance. She had never held any sort of gun before, and knew nothing aboutthem, but thought this one looked like a pretty serious weapon. She felt onlyslightly less scared holding it than she would have if someone else had beenpointing it at her.“No. Only one bullet comes out when you pull the trigger. But it issemi-automatic, so as soon as you fire, it’s ready to fire again, but you haveto let go and pull the trigger again.”“If my dad could see me now,” Jessica muttered, as if to herself, as she scannedthe fields outside through the scope.“Well, whether he ever sees you again might depend on whether you know how touse this thing,” Halen commented, which didn’t really comfort Jessica.Suddenly feeling silly, she carefully put the rifle down on the back of thecouch. “I don’t know,” she protested. “I don’t think I could do it. I don’tthink I could fire at a person.”“I hope you never have to find out,” he said, picking up the gun himself, “butI’m afraid that, considering where you are right now, it’s something you’dbetter think about.”How about if I just stay near you? she thought, but didn’t say it out loud.Despite her growing attachment to him, Jessica still wasn’t sure what to thinkof Halen. When he spoke to her, he seemed perfectly reasonable and kind. But thethings he had done, even the fact that he knew how to do them, still disturbedher. Could someone be that good at mortal combat and still be a good person? Itseemed to her like an unsolvable paradox: sometimes good people have to useviolence to stop bad people, but how can someone become so proficient at killingand still be a good person?She remembered having a similar thought before, when an issue came up in acivics class at school. Assuming there were some people in the world who were sobad and dangerous that they should be put to death—and Jessica believed therewere— was it even possible for a good person to have the job of executioner?Would a good person ever agree to do such a job? And if not, should the job begiven to some sadistic monster who might enjoy it? Which would be worse, to havea good person suffer the anguish of taking human lives, or to have an evilperson take joy in it? She didn’t really want to think about it, but one thingshe knew was that, just then, she was glad to have someone like Halen around. image [../Images/image00251.jpeg] JASON stood in the open doorway, looking out past the patio to the hills beyond.Somewhere over there, just out of sight, was the trailer he had sat in front offor so many hours, watching those same hills from the other side. And here hewas, still watching and waiting, feeling the same nervous uncertainty. Whatevermalicious presence his mind had previously imagined on this side of the hills,that was no longer what he feared. Nor did he fear any particular person outbeyond those hills. He feared only being caught in the middle of a conflict thathe no longer wanted any part of.“Coming through,” came a gruff voice behind him. He turned to see Keith carryinga large wooden box, and stepped out of the doorway to let him through. Keithwalked over to a patio table and set the box down. He started taking out itscontents and arranging them on the table: glass bottles, wires, rags, 9-voltbatteries, and some other odds and ends. He sat down and started working atassembling something out of the pieces. Jason watched for a while, reluctant toask what he was doing. Keith seemed to him the most hostile person there. EvenHalen, who was so cold and callous, but not openly malicious, now bothered Jasonless than Keith did. Then again, all of them, including Keith, had agreed to setJason free, and even let him have his rifle back, still loaded.“What are you making?” Jason finally asked, trying to sound civil.“Some presents for your buddies,” Keith said, not looking up from his work.Jason would have guessed they were Molotov cocktails, but the wires andbatteries hinted at something more sophisticated. Saying nothing more, hewatched quietly as Keith assembled a total of five devices, each having a bottlefull of liquid—something flammable, Jason assumed—with some sort of triggermechanism attached. Then Keith put them back into the box and walked out beyondthe garden, into the field. He knelt down, took out one of the devices, and putit on the ground, carefully covering it with the dry grass.It was clear to Jason that they were some type of explosives or fire bombs, andthat Keith was setting up a mine field, with the five devices equally spacedacross the front lawn, about a hundred feet from the house. For some reason,this bothered him a lot more than the guns that Halen and Keith perpetuallycarried. Obviously these people meant to forcibly resist any assault on theplace, but the image of a fellow agent being engulfed in a ball of flame afterstepping on one of these things was too much for him to quietly accept.“Is that really necessary?” he asked Keith as he came back, carrying the emptybox.“That depends on whether your Nazi friends out there decide to comegoose-stepping in here,” Keith said with obvious disdain. “If so, then yes, it’snecessary to cook those bastards alive.”The harshness of the comment snapped Jason out of his assumed role of neutralspectator. Trying to remain calm, he said, “I think your image of those guys ismore messed up than their image of you. They have families, you know. Wives andkids.”Keith walked right up to Jason, until his face was just inches away. “Then maybethey should have stayed home with them,” he growled, “instead of coming onto myproperty with their Gestapo bullshit.”“If you had nothing to hide here, maybe you should have just let them do theirjob,” Jason said, his voice beginning to rise, his fear turning to anger. “Ifyou had just let them do the search, and they found nothing, none of this wouldhave happened.”“If we all just cowered before fascists like you,” Keith snarled, “and let youdo whatever the hell you want, you might be nice to us. Is that it?” He leanedin even closer and, hammering his index finger into Jason’s chest for emphasis,added in a harsh whisper, “If not for David and Halen, I would have blown yourdamn head off long ago, so feel free to shut the hell up.”At that, Jason reached to push Keith’s hand away, but Keith blocked the swingwith one hand, and with his other hand grabbed Jason by the throat. It felt likea vise around his neck, instantly cutting off breath and blood. In desperation,he swung with his free left hand at Keith’s face and caught him hard on the jaw,but Keith barely flinched. His adrenaline rising, Jason swung again, and thistime Keith ducked, but let go at the same time. Jason was so focused on beingable to breathe again that he didn’t notice the left uppercut from Keith, whichfelt like a baseball bat as it slammed into the side of his jaw. He reeledbackward, almost falling over, his balance and sense of direction gone haywire.The world seemed to be spinning, but he could just make out the image of Keithlunging toward him, both hands outstretched. Jason swung his foot up, and mostlyby luck, planted his boot firmly in Keith’s stomach, which stopped his forwardprogress, but also sent Jason toppling over backward, crashing into two aluminumpatio chairs in the process. He quickly struggled to his feet and turned,expecting another charge from Keith.Instead, he saw David standing in front of him, with Keith behind him, red-facedand breathing hard, his hands clenched into fists. “Is this really necessary?”David asked in a calm voice. Neither Jason nor Keith said anything. “I don’tknow what this is about, but I was under the impression that, whatever you thinkof each other, we had achieved a state of peaceful coexistence here.” Still,neither responded. “Any reason we can’t go back to that?” At last Keith seemedto calm down a little. Without a word, he picked up the empty box and walkedinto the house.“Are you okay?” David asked Jason.“Yeah,” came the reply, “I think so. That guy is a freaking maniac. He needs tobe put on a damn leash.” David held his hand out toward a chair, and Jason satdown, his heart still pounding and his hands shaking a bit.“I don’t know what that was about,” David said again, taking a seat next toJason, “but just so you know, Keith has plenty of reasons for not liking thepolice, and I don’t just mean philosophical reasons. So try not to take itpersonally.”“Yeah, and I’m sure the cops around here love him, too,” Jason remarked, hisbreathing starting to slow down to normal.“If you knew his story, you might be a little more sympathetic to hisconfrontational demeanor.” David gazed out over the hills. When Jason saidnothing, he went on. “Keith’s father was a cop, as well as a generally rottenperson. He bullied Keith and his mother for years, while the other cops lookedthe other way. Eventually Keith left home, and he’s been in trouble with the lawever since. He was never exactly a good kid. He’s always been a hothead—gettinginto fights as long as I can remember. It’s not too hard to figure out that hesees his dad in every bully he encounters, and takes it on himself to punishthem. He’s got this rage inside him; it’s as if he’s on a one­man crusade towipe out the abuse of power, and he’s frustrated that he can’t get all of it.Mind you, I’m not telling you anything he’s trying to keep secret,” Davidcontinued. “In fact, he seems to be quite proud of his run-ins with theauthorities.” Jason said nothing, but listened with interest.“The first time he went to prison, it was for beating an older kid, almost todeath,” David said. “The older kid was the leader of a gang, a gang that hadbeen terrorizing a black family—the first one to move into their whiteneighborhood. When the gang decided to pick on the youngest kid in the family,Keith took on three of them and almost killed the biggest; he put that boy inthe hospital for a month.” A sad sort of smile appeared on David’s face as hegazed at the ground. “Keith said the gang never bothered those people again.”Then David leaned back in his chair, folded his hands on his stomach, and turnedhis eyes to the sky. “On another occasion, he went to prison for destroying apolice car with a sledgehammer while the cop was inside a local housing projectrunning his own little extortion ring. The cop ended up getting fired, but Keithwent to prison again. After that, you can bet that the local cops weren’texactly friendly with Keith, and he wasn’t very friendly with them.”“He’s been to prison twice?” Jason asked.“Three times. He was also convicted of shooting his father.”“He killed his own father?” Jason asked incredulously.“Didn’t kill him,” said David. “Didn’t even shoot him, in fact. He was justconvicted of shooting him. When Keith’s mom finally got the courage to divorcehis dad, the guy just wouldn’t leave her alone. She got a restraining order, buthe still came around, and the other cops wouldn’t do anything about it, ofcourse. It was getting really ugly, and she began to fear for her life. Shebought a gun, and when he came after her again, she shot him. He didn’t die. Hewas only hit in the leg. But since he was a cop, the local DA didn’t want to letit slide as an act of self-defense. To make a long story short, Keith refused tolet his mom go to prison for defending herself, so he said he did it. His momkept insisting that she’d done it, and his dad refused to testify against eitherone of them. In the end, the jury still believed that Keith was guilty. Gofigure. They believed his lie, and he spent years in prison for it.” There was along pause.“Wait a second,” said Jason, frowning. “With that criminal history, he’s notallowed to have guns at all.”“Well, he was seventeen, still a juvenile, when he was convicted of theshooting,” David explained. “And he was even younger when he fought that gang.The only one that happened when he wasn’t a minor was the incident with thepolice car. And the cops were so embarrassed by the events surrounding that onethat he got it bargained down to misdemeanor disorderly conduct. So after allthat, he’s got no felonies on his record, and isn’t even on parole anymore. Sounder state and federal law, he’s still allowed to have guns. Of course,” headded with a smile, “he’d probably have them whether the government said hecould or not.”David suddenly stood up, as if he had somewhere to go. “So now you know. Irealize that knowing all that may not make dealing with him any easier,” hesaid, “but it may make his behavior a little more understandable. And on apractical level,” he added, “I expect that if you decide to avoid him from nowon, he’ll probably avoid you, too.” Having said that, David walked away, leavingJason sitting alone, thinking about Keith. Maybe under that unattractive blanketof hostility and anger lurked a heart more noble than most. Jason had alwaysfelt it was his calling to defend the innocent from the bad guys. It seemed thatKeith felt the same calling, but it had taken him down a very different road.Jason wondered what he would have done if his life had been like Keith’s. image [../Images/image00256.jpeg] BETSY stood in her office, arms folded and brow furrowed. “I mean, it was justso stupid,” she was saying to Grant. “It must have been half an hour of allthese stupid questions.”“I didn’t realize they were making it such a big deal,” Grant saidsympathetically, “or I would have seen if I could have gotten you out of itsomehow.”“Well, it wasn’t really a big deal. But why do they have to have such rude jerksdoing the interviews? And why couldn’t they give us some warning that they’d bedoing it? Worst of all, by the time I got out, the crowd was gone. I think theylet everyone after me skip the thing altogether.”“Yeah, I later heard they were just going through the procedures for a certainnumber of employees. It was just a practice.” Then he laughed. “I had them moveyou to the front of the line, to get you through faster. If I’d just donenothing, you would have gotten here sooner, and without going through all that.Big help I was, huh?”“Well, thanks for the attempt, anyway,” she said.He glanced at his watch, and stood up. “Oops, late again. I’ll be right back,”he said, and strode out of the office.Only a moment later, before Betsy could even sit down at her desk and re-openthe file she had been working on, Sandy came barging through the door, withoutknocking, looking furious. “Unbelievable!” she said, “un-freaking-believable!Wanna hear what just happened to me?” she demanded rhetorically. She sat downhard in the chair facing Betsy’s desk. Betsy didn’t have time to answer beforeSandy continued. “I was at home, just me and Vee, when there’s a knock on thedoor. I open the door and it’s two feds! It’s the damn Secret Service!”“What? Why?” Betsy couldn’t imagine that Grant would have suggested such athing, and wondered if it had anything to do with what she had gone throughearlier today, with the security procedures.“A couple days ago I was in one of those online political chat rooms, arguingwith the fascists and the socialists. Well, it turns out the feds weremonitoring it, and didn’t like what I had to say.”“What did you say?” Betsy asked, trying to imagine all of the controversialthings her friend might be capable of uttering.“I said the world would be a better place if the President got hit by a bus anddied,” Sandy answered.“That’s all?”“Well, that was the worst, and that’s the part they asked me about. They had aprintout of the whole discussion. What’s worse,” Sandy said, leaning forward andlowering her voice, “the whole chat system is supposed to be anonymous. No oneuses their real names. But they knew it was me. Snooping bastards. They showedup at my house and started grilling me in front of my kid, like I’m somedangerous criminal. And they kept trying to get inside, even pushed me a littleonce, but I said that unless they had a warrant, they could bloody well stand inthe hallway. I should have just slammed the door in their faces and not said aword, but I was so surprised by the whole thing, I didn’t have time to think.”“So, what happened? I mean, they didn’t arrest you, did they?”“No, but they threatened to if I didn’t answer their questions. They asked meall sorts of stupid stuff. Vee was there the whole time. I thought of sendingher away, but then I thought they might behave better with a little kidwatching. Man, I was shaking for an hour afterwards, ready to strangle someone.”“Well, what did they ask about?”“Who I voted for, what I thought of the President, what I thought of SenatorCollins, whether I had been a member of a bunch of different political groups,most of which I’ve never even heard of—they might have been making them up. Andthey asked what I knew about the Iron Web.” Sandy jumped to her feet and walkedto the window. “Man, this pisses me off! What is wrong with this country?! Youcan’t say what you think now without having feds show up at your door?”“Did you get their names?”“No,” said Sandy, looking down. “I was so caught off guard, I didn’t even thinkof it until after they left. And they were there almost half an hour. I shouldhave been taping it.” She threw her arms up in disgust. “This is how they do it!They don’t come right out and say, ‘You can’t criticize us,’ but if you do, theyinvestigate you, harass you—I feel like strangling someone!”“Not me, I hope,” came Grant’s voice as he walked back into the office.Sandy turned toward the window, folded her arms, and went dead silent.“Sandy, why don’t you tell him?” Betsy suggested in her most soothing voice.“Why?” Sandy barked, spinning around, her expression as angry as ever. “Theywork for him already. Don’t you get it?” After that she clammed up.“Who works for me?” Grant asked, still pleasant and calm.“If you won’t tell him, can I?” Betsy asked. Sandy said nothing, and Betsycontinued. “She got a visit from the Secret Service because of things she saidin an internet chat room.”“What kind of things?” he asked casually, putting his briefcase down beside hisdesk.“Saying I wished the President would get hit by a bus,” Sandy said, still facingthe window.“I wouldn’t mind that either,” Grant said in an offhand way, sitting down at hisdesk. “I hope they don’t visit me next.”“It’s not funny!” Sandy almost screamed, spinning around toward Grant, and Betsycould see she was on the verge of tears. “Those fascists came to my house andtreated me like a criminal in front of my kid! And it was all because I saidwhat I think. I didn’t threaten anyone. I didn’t tell anyone to do anythingillegal.”“Well, what do you intend to do about it?” Grant asked, still calm and friendly,which only seemed to annoy Sandy even more. “File a complaint? Maybe a lawsuit?Sounds like something the ACLU might be interested in.”“It doesn’t matter what I do,” Sandy said, sounding exhausted. “They already didit, and they’ll do it again—if not to me then to somebody else. I just can’tbelieve the country has come to this.”“Well, times change,” Grant said. “People in government are pretty on-edge thesedays. They know there are a lot of people angry about the economy, our militarypolicy, and so on. And some of those angry people mean them harm.”“So that makes it okay to spy on everyone,” Sandy snapped, “and harass anyonewho happens to criticize the government?”“It doesn’t make it okay, but it’s to be expected,” Grant replied.“To be expected? What does that mean? We’re supposed to put up with it?”“Well, I’ll ask again: What are you going to do about it?”Sandy fumed silently for a moment, and then barked, “Nothing. Not a damn thing.They know I don’t have the time and money to do a thing about it, and they knowthat nothing would happen to them even if I did. So they’ll get away with it.”“Well, then, it’s probably best if you put it out of your mind as soon aspossible, instead of letting it stress you out like this,” Grant said kindly.“Just pretend it didn’t happen?” Sandy asked, incredulous.“Well, what good will it do to dwell on it?” Grant asked.“Isn’t there anything you can do?” asked Betsy.“Like what?” Grant replied. “I could ask them to leave you alone, and I will ifyou want, but chances are they would anyway from now on. Tomorrow they’ll havetheir eyes on someone else. They do a little intel, make their presence known,and move on to someone else. That’s how they operate.”“Make their presence known?” Betsy said, somewhat surprised. “That soundscreepy. Sounds a little like the Mafia.”“These are dangerous times,” Grant replied. “They’re doing whatever they thinkthey have to do to protect the President. It’s their job.”“So we throw the First Amendment out the window, because these are dangeroustimes?” Sandy asked sarcastically. “That sounds a whole lot more dangerous to methan folks mouthing off in chat rooms.”“Well, the focus of the Secret Service is the security of the President,” heresponded. “If you want someone to focus on freedom of speech, try the ACLU.Sorry, but that’s life.”Sandy stood there fuming for a minute, her arms crossed, and then said to Betsy,between her clenched teeth, “I’ll see you after work,” and walked out.Betsy looked at Grant, who was calmly going through his morning stack of mailand articles to review. His cavalier attitude about what Sandy had been throughbothered Betsy, but she couldn’t think of anything else to say, so she quietlywent back to organizing files. image [../Images/image00252.jpeg] JESSICA had decided to try her hand at whittling. She’d seen Doug and Keithdoing it a lot, and some of Doug’s carvings were really good. She sat on theback step with a small knife and a chunk of wood, attempting to make the chunkresemble a duck. It took a lot of concentration, and made the time pass.Halen was nearby, looking into the woods with a scope, checking and adjustingthings.“Halen, can I ask you something?” Jessica asked.“You can ask me anything you want,” he said curtly. “And I’ll decide whether toanswer or not.”She shaved off a few more bits of wood while she gathered her courage. “I heardsomething about you killing a senator,” she said.“That was a statement,” said Halen. “I thought you had a question.”“You don’t like to talk about it?” she asked.“No, I don’t like to talk about it,” Halen replied. “But if you want to know whyI did it, I’ll tell you.”“I do want to know,” she said. “At least I think I do.”Halen adjusted things for a while, until Jessica thought maybe he wasn’t goingto tell her after all. But after a few minutes, he sat down next to her on thestep, with something like a metal box, and began taking it apart.“I’d rather just tell you than have you imagining all kinds of things,” he said.“It happened four years ago. Seems like forever, though. It all started at oneof those fancy parties where politicians kiss each other’s asses and tell eachother how important they are. A few of us Marines, including a buddy of mine andme, were there in full-dress uniform—decorations to please the politicians.”Jessica found it hard to imagine the man in front of her as a well-kempt,disciplined Marine. “Chuck brought along his wife, Cleo—gorgeous girl. Well, itwasn’t long before the senator’s son, Andrew, was hitting on her. However ithappened, later on in the evening, when he was pretty sloshed, Andrew managed toget Cleo alone, and when he couldn’t seduce her, he attacked her. She managed toget away before much happened—she was a strong girl, and he was really drunk—butwhen she found Chuck and me, she was in tears. When Chuck heard what happened, Ionly barely managed to hold him back from tearing Andrew to pieces. I told himit would be better to do things the legal way.” He stopped talking for a fewminutes, concentrating on taking apart the device. Jessica wondered if shereally wanted him to go on.“I was wrong,” he said finally. “Cleo filed charges against the bastard, but ajudge who was a drinking buddy of the senator dismissed the case. Meanwhile, wefound out that she wasn’t the first woman Andrew had attacked. The guy made BillClinton look like a monk. There were accusations of sexual harassment, rape,assault and battery—lots of them—all in D.C., and all dismissed without trial.The senator apparently had friends in all the right places.”“Chuck kept talking about killing the bastard, since the law was obviously nevergoing to touch him. I talked him out of it. It was my idea for them to go publicwith the story, to tell the world just what kind of people the senator and hisson really were. Cleo did a couple of interviews with reporters, and Chuck didone too, telling their story and the stories of Andrew’s other victims—at leastthe ones who dared to talk about it. And they were told that the story was allset to run. But it didn’t.”“The night before the story was supposed to come out, the DEA raided Chuck andCleo’s house.” Halen went silent again, for a long time. “They were bothkilled,” he finally said. “At least Chuck took out four of those bastards beforethey got him. The government’s version of the story was predictable: they saidChuck was a drug dealer—which I know was an absolute lie— claimed that theyannounced who they were and why they were there, and that Chuck fired first. Isuspect that’s pure bullshit, but of course we’ll never get the truth, becauseas usual, the victims of the government thugs are dead. So they killed him,dragged his name through the mud, and called it a day.” Jessica had stoppedwhittling and was now listening intently, her eyes wide.“After that, I pulled whatever strings I could find, inside the military andout, to try to get some justice. But the feds did just what they did at Waco andRuby Ridge: the crooks investigated themselves, and exonerated themselves of anywrongdoing. What a joke. I tried going to the media, but they wouldn’t run thestory in any way other than the government version.”“The last straw was another story,” Halen continued in his emotionless voice.“At about the same time, a young girl in Maryland pressed charges against Andrewfor rape. It was outside of D.C. and the senator couldn’t pull strings soeasily. So a preliminary hearing date was set, and it looked like someone wasactually going to get Andrew into court.”He paused for a long time again. “Someone killed her, a few days before thehearing. Sweet little girl, still in high school. Quiet, shy, good student. Theyfound her at home with her throat slit.” Jessica gasped involuntarily. “No signsof forced entry, the house was locked, nothing was stolen,” Halen went on. “Shewas murdered to protect darling little Andrew, Son of Satan, from having to faceany consequences for his actions.”Halen took a deep breath. “I didn’t sleep for three days. That little girlhaunted me. Chuck and Cleo haunted me. I was desperately trying to figure outwho to go to—who in the system I could trust—who might provide a little justice.And then—and I remember this clear as day—it suddenly hit me, how utterly insaneit was for me to try to find anyone inside their little club of narcissists whomight give a damn. That’s the beauty of their game: they do whatever they want,and then they tell their victims that if they want justice, they have to go begfor it from someone else inside their club—someone appointed and paid for by thecrooks themselves. It was like trying to find someone inside the Mafia to tellthe heavies to please be nice. What could be more absurd?”“Anyway, a week after the girl was killed, the senator had another fundraisingparty at his house. I showed up with the knife Chuck used to carry—a big,Rambo-looking thing the rest of us would always kid him about. The security atthe party was pathetic. I walked right in, in full-dress uniform again, theknife worn in open view on my belt. I guess they figured anyone dressed likethat was a government thug, and no threat to the masters. Anyway, I walked rightup to the senator and asked to speak to him in private. He led me into an emptyroom, and I jammed the knife up under his jaw, straight up to the top of hisskull.” Jessica jumped at the words. There was no drama or emotion in Halen’sreporting of the event. He described it just as he might describe swatting amosquito. Somehow it would have been less disturbing for her if he had soundedangry. But he described the event without a hint of feeling.“He never had time to make a sound,” Halen continued, “and died with a look ofsurprise on his face. I left the room, locked the door behind me, and went tofind Andrew. It wasn’t long before I found him trying to coax a couple of powergroupies out of their dresses. I politely asked them to step outside for amoment. I didn’t have the knife then. I’d left it stuck in the HonorableSenator’s head, as a message. So I had to kill Andrew with my bare hands, notthat it was very hard. It seems beating up petite young women was the extent ofhis manly abilities. I snapped his neck, walked downstairs and right out thefront door. I’ve been in hiding ever since.” After a moment, he added, “The fedsout there don’t know I’m here. If they did, they would have leveled this placelong ago.”Jessica just sat and stared at her carving. She was sitting right next to afugitive murderer. Those hands right beside her, working on that box, hadsnapped a man’s neck and shoved a knife into another man’s head.“After that,” Halen continued, “I monitored the newspapers and the radio,thinking it wouldn’t take long before somebody recognized the knife and put thepieces together. Then the story would finally break: vigilante justice carriedout against overprivileged rapist and his corrupt father. It took a couple daysbefore anything hit the papers, and the story was that the senator and his sonhad died in a boating accident. And every paper cried about what a tragedy itwas for us to lose a great man like the senator. They all made him out to besome great statesman, and a crusader for the little guy.”If this had been a movie, Jessica thought, she would have cheered for the guywho had taken the law into his own hands. But knowing it was real, and hearingthe killer himself describe the event, she couldn’t decide whether he was a heroor a monster. She wondered if it was possible for someone to be both at the sametime.“I never realized until that moment just how big, and how well-orchestrated, thegovernment’s lie-machine really is,” said Halen. “Sure, they can expose a littlescandal here and there, and leave a sacrificial lamb hanging out to dry now andthen, but when it comes to the big game, you will never hear or read a word thatmight threaten the power system itself. Every word, down to the last detail,even in the stories which pretend to be critical of the government, is acarefully planned message, designed to keep the people stupid and enslaved. Theycan get away with any lie, however patently untrue, however ridiculous, becauseall of their little puppet mouths in the media will say it in unison, over andover again, until the masses accept it as the gospel truth.”“Like how Iron Web hijackers crashed the plane I was on,” Jessica interjected.“Yeah, just like that,” Halen answered. After a short pause, he stated, “So nowyou know.”Jessica whittled for a while, trying to collect her thoughts. Halen went onworking on his device, as if he didn’t care what she thought of him. But Jessicafelt she had to say something. She had to have some response to that story.“I think what you did was right,” she said finally. “The justice system issupposed to take those predatory people out of society. But when itdoesn’t—well, somewhere out there is the next girl Andrew would have gone after.You saved her, though she’ll never know it. She’ll never even know who you are.”“It’s enough for me to know that she’ll never know who Andrew is, either,” hereplied. “That alone makes it worth it.”“Does it bother you? I mean, if I killed someone, even if it was the right thingto do, I think it would haunt me forever.”“It would,” he said. “Killing is sometimes a necessary evil, but it’s always anevil. Every time you do it, you kill part of yourself as well. The guys who liketo brag about what they did in war, they’re either lying, or they’re monsters.Good people don’t want to think about that stuff.”“I’m sorry I made you talk about it,” Jessica said.“Don’t be,” said Halen. “I’d rather you heard it straight from me.” He wasputting the metal box back together now. “I want you to know how to handle agun, but I hope to God you never have to use one. No matter how necessary orjustified it is, taking a life will always take some humanity away from the onewho does it. No one comes back from war unharmed.”She carefully carved off a few shavings from her duck before she looked at Halenagain. “Do you think you could ever go back to a normal life?” she asked. “Havea wife and kids?”“No, it’s too late for me,” he answered without hesitation. “I’m damaged goods.I’ve managed to keep myself relatively sane, and I still know the differencebetween right and wrong— I still know there is a difference—but the world outthere—” He stopped talking for a minute. “Every once in a while, I go into town,and I realize how different the world looks to everyone else. They’re chattingabout what to have for dinner, or what happened on some stupid TV show. They’llnever know. I can’t just forget what I’ve seen, and what I’ve had to do. I can’tever go back.”“Sort of like Frodo, in Lord of the Rings,” Jessica blurted out. “He said thatthe Shire was saved, but not for him.” She suddenly felt silly, comparingHalen’s life to a fantasy story. “Sorry, I know it’s just fiction,” she saidquickly, “but I love those books. And Tolkien, the author, drew a lot from hisown experiences in World War I. He was—”“Hey, Jess!” Josh’s voice came from the top of the stairs. “Wanna play cardswith me and Jason?” image [../Images/image00251.jpeg] JASON sat cross-legged on the floor, happy to be in Jessica’s company, even ifJosh was there too. He’d been trying to read a book he’d picked from thebookshelf in the master bedroom, a bookshelf covering an entire wall and packedwith interesting titles, from classic novels to current events. And this is justtheir summer home, Jason thought. He had learned from Doug that his mother was acollege professor and his father a defense attorney, both extremely well-read.But, interesting as the book was, he couldn’t distract himself from histhoughts. He was relieved when Joshua came down the stairs, having finished histurn watching out the window, and suggested a game of cards with Jessica.“Where’s your family, Josh?” Jason asked.“My parents’ place is up the road a bit, about a mile,” Josh said. “I come downhere and hang out as much as they let me.”“Don’t you go to school?” Jason asked.“Nah, I left school last year,” Josh replied, dealing out cards. “I thought itwas stupid and talked my parents into lettin’ me do the whole homeschoolingthing. It’s no trouble for them. I’m doing this online program that gives me ahigh school diploma, and when I’m not doing that, I learn real stuff.”Jason vaguely knew that homeschooling was a divisive political issue right now,with some groups determined to outlaw it and others just as determined to defendit. He had never really thought about it much himself.“So, what’s ʻreal stuff’?” he asked Josh.“Well, lots of books you won’t find in the school library, for starters,” Joshreplied with a chuckle. “And real-life stuff. Like, I have an online business.And I come here to learn to shoot and hunt, and generally how to survive in thewild.”Jessica looked up from her cards and made a wry face. “I was going on my firstreal camping trip when the plane crashed,” she said. Then she went quiet, as ifshe didn’t want to express her next thought. That’s happening a lot around here,Jason thought. It seemed as if everyone was trying to keep the conversationlight.“How long have you been shooting?” she asked Josh.“About two years,” he said. “Since Keith got out of prison. Halen’s taught me alot since he’s been here, too.” He stopped talking and took his turn. “Halen’stough, though,” he said when he was done. “I used to laser myself sometimes—andsometimes other people, with the Glock. Only when it wasn’t loaded, of course.”“What’s lasering?” asked Jessica.“Oh, just when you point the gun the wrong way as you’re moving around. Picturea laser always pointing out the end of the barrel; you’re supposed to make surethat line never points at anyone. Like when you’re drawing, you can laseryourself if you’re not careful. Go, Jason.”Jason took his turn in the game while Josh went on. “Anyway, the first timeHalen saw that, he smacked me so hard on the shoulder I almost fell over. Hewasn’t even mad. You know how he is. He just said a sure consequence trains youbetter than a hypothetical one. I only did it one more time, and got anotherwhack.”Jessica’s eyes were wide. “You don’t think he’d do that to me, do you?” sheasked.Josh shrugged, and with a mischievous grin said, “Don’t see why not. He’sserious about gun safety. But he’s also spent hours with me, teaching me to slowmy breath down and Zen out, you know, so there’s nothing in the world except meand the target. I’m pretty good now. My groupings on the target keep gettingsmaller.”“I wish I could actually shoot at a target,” said Jessica.Jason thought wistfully that it would be fun to go shooting with these people,and even more fun to teach Jessica to shoot. “What are your hobbies, Jess?” heasked.“In school I was on the track and field team, and the swimming team,” Jessicareplied. “I took dance lessons since I was little, and I ride horses in thesummertime.”“You must have won a lot of races,” said Jason, with a rueful smile. “You’refaster than me with your ankle sprained.”Jessica rubbed her wrapped ankle. “And I couldn’t walk the next day, remember?”she said. “It’s finally getting better now, I think.”Jessica carefully put some cards down. “What are you into, Jason,” she asked,“besides being a fed?”“Well, I’ve been shooting since I was about five, Dad being a cop and all. I’vebeen in a lot of competitions.”“Really?” Josh said. “Have you won any?”“A few,” said Jason modestly. Then he put down his cards and won the game. image [../Images/image00256.jpeg] BETSY finished the file she was working on and put her computer to sleep. Shegot up and walked to Grant’s doorway. Grant was intently studying a yellow legalpad, his feet up on the desk, chewing on a pencil and scrunching his hairthoughtfully.“Senator Collins?” Betsy asked politely.“What?” Grant looked up, and Betsy suppressed a giggle at the state of his hair.“Don’t ‘Senator Collins’ me,” said Grant. “You asking me for a raise orsomething?”“Nope, just going to lunch. Need anything first?”“No,” said Grant. “But I was thinking. I have a lot to do on this piece I’mworking on, and I’d like your help with it after I get all my thoughts down.What would you think of taking this afternoon off and coming in tomorrow? Wouldthat mess you up too much?”“Of course not,” said Betsy. “You know I have no life.” She said it jokingly,but unfortunately, it was true.“Well, go have a life tonight,” suggested Grant magnanimously. “Go out with thegirls or something. It’s Friday night.”He’s missing the whole point of Friday night, Betsy thought. It’s specialbecause you don’t have to work the next day. But she could see that he wasfeeling good about it, and she didn’t want to burst his bubble.“All right,” said Betsy. “I’ll see you in the morning.” She turned to go, thenturned back again. “Oh, one more thing, Senator,” she said.“What?”“You might want to comb your hair.” She turned away with a giggle.As she shrugged into her coat, a scrunched-up sheet of yellow legal paper sailedthrough Grant’s doorway and almost hit her.As she walked down the hallway, Betsy’s mood sank a few notches. She knew Grantmeant well, but frankly, the thought of the whole Friday evening ahead of herwas somehow depressing. I guess I’m a workaholic, she thought. And then, Why amI lying to myself? It’s not the work I want so much, it’s Grant. I would lovethe evening off if I could spend it with him.She pulled her winter coat tighter around her body against the biting wind, andhurried home to her empty apartment.PART V image [../Images/image00252.jpeg] JESSICA sat across from Halen in front of the wood stove, losing yet anothergame of chess. She’d thought she was pretty good at the game until she playedwith Halen; he was always two steps ahead of her, and always seemed to know whatshe was planning.Jessica marveled at the way this life had begun to feel normal. It felt a bitlike a summer camp, with eight people packed into one house. Two people keptwatch at all times. Long before she had arrived, Halen had set upbattery-powered motion sensors and infrared cameras around the house. AndKeith’s mine field was still out there. There wasn’t much more they could do toprepare themselves. They listened to the outside world on their radios; everyday it seemed that another crime was being attributed to the Iron Web. They allhoped that help would come to them before it was too late. At least, Jessica wassure that everyone there hoped for that, though that hope was seldom actuallymentioned.They played cards and board games. They had done a little laundry in the kitchensink, since they still had running water but no electricity, and had hung theclothes on racks next to the wood stove to dry. The luxury of the clean clotheswas somewhat mitigated by their board-like stiffness.Before Jessica had arrived, Tasha and David had brought some supplies from theirown home over to Doug’s. Tasha still had to cook on the camp stove and woodstove, but with what she had, she created exotic Indian and Indonesian dishes,in addition to good old American steak and potatoes. Jessica was not the onlyone who had commented on the irony of eating gourmet food while hiding out fromthe feds.“I give up,” said Jessica, knocking over her king.“You weren’t quite doomed yet,” said Halen.“Why not? What could I have done?”“Let me be you,” said Halen. He stood the fallen king back up, and turned theboard around. “You see the attack coming over here, but if you go like this,” hesaid, moving her bishop, “you pin my rook to my king, so it can’t move downthere to check you.”“Halen,” Josh said, walking up to them. “Do you have any cleaning patches?”“There might be a few in the butt of my AR,” he answered, casually picking upthe rifle lying next to him. Jessica noticed that, no matter how casually Halenseemed to be handling the gun, the barrel never pointed at anyone. He opened alittle door in the back end of the gun, tipped the barrel up, and out fellvarious rods, metal brushes and pieces of cloth, a few of which he handed toJosh. Josh thanked him and walked away.It occurred to Jessica that she had become accustomed to seeing guns lyingaround all the time, and they no longer made her feel so uneasy.“Want a lesson?” Halen asked. She looked up and met his eyes, having beenabsent-mindedly staring at the rifle he was holding. “Charging handle,” Halensaid, pointing at a tab on the top of the gun behind the carrying handle. “Pullit back and let go to put a bullet in the chamber, so it’s ready to fire.” Withtwo fingers he pulled it back and released it, his other hand catching a roundthat came flying out. “There was already a round in there, but that’s how youget the first one in.”“And you don’t do that every time; when it fires, it loads the next bulletitself, right?” Jessica asked. Halen nodded.“Safety,” he said, pointing to a small handle on the side of the rifle, justbehind the trigger. He turned it toward “fire” and then back to “safe.” “Iusually keep a round chambered, but with the safety on.” He held the rifle outtoward her. “Now you do it, but keep your finger off the trigger.”Though she still doubted she would ever be able to shoot anyone, no matter whatthe situation, she decided she should at least be brave enough to hold the thingagain. She started to stretch out her arms, as if to ask for the rifle, butpulled back. “Halen?” she asked timidly.“What?”“If I put a gun down the wrong way, will you whale on me?”For the first time ever, Jessica saw Halen really laugh. Ten years dropped awayfrom his face, and she caught a glimpse of the young man he had once been,before all the bad stuff happened. “Did Josh tell you that I beat my students?”He laughed again as she nodded. “Luckily for you, I’m a sexist; I only beat mymale students. But you should see your face right now,” he said, grinning.“Priceless.”She looked into his eyes. Was he really that far gone? For a moment he seemedless wounded, as if maybe someday he could rejoin the rest of humanity. Sheimpulsively reached out and put her hands on his.For a moment neither of them moved. Finally, Halen looked up at her. He lookedtired and worn again. She looked intently into his eyes, desperately trying tocommunicate her feelings without speech.Halen’s face slowly faded into a sad expression. He looked down and shook hishead. Then he leaned back a bit, pulling his hands away from hers.“No, Jess,” he said quietly. “I’m sorry. I have no way to make you understand,”he said with a pained expression, “but I can’t ever go back. Real happiness,relationships, love—those aren’t a part of my life anymore. They can’t be, everagain. I’m broken inside, Jess, to a degree and in a way I can’t explain, a wayI wouldn’t even want you to understand. It’s always in there, even if it doesn’talways show.” He looked up at her again. A sad, forced smile appeared on hisface. “Even if the Shire is saved, it will never be, for me,” he said.The sound of shattering glass startled them out of their thoughts. Someoneoutside was shouting something over a loudspeaker, but the words wereincomprehensible. Halen jumped up and said, “Well, they’re here.” He picked uphis rifle from the couch, paused for a moment, and handed it to Jessica. “Go tothe basement,” he said shortly, “and keep that with you. A round is chambered,safety’s on.”Halen pulled a handgun from his waistband, and gestured for Jessica to head downinto the basement. As she hurried down the stairs, she heard more breaking glassfrom behind her, followed by gunfire and shouting. She quickly decided to hidein one of the big storage cupboards. She put down the rifle, opened a slidingdoor and pulled out a large bin of camping gear, intending to take its place.Something was stinging her eyes. It took her a moment to realize that it must betear gas coming down from upstairs. So she couldn’t just hide out in thebasement after all. Squinting her eyes against the burning gas, she grabbed therifle and staggered, almost blind, to the sliding glass door facing thebackyard. She got through, and found herself in bright sunlight.No one was in sight, and the sounds were all coming from behind her. Far away toher right she recognized Ben’s cabin. Down the long, gradual slope in front ofher was another house, and there was a third far off to her left. Behind all ofthe houses was one long wall of woods, though she had no idea how far in theedge of the river was. She decided that running to the house dead ahead would bethe most likely way to stay out of everyone’s view. She was just about to make arun for it when she heard a voice yelling off to her left. “I’m hit! I’m hit!”She recognized Joshua’s southern drawl, but she couldn’t see him. She stoodfrozen for a moment, not knowing what to do. Then she saw Josh stagger into viewaround the corner of the house to her left, his right hand dragging his rifle,his left hand on his upper chest, a black stain covering his front. Hisexpression was one of bewilderment and terror. Jessica ran to him, dropping herrifle and embracing him as he fell to his knees. She sank to the ground, stillholding him. Her mind was screaming, “No! Not Joshua! Please, God, not Joshua!”But she had no idea what to do. She looked around in all directions, not evenknowing what she was looking for. “Help! Somebody help!” she screamed out, butthere was no response. Shouting and gunfire continued on the other side of thehouse. Still frantically looking around, she felt Josh’s body go limp in herarms.“Hold on, Josh, just hold on, I’ll—” But as she looked desperately into hiseyes, the life went out of them. She clapped her hand over her mouth and wept. image [../Images/image00251.jpeg] JASON was jolted awake by the sound of gunfire overhead. It was a moment beforehe got his bearings, and then things started coming back to him. He had laindown on the bed in the corner room to rest for a moment, not intending to fallasleep. He got up and didn’t see or hear anyone near. Looking out the sidewindow, he saw only fields and trees. But something was definitely happening outfront.He was still unarmed, and thought it better to stay that way. But he needed toknow what was happening, and hoped he could find out without getting shot.Stepping out of the room into the hall, he smelled tear gas. He turned to hisleft, ran out the side door, and peered around the corner. He saw a parkedBradley in front of the house, facing to his right, not a hundred feet away.Crouching down behind it was an agent he quickly recognized as Miguel.The familiar face in the midst of all this mayhem made Jason forget his decisionto remain hidden. “Miguel!” he shouted out, stepping out into the open, hishands open and arms wide. “Miguel, don’t shoot! It’s me!” An expression ofrecognition was just forming on Miguel’s face when he suddenly let out a gruntof pain and bent over forward. At the same time he involuntarily squeezed thesubmachine gun he was holding and let half a dozen rounds fly.Jason felt something like a hard punch in his left shoulder, and something hitthe side of his right ankle. He watched helplessly as Miguel fell to the ground,clutching at his stomach and yelling something. Suddenly two more agents cameinto view from behind the Bradley. These Jason didn’t recognize, and theystarted firing in his direction. It occurred to him that they must have assumedthat he was the one who had just shot Miguel. He ducked back inside and lookedfor somewhere to run, expecting the agents to follow him in.Out of desperation, he ran straight through the living room, squinting his eyesand holding his breath against the cloud of tear gas filling the room. Barelyable to see, he managed to find his way to the room at the far side, hoping toexit by the side door. A strange rumbling sound made him pull up short. He thenwatched in amazement as a giant metal tank tread came tearing through the frontwall of the room. The front of an enormous steel monster came rumbling aboutfive feet in, stopped for a moment, and then backed out, leaving a ten-foot-widehole in the wall. Jason turned and headed back toward the living room.What was left of the picture window shattered as two more tear gas canisterscame flying in, one missing his head by inches. Through the smoke and gas, hecould make out the silhouette of a giant Bradley vehicle lumbering past. Theywere coming in, Jason guessed, and knew he had to get out quick. He duckedaround the corner to the stairs leading to the rec room downstairs. He jumpeddown three steps at once, and a bolt of pain reminded him that he had been shotin the ankle.As he arrived downstairs, the whole house trembled, and he wondered if the topfloor had collapsed. He was looking out the back window, trying to persuadehimself to make a run for the woods, when he heard a loud cracking sound abovehim. What felt like a ten-ton weight hit him on the head, and he lostconsciousness. image [../Images/image00256.jpeg] “BETSY?” It was Grant’s voice from the other room. She got up and walked intohis private office. “Thanks for coming in today. This shouldn’t take long. Iwant to read this to you and get your reactions. Then you can type it up.”“What is it?” said Betsy, taking a seat in her usual chair.“A press release, but also an addition to the web site, explaining what the newbill will do. I’ll have you proofread it too, but even for the written stuff,it’s important to see what it sounds like when it’s spoken out loud.” He scannedthe page, scribbled a last-minute note to himself, and began reading.“This Act, nicknamed the ‘Peace of Mind Act,’ will help the men and women of lawenforcement—those who put themselves in harm’s way in order to keep the rest ofus secure and free—by providing them with several new tools to be used in theirconstant battle against crime and terrorism, as well as closing existingloopholes in the law which are being exploited by those who seek to use terrorand violence to disrupt our great society. To do this, the Act will do all ofthe following:”“Number one. This Act will close a legal loophole allowing cop-killers to escapejustice. There is a gray area under existing law regarding the use of forceagainst law enforcement agents who are in the process of making arrests whichmay be legally flawed. In short, there is case law which has been exploited bycriminals who attempt to justify their use of violence, sometimes even deadlyforce, against police officers, because the criminals didn’t believe that thearrest was justified. Even in the rare case where an arrest is done improperlyor without legal justification, the proper venue in which to resolve suchdisputes is within our court systems. This Act therefore includes legislationmaking it a crime to forcibly resist any arrest, while also providing legalremedies to those who have been subjected to improper arrest.”Throughout her several-year process of learning how Grant liked to word things,Betsy also had acquired the ability to spot the things he was intentionally notmentioning. She knew, for example, that the new law would make it a crime toresist even a completely illegal, unwarranted arrest, which an astute readermight infer from the wording, but which Grant’s description carefully avoidedspecifically saying. She chose not to mention it.“Number two. This Act will end a legal loophole that allows criminals to, ineffect, spy on federal law enforcement agencies to determine their game planahead of time. Under the Freedom Of Information Act, or ‘FOIA’ for short,federal agencies must provide the general public access to many types ofgovernment records. There are already exemptions in the law regarding documentsrelating to matters of national security and ongoing criminal investigations,among other things. Nonetheless, some criminals continue to use FOIA requests asa means to find out about ongoing investigations or actions being taken againstthemselves or others. This makes it easier for the criminals to cover up theircrimes, and allows them to escape capture and prosecution more easily. The Actwill therefore add a new exception to the FOIA, to keep secret any documentswhich the directors of the FBI and CIA, or the Secretary of the Treasury,believe could jeopardize their efforts to combat crime, particularly terrorism,both here and abroad.”“Number three. This Act will allow for more effective law enforcement actions inareas that are plagued by overt violence or lawlessness. When one person isaccused of a crime, it is a very different scenario from when a mob becomesunruly, or when violence or crime on a large scale is being perpetrated. In theone case, it is often a simple matter to determine the identity of the accused,to obtain search warrants or arrest warrants, and so on. However, when facedwith many unruly individuals at once, of unknown identities and unknownintentions, the police simply cannot function under the same set of rules theymust use for dealing with a single suspect. The Act therefore allows for thetemporary designation of ‘Heightened Conflict Areas,’ or HCAs, in which somepolice procedures and policies will differ from their usual methods. This partof the Act does not create any new crimes, nor does it allow for long-termconfinement of anyone without formal charges being filed, or without goingthrough the usual legal channels. But it does allow the police to do their job,without unnecessary risk to themselves or to the public, by providing them withextra powers in situations involving crowd control or any forcible conflictinvolving six or more possible suspects. These powers include:”“Item A: the authority to temporarily detain any unidentified individuals foundin the HCA, but only as long as necessary to establish their identity and to runa background check for any outstanding arrest warrants. After that, anyindividual not being charged with a crime is to be released immediately.“Item B: the authority to temporarily prohibit the private possession offirearms or other weapons within the HCA, until the conflict is resolved and thelegality of the weapons is established, at which time they will be returned totheir rightful owners.“Item C: the authority to perform warrantless searches, of individuals andvehicles, but only to the extent necessary to locate and confiscate any weaponswithin the HCA. (If the weapons were possessed legally and promptly surrenderedto the police, the individual will not be charged, and the weapons will bereturned to their rightful owners once the conflict is resolved.)”“Item D: the authority to monitor all communications—whether sent through theair, wire, or other means—between areas inside the HCA and areas outside theHCA, until the conflict is resolved. (Because such monitoring constitutes asearch without a warrant, information thus gathered is not to be used asevidence in any court of law, but will be used only to prevent the prolongationor escalation of the conflict.)”Betsy put her hand up. “Can I interrupt for a second?” Grant looked up from thepage. “There’s an issue I’ve heard talked about on the radio. I don’t knowwhether you’d want to address it in the press release or not. Some people areclaiming that the law would allow the government to designate an area as one ofthese HCAs without making that public. They’re afraid the government can justdeclare an area to be an HCA, listen in on any conversations they want to in thearea, and then remove the HCA designation again without ever telling the publicthey did it. Is that true?”“More or less,” Grant admitted, “though there are time limits on how long an HCAcan be kept secret. As the bill stands now, after two weeks, a secretlydesignated HCA would either have to be made public or the designation would haveto be removed.”“Okay, sorry for interrupting,” Betsy said. “Go on.” So the government couldsecretly designate and undesignate HCAs, as long as the designation lasted forless than two weeks at a time. She tried not to show her surprise at Grant’sconfirmation of what she’d been sure was just another bogus, conspiracy-nutrumor.“This provision of the Act does nothing to the long-term legal rights of anyoneaccused of a crime,” Grant continued, “but merely allows for the safe, promptand effective resolution of large-scale violent or dangerous situations. Oncethe police have the situation under control, have determined which individuals,if any, have engaged in criminal activity, and have taken those individuals intocustody, the rules revert back to normal, and the HCA designation for the areawill be removed.”Betsy raised her hand again. “Sorry, but I forgot to ask before, is there a timelimit on how long an area can have an HCA designation?”“Not really,” Grant replied, “though to keep the designation in place, theagency handling the conflict has to issue weekly reports explaining why thedesignation should be continued for a certain area.”“Okay, thanks,” she said. “That might be worth including in the release, to helpreduce the concerns some people have.” She didn’t mention that her own concernsabout the Act had just increased significantly. After all, determining nationalpolicy wasn’t her job.“Good idea,” he said, and went back to his notes. “Number Four. This Act willclose a legal loophole which now allows the use of threats of violence andlawlessness when those threats are disguised as freedom of expression. This isanother area where case law has been somewhat vague, and where criminals haveexploited the law to suit their purposes, by disguising acts of terror asfreedom of speech. For example, the image of a burning cross has the obviousintention of intimidating or terrorizing minorities. Likewise, other images andsymbols have been used, in place of openly threatening words, to intimidate orcoerce either members of the general public or government agencies into doingwhat the criminals want. To put an end to this, the Act includes new legislationwhich will prohibit the displaying of logos, symbols, slogans, or other imagesdeemed to serve no other purpose than the advocacy of violence or otherlawlessness. All of the various federal agencies will then promulgateregulations specifically listing the images which are to be prohibited.”“Can I interrupt again?” Betsy asked timidly.“Sure. Think the word ‘promulgate’ is too much for a press release?” Grant askedwith a smile.“No. I was going to ask, is this what I heard about before: the law that wasgoing to ban the symbol of the Iron Web?”“Well, it doesn’t really ban any image outright,” he answered. “But if someonedisplays an image in such a place and in such a manner that it falls within oneof the categories deemed to constitute a threat of violence or an incitement tolawlessness, then yes.”“Including the Iron Web symbol?”“Very possibly,” he answered.Betsy thought for a moment, but then just said, “Okay, go on.” She was surprisedthat Grant wasn’t getting annoyed at her questions, which at this point felteven to her a little like heckling, but he just took them in stride.“Actually, that’s all; that’s the end of the list,” Grant said, putting down onhis desk the bunch of papers he was reading.“Wasn’t there something else about guns?” Betsy asked. “I thought the gunregistration plan was going to be part of this bill.”“It was going to be, but we’re not sure we could get it passed this time around,with all the stink the gun rights groups are raising about it, and we don’t wantto tie up the whole bill over that one issue. After all, my inauguration is onlydays away,” Grant added with a smile.“Speaking of which,” said Betsy, glad to be finished with the press release,“how often does this happen, having legislation introduced by a senator, passingjust in time for him to become president and sign the bill?”“Not very often, I suspect,” Grant said, and went back to scribbling down notesand going through papers.Trying to make it sound casual and off-hand, Betsy spoke up. “Just this morningI saw that Iron Web design on a T-shirt.” She paused, looking at Grant’s facefor a reaction, but he didn’t look up from his papers, and said nothing. “You’dthink a group that wants to strike fear into people’s hearts wouldn’t use asymbol that looks like the combination of a rainbow and a flower. I guess I’veseen the design in black and white a couple times too, but the colorful versiondoesn’t exactly convey the bad-ass gang image,” she added.“I’m sure that’s on purpose,” he said, still not looking up but rummagingthrough the pile on his desk, as if in search of something in particular. “Theyprobably still hope to win some more people over to their way of thinking. Thatwouldn’t work very well if they used a skull and crossbones for their logo.”“Grant,” she said, feeling uneasy and nervous, but feeling compelled to speakup. “Don’t you ever worry that someday the police might be as big a threat toour freedom as the criminals are?” With that, he stopped what he was doing andlooked up at her, but she could read nothing in his expression. “I mean, that’sa lot of power you’re talking about, and not every cop is what we wish they allwere.” She stopped again, somewhat puzzled, as a smile slowly appeared onGrant’s face.“People are only concerned with what they’re afraid of,” he said, going back torummaging through his pile of papers. “If they start being more afraid of thepolice than they are of terrorists and criminals, then things will swing theother way. Until then, we do what the people want.” Just then Grant’s phonerang, and Betsy saw the light for his private number blinking. He picked it upand listened, without saying a word. His face turned very solemn. “Something bigis happening down in Graveston,” he said, as he jumped up and walked out of theroom. image [../Images/image00252.jpeg] JESSICA stood in the smoke-filled room, in shock from what she was hearingaround her. It sounded to her like the end of the world. There was gunfire andshouting, the sound of breaking glass and explosions, though most of it soundedfar away. After she had left Josh’s lifeless body, she had come back into thebasement, hoping she would find Halen somewhere in the house. He was the onething in the world she could think of just then that felt like security. If shecould just find him, he would keep her safe. Finding him was her only goal.She grabbed a winter hat to hold over her face as a breathing mask, but by thenmost of the tear gas had escaped through the shattered windows and the gapingholes in the walls. She tried to run, but debris and wreckage lay everywhere,hindering her progress. She looked into all the rooms on the first floor, andfinding no one, ran up the stairs to the second floor. The house shook again,nearly knocking her off her feet. She ran across a clear space into an end room,and quickly surveyed the scene.The room was pulverized, with plaster dust everywhere, and chips of wood andglass all over. But at last, underneath the front window, half covered in somefallen curtains, Jessica recognized Halen’s jacket. He was crouched down in therubble, and she could see the barrel of his rifle pointing toward the frontwindow. She felt an immense wave of relief, and, dropping down low to stay outof sight, started crawling toward him, calling his name over the noise. Withinfive feet of him, she stopped dead. Something was wrong. Halen wasn’t moving,and the position of his body didn’t look right. A wave of panic swept over her.“Halen?” Her voice sounded like a faint little squeak. She moved closer, notdaring to breathe. Please be alive, Halen. Please be alive, she begged silently.Please don’t leave me alone here. His face was turned away from her, and onehand stretched out awkwardly back toward her. As soon as she touched his hand,she knew that he had left her forever. The man she had feared, admired, maybeeven loved, was gone. Her invincible movie hero had been felled by some luckyshot. She could see no blood, and she didn’t want to look. She lost all hope,and all her strength, mental and physical, vanished in an instant. She sat onthe floor in the dust, cross-legged, holding Halen’s hand in hers, her mindrefusing to accept that this was now no more than an empty shell.Slowly, her awareness of her surroundings came back to her, and her instinct tosurvive flickered back to life. She could hear a gunshot now and then, but thefighting was becoming more and more sporadic and distant. She looked at Halenagain. He had done what he could to prepare her for this, to train her tosurvive. She couldn’t let him down by giving up.“You weren’t a monster,” she said softly, a tear rolling down her cheek. “Youweren’t.” A Bible verse came into her mind: “Greater love hath no man than this,that a man lay down his life for his friends.” Halen had made that ultimatesacrifice, yet he had died feeling that he was incapable of love. He could notsee that his love for the innocent had been honed into a deadly blade that feltlike hatred. He had given up more than his life for that love. He had given upglory and honor, and the luxury of human feeling, to protect not only hisfriends, but also innocent strangers, from harm. And he would be remembered withscorn and hatred, as a vicious criminal. Religion had never been a big part ofJessica’s life, but now she fervently hoped that Halen’s spirit was stillsomewhere close to her. She kissed his lifeless hand one last time. “Go withGod, Halen,” she said. “Thank you.” After a moment, she added, “I love you.”And what would he say to her, if his spirit could speak to her now? Probably,“Pick up that rifle and get the hell out of here! Now!” At that thought, shefelt some of his strength flow into her. She had to live to tell the world whoHalen really was.Cautiously, Jessica stood up straight, still holding the rifle Halen had givenher. Through the large front window, which was a mass of cracks and bulletholes, she saw someone she didn’t recognize, not dressed like an agent, runningpast. She decided she had better try to find the others, if any were stillalive, so she headed back down the stairs and ran to the side door. Stepping outinto the sunlight, she saw wreckage everywhere. It looked as if a tornado hadcome through. In the distance she saw smoke rising from what was left of Ben’scabin. Not sure what else to do, she started walking in that direction. Despitethe occasional gunfire far behind her, she suddenly noticed that she could hearbirds singing in the trees. The human race could exterminate itself altogether,she thought, and the birds would go right on singing.She saw no one as she wandered through the wreckage, and she was at a loss forwhat to do. She stopped at what was left of an old tool shed, about a hundredfeet from the house, and crawled inside. By now she was too numb to cry, and toooverwhelmed to pay much attention to what was going on around her. But if shewas going to survive, as she was determined to do, she had to think. She had tocome up with some sort of plan. It took a moment for the sound of crunchingfootsteps in the debris to make it to her brain. Someone or something was movingaround amid the wreckage. Maybe it was someone who could help her.She glanced out around the corner of the shed and saw a lone agent, lookingexhausted and lost, less than two hundred feet away. He looked almost like akid, with his mop of bright red curly hair. She looked just a second too long;he turned and saw her. Instead of hiding, she didn’t move. Maybe he wouldn’tshoot a girl. Maybe she could surrender. But did she dare to be taken captive?When they found out who she was, might they really kill her? Maybe she couldsurrender now, pretending she had been a hostage, and escape later.Her thoughts of surrender vanished when she saw the look on the agent’s face. “Ifound one!” he screamed hysterically. But there didn’t seem to be anyone elsearound. He raised his rifle in Jessica’s direction, and without taking time toaim, let loose two volleys of bullets, which missed her and pierced the walls oneither side of her. She held up her hands, hoping that would make him stopshooting. Instead, to her horror, his face contorted into an image of purehatred and he charged toward her, stumbling over boards and rubble, firingaimlessly as he came. Time slowed down as Jessica’s senses took in every detailaround her. She inexplicably noticed a cranberry-colored glass vase that hadbeen thrown clear of the house and lay unbroken on the lawn.She ducked back inside the shed, picked up the rifle lying next to her, andsteadied herself on one knee. She couldn’t do it. Could she? “Stop thinking anddo it,” she told herself. “This psycho is not going to kill my daddy’s girl.”Still kneeling, she leaned out from behind the wall and brought the rifle up toher shoulder. It felt awkward as she tried to take aim. The image in the scopewas half-obscured, blurry, and shaking wildly. When she saw the crosshairs meetthe image of the man, she squeezed the trigger. Nothing happened. She pulledagain, as hard as she could. Nothing.The screaming agent was closing the distance as her mind raced. Then sheremembered: the safety! She frantically looked for it, found it, pushed thepointer to the “fire” position, and brought the rifle back up to her shoulder.Through the shaking scope, the man now seemed to be right on top of her. Shewinced, involuntarily closing her eyes for a moment as she squeezed the trigger,expecting the man to fall on top of her at any second.It was the piercing sharpness of the sound, more than the kick of the rifle,that made her jump. The gun slipped from her hands and the small blue smokecloud quickly cleared, but the man wasn’t there. Raising herself a little, shesaw a figure lying face down in the grass, not thirty feet from her, not movingat all. Her ears were ringing from the shot, and the other shouting and gunfireseemed miles away. Around her, all was still.She sat and stared at the man she had killed. She, Jessica, had snuffed out ahuman life. Twenty-some years of living, breathing, learning, playing,working—whatever this man did with his life, it was all over now, and there wasno way to undo what she had done. Was this man nice, and funny, and friendlywhen he wasn’t following orders? Did he have a mom and dad, or a sister whowould cry as he went into the ground? Jessica felt sick to her stomach. She wasa killer now. That fleeting moment had made her a different person, had changedher, perhaps, as much as it had changed him.Then she felt anger welling up inside her. She had felt terror as he bore downon her; then her mind had pushed all feeling aside to focus on the task ofsurvival. Now a blinding rage set in. Why was this bastard trying to kill her?What did he know about her? What had she ever done to him—ever done to anyone?He had forced her to kill him, and at that moment, that angered her much morethan the fact that he’d tried to kill her. “You asshole!” she screamed at thecorpse, “you stupid asshole!” Then she hugged her knees, put her head down, andstarted sobbing uncontrollably. A tiny beetle crawled across the toe ofJessica’s boot, and crept down into the grass. image [../Images/image00251.jpeg] JASON woke up, covered in dust and debris, his head aching even worse than ithad after being knocked out by Halen. He felt his head, which had been bleedinga bit, but the cut had crusted over. It took a moment to remember that he was inthe basement of Doug’s house, which was barely recognizable, with half of theceiling having caved in. He tried to move, and pain in his shoulder and ankleagain reminded him that he had been shot. He clenched his teeth and sat up. Hecould hear distant gunfire, but the immediate area sounded quiet. The Bradleysmust have gone somewhere else. He struggled to his feet and staggered to thesliding door that led out to the backyard. Limping outside, he couldn’t seeanyone. The fighting sounded as if it was far off to his left, on the other sideof the house. If there was still fighting, someone must still be alive.As he scanned the devastation everywhere, the image of Jessica’s face poppedinto his mind. He suspected that by now she was probably dead somewhere, but heswore to himself that he would search until he found her, even if he found onlyher dead body. He had been just a spectator, not a participant in the battle,unable to do anything other than wishing it would stop. He had stopped trying tofigure out which side he was on, or who was in the right. The only certainty heclung to was that Jessica didn’t deserve to be there, and if he could just saveher, that would be enough, no matter what else happened.Because of the dust and debris covering everything, at first he didn’t recognizethe shape lying on the ground to his left. When he realized that it was a body,he walked toward it. He didn’t have to get very close before he knew that it wasJosh, and knew that he was dead. Beside him lay an AK-47-style rifle. For amoment Jason considered picking it up, but decided against it. Even now, therewas no one here he was willing to shoot at, and his being armed would only makeboth sides more likely to shoot at him.He wandered back inside, deciding to search what was left of the housesystematically, room by room. He didn’t dare call out for fear of drawingunwanted attention. He checked every closet, under every bed, and behind all thefurniture. He went room by room through what was left of Doug’s beautiful house.Walking into the room on the north end of the house, he recognized the crumpledform of Halen by a picture window. He didn’t need to go any closer to know thathe was dead. He stood in that room, trying to guess where Jessica might be, whenhe glanced out the window and saw something in the doorway of the tool shedoutside. There could be a body in the shadows, he thought, with blue jeans andboots just catching the sun.He ran downstairs and down the hall, scrambling as quickly as he could over thebroken wood, glass, and plasterboard on the floor. Now his shoulder and anklewere really starting to throb with pain. Running out the door and over thestretch of grass to the shed, he was more and more certain that this would beJessica’s body. His heart pounding with trepidation, he looked in. Jessica wascurled up in the shadows, her eyes closed. A lump rose in Jason’s throat as hecrouched down and cautiously shook one of her feet.“Jessica?” he whispered desperately. “God, please be alive,” he said to himself.She started to move, almost as if she had been asleep, and Jason was so relievedhe almost laughed. “Jessica? We have to go. Can you walk?” For a moment she juststared back at him, looking dazed and confused.“I—I think I can walk,” she said listlessly.“Listen. The feds have backed off again, but we can’t stay here.” He quicklyscanned the area. “They might not be back for days, or they may be back anyminute. We have to go.” It suddenly occurred to him that he was calling hisformer comrades “the feds.” He no longer felt like one of them. The only onewhose “side” he was sure he was on was Jessica.“Go where?” Jessica asked, and Jason suddenly realized he had no idea how toanswer that. “You’re bleeding,” Jessica said, pointing to his shoulder, butJason just shrugged it off.“It’s okay,” he said. “The bullet went all the way through.” At least it wasfunctional at the moment. He helped Jessica to her feet, and looked around.Ben’s cabin was still smoking. To reach the house on the far side, they wouldhave to cross a wide open space, visible from almost everywhere.“That house,” Jason decided, pointing to the house directly behind Doug’s at theedge of the woods. The two of them started hobbling across the field as fast asthey could, looking right and left for any sign of friend or foe. The walkacross the open field seemed to last forever, and Jason kept urging Jessica tohurry, imagining a sniper’s bullet hitting at any moment. Jessica seemeddistant, as if she didn’t care what happened. The house they were approachingwas much smaller than Doug’s, with only one story, and hardly enough space formore than two or three rooms. But it was better than being out in a field.As they reached the front door, Jessica pulled back on Jason’s hand. He hadn’tnoticed until then that he was holding her hand. “Look,” she said, pointing downat the doorstep. The last stepping stone of the path leading to the house hadbeen moved aside, and in the smooth soil beneath had been scratched an arrowpointing diagonally to the left, with roughly drawn characters spelling out“200M.”Jason quickly brushed out the markings with his boot and kicked the stone backinto its place. “Let’s go,” he said, and started leading Jessica into the woods,in the direction the arrow had been pointing. “Just go as fast as you can. Bywhat that said, it’s only a couple hundred yards away.”“What is?” Jessica asked.“Wherever they’re hiding, I guess.”“Wherever who is hiding?” Jessica asked.“Guess we’ll find out when we get there,” Jason said, wondering the same thing.Who might still be alive? He suddenly wondered if Jessica knew that Halen wasdead. He didn’t dare tell her just then.They had to force their way through some patches of thick undergrowth, butmostly the woods were fairly open. Even after Jason thought they had covered twohundred meters, he still saw nothing but woods in all directions, and wonderedif he had misunderstood the markings. Then he noticed a structure, so obscuredby vines and weeds that it almost looked like a small hill. There wasn’t reallyenough left of it to call a cabin. Most of the roof was gone, and the front wallhad fallen outward. This wouldn’t offer much shelter, from the elements or fromattackers, he thought. “Over here,” he heard a whisper, and saw a hand wavingfrom around the corner of the ruins. Still supporting Jessica as much as hecould, despite the throbbing pain of his own injuries, he hobbled around behindthe cabin.He had expected to find half a dozen people or more hiding out there. But therewere only David, Tasha, and Doug. “Where are the others?” he asked.“What others?” Doug asked, his face long and wearied. image [../Images/image00256.jpeg] BETSY suddenly remembered the time, and jumped up to turn on the radio on thecounter next to her. “What are you looking for?”Sandy asked from the kitchen as Betsy scanned through the various stations.“Grant is doing an interview,” Betsy said.“God, you’re like a groupie or something,” Sandy remarked. “Is it really thatimportant, that you have to listen to his BS in my house?”“He likes to ask me afterwards how he did,” she said, still looking for theright station. “I think I already missed half of this one.”Finally she recognized Grant’s voice coming from the speakers: “ ... the sort ofmessage we should be sending out. But I promise you, once I take office, thismatter will be resolved immediately, fairly, and without any more wasting oftaxpayer dollars. My administration will make it clear that in this country,compliance with the law is not optional. Coddling criminals is only going toencourage further criminal acts, as we have seen all too well this week. To themembers of this so-called Iron Web group, I say this: This will end as soon as Itake office. Lay down your weapons, give yourselves up, and each of you willhave your day in court and will have your chance to argue your case. But it willbe within our legal system. No longer will you be permitted to act as a law untoyourselves. Your time is running out, and your best option is to surrender now.”“Resistance is futile,” Sandy muttered sarcastically. “You will be assimilated.”“I find your contempt and disregard for the laws of this country ironic,”Grant’s voice continued, referring to the terrorists but sounding as if he wasresponding to Sandy, “as it is only this nation’s respect for the law and dueprocess which has allowed you to continue to waste the government’s resourcesday after day the way you have. In many other countries, you would have beendealt with swiftly and severely long ago. Here, you have a right to have yoursay, present your case, have your day in court, and let a jury of your peersdecide your guilt or innocence. Instead, you have continually thumbed your nosesat the greatest legal system in history. Well, mark my words: even in this landof constitutional rights—the assumption of innocence until guilt is proved, theright to a fair trial—there are limits to the patience of those whose job it isto protect honest law-abiding citizens by seeing to it that everyone—everyoneeither complies with the rules that keep our society orderly and safe, or isheld accountable and subjected to the full punishment of the law.”As the radio show host commended Grant for his monologue and began to ask himsomething else, Sandy snorted in obvious contempt. “What’s wrong with that?”Betsy asked. “He’s not saying they don’t get a trial, or that they’ll be shot onsight— although at this point, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing. What’swrong with what he said?”“It’s not so much what he said,” Sandy replied, bringing two lunch plates out towhere Betsy was seated, “but the way it’s all carefully designed to manipulatethe emotions of the listener.”“Well, let me listen,” Betsy said, picking up the sandwich on her plate, “andafterwards tell me why he’s the root of all evil.”“Oh, he’s not the root of all evil,” said Sandy, smiling. “He’s just a tiny twigon the enormous tree of evil.” But she stopped talking then as Grant began toanswer the interviewer’s next question.“Right, right,” came Grant’s voice from the radio. “During the campaign, somepeople actually complained that the President and I agreed on too many things,as if that must be a bad thing. But I think most people are tired of sillypartisan bickering. I’m not going to disagree with someone’s position on anissue solely because he’s a member of the other party. That’s ridiculous. Soyes, the President and I agreed on a lot, and at the same time we havesignificant differences of opinion on some fundamental issues.”“What would you say was the issue you disagreed about most?” the host asked.“Well, there were several. For example, though he would never put it this way,the President’s comments, and the legislation he has supported, suggest to methat he doesn’t think average Americans should be allowed to own firearms, whileI’m a firm believer in the Second Amendment.”“If I could interrupt for a second,” the host cut in, “one friend of mine is abig gun rights guy, and he was pretty upset when the NRA endorsed yourcandidacy.”“Right, right. Well, some people think the Second Amendment means anyone canhave any kind of gun, whenever and wherever they want, with no restrictions. Notsurprisingly, those people weren’t very happy with some of the bills I’veproposed, which make it easier for law enforcement to trace where a gun used ina crime came from, making sure that people with psychological problems orcriminal histories aren’t walking the streets with machine guns, and so on.These are perfectly reasonable, necessary restrictions, and they don’t at allinfringe upon the rights of law-abiding citizens to own firearms in thiscountry.”“Okay, moving on, because we don’t have much time left,” the host continued,“you’ve also criticized the President’s stand on universal health care.”“Well, we need to be clear in our terminology here. I want everyone who needshealth care to receive it. That’s what universal health care should be. What Idon’t want is a giant federal bureaucracy telling doctors and patients what carethey need, and how it should be administered.”“We’re running low on time here, and there was a lot more I wanted to cover,”the host said, sounding hurried. “Could I just throw out a series of issues andget maybe a ten- or fifteen-second comment from you on each?”“Sure, go for it.”“Education.”“Again, the federal government shouldn’t be running everything, micromanagingeverything from Washington. At the same time, with all the prosperity thiscountry enjoys, even during the current economic slump, we should certainly beable to see to it that no child in this country should miss out on a goodeducation due to a lack of funding and resources.”“Social Security.”“This is a complex issue, and this is one thing on which the President and Ipretty much agree. There are ways to make the system sustainable, to protect ourseniors and give them what they were promised, without bankrupting the youngergenerations. But that discussion takes more than a few seconds.”“Crime.”“The way to reduce crime is through deterrents, and deterrents don’t work ifthose who put their lives on the line to protect us, law enforcement at alllevels, have their hands tied by policies that reward the criminals and punishthe good guys. When someone is found guilty of a crime, the punishment has to befair but sufficient, swift and unavoidable. No more having dope dealers tying upour court systems for years because they got a stubbed toe while they were beingarrested. You do the crime, you do the time.”“Last, but not least, terrorism.”“Well, we could talk for hours about that, but what it boils down to is this:people who use violence, or the threat of violence, to try to achieve somepolitical agenda—and this is whether we’re talking about some anarchist cult inthis country or Muslim extremists over in the Middle East—they should be dealtwith swiftly and severely. No deals, no compromises. As I said, when I takeoffice, such criminals and their intimidation and fear tactics will be stoppedby whatever means necessary.”“And that’s all the time we have today,” the host said as the background musicbegan fading in, signaling the end of the show. “Thank you very much, SenatorCollins—soon to be President Collins—for being on the show.”“You’re quite welcome, and thank you for having me on,” Grant responded.“Well, that about wraps up—” The host’s voice was cut off by Sandy turning offthe radio.“What a freaking hypocrite,” she said. “Man, why do people still fall for thiscrap?”“What was wrong with what he said?” Betsy asked, putting down what was left ofher sandwich.“The brave men and women of law enforcement,” Sandy said in an exaggerated,mocking imitation of Senator Collins. “Yeah, the brave, jackbooted Nazi thugs oflaw enforcement. Give me a break. How bad do things have to get before thestupid American people stop pretending that the cops are the good guys?”“Okay,” replied Betsy, “I admit that with all those videos of police abuse youkeep e-mailing me, and all the other stories about it, I’m starting to see whyyou distrust the police so much. But they do occasionally catch some bad guys,you know. There really are terrorists in the world, and even the cops like yourbuddy, Curtis Walters, might help to stop them.”“What terrorists do you think I need Dumb-ass Walters to save me from?” Sandyasked. “You mean the Iron Web, right?” She paused, but Betsy didn’t sayanything. “Ya know,” Sandy continued, “I’ve been resisting the urge to say this,considering who you work for and all—”“What?” interrupted Betsy. “Tell me you’re not siding with the terrorists now.”“Hey,” Sandy replied indignantly, “you work for the biggest terroristorganization on the planet: the damn U.S. government.” Then she leaned forwardin her chair, looking down at the floor, and got very quiet. “Seriously,though,” she added at last, looking up at Betsy again, “I want to ask you afavor.”“Uh oh, the wacko is getting serious,” Betsy joked, but Sandy didn’t smile.“Shut up,” Sandy said. “I mean it.” She sighed again, as if gathering thecourage to say something. “You’ve never read the book, have you?”“What book?” Betsy asked. “You mean that book about the Iron Web, by Davidwhat’s-his-face? The terrorist manifesto?” Sandy just looked at her and didn’tsay a word. “I’ve seen excerpts from it,” Betsy said.“Betsy, you know me,” Sandy said softly, looking directly into Betsy’s eyes.“I’m a throwback, a pot-smoking, live-and-let-live hippie, only with an attitudeand a gun. I’m no terrorist—though I can’t say the same for your boss. Do methis favor. Read the book.” She turned to her right, pulled open the drawer ofthe end table next to her, and pulled out a well-worn copy of a book, the coverof which said “Weaving an Iron Web,” above the image of the familiar, colorfulgeometric pattern.“Sandy,” Betsy began, getting a little concerned.“I’m not asking you to agree with it, or even to tell me what you think,” Sandysaid, holding the book out toward Betsy. “But you know as well as I do how oftenpeople get dehumanized, demonized and prejudged, right before they getmurdered.” Only once or twice in the many years she had known Sandy had Betsyseen her like this. “All I’m asking,” Sandy went on, “is that you find out whoit is that your boss intends to exterminate. That’s all. I’ve bitten my tongueon this for too long. Read it!” she said firmly, pushing the book toward Betsy.“Grant isn’t trying to exterminate anyone,” Betsy said defensively, and hoped itwas true, but she took the book from Sandy.“Don’t skim it, read it,” said Sandy in a softer voice. “And don’t assume youalready know what it says. Trust me, you don’t. Promise me you’ll read it. Allof it, Bet. Please.”“I promise,” Betsy said, Sandy’s uncharacteristic seriousness making her feelslightly uncomfortable. “I’ll read it tomorrow.” image [../Images/image00252.jpeg] JESSICA watched as a chipmunk skittered from log to log and rock to rock,occasionally twitching his tail and chirping. It was a beautiful day, with abright blue Arizona sky and a warm breeze. The group now sat behind the remainsof the old cabin, in a loose circle in a clearing carpeted with pine needles.Doug was relating yesterday’s events to David and Tasha.“So Keith got word to Carl and Tarzan, and they somehow got across the river andcame up from over there,” Doug said, pointing off into the woods. By thenJessica had lost all sense of direction. “Then all hell broke loose. I don’tknow what Carl had, but feds were dropping like flies, and I know Tarzan can’tshoot like that. But then they must have made a run for the house, over whereKeith still was, but the feds must have had a sniper somewhere. Carl went down.Tarzan stopped to help, and they got him, too.” Jessica didn’t want to interruptto ask who Carl and “Tarzan” were. “Then it looked like the feds were backingoff. I ran back around inside the house to find Keith. When I got to him, he’dbeen hit, three times I think. And he was still shooting at ’em.” He stoppedtalking for a while, and when he spoke again, his voice was very low. “After awhile, things got quiet. I thought Keith was just resting, but when I shook him,he was gone.”Last night, after she and Jason arrived, they had huddled in the poor shelter ofthe ruined cabin as darkness fell, trying to assess their situation. The onlyreal unknown at that point was Heather, and it was a safe bet that by now shehad been captured, if she was still even alive. They had confirmed that everyoneelse missing from the group was dead, so there was no one else to search for orwait for. They had no food, no water, and no weapons. More likely than not, thefeds by now had taken control of all of the buildings in the area, so there wasnowhere else to go.They spent the night huddled together for warmth on the floor of thecabin—hungry, thirsty, cold, and overwhelmed with grief and despair—until sheerexhaustion took them off to sleep, one by one. Jessica dreamed of the red-headedagent running at her, screaming. She heard the sharp crack of rifle fire, andher eyes flew open. Had she dreamed that, or was it real? She lay trembling fora while, but heard no more noises.Of course they all woke at the crack of dawn, cold, stiff and hungry, and movedout into the clearing. Jessica had spoken very little to anyone. Jason had toldthe others about Halen and Joshua, so she didn’t have to. The grief had simplyoverwhelmed her, and she felt an empty stillness inside, as if she would neverwant to do anything again. She grieved for Joshua and Halen. And she grieved forthe red-headed agent, and for the innocent girl who had boarded that plane toCalifornia. She grieved for her parents and her brother, who all thought she wasdead.She’d told no one about her killing of the agent. It felt as if talking about itwould give it another layer of reality. If she never spoke of it, maybe itwouldn’t be real. But she couldn’t stop the incident from playing over and overin her mind. The gunfire coming at her, the screaming man, the crack of therifle. The body lying still.“We need food and water, first of all,” she heard Jason saying. “You all shouldstay here, and I’ll go back to Heather’s. I’ve got the best chance of survivingif I’m seen.”The others agreed. “Doug,” Jason said, “can you give me a leg up into that treeso I can get my bearings?” But when Jason lifted his arm to grab the lowestbranch, a cry of pain escaped him, and he clutched at his shoulder. David wasbeside him in an instant.“Let me see the wound,” he said. Under Jason’s jacket, his shirt was stiff withdried blood. David’s face looked serious as he pulled back the shirt andassessed the wound. “You’re not going anywhere, Jason,” he announced. “And weneed first aid and medicines as soon as possible.”“It’s gotta be me, then,” said Doug. “I know these woods like the back of myhand. I’ve got a good chance of getting there without being seen.”Jessica watched anxiously as Doug quietly walked off into the woods. Thereseemed to be nothing to say. She looked over at Jason. He was sitting against afallen log, looking pale. She could tell that he was in a lot of pain and tryingnot to show it. David and Tasha sat on the ground, holding hands. Jessica got upand sat down again next to Jason, as close as she could without touching him. Noone spoke. image [../Images/image00251.jpeg] JASON watched Jessica as she sat cross-legged on the ground, her head down,playing with twigs and leaves. David and Tasha were leaning against each otherand talking in quiet whispers. It seemed like at least an hour since anyone hadsaid anything aloud.Jason kept mulling over the facts in his mind, trying to think of some way forthem all to survive this. Maybe the feds were calming down with the passage oftime, he thought. Maybe if they could hold out for a while, they’d at least havea chance of being captured instead of shot.But then what? The government would make sure that David went to prison for therest of his life, one way or another, and maybe Tasha, too. Doug might get off,but what would happen to Jessica? If the government was hiding something, as itmust have been based upon what Jessica had told him, was there any limit to whatthey might do to keep her quiet once she was identified? And if they might killJessica, now they were all at risk, because they had all met her, which madeeach of them a threat to the government’s official story. He tried to tellhimself that the U.S. government wouldn’t just assassinate people over somethinglike that, that it was all just conspiracy theory paranoia. But try as he might,he couldn’t convince himself. He had heard enough stories, just during his shorttime as a federal agent, to know that there were some pretty powerful, ruthlesspeople in the system, and that they played by their own set of rules. What ifJessica went along with the government’s story? She could say that she had beenasleep the whole time, and had no memory of what happened on the plane.Maybe if they were found by someone Jason knew, someone he could trust, theycould get the story out to the media. Maybe getting the truth out there quicklyenough could protect Jessica. Once the world knew she was alive, and heard whatshe had to say, killing her would only make people suspicious. Maybe publicitywas their only hope. Then again, Jason knew how strictly controlled all evidenceand information was in a situation like this. No, if they were found, they’d beas good as dead. Jason didn’t want to admit it, even to himself, but deep downhe knew it was true.He looked around, wondering if it was possible to remain hidden out here for afew days. Maybe then they could find a way to get out, after the world haddecided that everyone in here was dead. But the woods, though they followed theriver a long way, were never more than a couple hundred yards deep. It wouldn’ttake long for the whole area to be thoroughly searched. Building a fort ordigging a hole wouldn’t keep them hidden for long. Eventually they’d be found.Overhead, clouds had been racking up until the blue sky was all but hidden.“Doug’s back,” said David, pointing into the woods. Doug was walking back slowlyand quietly through the trees, carrying a plastic watering can.He walked into the clearing, shaking his head. “A couple of feds are camped outat Heather’s,” he said. “Damn them. But I got us some water.” He set thewatering can down on the ground. “Might be a little hard to drink from,” he saidapologetically. “I got into the back of Heather’s tool shed, and came back byway of the spring.”The water was most welcome, and for the next half hour, they took turns, oneperson holding the can while another drank from the spout, until everyone’sthirst was quenched.“I was thinking on the way back here,” Doug said. “Wasn’t the guy who lived herebefore, old man Hargroves, kind of a survivalist? I never knew the guy, butKeith used to talk about him a lot.”“Yes!” said David, standing up suddenly and looking around on the ground alongthe cabin wall. “I just remembered, this cabin had a cellar. I remember it. Iwas in it once. Kind of a secret basement, almost like a bomb shelter. OldHargroves built it himself. And knowing him, it wouldn’t be empty. It has tostill be down there. But I don’t remember how to get in.”Jason stood up, felt a stabbing pain in his leg, and limped over to the cabin.Doug was already on the cabin floor. He stamped on it a few times, and it made ahollow sound. His eyes met Jason’s.Jason started working around the front of the cabin, kicking the leaves awayfrom the wall, looking for any way to get in. Even if the place was empty, hethought, it might at least give them a place to hide a bit longer. He waslooking around out front, where the wall had caved in, when he heard David say,“Over here!” Hurrying around to the side, he saw David on his hands and knees,brushing aside leaves and dirt, exposing a small hole under the wall, leadingdown to complete darkness. He painfully got on his knees and helped to dig. Thisobviously wasn’t supposed to be an entrance; it was just a place where a portionof the old floor had rotted and fallen through. Then Doug pushed Jason aside,and David and Doug slowly widened the hole enough for someone to fit through it.“I don’t suppose anyone has a flashlight?” Jason asked, without much hope.“Wait, I do,” Doug answered, seeming surprised himself. He pulled out a keychainwith a tiny LED light on it. “Better than nothing.” He crouched down at thehole, aiming the little light into it. “I can’t see squat,” he said, squintinginto the blackness. “Let me go in.” Jason watched as Doug got on his stomach,feet toward the hole, and wiggled through it backwards. “I hope the floor isn’ttoo far down there,” he said. When he was almost through, David helped lower himdown.David stepped away from the opening as the first raindrops came splashing down.“Good timing,” he said. “If nothing else, we might be able to stay dry downthere.”Doug’s voice sounded again, distant and echoing. “It’s not exactly the Ritz. Thefloor is just dirt, but the ceiling—the cabin floor, I mean—actually looks likeit’s in pretty good shape. Some of the cinderblock wall is falling apart.” Therewas a brief pause, followed by the sound of stone grinding against stone.“Wait,” came Doug’s voice again. “I think I can make some half-ass stairs so therest of you can come down.”“Assuming we plan to hide here for a while, we should make something to coverthe hole,” Jason suggested, “something that the last one in can pull intoplace.”“Good idea,” said David, beginning to gather up sticks and leaves. “Though Isure hope we’re not just crawling into our own graves,” he added. image [../Images/image00256.jpeg] BETSY opened a folder on her computer and dialed Sandy’s number on her cellphone. “Hey, Sandy, it’s me,” she said when her friend answered. She sighed, andsaid with some effort, “You were right.”“About what?”“The book. And Grant. I started reading the book last night, and I couldn’tstop. I got like two seconds of sleep, and now I’m here at work again.”“It’s Sunday,” said Sandy.“I just have some things to wrap up and I want to talk to Grant today, before Ilose my nerve.”“So, what did you think of the book?”“Well, I think that what we’ve heard about these Iron Web people isn’t at alltrue. And the spin that everyone’s putting on this thing is completely wrong.They’re putting a lot of words into David Singh’s mouth that aren’t at all whathe’s saying. They’re making this man look dangerous when he’s not. And I justcan’t believe it’s a mistake, Sandy. They have to know it’s wrong. Grant has toknow it’s wrong. I’m sure he’s read the book; he reads everything.”She stopped for a moment to breathe. “You know, Sandy,” she went on sadly, “Ijust kept telling myself that he wasn’t like the others, that he was really agood guy, playing the game as much as he had to, you know, because you don’tlast if you don’t play the game. But I really believed that he was differentinside, and that some day he would do something different.” Sandy said nothing.“But this goes beyond spin. The way these people are being portrayed is probablygoing to get them all killed, while he’s making political hay with this.” Shewas silent for a minute, collecting herself. The disillusionment was too muchfor her. “Maybe I just wanted him to be different. But what he’s doing, and whathe’s saying, it just doesn’t match the man I thought he was.”Betsy appreciated Sandy not saying “Told ya so,” but wished she would at leastsay something now. “I know this is hard for you, Bet,” said Sandy. “I know howmuch you like him, and I totally understand why. If I didn’t hate politicians somuch, I’d have a crush on him, too. I really am sorry that he’s not what youhoped he’d be. Love isn’t just blind, you know, it’s also stupid. God knows I’mliving proof of that. And I won’t say I told you so, because everyone told me soevery time I started going out with some hot new jerk, and I never listened.”She paused and continued in a softer tone. “So, what will you do now?”“I’m quitting,” Betsy said flatly. “Right now. Today. I just can’t be here aminute longer. I know it’s unprofessional as hell, but I just don’t care rightnow. I’ve never gone off half-cocked in my whole life, and I think it’s abouttime I did.” She heard a suppressed giggle from Sandy.“Grant should be back any minute now,” she said, looking at the clock on thewall, “and then I’m telling him that I have to resign. We never talked about megoing to the White House with him anyway, but I want this to be my choice, mydoing.”“Way to go, girl,” said Sandy. Betsy could just picture a broad grin on herfriend’s face. “Listen,” Sandy continued, “when you’re done there, come on over.I’ll help you decompress, okay?”“Okay, thanks. I think Grant’s coming. I’ll see you soon,” said Betsy, closingher phone.Before Grant was even through the door, he was talking. “I have a meeting in anhour and a half, and before I go I wanted to—”“Grant,” interrupted Betsy, in a tone serious enough that he stopped talking andlooked at her. She took a deep breath. “I can’t in good conscience work hereanymore.” She was looking at the floor as she said it. Grant said nothing, andshe didn’t dare look at him to see his expression. She was seriously afraid thatif she looked at him, she would forget the whole thing. “What we do here,this—this whole game we play here—Sandy’s right. It’s all about power andcontrol. It’s all a lie, and it’s making me sick. I can’t be part of itanymore.” Of course she was as upset about leaving Grant as she was about theprinciple of the thing, but she wasn’t about to say so. She was on the brink oftears, hoping that it didn’t show, and she finally looked up at Grant. His faceshowed no anger and no shock.He sat down in the chair facing Betsy, and said soothingly, “What brought thison? Tell me what this is about.”Betsy steeled herself against his disarming tone. It would be so much easier ifhe got angry, she thought. “It’s been a lot of things,” she said. After castingabout for a way to say it nicely, she finally gave up. She’d dared to open hermouth, and now she might as well say what she really thought. “When I came toWashington, I thought I could do some good,” she began. “I thought governmentwas about helping people. I’ve spent five years learning how wrong I was.Everything here is a sales pitch. It’s all spin, and backroom deals, andcompromises. We support this bill if that guy will support ours. We’ll changeour position on this issue if that guy will endorse this candidate. It’s allabout trading favors, and sweet-talking contributors. This building is full ofpeople who spend day after day throwing around other people’s money, buyingvotes here, selling out to this or that lobby.”Now her words were tumbling out effortlessly. “Does anyone here actually believein anything other than money and power? Even the programs and things that soundgood, that sound like they’re designed to help people—around here they’re justtools for getting votes, and looking compassionate, and getting attention.” Shepointed out the window. “All the good people I know are out there in the realworld, trying to make ends meet, trying to pay all their bills, not to mentiontheir taxes. And all the people in here are throwing away billions here andbillions there, wherever they think it might buy them loyalty or recognition. Weput on the act of being compassionate and caring, of wanting to make the world abetter place, but it’s all a show. It’s all a lie. It sickens me, and I can’t bea part of it anymore.” She stopped talking, partly because she felt as if shewere about to cry.After a pause, she heard Grant say, as if to himself, “The urge to save humanityis almost always a false front for the urge to rule.”Betsy was prepared for some sort of excuse or spin, and was confused by hisresponse. “What?”Grant seemed to snap out of a daydream. “What? Oh, sorry. It’s a quote from H.L.Mencken. Smart guy. He also said that every election is a sort of advanceauction on stolen goods.”“Well, that’s what I mean,” she replied, wondering why he wasn’t trying tocontradict her. She wished again that he would argue and snap at her. “That’swhat it feels like. It’s a power game, and whether it actually does anyoneoutside this city any good, no one seems to care, as long as they get the PRimage they want, and the votes they want. Money and power, that’s all it’sabout. All of it. And it’s not what I want my life to be about. It’s not what Icame here to do.” She paused for a moment to control the tremble in her voice.“And it’s not what I thought you were about, either.”Grant leaned forward and put his hand on hers—something she never remembered himdoing before—and she became aware that she was nervously gripping the arms ofher chair. She loosened her grip a bit, and he walked away from her to thewindow again. She knew the power that Grant had to persuade almost anyone ofanything, but he wasn’t doing a thing to dissuade her from her decision. Wasthat a good sign, or a bad one?“Grant,” she asked in as steady a voice as she could manage, “have you ever readthe book, Weaving an Iron Web?”“Let me guess. Sandy talked you into reading it,” he said, not turning around.“Well, yes,” she answered, “but you didn’t answer my question.”Still gazing out the window, he answered, “Yes, I’ve read it.”“And?”“And what?” he asked, turning toward her with a faintly derisive smile. “Shall Iwrite you a book report on it?”“No.” His levity annoyed her. “They’re not what you say they are—those people inGraveston. If you’ve read the book, you know that.” For years she had quietlylistened to all sorts of political spin from him, and even helped him fashionsome of it, but had never directly confronted him about any of it. Now she wasessentially calling him a liar right to his face, and her stomach was doingsomersaults.Grant walked up to her, leaned over, put his hands on her shoulders, and lookedstraight into her eyes. “Betsy, let’s discuss this later. For now, I ask onlyone thing of you. Stay here today and tomorrow, just until the inauguraladdress. After that, do whatever you feel is right.”“I guess I can stay on that long,” she said, surprised at his response. Sheexpected some spin, or maybe even a confession of sorts, but not this. “I don’twant to leave you hanging or anything,” she added lamely, wondering if he wasjust concerned with the practical matter of running his office.“It’s not that,” he said softly, dropping his eyes but not moving away from her.He opened his mouth as if to add something, but then closed it. After a momenthe looked up at her again and said, in a low voice, “Just promise me you’ll stayuntil then. After that, I won’t lift a finger to stop you, and I’ll give youwhatever glowing references you want.” He stayed in that position, looking intoher eyes. She felt as if he was trying to hypnotize her, and it felt as if itwas working.“I don’t know what difference that will make, but I’ll promise that much,” shesaid, looking away from him. Then, to her surprise,he leaned over and kissed her gently on the forehead. He stood up and turnedtoward the window. As if to himself, he muttered, “A lot can happen in a day.”Then he turned and walked out of the room.PART VI image [../Images/image00252.jpeg] JESSICA sat in a dry corner of the dark cellar, watching rainwater drip throughthe boards of the floor above and collect in puddles at the other end of theroom. Tasha had gone outside and positioned the watering can to collectrainwater as it ran off the corrugated aluminum roof. But now that her thirstwas quenched at last, Jessica’s body was persistently demanding food.“We should probably save the battery in that light,” David said as Doug wanderedaround the room, examining the floor and walls.“No need,” Doug responded. “It’s one of those LED things. It’ll burn a zillionhours on one puny little battery.” He picked up some boards on the floor andlooked under them. “Chances are, it’ll be alive long after we are.”“Thanks for that bit of optimism,” Jason said. “What are you even looking for?”“I don’t know,” Doug answered, “but the guy who lived here built this place ashis own little survivalist retreat, expecting civilization to come to an end.You’d think he would have had some useful stuff down here.”“Where is he now?” Jessica asked.“Died of cancer, right in this house,” David said. “It was about fifteen yearsago. He’s buried out in the woods, not two hundred yards from here. That waswhat he asked for. Didn’t have any kids. He didn’t have much at all, but henever complained about that.”“Oh, man,” Doug said. “Check this out. There’s a section of cinderblocks herewith no mortar between them. This is it! I know it!”“How about we see if there’s anything there before we call Geraldo?” Jason saidmockingly, but he stood up and limped over to where Doug was standing. “Yeah, itdoes look like some of these have been taken out before.”Jessica watched for a while as Jason and Doug, in the dim glow of the littlekeychain light, tried to get one of the blocks to move. They used sticks, keys,anything they could find, to try to pry it out. Finally they got one to move outan inch, enough to get a grip on it. Each grabbing a side, they wiggled it backand forth. Finally it came loose, and they both stepped back as it loudlycrashed onto the boards lying on the floor below.“It might be good if we didn’t advertise our whereabouts so much,” David said.“Sorry,” Doug said, picking up the light and shining it in. “Oh, yeah. Jackpot.”“Time to call Geraldo?” Jason joked.“There are shelves of boxes and plastic bags,” Doug said, as he put his faceinto the hole. His voice sounded distant and muffled. “There’s a radio, too. Oh,man, there’s even a rifle in the corner.”“Let me see,” Jason said, and Doug handed him the light and stepped back. Jasonpeered in. “Yep, looks like an M1 Garand.Not bad, if there are any bullets. I don’t know what good it will do, though. Idon’t think Doug with one rifle is going to hold off the entire federalgovernment—including the army, for all we know. But what’s all that other stuff?Let’s get this wall down.”In only a minute or two Jason and Doug had the rest of the loose blocks removed,making an opening about four feet tall by three feet wide. “Okay, Indiana, youfirst,” Jason said to Doug, who climbed right in.“How do you know it’s not booby-trapped or something?” Jessica asked anxiously.“They’re using the method of trial and error,” David remarked. “But I don’tthink old man Hargroves would have done that. Any batteries for the radio?” heasked.“Aw, cool,” came Doug’s muffled voice from the hole in the wall. “No batteries.It’s the kind that you charge up by cranking it.” A whizzing sound came from thehole, and then the scratchy static of a badly tuned-in radio broadcast. “No way,it works! Dang it, where’s the volume?” After a moment the noise faded to almostnothing. “That’s better.”“Look for a first aid kit,” David said.After a brief pause, Doug’s voice could be heard again. “Got it. Sending itout.” Jason brought out a green metal box with the familiar emblem of a redcross on it.“Are those MREs?” Jason asked, peering in. “It looks like he’s got a million ofthem.”“What, these?” came Doug’s voice from the hole. A dark green package came flyingout of the hole, and Jason caught it with his left hand. “What are they?”“MRE, meals ready to eat,” Jason answered. “They keep almost forever.” Suddenlyhe stopped and looked into the hole. “Wait a second. You’re the survivalist,militia-type guy. How did you not know that? Aren’t you guys always supposed tobe prepared for the end of the world?”Doug’s face came out of the hole. “I missed that lesson. I was busy reading TheAnarchist Cookbook for the hundredth time. If you’re done stereotyping me, it’syour turn to go in, jackboot. It’s getting tough to breathe in there.” Hestepped out, and Jason stepped in.It occurred to Jessica that, in a very real sense, Jason now fit in with thisgroup as well as anybody. Philosophically, he and Doug might be worlds apart,but circumstance had made them allies. When survival itself was the goal,everything else seemed trivial.“Man, look at all this stuff,” came Jason’s voice from inside. “Ammo box for theM1, blankets, propane, matches. What’s this?” There was the sound of a metal tinopening. “Holy smokes. One, two, three.” There was silence for a moment.“Eighteen gold coins, and maybe twice that many silver ones.”“Not bad,” said Doug. “At least, it wouldn’t be bad if we ever get out of herealive. Are they one ounce, or half ounce?”“I have no idea,” came Jason’s voice. “They’re a little bigger than a quarter.”“One ounce,” David said. “Worth around two thousand FRNs each, last time Ichecked, which was a while ago.”“FRNs?” Jessica asked.“Federal Reserve Notes,” David answered.“What you call dollars,” Doug added.“What I call dollars?” Jessica asked curiously. “What do you call dollars?”“Man, don’t get him started on monetary policy,” David said.“The short version is this: paper currency used to represent something, likesilver or gold,” Doug explained. “You could trade it in for the real thingwhenever you wanted. It used to say that right on the front: ‘payable to thebearer on demand.’ But after people got used to using the paper, a bunch ofcrooks figured out that they could just print more paper, without itrepresenting anything, and then loan it to us at interest.”“You mean counterfeiters?” Jessica asked.“Well, yes, it is counterfeiting, but not the way you mean it,” Doug answered.“I’m talking about the Federal Reserve. It makes up money out of nothing, andloans it out to people and governments. And once all the people and all thegovernments are perpetually indebted to the international bankers, the bankerspretty much own the world. It’s a brilliant, relatively simple way to controleverything.”“This conspiracy stuff is all way over my head,” Jessica said, not sure how muchof it to believe.“It’s actually a very simple concept. It’s just that you never heard it inschool, or in the mainstream media,” David said.“More conspiracy?” Jessica asked, sounding dubious.“Shhh!” The sound came from Doug. Everyone went silent, except for Jason, whowas still in the hole, talking to himself. “Jason, shut up,” whispered Doug. Allwent quiet. All ears strained to hear something. After a moment, there was theunmistakable sound of voices outside, and they were getting closer.“Clear here,” came a voice just overhead. There was the sound of footsteps abovethem, and dust fell from the rafters. Doug quickly shut off the light. “Thecaptain said we’re supposed to burn any structure we find.” Jessica felt panicsetting in. “This ain’t much of a structure,” came another voice, “and good luckgetting this soggy heap of crap to burn.” There were now more footsteps comingfrom above. “Yeah, forget it. The bulldozers can take it down tomorrow. Do theguys in nest D have a view of this place?” There was an unintelligible response.“Good enough. Another couple hundred yards of these woods, and that’s it. Eyesopen. Let’s go.”The sound of footsteps and voices gradually faded, but it was a long time beforeanyone in the basement dared to say a word. image [../Images/image00251.jpeg] JASON felt as if time had slowed down. Each minute seemed to drag on for an houras he sat in that wet, dark basement. While Doug and Tasha prepared a dinner ofMREs, David had insisted on doctoring Jason’s shoulder and ankle with the firstaid kit. The ankle had received an open wound that had bled freely and washealing well. But although David didn’t say much, Jason could see that he wasdeeply concerned about the shoulder wound, which had closed without beingsterilized. He muttered something about antibiotics, but the only medication inthe kit was aspirin. David gave him some with a drink of water. “I don’t knowhow old it is,” David said. “It might be ineffective. But it’s all we have.”Jessica had assisted David over Jason’s objections. “Shut up and lie down,Jason,” she said. “I’ve seen injuries before.”Jason was impressed with the girl’s courage and fortitude. By her own admission,she had lived a fairly pampered, privileged life. She’d then been thrust withoutwarning into a war zone, and had turned out to be remarkably strong. Time andagain he’d seen an irrepressible spirit bubble up through her fear and grief.But something had changed since yesterday. Her sparkle was gone, and even herown survival did not seem to interest her that much. His heart ached for her. Hewanted to hold her, and let her cry out her grief. The group avoided speaking ofHalen, as if no one wanted to acknowledge how much hope had died along with him.But Jason knew, more keenly and painfully than anyone else, that Halen had beenmuch more than hope to Jessica.Now the rain suddenly came down harder, like gunfire on what was left of the oldaluminum roof. The wind blustered, bringing cascades of leaves and twigs down onthe cabin floor over their heads. The noises outside kept playing tricks onJason’s ears. It would sound as if someone were walking around up there, andsometimes he thought he could even hear voices. He kept telling himself that theother agents wouldn’t bother searching in this weather; they would wait until itcleared; it was just his imagination. Time continued to crawl by.“I think I should go out there and surrender.” Though he spoke quietly, Jasonjumped at the sound of David’s voice; no one had spoken for so long. “They won’tstop looking until they find me. But the rest of you, I doubt they even knowyou’re here. They probably think Jason’s dead by now, they don’t know Jessica ishere at all, and I doubt Doug is really on their radar.” Jessica saw him squeezehis wife’s hand. “I can’t see this ending well either way, but if I go out, theymight stop searching, and the rest of you might have a chance to sneak away.”“I’m going with you,” Tasha said.“No,” David said firmly, shaking his head. “Whatever horrible crimes they makeup about me, they’ll just lock you up as an accomplice. Maybe even an enemycombatant. You’re the main reason I have to go. I won’t let them get you. Notever. No matter what.”“Don’t go at all,” Jason said. “You heard them. They’ll bulldoze this whole areaanyway, like they did in Waco. You’ll be killing yourself, and you won’t besaving anyone.”“I’d rather die with you than lose you,” Tasha said to David, in a voice almosttoo soft for Jason to hear.“Were you at Waco?” Doug suddenly asked Jason.“No,” Jason answered, grateful for the change of topic. “I’ve only been an agentfor a few weeks now. But I know a couple guys who were there. One of them islike super-macho man, brags about stuff he probably never did. The other one, hedoesn’t really like to talk about it.” Jason leaned back against the cool wall,remembering the look of sadness on the other agent’s face whenever he spoke ofWaco. “After work one day we were hanging out, just the two of us. After a fewbeers, he starts talking about Waco. He says when it was happening, he was alljuiced up, like they all were, you know: the righteous cavalry bringingevildoers to justice. He was in on the raid that started it all, before the FBItook over. When the shooting started, they were outside, just shooting atanything that moved. He said it was like one of those old carnival games, wherethe metal ducks pop up and you shoot them. He saw movement in a window, turnedand fired. He was pretty far away, but he swears he saw it clear as day, andsaid the image won’t ever leave him. It was a middle-aged woman, he stilldoesn’t know who it was, and he got a perfect head shot. Saw the splatter on thefar wall as she dropped out of sight.” The room was dead silent for a moment.“Says he hasn’t fired a gun since then,” Jason continued. “He tried to quit theagency, but they gave him some office job instead. They told us he got someinjury that kept him from doing operations. It was a lie. He told me that flatout. Killing that lady messed him up bad. He started drinking a lot. His wifeleft him.” Jason didn’t want to talk about it anymore, and the room was quietfor a long time.“There’s someone up there,” Doug suddenly whispered.“It’s your ears playing tricks on you,” said Jason. “It’s just the rain.”“No, not this time,” Doug said. “Someone is calling.” They all sat quietly, andthen Jason heard it too.“Oh my God, I think it’s Heather!” Jessica choked out. Doug scrambled up themakeshift cinderblock stairs to the covered opening, and pushed the debris outof the way. A dim light flooded in, bright to Jason’s eyes, which had adjustedto the dark. Doug disappeared out of the hole, and everyone in the basement satstill. For a moment, Jason considered making a run for the rifle, which nowleaned against the far wall, but decided against it. In a minute or two, therewas movement outside the hole again. Someone was coming in, and with the lightblocked, the room went dark again, except for the keychain light in the corner.When light came in again through the outside hole, Jessica could just make outthe form of Ben’s sister, Heather. “I thought I might find someone here,” shesaid. She turned toward David, and the light from outside revealed a huge darkbrown patch on her dress, from her stomach down the front of her skirt.“Oh, no!” David said, jumping to his feet.“It’s okay,” Heather said. Her voice was weak, but she sounded almost ascheerful as ever. “It’s stopped bleeding now. It went across sideways,” shesaid, drawing a line across her stomach with her finger. “That was a close call,but it didn’t hit anything important.” Jason was amazed. This little old lady,completely drenched from the rain, wounded, after having staggered around in thewoods alone for who knew how long, seemed perfectly cheerful.But as Heather glanced around the room, her smile faded. “I was hoping I wouldfind more people here,” she said.David shook his head sadly. “This is it,” he said. “They got Ben first. And thenJosh, and Halen, and Keith. Carl and Tarzan, too.”“And who might this be?” Heather asked, indicating Jason.“This is Jason,” Doug answered. “He’s a fed—or at least used to be, though he’spretty much one of us now.”“How do you do?” she said politely, not seeming very surprised. “I’ve beenlooking for survivors,” she added. “I found Ben’s grave.”“Keith went over and did that last week. We thought you got captured long ago,”David said. “Halen looked everywhere for you. We’d have kept looking, but wewere so sure ... ”“How did you not get caught?” Doug asked her in amazement.“I’m a little old, and a little slow, but I still have a few tricks up mysleeve,” she answered cryptically, with a wink at David.Jessica walked over to Heather and put an arm around her. “You’re wounded, andsoaked,” she said.“If you gentlemen could look the other way for a bit,” said Tasha, “we shouldget Heather into some blankets and look at that wound.”The men obliged, but Jason worried about the old lady. It was likely to get coldat night, and there was no way to dry her clothes down here. They couldn’t makea fire in the basement, and they didn’t dare make one outside, even if theycould get something to burn.The best Tasha and Jessica could come up with was to help Heather out of her wetclothes and zip her snugly into a sleeping bag, with a blanket over her wethair.“We’ve got a fine menu of MREs here,” David said. “Let’s see ... black bean andrice burrito, spaghetti with meat sauce, grilled chicken breast, chicken andrice pilaf, beef enchilada ... ”“You can even have it hot,” said Doug. “They come with these magic heaterpouches.”“Best of all, there’s hot coffee,” said Tasha.“It’s like a five-star hotel here,” said Heather.After Heather had chosen her meal and watched the magic heater pouch at work,Doug heated coffee for everyone, and they all focused on enjoying this simplepleasure.“So this is the dastardly terrorist organization the whole country is sofrightened of?” Heather said facetiously. “It’s a shame. It’s a shame wecouldn’t have done more good.”The statement surprised Jason. After all this woman had just been through, hermain concern was that she hadn’t helped the rest of the world enough. “Thosepeople out there,” Heather continued, “they’ve all been whipped up into afrenzy. They’re all scared to death of things that aren’t a danger at all, andpay no attention to the things they should be afraid of.”“Have you been here before, Heather?” David asked. “I mean, down here, whileHargroves was still alive?”“I’ve been to his cabin, but I didn’t know he even had a basement,” sheanswered.“Well, thanks to Willard, we have lots of food, a first aid kit, and a radio,”David said. “He had a secret stash hidden behind the wall over there.”“That, I didn’t know about,” Heather said, “but with Willard, it doesn’tsurprise me in the slightest. I was only over here a few times. We tried to begood neighbors, but Willard and I didn’t get along very well. He seemed so angryall the time. I understood what he was angry about. Still, it makes lifeunbearable if all you ever think about is what’s wrong with the world. He wouldalways talk about how stupid people are, and how bad things were going to get. Iknow he was frustrated that he could see these things and couldn’t do anythingabout them, couldn’t make people listen.” Heather looked up at David. “I’m proudof you, dear,” she suddenly said with a smile. “That book of yours, that’smaking some people sit up and take notice. That’s why they’re working so hard topaint you as the devil. You know what they say: if no one hates you, you’re notmaking a difference.”“Speaking of which,” Doug cut in, looking as if he had bad news to report, “Ialmost forgot. Before all hell broke loose yesterday, I heard a news broadcast.I tried to remember it exactly. They said a group up in Idaho, claiming theywere acting on behalf of the Iron Web, has been terrorizing blacks, and evenkilled a black couple up there. Said it was something about having a new AryanNation rise out of the ashes of the failing United States, blah blah blah.”“Well, that’s really going to help the Iron Web image,” Jason said. “Anyone youknow?” he asked David.“You tell me,” said David, in his usual patient way. “I told you what theconcept of the Iron Web is. Do you think that concept is compatible with racialviolence, or with building any sort of nation? Maybe some people were uninformedenough to assume—without reading it—that my book advocates that sort of thing.There are some groups latching onto the Iron Web’s popularity without theslightest understanding of what it means. Or it could be just another false flagoperation by the government. There’s so much ignorance and so much corruptionout there, sometimes it’s hard to tell where one ends and the other begins.”“What’s a false flag operation?” Jessica asked.“Ever heard of the burning of the Reichstag?” Doug asked.“What? I don’t think so,” Jessica answered.“Hitler had his own guys burn down the German parliament building, and thenblamed it on the opposition,” Doug said. “The technique is nothing new. It’scalled a ʻfalse flag’ operation—you do something really bad in such a way thatit looks as if your enemies did it. It’s a simple way to get public opinion onyour side, and governments around the world have been doing it for millennia.”“The name comes from the trick of sending in a ship, bearing the flag of yourenemy, and having it do something horrible that you can blame on your enemy,”David explained. “After my book became an underground best seller a couple ofyears ago, the government’s been trying to link the Iron Web concept to racismand crime and violence of every kind. Of course, it’s idiotic to claim thatterrorizing and murdering people is compatible with the idea of people owningthemselves, yet most people will blindly accept the connection without a secondthought.”“I must admit,” Jessica said, “I sort of expected you guys to be a bunch ofwhite separatists or something, though I’m not really sure what gave me thatimpression.”“Well,” said David, “I’m sure you heard the media making those connections everyday, and especially if you weren’t really paying attention to the storyyourself, those connections just stay in your mind by default.” He smiled,putting his arm around Tasha. “Yeah, we’re secretly KKK members,” he joked.“They’ve started accepting Indians and Filipinos as part of their new diversityprogram.”Jessica looked slightly embarrassed. “Well, I didn’t know what color you were,”she said. “I never saw a picture of you or anything.”“That probably wasn’t by accident, either,” Doug said. “They calculate all thesethings very carefully. The last thing they want is a picture of Tashacirculating around, as an example of the despicable terrorists who are trying todestroy the world. David, on the other hand,” he added in a kidding tone, “he’sa pretty shady-looking character; they could plaster his ugly mug all over theplace and scare almost everyone.”“And half the country would assume I’m Iraqi,” David added.“I hate to say it,” Jason cut in, “but you’re right about that vilificationstuff. All the agency’s press releases are scripted and fine-tuned by special PRguys. We’re the good guys, and whoever we’re investigating is the scum of theearth. Every word and every image that makes it to the media has to fit thatmessage, though it can’t be so blatant that people see through it. The amount ofspin they put on stuff has made me uneasy more than once. Don’t get me wrong,”he added quickly, “I believe in a lot of what the agency does—or at least I usedto—but I have to cringe sometimes at how much they spin and twist things toalways make the agency look like a bunch of heroic angels.”“What is this, confessions-of-recovering-fascists day on Oprah, or what?” Dougjoked.“Something like that,” said Jason ruefully.“There’s just so much that people don’t understand, and never even think about,”David said. “Trying to clear things up, when people in power are constantlytrying to confuse matters, is a tough job. There are so many levels ofmisunderstanding in most people’s minds, that it’s hard to even know where tobegin. Even the term ʻwhite separatist’—tell me, Jessica, what stereotype doesthat term bring to mind?”“I don’t know,” she said, but after a moment’s thought she came up with,“cross-burnings, those white pointy hoods and KKK outfits, mobs lynching blackguys.”“Yes. And that’s the image that some people want to push, as inaccurate as itmay be. The number of cross-burnings and lynchings has been almost zero fordecades, but the stereotype remains. Most white separatists just want to hangaround with people who are culturally similar to them. When any other group doesthat—the Chinese, the Japanese, Koreans, Hispanics, blacks, Italians, Irish,Indians—everyone accepts it as perfectly natural. But when whites do it, peoplethink they’re evil.”“You’re defending the KKK?” Jessica asked.“Well, I’m not defending everything the KKK might do,” David answered. “What I’msaying is that, if people want to hang around only with other people of the samereligion, or the same skin color, I think they absolutely have that right.Personally, I wouldn’t want to limit my acquaintances that way, but I don’tthink I have any right to foist my own preferences onto others. If all the blackpeople in some neighborhood want to limit their patronage to only black-ownedbusinesses, that too is their right, even if it seems silly to me, or puts meout of business. In fact, if some group wants to go around saying that they’rethe best Sneetches on the beaches, they can go right ahead. If they want to saythat they’re a super race and everyone else is inferior, I have no right to stopthem. The only time they become my enemies—the only time it’s justified foranyone, inside or outside of government, to use force against them—is when theydecide to try to forcibly rule, or assault, or rob, or kill someone else.”“The leftists claim to be tolerant,” Doug whispered to Jessica, but in a voiceloud enough for all to hear, “but this guy is even tolerant of the goddamn KKK.”“But he’s not defending lynching or anything else violent,” said Jessica. “Justtheir right to hang out with each other and express their ideas. So I guess I’dhave to agree.”“I own myself, and they own themselves,” David responded unapologetically. “Asfar as I’m concerned, they can say or do whatever they please. As long as theyleave others in peace, I’ll leave them in peace.”“Man, he’s not kidding,” Doug said. “Remember that guy at the lumberyard whocalled you a ʻnigger’?” he asked David, who chuckled.“Yes, he didn’t seem very well informed about which insults go with which ethnicbackgrounds,” David joked. “Didn’t know a nigger from a dothead. But why shouldI care if someone wants to call me names? I’m a little more concerned about thepeople trying to rob and control me.”“Doesn’t the KKK share a lot of your complaints about the government?” Jasonasked. “And maybe that common ground makes people associate you with them.”“To a point,” David answered, “but like a lot of groups that object to thecurrent regime, if you put them into power, they’d just establish their ownflavor of tyranny. Nobody likes being beat up on, so it’s no great virtue tooppose your own oppression. If you don’t value freedom in principle, liberty foryour friends and enemies alike, then there’s nothing noble about you. Peopledon’t understand that, which is how you get people like Fidel Castro and CheGuevara. They start out by using the flag of freedom to resist the old tyranny,only to turn around and support a new tyrannical regime. They love their ownfreedom—who doesn’t? But they couldn’t care less about freedom in principle.That’s why history is just a long string of oppressions, toppled by resistancemovements, and then replaced with new oppressions. The American Revolution cameclose to being an exception to the rule, but even that eventually led to anempire that was worse than the one before. Whenever someone claims to be afreedom fighter, you have to ask yourself, is the guy fighting for everyone’sliberty, or just for his own? If it’s only the latter, then he’s just anothertyrant waiting to happen.”It suddenly occurred to Jason how much David’s words also applied to lawenforcement. It felt good taking down the bullies who hurt other people. Butwhen cops were the ones doing the bullying and the hurting, what then? How oftenhad he looked the other way? How often did all cops look the other way? Wasbeing a cop about fighting injustice, or just about being the biggest kid on theblock? Jason thought he now knew the answer to that question, and he didn’t likeit.“Back to your question,” David went on, “the KKK, if given the reins of power,would do just what the government is doing now, with a different flavor ofoppression. However, they’re still right regarding a lot of things that theycomplain about, like taxes, gun control, and one of their favorites, legislativecoercion being used to benefit one race over another, even though they just wantthe chance to do the same thing in the other direction.”“You mean stuff like affirmative action?” Jessica asked.“Yes. I’m not a fan of coercion, even when it’s given a nice-sounding name,”David responded. “I don’t know if you know this, but I was a dentist for manyyears, and a good one, too. When I went to school to learn dentistry, I wrotedown on my registration that I was Caucasian. The lady there, trying to be niceand helpful, told me to change it to Indian. It’s an advantage to be a minority,she said, not a disadvantage. But I told her, that’s exactly why I won’t putthat down. Either my accomplishments alone qualify me, or I don’t want to bethere. Hell will freeze over before I ever stand by while someone is forced toemploy me, or forced to let me into a school, because of my ancestry. I’d ratherthey said, ʻWe don’t want your kind around here.’ It would be less insultingthan getting so-called ʻhelp’ via government coercion. If anything should offenda minority, that’s it: a bunch of elitists telling them, ʻYou can’t possiblysucceed unless we give you a head start.’ And yet the politicians who say thatalways get the bulk of the minority vote.”“I never thought of it that way,” Jessica said. “I guess what the whole thingimplies is pretty insulting. But what do you do about the white guy who won’thire someone just because he’s black?”“Why do anything?” David asked. “No one has a right to a job, and no one has theright to force an employer to hire anyone. How would you like it if one day thegovernment told you that it would be deciding, based upon racial and religiousdiversity, what restaurants you were allowed to go to, what convenience storesyou could visit, and so on? You would have to make sure that thirteen percent ofthe mall stores you go to are black-owned, or the government will fine you orimprison you. Sound justified?”“Of course not,” answered Jessica.“Well, it’s the same thing. However short-sighted, bigoted, or just plain stupidI think someone is, how he spends his money, and who he chooses to associatewith, is entirely up to him. I own me, he owns him.” David paused for a moment.“I wish you could have met Carl. He wrote an amazing piece about theexploitation and victimization of subcultures by government.”“The what and what of what?” Jessica asked.“Sorry,” David said, laughing. “I’m talking about how tyrants target groups thatreally do have legitimate complaints, feed whatever bitterness and resentmentthey have, and use it to increase the government’s power over those very samepeople, and everyone else. It’s a fascinating topic, and Carl was a truescholar. I think he even surpassed Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell.”“Never heard of them,” said Jessica apologetically.“A couple of uppity niggers who left the plantation,” Doug said bluntly. Doug’spolitically incorrect language bothered Jason, and looking over at Jessica, hecould see that she was also a bit shocked.“What he means is that they’re two very intelligent black gentlemen,” Davidsaid, shooting Doug a disapproving glance, “who’ve been writing for a very longtime about how politicians who pretend to care about minorities are the biggestthreat to them. What Doug here meant by his somewhat less than tactful choice ofwords is that those who pretend to want to help minorities, mostly the leftistpoliticians of the last few decades, are the biggest racists and bigotsaround—modern-day plantation owners, if you will, who are using the black raceto serve their own power and greed. When a black person sees through the bill ofgoods the leftists have been selling them for decades, the socialists and theirmedia pawns will demonize that person and try to take him down. In the old days,the plantation owners called them ʻuppity niggers.’ Today they’re accused ofself-hatred, or being ʻtoo white’.”Jason still remembered the euphoria of the Obama campaign, followed bydepression, food shortages and civil unrest. As a child, he’d gone to schoolwith black kids, played with them, and felt comfortable with them. Now a wordlike “nigger” could lead to fighting in the streets. The word made him shudder,even as a joke.“I wish Carl were here to explain it,” David went on. “And Carl— he was black ascan be, I mean physically. He was born in Ghana, and came to this country whenhe was a few years old, and was discriminated against by blacks and whitesalike. He scoffed at the so-called ʻAfrican-American’ agenda, which teaches thatequality can come only from begging the government for goodies and favors, andfrom using the force of law to make things fair. Carl wrote about how thesupposed solutions to racism and poverty offered by the collectivists had donemore damage to minority communities than even overt slavery had. The welfarestate, the war on drugs, gun control, the education system, and all the othersupposedly benevolent government programs have been the driving force behind theilliteracy, illegitimacy, crime, violence, and drug addiction that are so highamong black Americans. And yet the people who made all that happen, knowing fullwell in advance what the results would be, still get the great majority of theblack vote. People who live in ignorance and poverty, whose parents lived inignorance and poverty, and whose kids are living in ignorance and poverty today,are still more worried that someone somewhere might be calling them the ʻn’ wordthan they are about the conniving criminals, both black and white, whose lustfor power has all but destroyed the self-reliance and self-respect of millionsof American blacks.”“Ya know, I once heard a black girl at my school say something like that,”Jessica said. “I wasn’t really sure what she meant at the time, but she saidsomething like: the best way to keep someone down is to keep giving him thingsthat he hasn’t earned.”“Smart girl. And I bet she got her share of grief for saying that, too,” Davidsuggested. “Anyway, the point is, if people are to be free and happy, theneveryone—black and white, male and female, old and young, rich and poor,ignorant and educated—has to accept the fact that every individual owns himself,and that no one owns anyone else. Only when we understand that truth, and stoptrying to use the beast called ʻgovernment’ to try to coerce others into makingthe choices we think they should make, will true civilization ever survive.”“You make it sound so simple,” Jessica said.“It is so simple,” David responded. “The only thing that makes it complicated isthe constant collectivist indoctrination cranked out by the media and theschools. True freedom and self-ownership is the simplest, most self-evidentthing in the world. It’s so obvious that people have to be constantly trained tonot see it. It’s the belief in authority that depends upon mental gymnastics,ignoring obvious contradictions, and engaging in ridiculously complex andconvoluted rationalizations, to try to justify one group of people rulinganother.”The room fell silent again, and Jason pondered what David had said. Yes, therewas some truth to it, but the real world couldn’t really be that simple. Whatwould a world look like where no one was in charge, where each person just madeup his own rules? Surely that would just lead to chaos, and even more violenceand crime than ever. It was hard for him to imagine any other type of societywithout government. image [../Images/image00256.jpeg] BETSY sat on Sandy’s couch, nursing a hot cup of tea and trying to “decompress,”as Sandy called it. She felt as if she’d chickened out. Grant had hypnotized herand spoiled her grand exit. Now she would be leaving on his terms instead of herown.“So, after all we talked about,” Sandy said, “he still sweet-talked you intostaying. Gotta give it to that guy—he’s a master.”“No, it’s not like that at all,” Betsy protested. “I’m still leaving, just notuntil after tomorrow. He just wants me to see him into office, for old times’sake, I guess.”“Yeah, unless he begs and pleads for another week, or a month.” Sandy sighed,looking exasperated. “He thinks once he’s president, you won’t be able to resistworking for him. Bet, that’s what these people do. They’re masters ofmanipulation and control. Power freaks, every last one of them. If you don’tbreak this off now, Mr. Charm will drag you along forever.”“But you weren’t there,” Betsy objected. “This was different. He was different.He was—” she hesitated, not wanting to say the word, “—sincere.”“Oh, please. A sincere politician?”“It was just weird,” Betsy said, unable to find adequate words. “He didn’t eventry to disagree with me or argue about it.” After a pause, she added, “He kissedme on the forehead, which isn’t like him at all.”“He did what? If only he were married, you’d have some good blackmail ammo,”Sandy commented. “Sounds like a scandal to me.”“Look, I’m serious,” Betsy said, cracking a smile. “It wasn’t like that. Look, Ijust can’t leave now. I promised I’d stay until tomorrow, and I will. But Ipromise, I’m outta there the day after that. Deal?”“Cross your heart?” Sandy asked, sounding skeptical.“Hope to die,” Betsy answered cheerfully, drawing the sign of an “X” across herheart with one finger.Sandy poured more tea through a strainer into Betsy’s cup. Sandy was aconnoisseur of exotic teas and coffees, and she scoffed at tea bags.“Wonderful tea, Sandy,” said Betsy. “Totally decompressing.”Sandy smiled. “So tell me more about what you thought of the book,” she said.“Well, it wasn’t at all what I expected. I just kept waiting for the author tostart sounding like an angry terrorist, and advocating violence, and he neverdid. The truth is, it’s all about nonviolence.”Sandy smiled. “I know. He makes it all so obvious, you wonder how you didn’t seeit before. Hey, maybe you should tie up Senator Slick and make him read it.”“He already has,” Betsy said.“Are you sure?” Sandy asked. “How do you know that?”“He told me, just yesterday.”“And he still keeps throwing out all those lies? What a scumbag.”“I guess. It was really weird, though. He mumbled this quote, something I thinkI’ve heard you say before—something about when people say they want to save theworld, they really just want to be the one in charge.”“Mencken?” Sandy asked.“Yeah, that’s it,” Betsy said, recognizing the name. “That’s what he said.”“Mein Führer is quoting H.L. Mencken now?” Sandy asked in wonder. “Wow. That isweird. When he starts spouting Albert Jay Nock, let me know.”“Who?”“Never mind.”“Anyway,” Betsy said with a sigh, “the day after tomorrow, I pack up my things,and I’m gone for good. I’ve had enough.”“Shrug, Dagny, shrug,” Sandy said with a smile.“What?”“Forget it,” Sandy said. “While you’re unemployed, I’ll give you some more goodstuff to read—there’re some other authors I’d like you to meet: Ayn Rand, Nock,Lysander Spooner, and a few others.”Betsy laughed as she sipped her tea. “You’re expecting me to be out of work fora while, aren’t you?” image [../Images/image00252.jpeg] JESSICA woke up and looked around the dark room. There was the sound of someonesnoring, but no other movement or sound. She decided the others must all beasleep. There hadn’t been enough blankets to go around from the stash they hadfound, but the men had insisted on making the three women fairly comfortable attheir own expense. Heather seemed very tired, and hadn’t even finished theration they gave her. Jessica thought the MREs were surprisingly good, despitebeing down there for who knew how many years. She had to wonder whether Heatherwasn’t doing worse than she let on.For a long while Jessica lay in the darkness, wondering what time it was. It wasalways fairly dark in this windowless hole, but she could see some light betweenthe boards above, telling her that it was morning. It seemed like ages sinceanyone had been outside, and she thought that someone should at least take apeek, to see if anything was happening they should know about. They hadn’t donea very good job of covering the opening again after Heather showed up. Luckily,they’d had no unwelcome visitors.Sitting up, she suddenly felt something on her leg. Looking down, squinting inthe dim light, she saw a large wolf spider, the spread of its legs well over twoinches, perched on her thigh. On any other day, in any other place, she wouldhave been terrified. She would have tried to kill it. But the world had changeda lot for her in the last few days. She just sat there calmly watching it. Whatwould have been a source of terror before was now just an irrelevant littledistraction. She knew that wolf spiders were relatively harmless. This creaturehad probably lived down here all its life, and this group of giants, thousandsof times its size, had invaded its environment. The thought of killing it wassuddenly distasteful to her.Eventually the spider crawled off of her and wandered into the shadows. Whensurvival itself was uncertain, she now realized, little else mattered very much.She tried to think of anything in her previous life that really mattered. Herfamily and her friends, they mattered. Everything else—grades, clothes, hairstyles, winning races and getting blue ribbons— all seemed so unimportant now.Thinking back, she couldn’t imagine how she’d ever thought that any of thosethings mattered so much.She slowly got to her feet, careful not to bump her sleeping companions as shedisentangled herself and her blanket from those next to her. The air in thebasement was cold. She gently placed her blanket over Jason, who didn’t haveone. If she was going to die here when the men with guns and bulldozers showedup, she wanted to at least see the outside world again first. It was probablytoo early for anything to be happening outside. Without thinking too much aboutit—because she knew it was not really a good idea—she decided to sneak outsidefor a moment. They had rigged up a makeshift bathroom in the basement the nightbefore, hanging an old tarp as a screen, so she couldn’t use that as her excusefor going outside. But she had to go out, she had to go see the world again,maybe for the last time.She crept over to the cinderblock stairs. When she put her foot on the firststep, it made a crunching, grinding sound. She winced and froze. But there wasstill no sign of any other sound or movement, so she continued. An inch at atime, feeling like a tiger stalking its prey, she crept up the stairs until herface was at the mass of sticks and leaves that served as a door. Looking througha tiny hole in the debris, she could see woods, dimly lit, as if the sun wasabout to come up.She carefully moved the debris, one leaf or twig at a time, widening the openinguntil she could stick her head out. The sound of birds was everywhere, and theground looked like silver velvet, with a thin sheet of dew covering everything.Gathering her determination, she climbed all the way out as quietly as shecould.The morning was still and peaceful, except for the chattering birds. For a longtime, she just stood, looking around. Finally, pushing all thoughts of dangerfrom her mind, she started to walk, with no particular destination in mind.Distracted by the beauty of the woods at dawn, she hardly noticed the chill.Something off to her left caught her eye, and she looked over to see a stripedskunk calmly waddling along, not twenty feet from her. She watched the creaturefor a while as it rummaged through the leaves for food. Then she kept walking.None of this area was familiar, and she wasn’t really paying attention to whereshe was going or how to get back. She was taking a break from worrying andthinking, and just enjoying being alive. She could see the edge of the woodsahead, and the golden light of the rising sun to the east was just starting toilluminate the tops of the trees in the woods across from her. She didn’t seeanyone around, and strolled out into the open. Her eye caught movement again,and far off to her left she saw the mother deer and her two young ones, whichshe assumed were the same ones she had seen before, from Doug’s house.She wondered if the doe was pregnant with her next fawn, and what the youngsterswould think when they were displaced by a tiny new baby. She remembered when herown mother brought her baby brother home.She wondered how anyone could justify bringing hatred and bloodshed into such aplace. Scanning the area, she could see the wreckage of Doug’s once-beautifulhome, and in the distance, the blackened ruins of Ben’s cabin. Off to her rightshe could just make out two other houses in the distance, though she didn’t knowwhose they were. Despite the signs of yesterday’s chaos, Mother Nature’s beautyshone through. Jessica wished she could stay in this paradise forever, and havethe rest of the world just leave her alone.And then it hit her: wasn’t that exactly what all of these people had wanted?The people she had met—Ben and Heather, David and Tasha, Doug and Josh, evenKeith and Halen—they hadn’t come here to cook up some scheme of destruction, orto plan terrorist acts. They came here hoping for one thing: to be left alone.At that moment, it seemed to Jessica that the supreme right above all others wasthe right to be left alone. Keith and Halen were like the skunk, she thought.Their defenses were formidable, but if you didn’t threaten them, you had nothingto fear from them. And the rest of us, she thought, are like the deer: all wecan do is run and hide.And why hadn’t this little neighborhood been left in peace? Because some kidswere supposedly smoking some pot. That’s what led to all of this? That was whyall the men with guns and the armored vehicles had come here? “They needed toshow everyone who’s boss,” Jessica said quietly, but aloud. “They needed to showthat everything is their business, that everything and everyone belongs to them,and that any who resist them will be destroyed.” It was no different from a gangstaking out its territory. You hurt a few people and scare the rest, and everyonce in a while make a show of force to let people know who’s in charge.“I own myself.” She pronounced it slowly and carefully, as if understanding thewords for the first time. It really was that simple. Whom had she harmed? Whomhad she ever robbed or hurt? No one, except for the red-headed agent who hadtried to kill her. What possible excuse could there be for anyone to have triedto harm her? Laws and badges didn’t make it okay. She had the absolute right tobe left alone. “Everyone has the right to be left alone,” she said out loud.“Jessica!” The sound of her name being urgently whispered snapped her out of hertrain of thought, and she turned to see Jason at the edge of the woods behindher. “What are you doing? Come back,” he said. His voice sounded urgent andfrightened. She turned and walked slowly back in his direction. Seeing Jason inthe daylight made her wonder what she looked like herself. His face and clotheswere muddy, and his hair disheveled. His brown eyes were full of anxiety.“You had no right to come to this place,” she said when she was close enough.“What do you mean? I woke up and didn’t know where you were,” he said, lookingconfused and a little angry about the scare she’d given him.“I don’t mean now, I mean at all,” she said. “You, and all the other agents, youhad no right to come to this place. You brought death and destruction here,” sheadded, pointing to the ruined houses in the distance.Jason was breathing hard, making clouds of mist, as if he had been runningaround looking for her. He said nothing for a while, as he got his breath back.“I know,” he said at last. “I know that now. I didn’t understand when I camehere.” He looked up and scanned the horizon, looking nervous again. “And theones who have this place surrounded still don’t understand it, so please comeback to the cabin.” She nodded, and the two of them walked back through thewoods, Jason nervously jumping at every snap of a twig, and Jessica calmlytaking in the scenery.Jason had always meant well. Jessica was sure of that. Even back when he camehere with the rest of the feds, he must have thought he was doing the rightthing, she thought. There was no malice or hatred in him, even at the beginningwhen he didn’t know what was going on. He was obviously attracted to her, butthere was more to it than that. He wasn’t the kind of person that Halen hadwarned her about, the kind who wanted other people under their feet. He treatedpeople with respect and sympathy, even when he disagreed with their beliefs.He’d really believed there were violent criminals back here, she thought, or hewouldn’t have come. He just didn’t know it was all a big lie. And how many lieshad she herself believed before falling into this place?He’s a good man, Jessica thought, and she felt a little bad for chastising himfor believing the wrong thing. Hadn’t he changed his mind in the face ofevidence, when a lesser man would have clung stubbornly to being right? Maybethis is what Halen would have been like, what he had been like, before prison,and war, and Andrew. He had gone from government enforcer to freedom fighter.Now Jason seemed to be headed down the same path, for whatever it was worth atthis point.When she and Jason finally reached the hole leading down into the basement,Jessica could hear voices inside. She hoped that she hadn’t caused too muchconcern, but she was still glad she had come out to greet the world again. Jasonheld her hand to steady her as she climbed down the steps into the darkness.“You gave us quite a scare,” Heather said, her smile looking more strained thanusual.“I’m sorry,” Jessica answered. “I just had to—” She couldn’t put into words whathad compelled her to do it, so she didn’t finish the sentence.“While you were gone, we got some more news,” Doug said, and his expression toldher that the news wasn’t good. “It was on the radio just now. Last night, aroundsunset, about thirty or forty guys who were on their way here to help us wereintercepted. It sounds like there was a massive gun battle.”“I didn’t hear a thing,” Jessica said, amazed at the news.“It was almost ten miles down the road. I’m not sure where they were comingfrom. Anyway, a bunch of feds went to stop them, and things got really badreally quick. I think only seven or eight of the guys survived, and I’m surethey’ll be in prison for the rest of their lives. But the media is talking aboutbetween forty and fifty federal agents dying in the fight. Of course, who knowswhether they’re telling the truth?”“If the story is true,” Jason said, “by now agents will be swarming the wholearea for miles around, with itchy trigger fingers. Maybe the National Guard,too, if not the Army. Now that the sun is up, they’ll bring in everything theyhave. They won’t leave a blade of grass standing.”“Well, if anyone was waiting for the cavalry to arrive,” David said, “I thinkyou can stop waiting.” With that, the room went silent. image [../Images/image00251.jpeg] JASON had gotten an old kerosene lantern to work, after some tinkering, tosupply a little more light than Doug’s keychain. It sat on a cinderblock in themiddle of the room. By that time enough rainwater had seeped through the groundthat there were several large puddles along two of the walls of the basement.Jason had the radio on, with the volume very low so that only he could hear, incase anything of importance came on. The mood in the room was one of defeat andhopelessness.“No one’s ever gonna know what happened here, are they?” Jessica asked in aquiet, tired voice. Jason wished he had some words that could comfort her, buthe didn’t. He remembered all too well his promise to get her out of this alive,but he couldn’t bring himself to repeat that empty promise now. “My folks willnever know that I wasn’t killed in the plane crash,” Jessica continued. “Theworld will forever think that Iron Web terrorists killed me.” Jason watchedJessica as she spoke. As dirty and bedraggled and sad as she was, her face stillenchanted him. “My dad voted for Collins,” she said. “The big law-and-order guy.He’ll be cheering the loudest when the government comes in here and kills usall.” Jason felt a physical pain in his heart as he watched Jessica break downand cry. “He’ll never know,” she sobbed.Tasha and Heather went to sit on either side of Jessica, and put their armsaround her. Jessica’s case was the most tragic, Jason thought, and he imaginedthe others thought so too. She’d been thrown into this situation completelyagainst her will, and snatched from the jaws of death only to die a couple ofweeks later. And she was so young.“The victors write the history books,” said David, sounding resigned andhopeless at last. “Soon little boys and girls across the country will be toldthe story of how the courageous and noble federal law enforcers defeated thatband of violent terrorists. Barring a miracle, we’ll just be one more lie in thehistory books.”“Cheery thought,” Jason said, wishing David had something more hopeful andinspiring to say, at least for Jessica’s sake. He motioned to David and Doug tocome sit with him, farther away from the women. If they had to talk like this,he reasoned, he could at least try to keep Jessica from hearing it.“Well, that’s how it’s always been,” David said softly as he sat down. “Kids aretaught to praise and adore tyrants, and taught to hate any who resist them. Wemake fun of it when other countries put their own spin on history. We’re stunnedthat anyone could still think that Josef Stalin or Chairman Mao was a good guy.But this country does the same thing, teaching our kids to adore tyrants likeFDR and Lincoln.”“Lincoln?” Jason asked. Was nothing sacred to this man?“Yeah, that deified crusader for freedom and justice,” David commented in anoffhand way. “Just another tyrant with a good PR program.”“You’re not gonna tell me he didn’t really free the slaves now, are you?” Jasonasked. He was happy to talk about anything that would distract him for a while.“Well, since you asked, he didn’t,” David replied. “The great EmancipationProclamation, which I assume you’ve heard of, only declared slaves free in areasnot controlled by the Union. It wasn’t a great victory for freedom; it was amilitary tactic, one used by lots of tyrants before Lincoln, including KingGeorge: tell your enemy’s slaves that if you win, they’ll be free. It’s a fineway to cause havoc on the other side, but it has nothing to do with principles.”Jason sighed. “Is there anything I learned about this country that you aren’tgoing to tell me was a lie?”After a short pause, and an attempted smile, David said, “If I can think ofanything, I’ll let you know.”“Whatever you do, don’t get him started on FDR,” Doug said.The voice of the news reporter coming from the radio, even at that low volume,suddenly caught Jason’s attention. After a moment, he said, “Uh, David, you’dbetter hear this,” and turned up the volume so that the others could hear it.The reception was clearer than it had been before, and the words easy tounderstand: “ ... released by the Justice Department show that he was convictedof corrupting a minor and statutory rape, and was investigated but not chargedregarding another allegation of soliciting sex from young boys.”“Why exactly do I want to hear this garbage?” David asked. “Who are they talkingabout?”“You,” Jason answered. He turned down the volume as the reporter moved on tosome other story. “Before I could turn it up, they said your name, and mentionedyour book.” After that, the room fell silent again.“You wonder if it’s true, but you don’t want to ask,” David said at last. It wasa statement, not a question. “It’s brilliant, really,” he went on. “Totallyevil, but brilliant. You hardly know me, so it’s perfectly reasonable for you towonder if it’s true. It’s not, of course. Pure fabrication, start to finish. Butaccusations like that, however baseless, are very powerful propaganda tools. Howmany people out there will doubt for a second what the media is feeding them?How many borderline sympathizers will distance themselves from the concept ofthe Iron Web after hearing this? The media could announce that I single-handedlyexterminated a small, non-existent country, and most Americans would eagerlybelieve it, and cheer for my execution. So easily manipulated. So easilydeceived.”“God, I don’t know how you can be so calm about this,” Doug said. “If someonesaid that about me, I’d go completely ape-shit.”“But why would they make that up?” Jason asked. “I’m not saying they didn’t, butwhy make up something that’s easy to disprove?”“It either means they think we’re already all dead,” Doug suggested, “or itmeans the order has been given to kill anyone they find in here. Who’s going torefute their lies if we’re all dead? History will remember us as the mostdespicable villains imaginable.” Jason wanted to tell Doug that his claim wasabsurd, but he knew it wasn’t.“This country will cheer our deaths,” David answered quietly. “I guess I shouldbe glad that I at least got my book published. Maybe some people will read it,and at least wonder if the official story is true. If it doesn’t get banned,that is.”The words from the radio again caught Jason’s attention. “They’re doing all theinauguration ceremony stuff. It sounds like Collins is going to be on in anhour,” he said. He picked up the radio and turned the handle a few times, togive it a full charge.“Is it really that late?” Doug asked.“Yeah, it’s inauguration day,” David replied. “It slipped my mind, but in just abit he’ll be sworn in.”“Great,” Doug said. “Führer Collins is about to accept the crown, and we allknow how he feels about us.” He scrambled to his feet. “I’m gonna have some beefravioli before he comes on. Anyone else hungry?”Jason wasn’t. He was in too much pain to eat, though he did feel thirsty.Infection was burning up his shoulder, and he felt generally feverish and weak.But he did his best not to let on. Everyone had enough worries, and whatdifference would it make now anyway?“Could I have something hot to drink?” Jessica asked.After some bustling around with food and heaters and making coffee for six withthree cups to drink from, they all settled down again. For a long time there wassilence except for the tinny sound of the radio. Jessica sat down next to Jason.“Do you mind if I sit here with you?” she asked softly.A smile appeared on Jason’s sweaty, dirt-smeared face. “I think I could toleratethat.” He put his good arm around her shoulders, and pulled her close. Jasonnever would have imagined that he could feel this peaceful and content whileknowing he was almost certainly about to die. Jessica laid her head on hisshoulder and he felt her tears soaking into his shirt. image [../Images/image00256.jpeg] BETSY sat off to the side of the stage, out of view of the cameras, ready tohear the inaugural speech she knew almost by heart. Only a few hours earlier thedecision had been made, due to fairly severe-sounding weather forecasts, to havethe address indoors. Now, after quite a bit of hectic re-planning andrearranging, things were ready to begin. Nearly every member of Congress was inattendance in the giant, grandiose hall, and the gallery beyond them was packedtight with people who had no doubt come from all over the country to witnessthis historic event.Grant Collins strode up to the podium. This was the moment of glory they hadboth worked so hard for. Just a few weeks ago, she had looked forward to thismoment with great anticipation. Now she felt the excitement trying to sweep heraway, and she resisted it. She knew the truth now. The presidency was everythingto Grant. He was willing to throw away truth, justice, and innocent human livesto achieve that goal, as so many others had done before him. She had wanted somuch to believe he was different.Grant gripped the podium, and for a moment just stared into space. All eyes wereriveted on him. Then he stepped around the podium and walked up to the very edgeof the stage. Betsy saw the cameramen far back in the room suddenly adjust theircameras to follow Grant. She glanced back at him, confused, knowing he couldn’tpossibly read the teleprompter from there. What was he doing? He folded hishands in front of him, straightened his posture and lifted his head.“I lied to get elected.” There was no shame or apology in the tone of his voice.A murmur began in the room, and for a moment Grant said nothing more. Betsy hadbeen all ready to hear that finely polished inaugural speech, and this certainlywasn’t it.“Of course,” Grant continued, holding up his hand to silence the crowd, “lyingto get elected doesn’t make me any different from anyone else who has acquired aposition of power in this government.” Betsy scanned the faces of thecongressmen, many of whom were now whispering among themselves. There were somelooks of anger, some of nervousness, and some of complete bafflement. The wordshe was saying did not compute. It didn’t sound like a joke, nor did it soundlike a confession. What was Grant doing?“I didn’t come here to talk to these crooks,” Grant said with a dismissive waveof his hand toward the hundreds of senators and representatives before him. Thenhe pointed up toward the TV cameras and civilian spectators in the back of theroom. “I came here with a message for you.” At this there was much clamor andmovement among the congressmen, but given the situation, it seemed that none ofthem dared to stand up or openly protest.“All politicians lie,” Grant continued. “You know that. But there is somethingvery different about me, and something very different about today.” He pausedagain for a moment, scanning the faces before him. “You see, every otherpolitician lies, and promises to take care of you, and fight for you, and giveyou goodies, in order to trick you into giving him power. But despite the nobleintentions they put on for show, all politicians have only one goal: to be theones holding the reins of this control machine.”Betsy didn’t dare to believe what she was hearing. Was this really happening?Grant was always good at using attention-grabbing tricks, but this didn’t seemlike a trick. He spoke now, not in the usual pompous, elitist politician tone,but like a man who meant what he was saying.“Well, not me,” he continued. “Unlike everyone else who holds high office here,I didn’t climb my way here—with all the usual lies, empty promises, backroomdeals, and other scheming—in order to acquire power for myself.” For a moment,Betsy thought maybe he would segue into a sermon about “honest government.” Butthen he went on. “No, I didn’t come here to seize the power for myself. I camehere to destroy it.”At this, the entire room broke into a murmur. “Shut up,” came Grant’s boomingbut controlled voice, and the noise level in the room dropped to almost nothing.“I have a few things to tell you that you probably aren’t going to want to hear.Shut up and listen.”A brief giggle involuntarily burst out of Betsy’s mouth. This was unbelievable.Not exactly presidential, she thought, but she was starting to enjoy herself.“Fourteen years ago,” the President continued, “a friend of mine bet me twomillion dollars that I couldn’t become a U.S. senator. And when this guy bet twomillion dollars, he meant it. We had always talked about whether it was possibleto infiltrate this little tyrannical club called the United States government,and strangle the abomination from the inside. He said it wasn’t; I said it was.Five years later, I was a state senator in Pennsylvania, running for UnitedStates Congress.” He paused and looked down at his feet. “That’s when I heardthat my friend had been murdered.” He paused again. “You see, my friend wasfighting tyranny from the outside, which is a dangerous thing to do. He wasusing his connections and his money to expose the political crooks of this townfor what they are. Needless to say, the control freaks here didn’t take kindlyto that. So the FBI made up a false charge, and when they went to get my friend,he wouldn’t surrender. So they killed him.” His expression was determined andunflinching. “It didn’t make the news.”“After that, I kept going with the bet, not for the money anymore, but for myfriend. I swore to myself, even if it took the patience of Job, that I would getso deep into the beast that I could reach its heart. And here I am.” He held hisarms wide, and the murmur began again. This time he ignored it.“To get right to the point,” he went on, letting his arms drop to his sides,“this thing you call government, this god that you pray to, to solve all theproblems in your life, this pretended protector and savior, this stinking heapof anti-human oppression that you so eagerly subjugate yourselves to—if anythingwas ever the epitome of pure evil, this is it. Trouble is, most of you are toostupid to see it. You still worship it, pay tribute to it, and allow it to chainyou, shackle you, control you, and monitor you. Instead of thinking foryourselves, you’re constantly clamoring for some new leader to save and protectyou. Your cowardice and irresponsibility built this monster. It commands, andyou obey, like good little slaves. And worst of all, you hold up your unthinkingobedience as a virtue; you believe it makes you good people. It doesn’t. Itmakes you stupid robots.”Betsy’s attention was on the rows and rows of representatives, many of whom werenow looking around the room nervously; a few were trying to be discreet whilefrantically whispering into their cell phones, and two or three looked as ifthey were about to walk out.“Well, I’m here to rudely foist freedom upon you, whether you want it or not.I’m going to tell you things you don’t want to hear. I’m going to do things youdon’t want me to do. You don’t have to worry too much, however, because I won’tbe in office long, and once I’m gone, I’m sure most of you will scramble backinto slavery and government-worship as quickly as you possibly can. You’lleagerly flock to the next lying politician who promises to take care of you,throw away your freedom to the next political con man who promises you security.And you will reap the rewards of your own ignorance. I can’t save you from youraddiction to subservience, and I don’t intend to try.”“But there are some of us, however few, who actually want freedom, who wouldrather face an uncertain world as responsible adults than live as slaves in acage. And now we’re going to do it. As for the rest of you, all you have to dois stay out of our way. If you insist on putting shackles on yourselves, be myguest. But you will no longer put them on those of us who choose to be free.”“Now it’s time for a little irony. You believe that by pushing buttons in votingbooths, you give certain people the right to rule you. In reality, I have nomore right to rule any of you now than I did yesterday. I’m still only human.Yet, for some reason, you accept it as undeniable gospel that governments havethe right to rule you, that the Constitution gives moral permission for theseliars and thieves to meddle in your lives,” he said, gesturing at thecongressmen sitting in front of him. “You accept that they own you, and have theright to take what you produce, to tell you what you may and may not do, and totell you what you must do. You refuse to see the truth: that neitherconstitutions nor voting booths nor legislative rituals can give anyone theright to rule you. You own yourselves, but most of you don’t even want to. Youfeel more comfortable being the property of politicians. Well, now I’m going touse your blind faith in this enslavement system against you.”From the expressions she saw in the crowd, Betsy knew that at that point, manyof the politicians there would have loved nothing more than to forcibly dragGrant off the stage, and if he was anyone other than the President of the UnitedStates, they probably would have done it.“As newly elected Chief Executive Officer of this bizarre power cult,” Grantwent on, “my first act will be to sign these pieces of paper.” He walked over tothe lectern, leaned down behind it, and brought out a bunch of papers and heldthem above his head. “By the power vested in me by your insane belief inauthority,” he said, setting the papers on the lectern and writing on them, “Iam hereby firing every employee of the IRS, the ATF, the DEA, the TSA, the CIA,the NSA, the ICE, most of the FBI, and a bunch of other federal agencies, someof which you’ve never even heard of. These executive orders are all perfectlylegal, for those of you who believe in that sort of thing.” A confused murmurarose again in the crowd. Some faces were openly angry, many were confused, butBetsy noticed, with some surprise, one elderly congressman grinning widely.“While we’re at it,” he continued, leaning down and hoisting a huge box frombehind the lectern, letting it slam onto the floor in front of him, “here are amillion or so presidential pardons, for all those now in federal prison for taxcrimes, or on drug charges, or weapons charges—basically, anyone who’s beenlocked up for a victimless crime, which includes most federal inmates. I’ll besigning all of these in the coming days.” The murmur rose to a dull roar. “Shutup,” Grant boomed. “I’m not finished.” image [../Images/image00252.jpeg] JESSICA sat in stunned silence as the fading lamplight lit the other fiveshining, sweaty faces around the damp cellar.All eyes were wide, mouths open, as the small group listened to the newPresident addressing the nation.“It’s pathetic how you people still imagine this to be a free country.” Thevoice was slightly distorted, and accompanied by significant white noise, butwas easy enough to understand. “There’s hardly a single thing or activity leftin this country that the parasites haven’t gotten their tentacles into. Youcan’t lift a finger without government permission, and without them taking acut. The kid who sells lemonade in his front yard is breaking half a dozendifferent laws. You can’t produce anything, sell anything, trade anything orbuild anything, without paying fee after fee, jumping through hoop after hoop,filling out this form and that form, getting this license and that permit, goingthrough all the inspections, groveling before regulators, and then hoping thatwhatever moronic bureaucrat you end up with decides to give you his holypermission to do what you had the God-given right to do to begin with. And youcall yourselves free?”“God, is this for real?” Doug whispered, and was instantly shushed by everyoneelse in the room. The voice on the radio continued.“U.S.A.! We’re number one!” came the voice from the radio, in an obviouslymocking tone. “Hooray for the pathetic, washed-up, hypocritical, falling-apartslave state that is the United States of America. Exactly what is it about thissheep pasture that you think is still worth celebrating? What the hell do youthink that flag represents anymore? What the hell are you proud of? Proud tolive in the country with the most intrusive, obnoxious, abusive tax collectorsin the world? Proud to live in a country that has a higher percentage of peoplein prison than any other country in the world? Proud to be ruled by a governmentthat has started and perpetuated more military conflicts in more areas of theworld than any other in history? Proud to live in a country where thepoliticians and bankers have seen to it that you, your children, and yourchildren’s children will forever be their indentured servants, to be foreverherded and fleeced like sheep? Proud to live in a country where the biggestslimeballs on the planet tell you what you can eat, what you can drink, what youcan drive, what you can build, where you can work, what you can produce, andwhat you can think?”“Did you know about this, David?” asked Jason.“No, of course not. Be quiet,” came the response. The radio voice went on.“When July Fourth rolls around, and you’re all swigging your beer and wavingyour flags, does the fact that we are infinitely less free than we ever wereunder British rule ever make its way into what’s left of your brains? Hooray,the land of the free, where half of what you earn gets swiped by politicians;where you fall for every crisis the liars in D.C. throw at you. They createproblem after problem—war, recession, terrorism, poverty, crime, disease,environmental disaster—and you are such well-trained sheep that time and timeagain, you demand your own enslavement as the solution. Two hundred years ago,Benjamin Franklin told you that those who would choose temporary security overessential liberty deserve neither. Well, you did, and now you have neither, andit’s just what you deserve. You looked to the biggest crooks in the world to beyour all-powerful saviors, and now you are paying the price.”“I know first hand how easy you are to deceive and manipulate. You elected mebecause I pitched the same lies all the parasites in this town do, only I did itmore convincingly, and with a slightly slicker presentation. I promised to saveyou from the economic depression that the government caused. I promised to saveyou from the wars that the government caused. I promised to save you from thecrime that the government caused. I promised to save you from the terrorism thatthe government caused. I promised you, if you would just accept me as yourmaster and give me control of your lives, that I would save you from all thescary things you could imagine, real or made-up. I used the same lies anddeceptions that every politician does; I just did it a little better than theothers this time. And while I was duping you, I was also convincing the powersthat be, the people who run this whole show behind the scenes, that I would makea good stooge for them, that I would be a good puppet and dance to their tune.Otherwise, I never would have even been on the ballot.”“You voted for me because it comforts you to have someone tell you that ifyou’ll only bow to him and give him unlimited power, he will make all yourproblems go away. That is the lie you always fall for: that if you just find theright leader, he can make the world a safe, happy place. But that is never theirintention, and that is never what they do. They make the world a scary,dangerous place, to ensure that you will forever remain dependent upon them andtheir so-called solutions. And you keep applauding them as they commit the worstof atrocities based on what they say are the best of motives.”“And what about you, my fellow Americans? What are your motives? You pretendthat the things you ask of government, you ask from the best of intentions. Youonly want to feed the poor, to protect the innocent, to punish the wicked. Or soyou say. But if your intentions are indeed so pure and noble, why is it that youfail to notice the damage done by the government’s so-called solutions? Haven’tyou noticed what government welfare has done to the poor, reducing millions ofpeople to stupid, empty shells, without purpose and without hope? Haven’t younoticed that the government schools crank out millions of ignorant kids whoseone lasting talent is the ability to mindlessly do as they’re told? Haven’t younoticed that the government’s economic solutions, from socialist redistributionto the fraudulent banking system and its fake money, have impoverished thisonce-prosperous nation? Haven’t you noticed that everything the governmenttouches turns to shit? If your motives are pure, why have you not noticed thatevery time you entrust these challenges to rulers and masters, they end upenslaving the poor, oppressing the innocent, and empowering the wicked? Are youjust profoundly unobservant, or is it something worse than that? Could it bethat your desire to help others and to fix society is outweighed by your desireto escape the uncertainties and responsibilities of living life as a free humanbeing? Is that why you keep voting for whoever pretends he can save you fromreality and magically save you from whatever the future might hold? Why elsewould you continue to fall for the patently ridiculous lies that all of thepoliticians keep telling?”“In your lifetime, every election has been nothing more than that: a contest tochoose the better liar. None of them ever meant a word they said. They all hadone goal: to rule you. But you never caught on. They kept feeding you a choicebetween two slimeball crooks, one colored red and one colored blue, and you keptproving that you were too stupid to see through the scam. You kept advocatingyour own enslavement, unable to comprehend the possibility that you might havethe power to do something other than just choosing one of two tyrants to runyour lives. Let me make this perfectly clear: if you voted for me—or for myopponent—you’re a gullible idiot. You fell for the same tyrant tricks that themegalomaniacs of the world have been using for thousands of years.”“And I’m not expecting to talk you out of your illusions here. These days I’d bemore likely to get converts out of a herd of lemmings than out of the Americanpublic. No, I’m not here to stop you from enslaving yourselves. I’m here to stopyou from enslaving that miniscule minority of Americans who still understandwhat freedom is, and who still yearn for it. Amazingly, despite the constantauthoritarian indoctrination cranked out by the so-called education system andthe media in this country, there are still a few people here who value freedom.You’ve heard of them. They’re the people you love to despise and insult. They’rethe kooks, the extremists, the people who won’t get with the program or go withthe flow. They’re the black sheep, whom you look upon with scorn for wanting tostep out of the shearing line. They don’t fit in. They’re the lunatic fringe.They’re not like you.”“No, they’re not like you. They dare to state the truth. You don’t. They canthink, and you can’t. Every inch of progress in history has been their doing,and they’ve had to constantly fight upstream against all the insults,condemnation, and outright violence which the dull-witted majority, made up ofpeople like you, has thrown at them. They ended slavery, while people like yousat idle. No, it wasn’t that fascist, Lincoln.They put an end to women being treated like animals, while people like youcalled them names. They spoke out against the injustices of regime after regime,while the supposedly good citizens just quietly did as they were told. Theyresisted the war-mongering, of this country and countless others, while peoplelike you either condoned or turned a blind eye to mass murder. They putthemselves in harm’s way for the sake of truth and justice, while people likeyou quietly avoided making waves. No, they are not like you, those extremistsand radicals. They have taken on the responsibility of being human beings, whileyou have remained content to be stupid animals.”In the dimness of the cellar, all eyes had been glued to the radio, as if therewas something to see there. Jessica glanced over at David. His head was bowedand his eyes were closed, a smile on his face and tears rolling down his cheeks.For the first time in what seemed like forever, she felt a twinge of hope. image [../Images/image00251.jpeg] JASON had just heard the President of the United States fire him, and everyother ATF agent. Did this mean they might get out of there alive after all? Hetried to picture the other agents out there— how were they reacting to this?Would they all just give up and go away? Or were some of them too juiced-up andbent on revenge to accept the President’s order? He wasn’t ready to believe thatit was safe to come out of hiding, but just then, the possibility that he mightlive to take Jessica out for lunch or a movie seemed overwhelmingly wonderful.Just minutes before, he hadn’t dared to hope for even such a simple thing. Buthe also hardly dared to believe what he heard coming out of that old radio onits cinderblock stand.“You glorify people such as Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, BenjaminFranklin and Patrick Henry,” the voice on the radio continued. “But have youever read a word they said? They were all too authoritarian for my liking, butby today’s standards they were anti-government extremist terrorists. Theyadvocated breaking the law. They said that when a government infringes on therights of the individual, the people have a right and a duty to do whatever ittakes, even if that means bloody revolution, to get rid of that government.Would anyone like to claim that the government we now have is a protector, not aviolator, of individual rights? The Founders taught how important it is for thepeople to remain armed, and to always retain the ability to forcibly overthrowthe government if it becomes oppressive. Those kooks, wackos, and extremiststhat we call our Founding Fathers committed treason, advocating violent, illegalresistance against their own government, the British Crown. And over what? A fewpuny little excise taxes on tea and pieces of paper.”“And what have you done with the country they gave you? Today you tolerate alevel of oppression and intrusion far beyond King George’s wildest dreams, yetyou cannot even imagine engaging in passive resistance, much less forciblerevolution, in defense of your own freedom. The bravest thing you’ll ever do iswalk into a booth every few years, where no one can see you, and press a button,to say which of two slave-masters you’d rather be owned by. And when someradical does suggest that it’s time to grow a spine and resist this heinousempire, you all rush to be the first to condemn that person. Like well-trainedslaves, you take pride in your subservience and obedience, while despising thosefew who have the will to try to escape the plantation, or worse yet, tooverthrow the master. If the Founders could see you today, they’d be ashamed ofyou for the opportunity you threw away, the freedom they won for you which youhave so thoroughly squandered. Samuel Adams might as well have been talking toall of you when he said, ʻIf ye love wealth better than liberty, thetranquillity of servitude than the animating contest of freedom, go from us inpeace; we ask not your counsels or arms; crouch down and lick the hands whichfeed you. May your chains sit lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that yewere our countrymen’.”Jason looked around the room. In the dim lantern light he saw alert, attentiveexpressions on all of the faces around him.“Land of the free and home of the brave?” came the voice from the radio.“Hardly. You are a nation of enslaved cowards, afraid to act, afraid even tothink. You keep telling yourselves that you, the American people, areindependent, strong, brave, and free. You are none of the above. Again, I don’texpect one speech to change your narrow minds, but before you put your headsback in your rear ends—before you switch the channel to some inane trashapproved by the Ministry of Truth, guaranteed to keep you distracted andstupid—I have something to say, and you had better listen close.”It still didn’t seem real to Jason. The tinny little sound of that radio,compared to the larger-than-life devastation, death and destruction he had seenfirst hand—it couldn’t be real.“Some of us still love freedom,” the President said. “Some of us believe thatevery person belongs to himself. We don’t belong to your stupid collective or toyour crooked politicians, and we don’t need your permission or legislation fromyour masters to be free. We don’t care what you think. We don’t care what thisbunch of dishonest jackasses sitting in front of me thinks.”It suddenly occurred to Jason that this rant was happening right in front ofCongress, and he tried in vain to imagine how they were reacting to all of this.“We feel no need to refute the government worship that you imagine to be learnedopinions,” the President continued. “We’re done asking you to let us be free.I’m here to tell you, we will be free. And if you want to parrot back therhetoric you’ve been fed all your lives, about how society can’t exist withoutrulers, about how there would be death, destruction and mayhem if no one wascontrolling all of us, you go right ahead. Predict doom and gloom until you’reblue in the face. Tell us it can’t be done all you’d like. And if time provesyou right, you can feel smug in your little cages while you say, ʻTold ya so.’Or, if time proves us right, as it will, you can watch the second great Americanexperiment from a safe distance, and see what humanity could be, without mastersand slaves and the false gods you now bow to.”Jason’s mind was still a bit on the defensive, suspiciously watching out for thetypes of cunning propaganda designed to justify lawlessness, the types ofrhetoric used by cult leaders to dupe the ignorant. While this renegadepresident was probably saving Jason’s life, that didn’t mean he had to agreewith him. He felt as if he was floundering in a sea of unfamiliar ideas.Whenever he thought he’d found something solid to stand on, a wave came andwashed it away. He’d lost count of the times since he’d been here that hethought one of David’s ideas was ridiculous, only to discover, on closerexamination, that it made a lot of sense.He’d heard Grant Collins speak before, and he always sounded good. Jason wasn’tmuch into politics; he just knew that Collins was a big supporter of lawenforcement. But Collins sounded different now. He didn’t sound like apolitician manipulating public opinion, but like a real man honestly expressingdeeply held convictions. And, as much as Jason resisted admitting it, even tohimself, it felt like the truth—an honest, raw truth he had never heard spokenaloud before.“You wave your flags and give lip service to freedom, but you wouldn’t knowfreedom if it slapped you in the face. In fact, it did slap you in the face, andyou called it a terrorist cult, and demanded that it be stamped out. Do you seethis symbol? You were told it’s the insignia of a terrorist cult, and despitethe fact that the truth was one book-read away, most of you just believed whatyou were told.”“He’s talking about your book,” Doug said to David in an excited whisper.“This symbol is nothing more than a way of expressing a very simple, butprofoundly important, concept: I, the one displaying this symbol, understandthat I own myself, and that you own yourself. It’s that simple. My life, andeverything I do with my life, belongs to me, as yours does to you. We are freehuman beings, not domesticated animals. We do not acknowledge anyone’s right toown us or to rule us, and likewise, we claim no right to own or rule over anyoneelse. That’s all it means.”“And, contrary to what you were told, this image does not represent somemonolithic cult, where everyone believes the same thing about everything. It’sabout understanding one simple, basic truth of humanity, on top of whatever elsesomeone happens to believe: that it’s wrong to start a fight; that it’s wrong tobe the one to first use force, even if you hide it under the label ofʻgovernment.’ And that simple belief can be held by all sorts of differentpeople with all sorts of different viewpoints, from goth punks, to hippie flowerchildren, to conservative Christians, or to any average Joe, and to everyone inbetween. That’s the reason for the many colors on the design. Freedom doesn’trequire us all to be the same. Instead, it allows us all to coexist peacefullywithout being the same. You don’t have to agree with everyone else oneverything; you don’t have to like everyone else. I know I don’t. All you mustdo, to be a piece of the Iron Web, is acknowledge that each person owns himself,and that it is wrong to initiate force or fraud against him, no matter what youthink of his religion, his culture, his race, his intelligence, his age, hisbehavioral choices, his income level, his hairdo, his taste in music, oranything else. We view and treat each other as adult human beings, eachresponsible for his actions, each obligated to judge right and wrong forhimself. We detest the alternative: the giant daycare center that so many of youseem to prefer, where a bunch of whimpering brats whine about their ʻneeds’ anddemand preferential treatment based on some twisted, delusional notion ofʻfairness,’ while at the same time begging the nanny to punish the kids theydon’t like.”“You evade your responsibility as human beings by hallucinating a false god thatrelieves you of the duty to think for yourselves. You don’t want to be free,because being merely obedient requires so much less thought. And so you demandto be ruled, you insist on being enslaved. Then you beg your masters to pleasebe nice to you. Pathetic. Well, some of us have outgrown such schizophrenicinsanity. Some of us realize the self-evident truth that no election, noconstitution, no legislation, and no other pseudo-religious political ritual canbestow upon anyone the right to rule another. Nothing can make a man into arightful master; nothing can make a man into a rightful slave.”Jason turned to look at Jessica’s face. She was smiling now, and her eyes wereshining with hope. Doug got up and went to the entrance. He went up a couple ofsteps and pushed the debris away from the entrance hole. The sunlight of a clearday flooded through the gap, lighting up six dirty but hopeful faces.“Using violence against someone who has committed no force or fraud is wrong,”came the voice from the radio. “What could be more self-evident than that? Somepeople call the concept ʻlibertarianism.’ I have another term for it: statingthe bleeding obvious. It’s wrong to start a fight. You can call the aggressorsʻgovernment,’ you can pretend that they represent us all, you can whine aboutthe common good, you can label the bullies ʻlaw enforcers,’ and you can calltheir violence ʻlaw,’ or ʻregulation,’ or ʻtaxation,’ or whatever you like. It’sstill wrong, and some of us have been trying to explain this to you forcenturies. Guess which extremist fringe kook terrorist said this: Quote:Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limitsdrawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add ʻwithin the limitsof the law’ because law is often but the tyrant’s will, and always so when itviolates the rights of the individual. End quote. Imagine that: you can dowhatever you want, as long as you let other people do what they want. Howextreme. Thomas Jefferson was the radical who said that. He also wrote, in theDeclaration of Independence—maybe you’ve heard of it—that when a governmentbecomes destructive of individual liberty, the people have the right, and theduty, to alter or abolish that government. So, how many of you have lifted afinger to resist the federal leviathan? Or are you still telling yourselves thatthe United States government is pro-freedom? How long will you tell yourselvesthat lie?”“Even those of you who consider yourselves rebels, most of you seem to thinkthat acting obnoxious and rude qualifies you as nonconformists, yet you end upas nothing more than useful puppets of the establishment you rail against. Fromthe hippies of the sixties, to the eighties punks with pierced noses and purplehair, to the so-called revolutionaries of today, generation after generation ofhip, cool rebels have whined about the status quo, only to turn around andembrace the old, heinous evil of communism, just because it came in a newpackage. Under the labels of ʻsocial justice’ and ʻeconomic equality,’ you pitchthe same sick, twisted, vicious collectivist oppression implemented by Stalin,Lenin, Mao and Castro. Only you’re too ignorant to know it. Even when you cansee the evils of a particular regime, you can’t escape the mindset of authorityworship. Your solution is always to find a new, kinder, wiser master. It neveroccurs to you that there is no such thing, and can be no such thing, as a goodslave-master. It never occurs to you to get rid of the tyrannical master of theday and replace him with nothing—to yank the despotic king off the throne and toput no one in his place—to leave the throne empty. And so, when the people tiredof that delusional, god-complex, collectivist, war-mongering lying thief GeorgeBush Sr., they replaced him with Bill Clinton, a delusional, god-complex,collectivist, war-mongering lying thief. And when they got tired of him, aftereight years, they put in yet another tyrannical Bush—this one worse than thefirst—for eight more years. Even the spectacle of having to choose between JohnMcHitler and Barack Ostalin in 2008 wasn’t enough to shake the American peopleout of their blind faith in the cult of democracy.”“A long time ago, Lysander Spooner explained that a man is no less a slavesimply because he is allowed to occasionally choose a new master. But you didn’tlisten. You still believe that your precious right to vote means that you arefree. It doesn’t. It means only that your masters have found a way to trick youinto not resisting, by giving you the illusion that you have some say in whatthey do.”“H.L. Mencken told you that the urge to save mankind is almost always a frontfor the urge to rule, but you didn’t listen. Time after time, crooks have posedas saviors, and you kept falling for it. Louis Brandeis, when he wasn’trubber-stamping the politicians’ socialist agenda, warned that we should be moston guard to protect our liberties when the government’s purposes are beneficent.But you weren’t listening. Every new goodie, every promise to give something tothe needy, to help this or that group, to save the economy—you fall for themall, hook, line and sinker. Two thousand years ago, even Plato gave the warning,saying that every tyrant, when he first appears, is a protector. But you weren’tlistening.”“Alexis de Tocqueville warned that the American Republic would survive untilCongress realized it could bribe the people with their own money. But you didn’tlisten. You still vote for whatever con man promises you the most pork, the besthandouts, the most goodies, all of which are paid for with money he stole fromyou in the first place. Likewise, you weren’t listening when Frederic Bastiatwarned you that government is the great fiction, through which everyone tries tolive at the expense of everyone else.”“Frederick Douglass, a former slave, explained that no man can put a chainaround the ankle of his fellow man without eventually finding the other endfastened to his own neck. But you weren’t listening. You all clamor to see whocan be first to beg government to impose all manner of laws and rules upon yourneighbors, and in the process you end up advocating your own enslavement. Mr.Douglass also explained that whatever level of injustice and wrong people willquietly submit to is exactly the level that will be imposed upon them. But youweren’t listening.”“Edmund Burke proclaimed that all that is necessary for evil to triumph is forgood people to do nothing. You’ve probably even heard that one, but you stilldidn’t listen. Albert Einstein put it another way, saying that the world is adangerous place to live, not because of the evil people, but because of thepeople who don’t do anything about it. But you weren’t listening. What have youdone to resist the evils you see in the world, or even in your own country? Hidein a corner to avoid trouble? Keep your head down and try not to make waves?Sophie Scholl, member of the White Rose, an underground group in Germany whichspoke out against the Nazis, described the situation quite well. The realdamage, she explained, is done by the millions of people who just want tosurvive, the honest men who just want to be left in peace, who don’t want theirlittle lives disturbed by anything bigger than themselves, who don’t want tomake waves or make enemies. Sophie and her friends had their heads chopped offfor daring to say such things, while the hordes of compliant cowards in Germanydid nothing. And are you any different from them? You people who live in theland of the free and the home of the brave, when have you lifted a finger tooppose the injustice you see? Or have you even noticed it? Are you so busygetting along and doing what you’re told that you can still imagine this to be afree country? Have you not noticed the trillions of dollars the American tyrantssteal every year? Have you not noticed the millions of non-violent people whonow live as captives behind razor-wire fences? Have you not noticed the hundredsof thousands of people abroad they have exterminated? Have you not noticed theirtentacles creeping into every aspect of your lives? Have you been wearing yourblinders for so long that you can’t see what’s going on all around you? As JohnHay pointed out, and as millions of people have learned the hard way, the evilsof tyranny are rarely seen except by those who resist it. Do you think the factthat you personally haven’t gotten into trouble yet, because you’re too much ofa chicken-shit to even rattle your own cage door, means that you’re free?”“Martin Luther King Jr., when he wasn’t falling for collectivist propaganda,explained that true peace is not the absence of violence, but the presence ofjustice. But you weren’t listening. You look around, and you don’t see the openstrife and violent conflict that exists in many other countries, and youinterpret that to mean that we have peace and freedom here. It means nothing ofthe sort. It means only that most of the victims of oppression here aren’tresisting it. And that is not a sign that you are strong and free; it is a signthat you are weak and cowardly. When the peasants quietly do as they’re told,the violence underlying all government remains hidden. It is only resistancethat brings it out into the open. The master doesn’t need to whip the obedientslaves, but that doesn’t mean those slaves are free.”“For millennia, radicals have been trying to tell you that as a human being, youwere born to be free, that your rights do not come from any law or anygovernment, and that it is your right and duty to preserve liberty for yourself,to allow others their freedom, and to never let the schemes and deceptions ofwould-be tyrants fool you into choosing the predictable, secure life of a cagedanimal over the uncertain, challenging life of a human being. But you didn’tlisten. Well, some of us are tired of trying to get you to listen. We’re notgoing to ask you to let us be free anymore. You can continue to choose slaveryfor yourselves if you wish, but we choose freedom.”By silent agreement, the group had slowly and quietly moved outside into theclearing, still listening to the radio, which David carried out. The ground wasstill damp, but the sunshine was warm. Doug brought out the M1 Garand and placedit within easy reach; apparently he also had some doubts about all the agentspacking up and going home without a fuss.Jason leaned back against a tree trunk, exhausted. He guessed he was going toneed some antibiotics after all. image [../Images/image00256.jpeg] BETSY continued to stare in amazement at Grant. As if it corresponded to hisshedding of his official, presidential persona, he had shed his tie and suitjacket while talking. Around thirty congressmen had actually walked out. Thosewho remained were now sitting, completely dumbfounded, without moving ortalking. Grant began to unbutton his dress shirt, as if just for comfort. Theaudience watched in fascination as he worked his way down to the last button,finally opening the shirt to reveal a black T-shirt beneath bearing therainbow-colored symbol of the Iron Web.“Here’s the deal,” he continued, in a relaxed, down-to-earth tone of voice, “interms even Joe Six-Pack can understand. So as to not upset your little cages ofdependency and delusion, those of us who actually like freedom will be formingsmall communities across this country. And this symbol will tell you who weare,” he said, holding open his dress shirt to display the symbol underneath.“If you believe in the divine right of politicians, stay away from us. If yousend your thugs after us, we will not take you to court, and we will not try tovote different people into your ‘government’ cult. Instead, we will exercise ourright of self-defense. Not only will we use whatever force it takes to repel theaggressors you send at us, but we will also hunt down and execute whicheverso-called ‘legislators’ gave them the order to initiate violence against us.Yes, you heard me right. If you leave us alone, we’ll leave you alone. Whereveryou see this symbol, keep your tax collectors, your regulators, your cops, yourinspectors—and every other brand of parasitic bureaucrat your statist machinecranks out—away from us. That’s all you have to do. And if you do that, you havenothing to fear from us.”Betsy could hardly believe what was happening. How could she have not knownabout this, or at least suspected it, when she thought she knew Grant so well?How could he have hidden this from her so well and for so long? Although shefelt a hint of hurt at his deception, it was overwhelmed by a feeling ofvindication. He really was different. In fact, more different than she had everimagined. Some of what he said made her uneasy, even scared. It was so faroutside anything she had ever even thought about that she could hardly evenprocess it. If not for Sandy throwing radical ideas at her for the last year orso—and even her ideas seemed moderate compared to this—Betsy wondered whethershe would have understood what Grant was saying at all.“When I leave this stage,” he continued, after taking a sip of water from aglass hidden inside the lectern, “and you desperately try to recapture yourdelusional little worlds of obedience and conformity, I will be heading out toGraveston. And since, by Executive Order, I just fired every employee of the FBIand ATF, I will personally shoot any jackboots who are too stupid to leavebefore I and my friends get there. As some of you know, I was in the Marines. Ihave since lost my penchant for blindly following orders, but I have not lost mycombat skills, nor have the people who will be coming with me. Whether or notanyone inside is still alive, anyone I see in the area wearing a governmentuniform I will shoot on sight.”Grant gripped the podium, paused for a moment, looking up into the ceilinglights. Then he lowered and shook his head.“You cannot begin to imagine in how many ways the world is the opposite of whatyou have been taught to believe.” His voice was very low now, but amplified soeveryone could hear it. “You see the guy who sells drugs to willing customers sohe can feed his family as the scum of the earth, while you see the hypocrite whogives away stolen money in the name of government as a saint. You see the guywho tries to avoid being robbed by the federal thugs as a crook and a tax cheat,but see as virtuous the politician who gives away the same stolen loot to peopleto whom it does not belong. You see the cop as a good guy when he drags a manaway from his friends and family and throws him in prison for ten years forsmoking a leaf, and you see anyone who defends himself from such barbaricfascism as the lowest form of life—a cop-killer. In reality, most drug dealersare more virtuous than any government social worker, and prostitutes have farless to be ashamed of than political whores, because they trade only with whatis rightfully theirs, and only with those who want to trade with them. Theupstanding, church-going, law-abiding, tax-paying citizen who votes Democrat orRepublican is far more despicable, and a bigger threat to humanity, than themost promiscuous, lazy, drug-snorting hippie. Why? Because the hippie is willingto let others be free, and the voter is not. The damage done to society by badhabits and loose morality is nothing compared to the damage done to society bythe self-righteous violence committed in the name of the state.”“You imagine yourselves to be charitable and tolerant, when you are nothing ofthe sort. Even the Nazis had table manners and proper etiquette when theyweren’t killing people. You think you’re good people because you say ‘please’and ‘thank you’? You think sitting in that big building on Sunday makes younoble and righteous? The difference between you and a common thief is that thethief has the honesty to commit the crime himself, while you whine forgovernment to do your stealing for you. The difference between you and thestreet thug is that the thug is open about the violence he commits, while youlet others forcibly control your neighbors on your behalf. You advocate theft,harassment, assault, and even murder, but accept no responsibility for doing so.You old folks want the government to steal from your kids so you can get yourmonthly check. You parents want all your neighbors to be robbed to pay for yourkids’ schooling. You all vote for whichever crook promises to steal money fromother people to pay for what you want. You demand that those people who engagein behaviors you don’t approve of be dragged off and locked up, but feel noguilt for the countless lives your whims have destroyed. You even call thegovernment thugs your ‘representatives,’ and yet you never take responsibilityfor the evil they commit. You proudly support the troops as they kill whomeverthe liars in D.C. tell them to kill, and you feel good about it.”“You call yourselves Christians, or Jews, or claim to follow some otherreligion, but the truth is, what you call your religion is emptywindow-dressing. What you truly worship, the god you really bow to, what youreally believe in, is the state. ‘Thou shalt not steal.’ ‘Thou shalt notmurder.’ Unless you can do it by way of government. Then it’s just fine, isn’tit? If you call it ‘taxation’ and ‘war,’ it stops being a sin, right? After all,it was only your god that said you shouldn’t steal and murder, but the statesaid it was okay. It’s pretty obvious which one outranks the other in yourminds. Despite all the churches, synagogues, and mosques we see around us, thisnation has one god, and only one god, and that god is called ‘government’.”“Jesus taught nonviolence, and told you to love your neighbor, but the stateencourages you to vote for people who will use the violence of government tobutt into every aspect of everyone else’s life. Which do you believe? To thoseabout to stone a woman who had committed adultery, Jesus said, ‘Let him who iswithout sin cast the first stone.’ But the state says it’s perfectly fine tolock someone up if they do something you find distasteful, such as prostitution.Which do you believe? The Christian God says, ‘Thou shalt not covet.’ Butcoveting is the lifeblood of the beast that is the state. You are taught toresent, despise, and hate anyone who has anything you don’t have. You clamor forthe state to tear other people down, steal their property, and give it to you.And you call that ‘fairness.’ The Bible calls it ‘coveting’ and ‘stealing’.”“You are not Christians. You are not Jews. You are not Muslims. And youcertainly aren’t atheists. You all have the same god, and its name is‘government.’ You’re all members of the most evil, insane, destructive cult inhistory. If there ever was a devil, the state is it. And you worship it with allyour heart and soul. You pray to it to solve every problem, to satisfy all yourneeds, to smite your enemies and to shower its blessings upon you. You worshipwhat Nietzsche called ‘the coldest of all cold monsters’ and you hate those ofus who don’t. To you, the greatest sin is disobeying your god—‘breaking thelaw,’ you call it—as if anyone could possibly have any moral obligation to obeythe arbitrary commands and demands of the corrupt, lying, delusionalmegalomaniacs who infest this despicable town.”Betsy scanned the faces of the congressmen. Most had their eyes downcast, someseemed to be mumbling to themselves, and a few looked almost comatose withshock.“Even your ministers, priests and rabbis, more often than not, are traitors totheir own religions, teaching that the commands of human ‘authority’ shouldsupersede adherence to the laws of the gods they say they believe in. Severalyears ago, I heard one pompous evangelical jackass in particular pontificatingon the radio that anyone who disobeys the civil authority, be it a king or anyother government, is engaging in rebellion against God—those were the exactwords he used. What if the government is doing something wrong? Well, thissalesman for Satan opined, that is the business of those in government, and youare still obligated to obey. Everywhere you turn, be it the state or the church,the media or the schools, you are taught one thing above all else: the virtue ofsubjugating yourselves to mortals who claim to have the right to rule you.”“It is sickening, the reverence with which you speak of the liars and thieveswhose feet are so firmly planted on your necks. You call the congressmen and thejudges ‘honorable,’ and you swoon at the magnificence of the grandiose hallsthey inhabit, like this one,” Grant said, raising his arms and looking aroundthe room, “the temples they built to celebrate the domination of mankind. Youfeel pride at being able to say you once shook a senator’s hand, or saw thePresident in person. Ah, yes, the grand deity himself, His Royal Highness, thePresident of the United States of America. You speak the title as if you’rereferring to God Almighty. The vocabulary has changed a bit, but your mindset isno different from that of the groveling peasants of old who bowed low, faces inthe dirt, with a feeling of unworthiness and humility, when in the presence ofwhatever narcissist had declared himself to be their rightful lord and master.The truth of the matter, back then and today, is that these parasites who callthemselves ‘leaders’ are not superior beings, they are not great men and women,they are not honorable, they’re not even average. The people who earn an honestliving, from sophisticated millionaire entrepreneurs to illiterate day laborersdoing the most menial tasks you can imagine, those people deserve your respect.Those people you should treat with courtesy and civility. But the frauds whoclaim the right to rule you, and demand your subservience and obedience, theydeserve only your scorn and contempt. Those who seek so-called high office arethe lowest of the low. They may dress better, have larger vocabularies, and do abetter job of planning out and executing their schemes, but they are no betterthan pickpockets, muggers and carjackers. In fact, they are worse, because theydon’t want to rob you of just your possessions; they want to rob you of yourvery humanity, deprive you of your free will, by slowly leaching away yourability to think, to judge, to act, reducing you to slaves in both body andmind.”“And still you persist in calling them ‘leaders.’ Leaders? Where is it that youthink you’re going, exactly, that would require you to have a leader? If youjust live your own life and mind your own damn business, exercising your owntalents, pursuing your own dreams, striving to be what you believe you shouldbe, what possible use would you have for a leader? Do you ever actually thinkabout the words that you hear, the words that you repeat? You parrot oxymoronicterms such as ‘the leader of the free world.’ Even pretending for a moment thatthere is some huge journey or some giant battle that everyone in the entirenation is undertaking together that would require a leader, why would you everthink, even for a moment, that the crooks that infest this town are the sort ofpeople you should listen to, or emulate, or follow anywhere? Somewhere insideyour mostly dormant brains, you know full well that politicians are all corruptliars and thieves, opportunistic con men, exploiters and fear-mongers. You knowall this, and yet you still speak as if you are the ones who are the stupid,vicious animals, while the politicians are the great, wise role models,teachers, and leaders, without whom civilization could not exist.” Grantgestured toward the congressmen. “You think these crooks are the ones who makecivilization possible? What belief could be more absurd? Yet when they do theirpseudo-religious rituals, deciding how to control you this week, you still callit ‘law,’ and continue to treat their arbitrary demands as if they were moraldecrees from the gods, that no decent person would ever consider disobeying.”“You have become so thoroughly indoctrinated into the cult of state-worship thatyou are truly shocked when the occasional sane person states the bleedingobvious: the mere fact that the political crooks wrote something down anddeclared their threats to be ‘law’ does not mean that any human being anywherehas the slightest moral obligation to obey. Every moment of every day, in everylocation and every situation, you have a moral obligation to do what you deem tobe right, not what some delusional bloated windbag says is ‘legal.’ And thatrequires you to first determine right and wrong for yourself—a responsibilityyou spend much time and effort trying to dodge.”“You proclaim how proud you are to be ‘law-abiding citizens,’ and express uttercontempt for anyone who considers himself above your so-called ‘laws,’ laws thatare nothing more than the selfish whims of tyrants and thieves. The word ‘crime’once meant an act harmful to another person. Now it means disobedience to anyone of the myriad of arbitrary commands coming from a parasitical criminalclass. To you, the term ‘crime’ is nearly synonymous with the word ‘sin,’implying that the ones whose commands are being disobeyed must be something akinto gods, when in truth they are more akin to leeches. The very phrase, ‘takingthe law into your own hands,’ perfectly expresses what a sacrilege it is, inyour eyes, for a mere human being to take upon himself the responsibility tojudge right from wrong, and to act accordingly, instead of doing what you do:unthinkingly obeying whatever capricious commands this cesspool of maggots spewsforth.”Betsy had to force herself not to laugh out loud. Grant was dead serious, butthe absurdity of what she was watching unfold before her very eyes was almosttoo much for her.“You glorify this criminal class as ‘lawmakers’ and believe that no one is lowerthan a ‘lawbreaker’—someone who would dare disobey the politicians. Likewise,you speak with pious reverence of ‘law enforcers’—those who forcibly impose thepoliticians’ every whim upon the rest of us. When the state uses violence, youimagine it to be inherently righteous and just. And if anyone resists, they are,in your eyes, contemptible lowlifes—lawless, terrorist criminals. Like thelawless, terrorist criminals who helped slaves escape the plantations; like thelawless, terrorist criminals who helped Jews escape the killing machine of theThird Reich; like the lawless, terrorist criminals who were crushed to deathunder the tanks of the Red Chinese government in Tiananmen Square; like all thelawless, terrorist criminals in history who had the courage to disobey thenever-ending stream of tyrants and oppressors who have called their violence‘authority’ and ‘law.’ And that includes the lawless, terrorist criminals whofounded this country.”Grant shook his head again, this time smiling, as if in disbelief.“Everything you think you know is upside-down, backwards, and inside-out. Butwhat has to take the cake—the height of your insanity—is the fact that you viewas violent terrorists the only people on the planet who oppose the initiation ofviolence against their fellow men: anarchists, voluntaryists, and libertarians.We use violence only to defend ourselves against someone who initiates violenceagainst us. We use it for nothing else. Meanwhile, your belief system iscompletely schizophrenic and self-contradictory. On the one hand, you teach theyoung slaves that violence is never the answer, yet out of the other side ofyour mouths, you advocate that everyone and everything, everywhere and at alltimes, be controlled, monitored, taxed, and regulated through the force ofgovernment. In short, you are teaching your children that the masters may useviolence whenever they please, but the slave should never resist. Youindoctrinate your children into a life of unthinking, helpless subservience. Youare putting the chains around their little necks and fastening the locks tight.And worst of all, you feel good about it.”“Out of one side of your mouths, you condemn the evils of fascism and socialism,and lament the injustices of the regimes of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, while outof the other side of your mouths you preach exactly what they did: the worshipof the collective, the subjugation of every individual to that evil insanitythat wears the deceptive label, ‘the common good.’ You babble on and on aboutdiversity and open-mindedness, and then beg your masters to regulate and controlevery aspect of everyone’s lives, creating a giant herd of unthinking,conformist drones. You wear different clothes and have different hairstyles, andyou think that makes you different, yet all your minds are enslaved to the sameclub of masters and controllers. You think what they tell you to think, and dowhat they tell you to do, while imagining yourselves to be progressive,thinking, and enlightened.”“From your position of relative comfort and safety, you now condemn the evils ofother lands and other times while turning a blind eye to the injusticeshappening right in front of you. You tell yourself that, had you lived in thoseother places in those other times, you would have been among those who stood upagainst oppression and defended the downtrodden. But that is a lie. You wouldhave been right there with the rest of the flock of well-trained sheep, loudlydemanding that the slaves be beaten, that the witches be burned, that thenonconformists and rebels be destroyed. How do I know this? Because that isexactly what you are doing today.”“Today’s injustices and oppressions are fashionable and popular, and those whoresist them, you tell yourselves, are just malcontents and freaks, people whoserights don’t matter, people who deserve to be crushed under the boot ofauthority. Isn’t that right? You bunch of spineless, unthinking hypocrites. Lookin the mirror, take a good look at what you imagine to be righteous and kind.You are the Devil’s plaything. The crowds of thousands wildly applauding thespeeches of Adolf Hitler? That was you. The mob demanding that Jesus Christ benailed to the cross? That was you. The white invaders who celebrated thewholesale slaughter of those godless redskins? That was you. The throngs fillingthe Colosseum, applauding as the Christians were fed to the lions? That was you.Throughout history, the perpetual suffering and injustice, occurring on anincomprehensible scale—it was all because of people just like you: thewell-trained, thoroughly indoctrinated conformists, the people who do as they’retold, who proudly bow to their masters, who follow the crowd, believing whateveryone else believes and thinking whatever authority tells them to think. Thatis you.”“And your ignorance is not because the truth is not available to you. There havebeen radicals preaching it for thousands of years. No, you are ignorant becauseyou shun the truth with all your heart and soul. You close your eyes and runaway when a hint of reality lands in front of you. You condemn as extremists andfringe kooks those who try to show you the chains you wear, because you don’twant to be free; you don’t even want to be human. Responsibility and realityscare the hell out of you, so you cling tightly to your own enslavement and lashout at any who seek to free you from it. When someone opens the door to yourcage, you cower back in the corner and yell, ‘Close it, close it!’ ”“Well, some of us are finished with trying to save you. We’ve wasted enougheffort trying to convince you that you should be free. All you ever do is spoutback what your masters have taught you: that being free only leads to chaos anddestruction, while being obedient and subservient leads to peace and prosperity.There are none so blind as those who will not see. And you, you nation of sheep,would rather die than see the truth.”Grant took a deep breath. “Well, don’t worry, because after today, I won’t bewasting another breath trying to disentangle you from your deeply ingrainedsuperstitions. After your masters come up with some way to pretend that all ofthis didn’t really happen, and to say that I was never really President, and toput a new master on the throne who will control and rob you like in the good olddays, I will be happy to let you cling to whatever self-destructive delusionsyou wish. You can rebuild your government-god, pray to it again to save you fromreality, and suffer the consequences, until you, your children, and yourgrandchildren are all dust. But what you cannot do—what we will not allow anylonger—is to inflict the consequences of your inhuman insanity upon those of uswho believe in free will.”“Most of us will even do you the favor of removing ourselves from your patheticlittle circus of slaves and masters, and go where you can comfortably pretendthat we don’t exist. But do not follow us. Do not send the unthinking thugs ofyour masters after us. Do not seek to punish us for refusing to bow down to yourfalse gods. Unlike the games your masters play, sending pawn to kill pawn, wewill not waste our efforts on continually fighting the unthinking robots youcall ‘law enforcers.’We will go to the top, immediately, and lop the head off ofyour great god. And we will do it as many times as we must. Leave us alone, andyou can keep your gods.”“Likewise, we do not want, and will not accept, the stolen goods with which yourfalse gods so easily buy your loyalty and obedience. We will go out of our wayto make sure that we do not benefit at all from the looters’ game that you nowbelieve to be the foundation of civilization. We won’t be using theindoctrination camps you call schools. We won’t be using your phony currency oryour fraudulent banking system. We won’t be participating in any of thetrappings and schemes your masters euphemistically call ‘programs’ and‘benefits.’ We don’t want your department of this and bureau of that, yourinspectors and regulators, politicians and judges, tax collectors and police, orany of the other crooks and thugs which your gods may spawn. We want nothingfrom you but to be left alone. And we offer you nothing, except the promise thatwe will leave you alone if you do the same for us. That is what it means to be ahuman being. And if any of you ever figure that out, and are ready and willingto give up your chains and embrace true freedom, we will welcome you with openarms. Until then, stay the hell away from us.”Grant took another sip of water and put the glass down on the lectern. For along time he was still, not saying anything, looking as if he was deep inthought. “I just have one more thing to do today,” he finally said, quietly,“and then I’ll be finished.”He turned to his right, away from Betsy, and made a gesture to someone shecouldn’t see. Three men then came up on stage, the one in the middle lookingweak and a bit sick, the other two holding his arms. They didn’t seem to beholding him so he couldn’t escape as much as they were holding him so hewouldn’t fall down. At this, a new murmur arose among the remaining congressmen.Betsy recognized the Acting Chief of Staff, the man who had taken over theposition just six weeks before, after the former Chief of Staff had a heartattack.“As you should all know,” Grant said, turning back to the audience, “this isClarence Ferris, the former President’s Acting Chief of Staff.” He turned to thesick-looking man. “I believe you have something to tell the nation.” The manweakly nodded to the others holding his arms, and they let go. He walkedunsteadily to the podium, his expression fluctuating between terror and anger.He swallowed hard, looking down at his notes, which he set on the podium. Hishands were shaking, and he accidentally knocked over the glass of water, whichrolled off the podium and shattered on the floor. No one moved. A tear rolleddown the man’s cheek. After an awkward pause, he threw Grant a pitiful look, asif he were pleading to be dismissed. Grant’s face showed no emotion. “Do it,” hecommanded.“I,” the man began, but he could barely speak. It was all he could do to gothrough the mechanical motions of reading his prepared speech. “I have served mycountry as best I could. I cannot tell you how much it pains me to do this.” Hetook a deep breath, and looked at Grant again. “When I took the position ofActing Chief of Staff, I made recordings of all my meetings with the President.”Now his eyes seemed riveted to his notes. “I made ... I made the followingrecording of the President—the former President, I mean. This was one of ourregular meetings concerning domestic affairs. We were discussing the situationin Graveston. He said some things that I ... things that I ... ”“Just tell them what the tape is, and then play it,” Grant instructed, firmly,as if trying to bolster the man’s courage. There was another long pause.The man drew another deep breath. “This is a tape I made, without thePresident’s knowledge, of one of many meetings I had with him. Present weremyself, the President, and the Secretary of Defense. This meeting occurredJanuary 9, eleven days ago.” His hands trembling and tears streaming from hiseyes, he fumbled with a small electronic device, until a hiss could be heardover the loudspeakers on the wall behind him.“Our intelligence sources aren’t giving us much to work with.” The voice on thetape matched the voice of the man at the podium.“We don’t need any more damn intelligence,” came the familiar voice of theformer president. “We need action. Don’t you get it?”“The agent in charge says that if we can show restraint a little longer, hethinks a peaceful resolution might—”“I’m tired of hearing about caution and restraint. I tried that, and Collinsmade me look like a damn pussy! So now we’re doing something different. Afterthis Flight 422 incident, the public will cheer if we go in and take them allout.”“But how sure are we that members of the group were even to blame? I know whatwe’ve been saying to the media, but the intel is still—”“God, when are you going to grow up?” yelled the former President. “You have noidea what’s going on, do you?”“Sir?”“Quit being such a Boy Scout! You know what a leader is? It’s someone who can dowhatever it takes to keep the team strong. You have no idea the pressures, thesacrifices I have to make. History doesn’t remember those who show restraint anduse caution. It remembers the bold victors. What this country needs most rightnow is unity, and the best thing for that is a common enemy. I gave them that. Igave them something to rally against.”“I don’t follow you, sir.”“What do you think every war is? Conflict is what keeps a people unified, keepsa country together. The sacrifices of war, you need them—you need them to keep acountry strong. A people without an enemy is a people without a cause. The damnsheep out there needed something to think about besides their pocketbooks.Whatever the cost, they needed a common enemy to make them pull together andfeel like Americans again. Did you think I was going to sit around until Collinsgave them that?”“What do you mean? Are you saying you wanted something like this to happen?”“Wake up, you jackass!” the former President screamed. “Wanted it to happen? Imade damn sure it would happen! I made damn sure that those ungrateful littlemalcontents down in Graveston wouldn’t win any more supporters or sympathizers.And it’s working like a charm.”Betsy saw looks of shock on many faces in the crowd.“Sir? What are you saying?” Ferris’ voice demanded. “Are you saying you knew inadvance about the plans to hijack the plane, and let it happen?”“No, you dumb-ass! You still don’t get it! Get this through your thick skull! Igave the order to shoot the fucking plane down!”With a loud “click” the tape stopped, and the room fell silent. A single snifflewas heard from the man at the podium, who now wept openly, his head hung low.Grant put a hand on the man’s back, and without raising his head, the man turnedand walked slowly off the stage and out of sight, the two other men helping tosteady him.“You put him into power,” Grant said to the audience, his voice low and calm.“In your quest for a savior, this is the kind of person you put into power, overand over again. These are the people you ask to rule you, to protect you. Thisone murdered one hundred and seventy-eight people because he thought it mighthelp his image. What makes him different is not that he would do such a thing,or that he did such a thing, but only that he got caught. Most of the otherso-called ‘leaders’ have done similar things.”“And you put them here. You made them gods, foolishly hoping that the power yougave them would be used for good. Well, let this reality sink in today. Don’thide behind your delusions. Open your eyes. This is the protector and savior youwanted so badly. This is the monster you worshiped. Take a good, long look, anddecide if you want more of the same, or if you’re ready to be free.”“All your lives, you’ve been trained to be subservient and obedient. Throughyears of authoritarian indoctrination mislabeled as ‘education,’ one message hasbeen constantly pounded into your heads, by parents, the media, so-calledteachers, the entire culture. And that message is this: you cannot find thetruth yourself; you cannot be trusted to judge right from wrong; you cannot betrusted to make your own decisions. So if anything comes up that might requireyou to think, or worse yet, might require you to do something, to take action,don’t worry—just huddle timidly in a corner and let the authorities handle it.And now, having been raised to be perpetually infantile, you are existentiallyterrified of the idea of having to take care of yourselves, having to protectyourselves, having to effect justice yourselves, having to face an unpredictableworld without some all-knowing, all-powerful being holding your hand. And so youappoint an imagined authority to save you from reality. But it doesn’t, and itnever will. It will betray you and enslave you, keeping you forever powerlessand defenseless. It’s not a fluke. It’s the nature of the beast you worship.It’s time for you to open your eyes and grow up.”Betsy was still in shock from what she had just heard. How long had Grant knownabout this? And what kind of will power must it have taken for him to plan allof this, knowing what he knew?“In the last couple of days, the media has been theorizing about why the formerPresident would not be attending this inaugural address. It is not because hedoesn’t like me, or because he is upset, or because he’s sick. And he is notvacationing at his winter home, as the media believes. He is dead.” Gasps wereheard throughout the room. Grant held high a piece of paper. “For those of youwho believe in such things, here is a copy of the presidential pardon for theman who killed him. It seems that a few people were not willing to let ourso-called justice system decide what to do with one of its former gods. I havebeen informed that tomorrow the media will be told where to find the body of theman who ordered the murder of one hundred and seventy-eight innocent Americans.”A murmur again arose throughout the room, but Grant ignored it. He reached downand picked up his jacket from the floor, where he had dropped it, and draped itover his shoulder.“As for me, I’m heading down to Graveston, to shake the hands of some of the fewmen and women—if any are still alive—who have dared to stand up for truth andfreedom in a country that now, for the most part, despises those things.”Grant stepped off the stage, walked over to Betsy, and took her hand, a serious,almost pained expression on his face. He spoke so softly then she could barelyunderstand his words. “Of all the people I had to lie to for all these years, ithurt the most to lie to you.” Still in shock, but not unhappy, Betsy could onlystare at him in amazement. “Since you’re quitting now,” Grant continued, “I waswondering if you’d like to be my date on a little trip I have to go on.”A smile slowly crept onto Betsy’s face, and she managed to choke out, “I’d loveto.”EPILOGUE image [../Images/image00252.jpeg] JESSICA pushed one last cross piece into the hole of a fence post andstraightened herself up, exhausted. She knew she was overdoing it, but she keptthinking she’d stop after the next one, and then the next one. This fence had tobe done before Saturday, when five pregnant brood mares were being delivered.Jessica stepped back, removed her heavy leather gloves, and surveyed her workfor a moment. Then she turned and walked back toward the house.She stopped along the way to check on the chicken tractor; the chickens werestill scratching happily in the long grass inside their movable enclosure.Jessica couldn’t move it by herself, anyway. To keep coyotes from getting in,they’d had to make it really heavy. Next to the new log house was a largevegetable garden enclosed by a six-foot wire fence. It wasn’t attractive,Jessica had to admit, but she did enjoy being able to watch deer and rabbitswander through the yard without wondering if they were about to eat all herfood.Jason came out to meet her, and stopped to give her a kiss. “What, you’re givingup already?” he teased. She’d been out there for four hours straight.“Yes, I’m giving up, and you should too,” she replied. “We have to get cleanedup for dinner.”“Yes, I know. Tasha’s cooking already. I’ll be in in a few minutes.”Jessica watched him head for the barn, and hoped he wouldn’t forget himself andstay out there for an hour. Jason loved this place and worked outsideconstantly.She remembered back to that January day when their hopeful little group ofsurvivors sat around that old radio, listening to Grant’s speech. Their euphoriahad quickly turned to anxiety when they realized that Jason was dangerously ill.She remembered sitting in an ambulance, holding Jason’s hand as a doctoradministered IV antibiotics on the spot.She remembered her first phone call to her family, when they’d all been tooshocked and happy to speak. Jessica had refused to leave while Jason was stillin the hospital, so her whole family flew down to Arizona to be reunited withher. Eventually conflicts arose when Jessica said that she was staying there atleast until Jason was well, if not permanently. The Graveston area, includingthe river bend neighborhood, was to be one of the new free communities, and shewanted to be part of it. Her parents could not understand why she would want tostay with these “extremists,” even if one of them was the President of theUnited States. They spoke of Stockholm syndrome, and wanted to take Jessica to apsychiatrist for “deprogramming.” But she had insisted, kindly but firmly, thatshe was old enough to make up her own mind, and that her experience with her newfriends was the deprogramming.She was smiling, though her legs ached, as she climbed the front steps of hernew home. As she walked in from the bright sunshine and her eyes adjusted to thelower level of light, she could hear the tinny sound of an AM radio playing.“In yet another of a series of ongoing attacks, seven people were killed whenthe IRS offices in Ogden—” The sound was cut short as David switched it off.“I thought you hated listening to the news,” commented Jessica, dropping herwork gloves on the table.“I do,” David answered, “but I still make myself do it every couple of weeks,just to see what’s going on.”“Well, it doesn’t sound good,” said Jessica, flopping into an old recliner. Hersmile faded, and for a moment her own ordeal was all too clear in her memory.“Is it even worth all this? Is it ever going to end? I mean, these days even theones on our side seem to be going too far.”“They’re not on my side,” David declared emphatically.“Well, you know what I mean.”“You have to understand,” David said, “this was bound to happen sooner or later.The parasites have been creating this monster for decades, and now it’s brokenfree.”“You don’t approve of all the stuff going on out there, do you?” she asked,pointing at the radio.“No, certainly not. But it doesn’t matter what I think of it. I think it’sinevitable. It’s like some poor dog that’s been beaten since it was a puppy. Allits life it cowers and whimpers in fear. Then one day, it snaps and rips itsmaster’s throat out.”“Thanks for the pleasant image,” Jessica said, making a face. “But the dog isn’tonly attacking the one who beat it. It sounds like even average bureaucrats aredying out there.”“Remember, those IRS paper-pushers have been emptying bank accounts, takinghomes, and ruining lives for years and years. The zoning bureaucrats, theinspectors and regulators— they’ve all been pushing people around for decades,and it all adds up. As long as the cogs in the machine felt comfortable obeyingorders, they went right on doing it, oblivious to the harm they were doing andthe suffering they were causing, and oblivious to the resentment and anger theywere feeding. Their victims had no recourse back then, so they just put up withit. Well, now all their frustrations are coming out as hatred and a desire forrevenge.”“I’m not saying the drones who just follow orders are good, but I don’t thinkthey deserve to die,” said Jessica, frowning.“Depending on what you mean by ‘deserve,’ I agree. But when people areoppressed, humiliated, and tormented for all their lives, even if only a littleat a time, and even if they barely notice, it builds up inside them. It’s like apoison the body can’t get rid of. It builds up and builds up, until somethingbreaks. Now it’s the French Revolution all over again. People who have beentreated badly all their lives, once they reach the point where their angeroutweighs their fear, are capable of some pretty heinous things. Like I said,the tyrants created this monster, and now they’re paying the price, whether it’sfair and just or not.”“You know,” David went on, “all those average agents who sat smugly behind theirdesks, thinking they could ruin hundreds of people’s lives with impunity,they’re like ... well, they’re like a guy who keeps poking a bull in the facewith a stick because he thinks the fence is strong. He deserves a kick in thepants, maybe. But if that fence falls, he’s very likely to get killed. Humannature is like that. I wish I had some magic power to stop it, but it will justhave to work itself out.”“And then what? Utopia and peace on earth?” Jessica asked jokingly, her smilebeginning to return.“Well, in all likelihood, if history is any indication, they’ll rebuild thebeast called ‘authority.’ They’ll have more wars, more oppression, moresuffering and more death. And they’ll keep right on doing it for centuries tocome.”“What are we supposed to do to stop it?” Jessica asked.“I know of only one thing we can do: show them, by example, that human beingscan live without worshiping monsters. A few might pay attention. Most won’t.”“Speaking as a recovering fascist,” came Jason’s voice from the doorway, “Iagree.” Jessica hadn’t heard him come in. “I know from experience that it takesa lot to change a person’s view of reality.” He walked to the window and lookedout. “It’s just so easy to assume that what you were raised to believe is thetruth, and that anyone who thinks otherwise should be forced to conform to yourviewpoint. Of course, when lots of people with different beliefs do that, theresults aren’t pretty.”“Wow, you’ve come a long way, pawn of the oppressor,” David chuckled. “Nextyou’ll be saying we should each be true to our own conscience and not bow to anyoutside authority.”“What do you think I am, some kind of anarchist or something?” Jason said with asmile. “Well, I’d like to stay and repent of my past sins, but I need a showerbefore dinner.” He headed for the back of the house, stopping at the kitchen fora moment to speak to Tasha.“Why is this so hard to understand?” Jessica said after a moment. David’s looksaid he wasn’t sure what she was referring to. “I mean, the idea seemed reallyweird to me at first, that everyone is just in charge of themselves. I reallybelieved that someone has to make rules and laws to tell the rest of us what wecan and can’t do. Now that seems so stupid, and what you say seems so obvious.”“This is how it’s been for a very long time,” David replied. “Even those whohave been openly enslaved throughout history were usually completely convincedthat they were meant to be slaves. Many slaves would actually view running awayas stealing from the master, the same way most Americans view not paying taxesas some great sin. Wanting to keep what you earn for yourself, or to spend it orgive it away however you choose, instead of giving it to the parasites who claimto own you, is still viewed by many as a crime. It’s utterly insane, butbillions of people still believe that by being born in a certain place, theysomehow acquired an obligation to surrender a portion of their time and effortto a group of people claiming to be their rightful masters. It’s the divineright of kings all over again. And yes, once someone has broken free of thedelusion, he can see the insanity of it, and he will wonder how he ever couldhave been tricked into believing something so ridiculous.” From outside came thesound of children laughing. “I think back myself, back to when I was arun-of-the­mill conservative, and I wonder how I could ever have clung to suchan absurd superstition, and why I tried so hard to cling to it when the truthstarted making itself known to me.”Jessica got up and looked out the front window. Her next-door neighbor’schildren were playing catch with Cassie, the golden retriever she and Jason hadadopted.“I’d better get cleaned up too,” she said. “I guess we can talk all we want atdinner.” She stopped in the doorway, looking back at David. “I just wish therest of the world would listen.”“Yeah, wouldn’t that be neat?” David asked, but his smile looked a little sad. image [../Images/image00251.jpeg] JASON stood still, deep in thought, in the middle of the spot where Doug’s househad been. A hundred yards away, out back, was a huge black area in the fieldwhere they had burned all of the useless debris. They had cleared awayeverything except for half of the cinderblock foundation, which had survived theonslaught. Nearby was a big pile of what they’d decided was reusable lumber,piping, cinderblocks, and other materials. The new house was still in thedesigning phase.Months earlier, Jason had stood in a room, just above where he stood now, andwatched a Bradley come through the wall. He had experienced the terror of beingon the government’s hit list through no fault of his own. He had experienced forhimself what hundreds of millions of others had experienced throughout thebloody history of man’s oppression of man. He had come face to face with theforce of government. Take away the spin, the propaganda, and the euphemisms, andthe message is: Comply or we will crush you under our tank treads.It made Jason shudder to think that he’d once been on the government’s side,that he could have killed Halen, or David, or Doug, or Josh. Or even Keith,whose bitterness he understood now, all too well. Suddenly his mind flashed backto a moment he’d forgotten entirely until just then. He was sitting next to hisammo box, loading his rounds one by one, pondering the power of each and everybullet to end a life and asking God to help him make the right decisions. And inthe end, he hadn’t fired one shot. He touched the tiny silver cross at histhroat. “Thank you,” he whispered.Jessica came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder. “You guys about donehere?” she asked.“Yep,” he said. “I think we’ve got everything usable out of here.”Doug was playing frisbee with Veronica while Sandy sat by a tree, sketching.Sandy was designing a memorial garden where Ben’s house and garden had been.“How do they do it?” Jason asked, still deep in his thoughts. “How do they makepeople hate each other? How do they make us unwilling to just leave each otheralone?”“They have to keep us from seeing other people as real human beings, likeourselves,” Jessica answered. “It’s hard enough to comprehend that everyone inthis world really matters as much as we do. I think human beings are all tooready to believe that some other group is a bit less human than they are, andthat makes it okay to be mean to them or exploit them, or kill them, to makelife better for us. And government makes up lies to push us down that pathfurther and faster.”Jason scowled. “How many people are out there having wars, killing each other bythe thousands, because some authority keeps telling them to hate each other, andkeeps inventing things to divide them and pit one group against another? We’resupposed to be so enlightened and informed. Why do we keep falling for it?”“You’re sounding more and more like David every day,” Jessica commented with asmile.“I’m just amazed that I ever believed in all that crap,” said Jason. “I was soconvinced that making people obey the law was a noble cause. I was so sure, Iwould have killed people, people who hadn’t harmed anyone else. Now that allseems utterly insane to me.”Jessica was surveying the area thoughtfully. “I want to plant a tree over thereby the tool shed,” she said. “Where we found your friend.”“Red? He wasn’t my friend,” said Jason. “He was a trigger-happy idiot.”“He was a human being,” said Jessica. image [../Images/image00256.jpeg] BETSY felt like the girl on the cover of a corny romance novel as she strolledarm-in-arm with Grant through a field of riotous wildflowers. Bluish mountainsloomed in the distance against a clear blue sky. As they approached a group oflog cabins, Jessica and Jason came out to meet them.“Hey, Prez, how’s it going?” Jessica asked.“I told you not to call me that,” Grant responded. “Don’t make me send theSecret Service after you.”“Yes, sir,” Jessica responded with a laugh, standing up straight and saluting.Betsy was happy to see Jessica looking so well; she’d liked the girl since themoment they met. Grant’s inauguration day had been such a blur; it seemed likethree days put together. Right after the speech, Grant had whisked her off toArizona on Air Force One. His first concern had been to find survivors andassure their safety. By the time they landed, Grant had arranged for a hotelsuite next door to the hospital so the other survivors could be close to Jason.And he had spoken to David Singh at great length over the phone.Betsy didn’t have much time to talk to him at all, but when he finished talkingto David, she had snatched the opportunity to ask him her most burning question:“Why didn’t you trust me enough to tell me what you were doing? Did you reallythink I would give you away?”“I’m really sorry I had to do that,” Grant had said. “It was very hard for me.And when you quit, when you thought I was the most despicable man on the face ofthe earth, I almost told you then, but I couldn’t. It wasn’t because I didn’ttrust you. Not at all. But we were both safer that way. Presidents are not theultimate power that they pretend to be. They’re almost always the puppets of farmore powerful people whose names the public wouldn’t recognize. And those peoplelike to know who their puppets are. If they didn’t have my phones bugged, myoffice bugged, and my house bugged, I’d be very surprised. Even when I wasalone, I had to play the part, day and night. And I can tell you, it wasn’teasy.” He chuckled. “Someday I’ll have to tell you how I got my hands on an‘Iron Web’ T-shirt for the speech without anyone knowing. Now that was achallenge.”It was unnerving for Betsy to meet David Singh after the way he had beenportrayed in the news, and she felt deeply ashamed of her own participation inthat portrayal. These people were so astonishingly different from what she hadbelieved they were, she almost felt as if she was in a Twilight Zone episode.The news of the Miracle Girl was all over the country already, with hereye-witness confirmation of the shocking revelations of that morning. When Betsyfirst met her, she was in the hotel suite hiding from reporters. Betsy could seethat the girl’s happiness was dampened by her concern for her friend, and sheresolved to pamper and distract her as much as possible. Fortunately, Jasonturned the corner the next day, and was sitting up eating when the Presidentcame in to meet him.Grant and David, who had become instant friends over the phone, met with thehearty embrace of old comrades. The two men were as different as could be, inlooks and personality both. Betsy could hardly imagine a more polite, gentle,considerate man than David. But Grant? He’d always been bold and charismatic, ofcourse, but now it seemed as if a heavy lid had been removed, and hispersonality was bubbling over. He wasn’t faking anymore. He wasn’t mincingwords. He was laughing louder, and using coarser language. In other words, Betsythought, he’s thoroughly enjoying being himself for the first time in years. Andmuch as she liked this new man, this added to the whole Twilight Zone tenor ofthe day.Feeling exhausted by the evening, Betsy realized that her day had actually beentwo hours longer than it should have been, due to her flight west over two timezones. Ever since getting off of Air Force One, Grant had refused to use anygovernment-funded limousines, planes, or anything else. However, a few SecretService agents, whom Betsy suspected were men that Grant had known from before,had chosen to stay with him, and were constantly on high alert.“Are those guys ever going to leave us alone?” Betsy had asked, as Grant’sbodyguards were carefully surveying every inch of the hotel suite they hadreserved near the hospital.“What would we do if they did?” Grant had asked in return.“I’m sure I don’t know. What would you do?”“Something I’ve wanted to do for the last three years,” he had said. Then he hadturned her face toward his and kissed her.Now, so many months later, the memory of that moment still made tremors runthrough Betsy’s body, and she clung a little tighter to Grant’s arm to keep herbalance. They were approaching a group of five cabins, three of which lookedbrand new, with a couple dozen people milling around them. Grant announcedloudly, “If anyone wants news of the outside world, I’ll be giving my officialweekly report in ten minutes.”He led Betsy into a large log building, which had been under construction whenBetsy last visited. She expected the inside to be as rustic as the outside, andwas surprised to see smooth white walls and a polished floor of pine boardsstained to the warm brown of cherry wood. On both sides of the room, she wasamazed to see beautifully carved church pews that looked like mahogany. “Whereon earth did they get those?” she asked Grant.“Salvage,” he said. “Someone was in the right place at the right time. Luckyfind, wasn’t it?”She remembered hearing about the new building from Sandy, who said she wasitching to get a real stage built in there, and to get some culture going inthis “little podunk town,” as she called it. Sandy wouldn’t admit it, but Betsyknew that she missed the art and culture of Washington.“What news from the front?” asked a young man as he came in the front doorbehind them.“When the others get here, I’ll tell you,” Grant answered.Over the next few minutes, about thirty people filed in, many of them smilingand nodding to Grant and Betsy as they passed, and exchanging warm greetingswith each other. Jessica and Jason came in, and Heather, looking tanned andwell, and David and Tasha, and Doug with his whole family. And many others she’dnever seen before. They all settled into the church pews, still chatting, asGrant walked to the front of the room.“Okay, I’ll try to make this quick,” he began. Betsy started to sit down, butGrant beckoned her to him. “The most important thing that has happened in thelast month is that I married my secretary, Betsy. Betsy, wave to all the nicewackos.” There were chuckles and waves from the audience. Blushing, Betsy lookedout at the crowd, and was happy to see Sandy, looking as she always looked,leaning in the doorway, smiling, with Veronica at her side.“Let me find my list, so I don’t forget anything,” Grant said, pulling a foldedpiece of paper out of his pocket. Betsy took her seat. “Okay, here we go. Hereare the top stories—from reliable sources, not the mainstream media—in noparticular order. Item number one. In the past few weeks, the governors ofCalifornia and New Jersey declared martial law.” There were murmurs from thecrowd. “To make a long story short, it didn’t work out well for those in power.Things got bloody, government buildings were burned, lots of civilians and copsshot each other, and then the martial law ended. The reports I’ve heard say thatat this point, some people are considering anyone wearing a police uniform inthose states to be fair game. Cops are quitting in droves.”He scribbled a note to himself and continued. “Item number two. So far,forty-seven IRS offices have been burned to the ground.” This brought severalspontaneous cheers from the audience. “As a result, the bureaucrats stoppedshowing up to work. As far as I can tell, the IRS is completely out of business,as of one week ago.”At this, applause burst out, almost drowning out one spectator’s comment: “Doesthat mean I don’t get my refund check?” Several people close enough to hear himlaughed. When the noise had died down a bit, someone else said, “I thought youfired them all anyway.”“Yeah, sorry,” Grant said, “I keep forgetting that lots of you still don’t knowthe whole story. You sure wouldn’t have gotten it from the loyalist media. Thecrooks had a bunch of emergency sessions, made up a few new legal principles,and declared my Executive Orders to be invalid. Somewhere around half of thebureaucrats came back for a while, probably just desperate to get a paycheckagain. But as I said, the IRS has now ceased to exist.”“Item three. Half of Congress is missing. At least a couple of congressmen haveactually been assassinated, but the rest are probably just hiding.” There was amurmur, and Betsy could see on the faces in the crowd that some people thoughtthis was a shame, while others seemed to approve. “Either way, Congress has notbeen in session, at least not publicly, for two weeks now.”“Item four. Oops, I should have done this first, because this is probably whyCongress is M.I.A. Several groups, apparently including some active and reservemilitary folk, forced their way into various offices at the Pentagon, the CIAoffices in Langley, and some others, and seized a whole lot of classifieddocuments. They’re now all posted on what is left of the internet, and thehighlights are being circulated across the country as a pamphlet. As you canprobably imagine, the documents expose quite a bit of conspiracy, murder, fraud,and so on, courtesy of the federal government. The conspiracy theorists amongyou will have a field day with some of the stuff that’s been uncovered about9/11, JFK, Pearl Harbor, Oklahoma City, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the federalincome tax hoax, and lots of other stuff—including, of course, that terroristcult known as the Iron Web.” This again brought chuckles from the audience.“Item five. Washington, D.C., pretty much looks like a war zone now. It seemsalmost all of the control freaks ran away, and the, uh, less affluent elementsof the city decided it was time for some riots and looting.” He wrote anothernote to himself on the paper he was holding. “I haven’t been there myself sinceabout a week after my little speech. I did as much damage as I could to theFourth Reich, before having to flee for my life. You’ve probably all heard ofthe three attempts to kill me—well, the three that came close enough to be worthmentioning. Apparently there’s still quite a bit of debate over the question ofwhether I’m still the President or not. They’re fishing for some legal excuse todeclare VP Conrad the new Prez.”“So he wasn’t in on your little charade?” Doug asked.“No, couldn’t risk trying to have another spy,” Grant answered. “Conrad was justanother political crook like the rest of them. Never saw it coming.”“Item six. You already know about the small patches of freedom sprouting up allover this country. We’ve already established trade with twenty-seven freecommunities, at last count. Well, apparently now it’s also happening in England,Australia, and Canada.”“Wow, didn’t know the Canucks had it in them,” came a comment from Doug, who satin the front row.“Apparently so,” Grant answered. “Good for them. So the Iron Web has goneinternational.” He paused for a moment, looking at his notes. “Oh, and there arenow three new free towns consisting entirely of former federal prisoners.Incidentally, those towns seem to have very low crime rates, like all the otherfree communities.”“Let’s see. Item seven. Two more Federal Reserve buildings have been blown up.They were given warning, and no one was inside.”“Pity,” came the flippant remark from Doug.“A few big names in the banking industry and the Federal Reserve have turned updead recently,” Grant continued. “No one has claimed credit yet.”“I wouldn’t mind the credit,” Doug said.“Shut up or I’ll have you arrested,” Grant joked.“Tyrant,” Doug muttered.“A couple of those deaths may have been suicides,” Grant continued. “As youknow, the dollar is basically worthless now— not that it was worth much before.Even average Joes are starting to catch on to the idea of trading with silverand gold, or whatever else they happen to have that’s portable and valuable. Afew states are now beginning to issue their own currencies, but they don’t seemto be catching on very well. Much of the economy has screeched to a halt aspeople try to figure out how to keep the world turning without using FederalReserve notes.”“Item eight. Something really weird happened up in New Hampshire that I hardlyknow how to describe. A week ago, in several different municipalities, localgovernments had their hearings interrupted by groups of armed folk showing up.Here’s the weird part: the armed folk brought along a bunch of money, mostlysilver and gold, and gave it to the governments, along with a declaration thatbasically said, if you need money, ask us for it. But don’t demand it from us,and don’t try to tax us, or we’ll shoot you. And in the following days, a bunchof volunteers—unarmed this time, so as not to intimidate people—went around,door to door, telling all the people in the area that there would be no moreproperty taxes, but asking the people if they wanted to voluntarily contributefor the things the local governments usually handled. Oddly—and this evensurprised me—all but one of the towns received more in donations than they hadever collected in taxes.”“But who will build the roads?” Doug asked in a mock whiny voice, bringingchuckles from many. Betsy assumed it was an inside joke of some sort.“Item nine. When I fired the ICE, it naturally triggered a huge influx fromMexico. That has now died down. In fact, a lot have now gone back home. The oneswho wanted free handouts here found out that there aren’t any anymore—well,except in a few states, like California, which are still clinging to socialismand going bankrupt because of it. And a lot of the Mexicans who just came hereto earn an honest living decided to go back to Mexico and give their owngovernment a well-deserved kick in the pants. The Mexican government is on thebrink of collapse.”“Item ten—almost done now. For the third time, what’s left of the United StatesCongress has sent a letter addressed to ‘The Iron Web,’ whoever that is,” Grantsaid, holding up a piece of paper, “agreeing to meet with us and hear ourdemands, so that we may begin negotiations.”“Demands? What demands?” asked a solidly built, middle-aged man with a ponytailin the back of the room.“Does ‘Piss off!’ count as a demand?” asked Doug, and several people chuckled.“Apparently they’re still having trouble grasping the fact that we don’t carewhat they think, we don’t want anything from them, and we don’t need theirpermission to be free. I guess they’ve been treated like royalty for so longthat the concept is incomprehensible to them. Well, there’s one for the circularfile,” Grant said, and crumpled up the letter and dropped it in the wastebasket, an action which a dozen or so people applauded.“Last but not least, item eleven. I don’t know the details, but apparently forthe last three days there has been heavy fighting at a U.S. Army base in Texas.The fighting seems to be between the Army and itself, or maybe the NationalGuard against the Army. Again, I don’t know the details, but there seems to be afair amount of mutiny going on, and not just in Texas. There’s even a rumor thata former general, in addition to all his other medals, is now wearing an IronWeb lapel pin. I’m not sure if it’s true or not.” There was a murmur from thecrowd.“Oh, I almost forgot. You already knew that within the last two months, NewHampshire, Wyoming, Texas, Montana, Colorado, and for some reason Florida, allseceded from the union. Well, now you can add Arizona, Nevada and South Dakotato the list.”“Don’t forget Maine,” came a voice from the back of the room.“What? When did that happen?” Grant asked.“I have family up there, and the state legislature—what’s left of it,anyway—just passed the bill, and the governor signed it.”“Interesting. And it sounds as if a bunch of states, faced with the very realpossibility of violent revolt, have suddenly decided to be libertarian. They’rerepealing taxes and socialist programs right and left. We’ll see how that turnsout.” Grant folded up his notes and put them in his pocket. “Anyway, that’s allI have. While we’re all here, does anyone have any more news to report?”“Yeah. In more important news, Jessica grows the best tomatoes I’ve evertasted,” said a middle-aged, curly-haired blond woman in the third row.“And the fish are biting down by the south bend of the river today,” added ayoung boy in the second row.“If anyone wants to help, tomorrow we’re starting on a cabin for Drew andStacy,” Heather added. “They came all the way from Australia, looking forfreedom.”“Ya know, I like the news around here a lot more than what the rest of the worldis talking about,”concluded Grant . For a moment he had an expression ofconcern. He looked at Betsy, and the stress in his face evaporated. “Well, mydear, shall we stroll on back to our own little extremist compound?” He offeredher his arm. Smiling, she took it.OTHER BOOKS BY LARKEN ROSE image [../Images/image00251.jpeg] HOW TO BE A SUCCESSFUL TYRANT(The Megalomaniac Manifesto)The oppression of the masses has evolved into a detailed science, if not an artform.
