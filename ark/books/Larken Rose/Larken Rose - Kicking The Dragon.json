In fact, had my class back in high schoolvoted for someone “least likely to ever go to prison,” I’m sure I would havemade the top three. Given my lack of criminal history, my quiet and obedientbehavior back in school, the fact that I have never used any drugs (or evenalcohol), never smoked, am happily married and have a great kid, and so far havesurvived for 37 years without ever having to punch anyone, I’m pretty sure Iwould qualify as a “goodie-two-shoes” in most people’s minds. Yet here I am,serving a 15-month sentence in federal prison. Granted, it’s only aminimum-security prison “camp,” which is pretty tame compared to “real” prison,but I’m still stuck here. So, while I have a bit of time on my hands, I feelcompelled to tell the story of how I got here, because it involves issues whichshould matter to every American, not just to me.I might as well tell you now, my tale doesn’t involve any car chases orshootouts, or anyone dying—nor does it involve sex, drugs or rock ’n’ roll. (Iwonder if anyone will keep reading after that admission.) Nor does the storyinvolve me getting caught doing anything sneaky or dishonest. In fact, itdoesn’t even involve me doing anything illegal. I know, I know: everyone sayshe’s innocent. They all claim, “I didn’t do it!” Well in my case, I did do it,but “it” wasn’t illegal (notwithstanding my current incarceration). But mypurpose in writing this book is not to “clear my name” or to make anyone thinkbetter of me. You may think what you like about this nasty convict and enemy ofthe state, because what is worth learning from my story has nothing to do withme personally.To skip right to the punchline, I stopped filing federal income tax returnsafter 1996.Now, it’s been my experience that whenever someone hears that, he immediatelyjumps to half a dozen conclusions, all of them incorrect. So I beg the readernot to get ahead of himself, and not to form any opinions until all the factsare known. It’s very easy for people to get carried away by unthinking mentalreflex, since jumping to conclusions is so much easier (and often more fun) thanobjectively analyzing and thinking about stuff. So, if you were hoping for anexcuse to jump to a conclusion, make up your mind (and shut your mind), so youcan skip the rest of the book, here you go:1) I was convicted of failing to file federal income tax returns.2) People in government call me a “tax protestor.”3) The IRS says that my beliefs are “frivolous.”4) Several judges have said the same.5) Conventional wisdom also says I’m wrong.Therefore, I’m a wacko criminal. So if you’d like, you can dismiss me as suchwithout reading any further, and get back to your daily routine. There, wasn’tthat easy? If, on the other hand, the above didn’t scare you away (as apparentlyit didn’t, since you’re still reading), you might find the rest of the storyinteresting—maybe even disturbing.Though my story revolves around some very unorthodox conclusions I reachedconcerning the federal income tax laws, the primary goal of this book is not toconvince you that those conclusions are correct. In order for the story to makesense, you’ll need to grasp at least the basics of my legal conclusions, butwhether you agree or disagree with them, or even fully understand them, pleasedon’t let that interfere with the story. Whether you’re curious, skeptical, oreven if you already think I must be a clueless wacko, I ask you to simply absorbthe story, and reserve judgment until the end.“Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.”[Albert Einstein]I also want to emphasize that the title of this book is not “Defeating theDragon,” or even “Battling the Dragon,” but merely “Kicking the Dragon”—probably an act of sheer stupidity as much as anything else. If some wimpylittle peasant walked up to a huge dragon and kicked it, some people mightwonder why he did so. Well, I invited the federal government to prosecute me.Want to know why?FALSE ASSUMPTIONS“Oh, you’re one of those people!”While we humans like to consider ourselves to be thinking, rational beings,mostly what we do is parrot what we hear elsewhere, blindly jump from oneconclusion to the next, and engage in other forms of what I call “programthink”: the tendency of people to reach their beliefs and conclusions as theresult of utterly irrational mental reflexes.One of the most common manifestations of “program think” is wanting tocategorize and stereotype people based upon a speck or two of information. We’repretty much forced to do that on a regular basis, as we don’t have time to makean objective, careful analysis of everyone we meet. It’s also psychologicallyhandy to compartmentalize ideas as well as people. For example, anythingsounding like “I don’t have to pay taxes” is very easily categorized by mostpeople as some sort of “tax protest.” Anyone who doesn’t pay “his taxes” must bea nasty, unpatriotic, malcontent tax cheat who just doesn’t want to pay his fairshare, right?In the hope of fending off false assumptions in this case, I must list a fewthings that I do not believe, and things that I am not claiming. Hopefully thiswill keep my beliefs from slipping into categories in your brain where they donot belong.1) I did not refuse to pay my taxes.2) The reason I stopped filing tax returns was not because I object to taxes.3) I do not think that income taxes (or taxes in general) are unconstitutional.4) I am not a tax protestor.5) I did not end up in prison by cheating on anything, hiding anything, or lyingabout anything.If you’ve now run out of convenient conclusions to jump to, or handy categoriesor stereotypes to quickly fling me into, good! Now I can tell you what thisstory is about, or at least what started it: I believe that my income (andprobably yours, too) is not subject to the federal income tax.If you’re having troubling making sense of this so far, that’s good—it meansyou’re trying to reason instead of assuming. (It’s more trouble, but it’s goodfor us to do that on occasion.) So let’s take it slow and easy, and see whatthis is all about. Here goes:Governments write laws which impose taxes. Assumptions and guesses do not createlegal obligations; only legislation does. For example, if you were to assumethat life insurance benefits are subject to the federal income tax, you’d bewrong. Whatever you think should be taxed, or whatever you think is fair orunfair, unconstitutional or not, economically wise or stupid, etc., the issue athand here is something else entirely: Who, according to the law, owes federalincome taxes?Yes, the question sounds rather stupid. Apart from people with little or noincome, and maybe some people who are really good at jumping through tax codeloopholes, we all owe income taxes, right? We may not like it, but legally weowe it. Right? Maybe, maybe not. Please bear with me while we address thisseemingly stupid question.In an effort to keep this from getting too technical, let’s start with some verybasic (almost silly) points:1) The federal income tax applies only to “taxable income.” There is no tax uponnon-taxable income.2) It’s not unpatriotic, illegal or immoral to not pay something you don’t owe.For example, if you don’t distill whiskey, you have no legal, moral, orpatriotic duty to pay whiskey-distilling taxes. Likewise, if you don’t receiveany income which is subject to the federal income tax, then giving money to theIRS is neither virtuous nor patriotic; it is both silly and legally improper.3) The law, and only the law, determines what taxes people owe. (Whether the lawis immoral, unfair, unconstitutional, and/or stupid—whether or not you think youshould be taxed—is an entirely different question, and one which need not beaddressed here.)That third point, though patently obvious, can easily get mangled by backwardlogic and emotional thinking (or non-thinking). For example, when confrontedwith a claim that most Americans don’t legally owe federal income taxes, somerespond with things like “But how will the government function?” That may be areasonable question, but it has no bearing on whether someone owes a tax or not.The law alone determines that. (For example, someone who doesn’t distill whiskeyisn’t going to suddenly owe whiskey-distilling taxes just because the governmentsupposedly needs more money.)In short, the issue here has nothing to do with any political or moral opinion.It’s just about determining one’s tax liability, based entirely upon the lawitself—an issue which, on its face, might sound painfully boring. So pleasedon’t let political beliefs or moral opinions get in the way of examining whatis a purely academic issue.I should add, however, that while my conclusions about who owes federal incometaxes are based entirely upon the law, this story involves a lot more than alegal argument, and what can be learned from it is far more important— andhopefully a lot more interesting—than the technical intricacies of the federaltax code.IT MEANS WHAT IT SAYSImagine being pulled over and ticketed for driving 42 miles an hour in a 45 mphzone. “Wait a second, officer,” you protest, “the sign says 45, and I was onlydoing 42!” Instead of disagreeing, the cop confidently responds, “The speedlimit here is 25; that sign doesn’t apply to you.” Would you just accept that?Certainly not. You would be outraged, and rightfully so. But that would neverreally happen, right? Well, I’m in prison right now for doing exactly what thelaw commanded me to do.Question: How do you know how fast you’re allowed to drive on any given road?Answer: Look at the speed limit signs. Why? Because that’s what they’re for;it’s why they exist: to tell you how fast you can drive.Question: When figuring out your taxes, how do you determine how much domestic“taxable income” you have? Answer: Refer to the rules found in Section 861 ofthe Internal Revenue Code, and the “regulations” that go along with thatsection. Why? Because that’s what those sections are for; it’s why they exist:to tell you how to determine your “taxable income from sources within the UnitedStates.”Who says? The government says. The following shows the titles of a couple ofsections (and subsections) of the Internal Revenue Code.Section 861: “Income from sources within the United States”Subsection 861(a): “Gross income from sources within United States”Subsection 861(b): “Taxable income from sources within United States”Section 862: “Income from sources without [outside of] the United States”Subsection 862(a): “Gross income from sources without United States”Subsection 862(b): “Taxable income from sources without United States”Now, if you don’t do any foreign trading, but just earn a living in the UnitedStates, so far doesn’t it seem—based just on what you see above—that maybe youshould be looking at Section 861 of the tax code to figure out how much (if any)taxable domestic income you have? Here is a quote from an official IRSregulation reinforcing the point:“Sections 861(b) and 863(a) state in general terms how to determine taxableincome of a taxpayer from sources within the United States after gross incomefrom sources within the United States has been determined.” [26 CFR § 1.861-8](Just so you know, any time you see underline or bold emphasis within quotationsin this book, it is my own added emphasis, and doesn’t appear in the originalquote. Also, when you see the symbol that looks like someone stepped on aninchworm (“§”), it just means “section.”)The quote above is an official, legally binding instruction, courtesy of theCommissioner of the IRS and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, telling you andme how to determine our taxable domestic income. And it sure seems to be tellingus to use those particular sections, doesn’t it?So what? Would you believe that I’m in prison right now, clicking away on thisstupid typewriter, because I used Section 861(b) of the tax code, and theregulations related to it (1.861-8), to determine my “taxable income fromsources within the United States”? No, I’m not kidding. I was prosecuted andimprisoned for complying with official, legally binding commands, straight fromthe government’s own law books, including what you see above.“Oh, come on! There must be more to it than that! They wouldn’t prosecute youfor doing what the law told you to do!” Oh, really? Wouldn’t it be a story worthreading if they did?ONCE UPON A TIMEThe year was 1997. My wife, Tessa, and I lived in a little house in a suburb ofPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, where we ran a small medical transcription business.Of the $40,000 or so we brought in each year (nothing to brag about, with bothof us working full time on the business), about $10,000 was going to the IRS.(One reason it was that high is that we were considered “selfemployed.”)Needless to say, we weren’t exactly thrilled about that, but you know what theysay about death and taxes.Anyway, around that time I started hearing about various theories concerning theincome tax (other than “It stinks!”). I started looking into a few so-called“tax protestor” arguments that I came across on the internet. I found lots andlots of claims that ended with conclusions along the lines of “so we don’t haveto pay taxes!” Many of the claims were downright batty. A few others at leasthad interesting points to make or lines of reasoning, but one by one I foundthat, in the end, they just didn’t hold water. They were often based onmisunderstandings or misreadings (presumably inadvertent) of various laws orcourt decisions. They sounded too good to be true, and they were.After reviewing many such theories and claims, someone (I don’t remember who)pointed me in the direction of yet another “theory,” with a similar-soundingpunchline (i.e., “We don’t owe taxes! Yippee!”). The article was called “GrossIncome,” written by a man named Thurston Bell. Initially I had the classicprogram-think response: “That sounds like those other theories, and they allturned out to be wrong, so this one will be too.”(That is a fine example of intellectual guilt-by-association, which is easy tofall into, even if it is logically unsound. Just because one theory is flaweddoes not mean that every theory with a similar conclusion must also be flawed.For example, those people who long ago were stupid enough to jump off cliffswhile wearing cardboard wings with feathers glued to them did not prove thathuman flight was impossible; they only proved that they didn’t know how to doit. Likewise, while there have been many legally and logically flawed argumentsending in “so I don’t owe income taxes,” that is not a logical proof thateveryone does owe income taxes.)Again, the law alone determines who owes taxes, but the law tends to be boring,confusing, long-winded and convoluted. So let’s go read some tax law! Hooray!The good news is, if you can invest a bit of actual concentration for the nextfew pages, the rest of this book should be easy sailing—and will make a lot moresense.And for those few, weird people like me who actually like evidence, thoroughacademic analysis, and comprehensive proofs, I’m including my entire “TaxableIncome” report at the end of this book as Appendix A. For everyone else—allthose who want to skip the headache and get on with the story—what follows isthe short version.If you were to read Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (assuming you knewwhere to find the Internal Revenue Code), you would see that the law imposes atax on the “taxable income” of every individual. Section 1 also includes achart, showing how to determine how much you owe in taxes based on how much“taxable income” you received during the year. If your taxable income is zero,of course, your tax liability is also zero. Nothing surprising yet.If you continued reading the tax code, you’d eventually find that anothersection of the law (Section 63) says that, generally speaking, “taxable income”means “gross income” minus deductions. (Congress has a nasty habit of writinglegal definitions that use other terms that require even more legal definitions,so get used to it.) So from your “gross income,” you get to subtract certaincredits, exemptions, and deductions, in order to arrive at “taxable income.”Anyone who has filled out a 1040 form knows this, but let’s make a note to burnthe concept into our brains:[ Gross Income ] - [ Deductions ] = [ Taxable Income ]Still nothing earth-shattering. And another section of the tax code (Section 61)generally defines the legal term “gross income” to mean “all income fromwhatever source derived,” including things like compensation for services(wages), business income, interest, dividends, rents, and so on. In other words,the definition appears to include pretty much all of the normal types of incomepeople receive. So it would seem that we can change our equation to this:[ All Income ] - [ Deductions ] = [ Taxable Income ]That’s clear enough, isn’t it? But if it’s really that simple, why have we allheard about the monstrously voluminous and confusing tax code? If you look nofurther than those two general definitions, the conclusion seems obvious:everyone who has any income owes the tax (though he may be able to use a fewcredits and deductions to reduce the pain a bit). So go pay your fair share, andstop looking at the law!A LABORIOUS, PAINSTAKING JOURNEYWhile reading this story, please keep in mind that, prior to looking into theseissues, I had no training in tax law, or in any law. I’m not a CPA or anattorney. I had worked on a grounds crew and had done medical transcription(typing letters for doctors). Legal stuff was pretty dang foreign to me. When itcame to doing our tax returns, I let a computer program do it for me. It askedme questions, half of which I understood; it spat out a number; I grumbled abit, and paid it. But I was pretty darn clueless about the law itself.Were I to give a detailed account of all the basic stuff I had to learn aboutthe law before I could even begin to grasp the important stuff, this story wouldbe ridiculously long and horribly tedious. I started with a zillion questions,even about really basic stuff: Where do I even find the law? What does it looklike? How is it arranged? How do I know where in the law to look for any givensubject? What is a “statute”? What is a “regulation”? Who writes them? Whichparts are legally binding? What is the role of court rulings in all this? Doesit matter which court a ruling comes from? And what are all those dang randomnumbers in all of it, such as “26 CFR § 1.861-8(f)(1)(vi)(E)”? What sadisticlunatic came up with this system?!I had to learn it all from scratch. I will attempt to make the explanation of myfindings as simple and easy to follow as possible, but it was anything butsimple and easy when I went through it. Walk into any law library, and you’lllearn what I learned the first time I did it: the law is not set up to helpnormal people understand it. It is an insider’s game—a system of the lawyers, bythe lawyers, and for the lawyers. And woe unto the peasant who thinks thatunderstanding plain English is enough to keep him alive in the world of“legalese.” Below I will try, whenever possible, to translate all thelawyer-speak gobblety-gook into something fairly coherent and understandable,but keep in mind that that is not how it was when I found it.WANT TO KNOW A SECRET?As every tax preparer knows, there are certain sections of the tax code that saythat certain types of income (such as gifts, life insurance proceeds, andinterest on municipal bonds) are not subject to the federal income tax, but areinstead “exempt.” You don’t have to pay taxes on those kinds of income.(Woohoo!) And if you ask him, your tax preparer will confidently tell you thatall income is taxable, unless you can find such a section of the tax codespecifically saying that a certain kind of income is exempt.Well, as part of my investigation of the “wacky” claim that most Americans don’towe federal income taxes, I found myself in the law library in the basement ofthe county courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania. And while there, thumbingthrough a set of huge, old red books labeled “Federal Income Tax Regulations,” Istumbled across this:“Section 22(b) [of the 1939 tax code] exempts certain types of income ... Noother items may be excluded from gross income except ... those items of incomewhich are, under the Constitution, not taxable by the Federal Government.” [26CFR § 39.22(b)-1 (1956)]So, in addition to what the tax code says is exempt, some other income is alsonon-taxable because of the Constitution itself. Wait a second. That’s not what“conventional wisdom” says! All the tax pros say that all income is taxable,except for what the tax code specifically exempts. But there in front of me, inblack and white, were the government’s official regulations proving that the“experts” were either lying, or didn’t know what they were talking about. I ranto the library photocopier, with the big red book in hand, lest someone snatchit from my clutches before I could copy what I had found.In that same book, I also found another section explaining that the federalincome tax is imposed upon “income,” and that neither income exempted by statuteor by “fundamental law” (the Constitution) enters into the computation of “netincome” subject to the tax. Later I would find that the income tax regulationsincluded very similar wording every year from at least 1918 up through 1956. (Ilater learned that a couple of other people had found the same citations beforeI had, but this was the first I had ever heard of such a thing.)In short, I had found solid proof that the so-called “experts” do not knoweverything about the tax laws. In the many years since that discovery, I havetalked to dozens, if not hundreds, of tax professionals. Except for the ones whobelieve as I now do, never have I met one who knew that some income is taxexemptbecause of the Constitution itself. Nor have I met one who knew that theregulations ever said that. (Some “experts” they turned out to be.)And of course, since mainstream tax professionals don’t know that theConstitution itself makes some income non-taxable, they don’t tell their clientsabout it, and they don’t take it into account when determining what (ifanything) their clients owe in taxes. You may find this hard to believe, but younow know something about tax law which even the tax attorneys who rake inhundreds of thousands of dollars a year do not know. If you doubt this, tryasking your tax guy, “What kinds of income are exempt from federal income taxes,not because of any particular section of the tax code, but because of theConstitution itself?” His clueless expression will tell you all you need toknow.In fact, I challenge you to find any “status quo” tax professional anywhere whohas ever treated any income of a client as exempt due to the Constitutionitself. But whether it’s a few people or a few million people, somebody must bereceiving that constitutionally exempt income the regulations spoke of. Wouldn’tyou like to know whether you are one of those unlucky people who are unwittinglypaying taxes on non-taxable income, due to the uninformed advice of so-called“tax experts”?(To be modern about it, nowhere in any of the nifty tax-preparation software(TurboTax, TaxCut, etc.) will you find any reference to any income being exemptfrom tax because of the Constitution itself. And in case you thought that suchsoftware descends from on high as a gift from the infallible tax gods, Ipersonally know a guy who has written tax preparation software, and who nowacknowledges that at the time he was woefully ignorant of the actual tax laws.He now agrees with me that most Americans do not owe the tax, and he’s doingwhat he calls “penance” for inadvertently helping people pay taxes they didn’tactually owe. The vast majority of tax software writers, meanwhile, have yet torepent of their sins of ignorance. The point is, however slick the packaging,the software is written by people, and if those people don’t have all theevidence—and they don’t—the end result will be a misapplication of the law. Sowhether you misapply the law with a CPA or tax attorney, or misapply it with thehelp of snazzy-looking software, you’re still accepting on faith the opinions ofpeople who simply do not have all of the evidence.)To be blunt, the opinions of a million “experts” who don’t have all of theevidence are, all together, worth next to nothing. Imagine 1,000 zoologists whohad never heard of a platypus or an echidna, confidently declaring, “All mammalsgive birth to live young.” It only takes one bit of evidence (e.g., agoofy-looking, egg-laying mammal from Australia) to prove all of the “experts”dead wrong. And so it is with tax law as well. If a million “experts” don’t knowthat some income is tax-exempt because of the Constitution itself, then they arenot the ones to ask about who does and who does not owe taxes. It doesn’t matterwhat credentials they have, what plaques hang on their walls, or how highly paidor widely respected they are; if they don’t have all of the evidence, then their“expert” opinions will be incomplete, at best.At this point do you feel any “program think” kicking in? It might go somethinglike this: “There’s no way some wacko convict knows something about tax law thatmy expensive tax guy doesn’t!” So try asking your tax guy about it. Or don’t youdare to? (Sad to say, many who label themselves as “experts” tend to get verybelligerent and hostile when some lowly peon asks them a question that theycan’t answer. So don’t be surprised if your favorite tax pro gets a little testywhen you try to ask him about these things.)Expert-worship is a very common type of “program think.” We accept as gospel theproclamations of perceived “experts,” mainly because it’s a lot easier than eachof us having to figure out the whole world from scratch for ourselves. Thetrouble is that so-called “experts,” in many fields of thought, so often makecolossal blunders (e.g., poo-pooing the round-earth “theory,” poopooing germ“theory,” poo-pooing flying machines, poo-pooing supersonic travel, etc.). Infact, pick any important discovery or invention, and it’s almost a sure bet thatthe learned, credentialed “experts” of the day poo-pooed it.Getting back to the issue at hand, the following chart shows the categories intowhich all income can be divided—according to the tax professionals, and thenaccording to the actual income tax regulations published by the federalgovernment. Note the difference.[../Images/image0.jpg]Do you know if any of your income belongs in that second category on the right?If so, you’re not supposed to report that income on a tax return, and you’re notsupposed to pay taxes on it. But how are you to know whether you might have someof that income, when the tax professionals don’t even know there is such athing?In our system of written law, the law isn’t supposed to leave you guessing. Itmust tell you precisely what is required of you, or it would be considered “voidfor vagueness.” (The Supreme Court, in Connally v. General Const. Co., 269 U.S.385 (1926), explained that a law which is “so vague that men of commonintelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to itsapplication” is invalid.) So the question is not what you might guess istaxable, but what does the law say is taxable? There are only two possible waysthe law could answer the question about what is constitutionally taxable: 1) itcould specifically list or describe what is exempt (what is not taxable); or 2)it could specifically list or describe what is taxable (what is not exempt). Inother words, the law books should either say “Here is what is taxable...” or“Everything is taxable except for the following...”If you ever see anything in the law books that looks like a list of what isconstitutionally exempt, let me know. Having personally reviewed many hundredsof pages of tax statutes and regulations, including over eighty years’ worth ofolder law books, I have never seen such a list. However, I have seen a list, inboth current regulations and regulations dating back to long before I was born,specifically listing and describing types of income which are not exempt—i.e.,listing types of income which are subject to the federal income tax. Here is howthe list appeared in the older regulations defining “gross income,” from thosesame big, old red books I found in the Norristown courthouse law library:“Profits of citizens, residents and domestic corporations derived from sales inforeign commerce must be included in their gross income; but special provisionsare made for nonresident aliens and foreign corporations by sections 211 to 238,inclusive, and, in certain cases, by section 251, for citizens and domesticcorporations deriving income from sources within possessions of the UnitedStates.” [26 CFR § 39.22(a)-1 (1956)]And here is how the list of non-exempt income appears in the currentregulations:“Income that is not considered tax exempt. The following items are notconsidered to be exempt, eliminated, or excluded income and, thus, may haveexpenses, losses, or other deductions allocated and apportioned to them:(A) In the case of a foreign taxpayer (including a foreign sales corporation(FSC)) computing its effectively connected income ...(B) In computing the combined taxable income of a DISC or FSC and its relatedsupplier, the gross income of a DISC [domestic international sales corporation]or a FSC [foreign sales corporation];(C) For all purposes under subchapter N of the Code ... the gross income of apossessions corporation ...(D) Foreign earned income as defined in section 911 and the regulationsthereunder ...” [26 CFR § 1.861-8T(d)(2)(iii)] While arranged and worded differently, both lists (past and present) includecertain foreign income of Americans, certain income which foreigners receivefrom inside the U.S., and rules about federal possessions. (The term “federalpossessions” refers to places like Guam and Puerto Rico: territory outside ofthe 50 states but owned by the U.S. government.) Notice anything conspicuouslyabsent from both lists? What about the domestic income of the average American?Why is that not found on either list? That’s taxable too, isn’t it? (If you wantto further annoy your tax guy, ask him if he’s ever seen the sections quotedabove. The chances that he has are slim to none.)So, according to those big books of official federal tax regulations which Ifound in that Norristown law library, some income is tax-exempt because of theConstitution, but income from certain international trade—commerce crossingcountry borders or involving federal possessions—is not exempt, and taxes mustbe paid on that income. Okay, but what about my income? (And what about yourincome?)ASSUMPTIONS AND LAWSuppose you were reading the laws about driving a car, and you came across asection saying that you must have your headlights on whenever: 1) it is darkoutside, or 2) it is raining. Would you then assume that you must always haveyour headlights on, even when it is dry and sunny? Of course not. If the lawmeant “always,” it would say “always.” Why would you assume a requirement thatthe law doesn’t mention? You wouldn’t, and you shouldn’t. (What good is writtenlaw if it doesn’t bother specifically telling you what is required of you?)There is a principle of law, known as “inclusio unius est exclusio alterius,”which dictates that when the law “expressly describes a particular situation towhich it shall apply, an irrefutable inference must be drawn that what isomitted or excluded was intended to be omitted or excluded” (Black’s LawDictionary). In other words, if the law says only that it applies to A, B, C andD, you are to conclude that it does not also apply to E. If the legislaturewanted it to apply to E, they would have written the law to say so.With that in mind, why do the regulations (past and present) say that incomefrom certain foreign or international trade is not exempt (and therefore must bereported as “gross income”), without also saying the same about the domesticincome of most Americans? That’s a heck of a thing for the regulationwriters to“forget” to mention, don’t you think? Of course, it’s easy to just assume thatwhat they meant to say was that income from international trade, as well as frompurely domestic trade, is subject to the tax. Everyone “knows” that domesticincome is taxable. So shouldn’t we just assume that to be the case, even if thelaw doesn’t specifically say so?Well, the Supreme Court (in Gould v. Gould, 245 U.S. 151 (1917), and manysubsequent cases) has clearly stated that, when interpreting tax laws, oneshould not assume that they apply to any matters which are “not specificallypointed out,” and that tax laws are to be construed “most strongly against thegovernment, and in favor of the citizen.”So, in the regulations quoted from above, what do you see being “specificallypointed out”? (Hint: international trade.) And what is not specifically pointedout? Your income, perhaps? So if the law lists types of income which are taxable(not exempt), and your income is not on that list, what should you conclude?Could it be that the federal income tax applies only to income from certaintrade which crosses country borders?It’s time for another “program think” check. Is your brain objectively takingall this in, or is it groping for some reason why this can’t mean what it lookslike? There must be some other reason it says that. There must be some otherexplanation for the regulation saying that some income is exempt because of theConstitution itself. There must be some other reason why the regs (short for“regulations”) list international activities, but not the income of you and me,when they describe what income is not exempt. It can’t be that most Americansdon’t legally owe the tax! That’s impossible!Besides, you’re only hearing my side of the argument, right? What about theother side? What do the experts say about this? Having spent eight yearsconfronting numerous CPAs and attorneys with this evidence, I feel qualified toshare with you their “side” on this point: “No comment.” They don’t know thatthe law books ever said what you see above, and they have no explanation for it.In addition, in my years of confronting those in government with this evidence,I have never seen any IRS form letter or notice, or any court ruling at anylevel, which has even mentioned the regulations quoted above. Never. This isdespite the fact that thousands of Americans have specifically asked thegovernment about this issue. I also have never read or heard any IRS or DOJattorney or bureaucrat, or any judge at any level, even suggesting where the lawmight tell us what is and what is not constitutionally taxable. Instead, I haveseen and heard numerous government bureaucrats and attorneys and judges(including at my own trial) asserting and/or implying that all income istaxable, except for what is specifically exempted by the statutes of the taxcode. And they’re all provably dead wrong.But how could all of those thousands of “tax experts” be completely ignorantabout such a fundamental issue? How can they not know what is taxable and whatis tax-exempt? I mean, that’s what they do; those are the things they get paidto know. How could they all be that clueless? If you’re having trouble acceptingit, join the club. It’s a little like finding out that we all have another majorinternal organ that no doctor knows about. How could they all have rummagedaround in so many guts for so many years without any of them noticing it? Well,of the thousands of tax pros who have rummaged through the “guts” of the taxcode for decades, there are several very important guts that have gonecompletely unnoticed.There are several reasons for this. First, the tax pros don’t look at the actuallaw anywhere near as often as most people might expect. (There are a lot of taxlaw “guts,” and they aren’t very pleasant to look at.) Instead, the tax prosrely mainly on the legally worthless IRS “publications,” and textbooks writtenby other ignorant people, and so just pass on the flawed “conventional wisdom”from one generation to the next. Second, the important “guts” were verycarefully designed to be inconspicuous, and easy to miss. If one goes to the taxcode assuming that we all owe the tax, he’ll most likely come out with the sameconclusion, and just dismiss out of hand anything that shows up which he can’tunderstand or explain. The tax pros are familiar with a few tiny scraps from thelaw, but most of it is just as unfamiliar to them as it is to you.For example, those general definitions of terms like “gross income” and “taxableincome” by themselves certainly sound all-encompassing, and that’s as far asmost tax pros ever look. After all, how could those definitions not include allincome? Once again, after a little rummaging around, the law books hit me withthe answer. The Supreme Court (in McCullough v. Virginia, 172 U.S. 102 (1898))says that it is “elementary law” that, “however broad and general its language,”no statute should “be interpreted as extending beyond those matters which it waswithin the constitutional power of the legislature to reach.” So it makesperfect sense to have, on the one hand, a very broadly worded statutorydefinition of “gross income,” and on the other, regulations saying that someincome is nonetheless tax-exempt because it is, “under the Constitution, nottaxable by the federal government.”Also keep in mind, this is not a matter of a typo or mistake in the law books,nor is it some “loophole” that Congress could simply “fix” with new legislation.For decades the law books have clearly stated that there is some income which,because of the Constitution, Congress cannot tax, no matter how much it wantsto, and no matter how much it supposedly “needs” tax dollars. But could itreally be that, under the Constitution, Congress is allowed to impose an “incometax” only upon international trade? That’s far too weird to be true! Isn’t it?OPPOSING VIEWSIn any search for the truth (about anything), it’s good to see what all sides ofan argument have to say. While the government has done its best to forciblysilence my opinions (as you’ll soon see), I’m more than happy to publish theopinions of the other side, from both government and private individuals, thoughsubstantive attempts to address the issue by the other side have been few andfar between.One tax attorney in particular, Daniel Evans, has made it his personal missionto debunk so-called “tax protestor” theories. And, though some might not like tohear this from me, most of the time Mr. Evans does a pretty good job of it.(Many of the “anti-tax” theories I long ago found to be flawed, Mr. Evans alsodisputes for similar reasons.) Trouble is, once someone becomes attached to anagenda, such as defending conventional wisdom against “tax protestors,” hesometimes starts to engage in some pretty impressive mental gymnastics to avoidhaving to admit that he made a huge mistake.In an online, public internet discussion group, I had a number of exchangesabout my findings with Mr. Evans and other tax professionals. As an example of“expert” mental gymnastics, consider what happened when I asked some taxprofessionals what income was exempt from tax, not because of any specificsection of the tax code, but because of the Constitution itself. In other words,I asked them what income is, “under the Constitution, not taxable by the federalgovernment,” just like the older regulations said. In response, a few tax folkmade wild guesses, such as interest on municipal bonds, but everything theyguessed has always been exempted by statute in the tax code, so they flunked thetest. (Remember, the regulations say that in addition to what is exempted bystatute, some other income is constitutionally non-taxable.) After the incorrectguesses from a few other supposed tax experts, Mr. Evans chimed in with hisexpert opinion, enlightening all readers as to what the regulations werereferring to: absolutely nothing. That’s right, Mr. Evans declared that, otherthan what is exempted by statute, no income is constitutionally exempt. He thenopined that the regulations obviously saying the exact opposite were “badlyworded.”Badly worded? I’ve seen a lot of badly worded, convoluted and confusingregulations, but what we’re looking at here is not just a case ofless-than-ideal phraseology. The older regulations said that you were supposedto exclude from your “gross income” that income which is constitutionallynon-taxable. It’s a bit beyond “bad wording” to say the exact opposite of whatyou mean, yet that is how Mr. Evans (experienced tax attorney) tried to explainthis away.And that illustrates a point which is far more important than the silliness ofone self-proclaimed expert. When there are two conflicting conclusions whichseek to explain a collection of evidence, that can make for an interesting andworthwhile debate. When, on the other hand, one side of an argument blatantlycontradicts or ignores the evidence (as Mr. Evans did), why would theconclusions—or, more accurately, “assertions”—of that side deserve any credence?Is it okay to ignore the evidence and make provably false statements if you haveenough credentials?Much of the “debate” I’ve seen regarding what has become known as the “861evidence” (which is a sort of shorthand nickname for the legal issue involvedhere) has ended up going in that direction: the people on my side believe thatthe words in the law mean what they say, whereas the tax professionals insistthat the law means the opposite of what it says. (Then people chastise me forthinking I could possibly know any better than the “experts.”)This is something a lot of people have come up against in a lot of differentfields of thought: all the credentialed, formally trained “experts”unequivocally declare that “X” is the gospel truth, while the evidence itselfobviously proves that “Y” is the truth. And what do the onlookers do? Theyusually accept “X” as indisputable doctrine. They accept at face value theassertions of the “experts,” while assuming that such assertions must be backedby evidence and logic—albeit evidence and logic the general public never asks tosee, and never gets to see.So, when deciding which income is taxable, the law books say one thing, and theself-proclaimed “experts” say another. What should you believe? Well, if youwant to join me here in prison, believe your own eyes. If not, you’d better justblindly accept the provably incorrect assertions of people in power.BUT WHY?Suppose you are a United States citizen living and working in Florida, and oneday you get a tax bill for $3,673 from the government of China. What do you do?Probably either ignore it, or write them a nasty letter telling them you don’towe them anything. But how can you be so sure? Because you don’t do anythingthat’s any of their business. The technical term for “any of their business” is“jurisdiction.” Working in Florida, you aren’t doing anything which is under thejurisdiction of the Chinese government. That’s a no-brainer.But here’s a twist: is the guy working in Florida under the jurisdiction of theUnited States federal government? Contrary to what almost everyone in thecountry would assume, the answer is “no.” Under the U.S. Constitution, thefederal government has jurisdiction over only a few, specific things happeningwithin the 50 states (the main ones being listed in Article I, Section 8 of theConstitution). And generally speaking, doing business in one of the 50 states isnot a federal matter. If you think I’m making this up, read on. In one case,after saying that Congress does have jurisdiction over commerce which crossesstate and country borders, the Supreme Court added this:“But very different considerations apply to the internal commerce or domestictrade of the states. Over this commerce and trade Congress has no power ofregulation nor any direct control. This power belongs exclusively to the states.No interference by Congress with the business of citizens transacted within astate is warranted by the Constitution, except such as is strictly incidental tothe exercise of powers clearly granted to the legislature.” [License Tax Cases,5 Wall 462]If this comes as a surprise to you, don’t worry, you’re not alone—not by a longshot. If the media and education system weren’t so pathetically inept, moreAmericans might still know this stuff. (Just to further upset your comfortableassumptions with another dig at “conventional wisdom,” if you think thePresident is chosen via public election, go read the Constitution.)To oversimplify a bit here, what a government has no jurisdiction to regulate,it has no jurisdiction to control via “taxation” either. (See Appendix A, my“Taxable Income” report, for a thorough explanation of this point.) If you earnyour living doing international trade—or, as the Constitution puts it, engagingin “commerce with foreign nations”—then you are doing something which is underfederal jurisdiction, and Congress could (and did) impose a tax on the incomeyou receive from such business. Once again, if you think this is just some wildtheory I made up, check out the following quote from another Supreme Court caseI came across during my studies. The case was about how the 1913 federal incometax applied to an American company which was selling products in foreigncountries.“The Constitution broadly empowers Congress not only ‘to lay and collect taxes,duties, imposts, and excises,’ but also ‘to regulate commerce with foreignnations.’ So ... Congress undoubtedly has power to lay and collect such a tax asis here in question.” [Peck v. Lowe, 247 U.S. 165 (1918)]In other words, the Court said that because of Congress’ general taxing powertogether with its specific jurisdiction over international trade, it could“undoubtedly” impose an income tax upon income from international trade. Thenext obvious question—which, unfortunately, neither the court nor the companybrought up in that case—is, “What about income from trade or commerce over whichCongress does not have specific jurisdiction—like, for example, a citizenworking in one of the 50 states?”For over eighty years the Supreme Court has very curiously avoided directlyaddressing that question. In fact, in one case handled by an attorney I know—the same one who ended up being my “standby counsel” at my trial—the governmentlawyers came right out and admitted the following (in writing): “The governmentis unable, therefore, to offer case authority for the universally acceptedproposition that a citizen of the United States, working and residing in theUnited States, subject to federal law, earning wages, and responsible for filingan income tax return, is liable for taxation.” In other words, “everybody knows”that the average American owes the tax, but the government can’t find any courtcases which have specifically decided that.While the courts were avoiding the question like the plague, however, thefederal tax regulations, as we saw above, were nice enough to tell everyonethat: 1) some income is tax-free because of the Constitution; and 2) income fromcertain international trade is subject to the tax. Coincidence? I think not.James Madison himself, often called the “Father of the Constitution,” said this:“The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government arefew and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerousand indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, aswar, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power oftaxation will, for the most part, be connected.” [James Madison, Federalist #45]Got that? The “Father of the Constitution” said that the federal governmentwill, for the most part, get its revenue by taxing foreign commerce. (Nowthere’s something they don’t teach in school.)(As an aside, there is a popular misconception that the Sixteenth Amendment tothe Constitution gave Congress the power to tax any income it pleases, but theSupreme Court has stated in no uncertain terms that the Sixteenth Amendment“conferred no new power of taxation” upon Congress, that that amendment “doesnot extend the taxing power to new or excepted subjects,” that it did not“render anything taxable as income that was not so taxable before,” and in factthat the words “from whatever source derived,” as used in the amendment, werenot intended to have any effect “on which incomes were subject to federaltaxation.” (For all of the citations for those quotes, see Appendix A of thisbook.) Furthermore, the regulations cited above, which talk about some incomebeing exempt due to the Constitution, were all written after the SixteenthAmendment was enacted (in 1913). So if you thought the Sixteenth Amendment gaveCongress the power to tax any and all income, think again.)In short, the law itself shows that Congress imposed an income tax upon incomederived from “commerce with foreign nations,” over which the Constitution givesit jurisdiction, while not taxing income from purely domestic commerce, overwhich it does not have general jurisdiction (any more than it has generaljurisdiction over everyone in China). Now, if at this point you’re assuming Imust be wrong, must be misreading or missing something, or that I’m just plainoff my rocker, that’s quite all right. Skepticism is healthy. If you find thecitations I’m quoting even slightly curious, that’s good enough for now. Again,you’re allowed to think I’m wrong, or even crazy, as long as you grasp myposition just enough to be able to follow the story below.THE MAGIC NUMBER: 861There are really two independent routes through the law which prove that thefederal income tax is a tax only upon international trade. We just brieflycovered the first one, having to do with some income being non-taxable becauseof the Constitution, and only international trade being listed in the law booksas being non-exempt (taxable). But there is another way to prove the truth, andit has to do with Section 861 of the Internal Revenue Code. Notice that thefirst route to the truth doesn’t even mention Section 861, demonstrating that,despite the fact that my legal conclusions are often referred to as the “861argument,” the issue is not just about the meaning of one lone section of thetax code. Far from it.Going back to how I came across the issue, the article I had read titled “GrossIncome” (by Thurston Bell) basically posited that there was a certain place inthe federal regulations which lists the types of activities that produce“taxable income,” and that income from any activities not listed therein was notsubject to the federal income tax. The article then quoted from a certainregulation (26 CFR § 1.861-8(f)(1)) which listed a bunch of activities relatedto international trade and federal possessions.The first obvious question which sprang to my mind was this: Why is he lookingat that section? I’m sure I can find lots of sections in the tax code that talkabout things which don’t apply to my situation. That doesn’t mean I don’t oweany taxes; maybe the sections about me are simply found somewhere else. If,however, that really was the place to look in the law to determine what istaxable for you and me, then it would be more than a little curious (to say theleast) for it to mention only international stuff.So, to put the claim to the test, the first step was to determine if there wasany reason to be looking at Section 861 to begin with. I put on my SherlockHolmes cap, got out my oversized magnifying glass, and went to work.I looked up a couple of sections mentioned in the “Gross Income” article, andsure enough, they did indeed say that 861 and its regulations are the place tolook to determine “taxable income from sources within the United States.” Andthose citations did not say that those sections were just for certain people incertain situations—they said, in black and white, without condition orexception, that 861 and its regulations tell how to determine a taxpayer’staxable domestic income. Period.As I kept researching the issue, I kept finding one quote after another—in thestatutes, the regulations, the indexes, and so on—saying, unequivocally andunconditionally, that 861 and its regs are the sections to use to determineone’s “gross income” and “taxable income” from sources inside the United States.Okay, so Mr. Bell really did have a good reason to be looking there. The nextstep was to determine what those sections said, and what kinds of income theyshowed to be taxable.A WALK DOWN MEMORY LANEIn my research into Section 861, I learned the entire story backward. I startedwith the current statutes and regulations, and only later found out where theyhad come from, and the changes which those sections had gone through over theyears. To spare the reader the confusion and headaches I had to go through, I’llexplain this point by examining the law as it “evolved” over time, rather thanexamining the evidence in the order I found it, which was completely backward.(Try reading a book starting on the last page and working your way back to thefirst page, and you’ll have a good idea of what I went through trying to makesense of what I had found.)By sheer luck—or providence, if you prefer—some guy I didn’t know happened tofind a dusty old copy of a federal “Revenue Act” from the 1920s in a usedbookstore, and posted a scan of Section 217 of that act on the internet (forreasons unrelated to the 861 evidence). And then I happened to stumble across itas a result of doing internet word searches. (I don’t even remember what I wassearching for.) After a little trying, I managed to contact the guy who hadposted it, and he generously sent me a copy of the entire Revenue Act. Thesection that he had posted, which caught my eye, looked like this (I’ve takenout some extraneous text here for the sake of brevity):“Sec. 217. (a) In the case of a nonresident alien individual or of a citizenentitled to the benefits of section 262, the following items of gross incomeshall be treated as income from sources within the United States:(1) Interest on bonds, notes, or other interest-bearing obligations ofresidents, corporate or otherwise ...(2) The amount received as dividends (A) from a domestic corporation ...(3)Compensation for labor or personal services performed in the United States;(4) Rentals or royalties from property located in the United States ...(5) Gains, profits, and income from the sale of real property located in theUnited States.(b) From the items of gross income specified in subdivision (a) there shall bededucted the [allowable deductions]. The remainder, if any, shall be included infull as net income from sources within the United States.” [Section 217, RevenueAct of 1925] Trying to wade through legalese can be difficult, especially for us merepeasant-folk, so read it carefully, and read it twice. In short, it lists somecommon types of domestic income (numbered 1 through 5), and says that, afterdeductions, such income is taxable for “nonresident aliens” (people who aren’tU.S. citizens and don’t live in the U.S.), and for citizens who are “entitled tothe benefits of section 262.” A little more research revealed that Section 262of that Revenue Act was only about those who received most of their income fromwithin federal possessions (e.g., Guam and Puerto Rico).Time out! Doesn’t conventional wisdom say that the types of domestic incomelisted in that section are taxable for everyone, including all Americans? Aren’twages earned in the U.S., for example, taxable for all U.S. citizens (andforeigners, too)? So why on earth would there be a section pointing out thatwages earned in the U.S. are taxable for foreigners and for certain Americans incertain unusual circumstances? What gives?What you see above (the old Section 217) is the “grandfather” of the currentSection 861. Now do you see why the feds really don’t want you looking there todetermine your taxable income? No one would mistake that older section to meanthat domestic income is taxable for all Americans. It very clearly spelled outfor whom such income was taxable, and it wasn’t you and me (assuming you’re anAmerican who earns a living inside the U.S.). Remember, we’re not supposed toassume that tax laws apply to matters “not specifically pointed out,” so whywould the law specifically point out that domestic income is taxable for certainpeople, while not saying it’s taxable for the average American? After all, itwould have been so easy to make the section say that domestic income is taxablefor all Americans—in fact, it would have taken a lot fewer words to say thatthan to say what it did.CONSPIRACY THEORYIf you look at the current Section 861, all by itself, you will not see what theold Section 217 said. It still lists various types of domestic income, but thevery beginning of it changed. Throughout the 1920s, the section started likethis:“In the case of a nonresident alien individual or of a citizen entitled to thebenefits of section 262, the following items of gross income shall be treated asincome from sources within the United States: ...”It was pretty darn obvious who it was about. But ever since 1932, it has startedlike this:“The following items of gross income shall be treated as income from sourceswithin the United States: ...”Where did the stuff about foreigners and federal possessions go? Had somethingchanged? Had domestic income become taxable for everyone? After visiting allsorts of law libraries, digging up the corresponding regulations from manydifferent years, I can confidently answer: No, the correct application of thelaw did not change, but the wording was changed so that you wouldn’t know thatyou don’t owe the tax. Yes, I’m alleging a conspiracy (which means only thatmore than one person cooperated to do something nasty).Sound kooky? Again, my “Taxable Income” report (Appendix A of this book) goesinto a lot more detail than I will here, but in short, there were at least adozen changes to the wording of that part of the law since the 1920s which, whentaken together, paint an unmistakable picture of an attempt to hide the factthat income from inside the U.S. has always been taxable for foreigners, and forcertain Americans (those doing business in federal possessions), but not for therest of us.OPPOSING VIEWS, AGAINOnce again, a good investigator will want to know what the “other side” of theargument makes of all this. I have always been consistent about my position, thebasics of which can be summed up as: 1) I should be using the regs under 861 todetermine my taxable income; and 2) those sections do not show my income to betaxable. I therefore conclude that I don’t owe any tax on my domestically earnedincome. On the other hand, those desperate to maintain “conventional wisdom”don’t seem to mind jumping around from one position to another. For example, inour internet debates, Daniel Evans (the tax attorney mentioned above) wouldregularly jump back and forth between two conflicting positions: 1) Youshouldn’t be looking at 861; it’s not about you! and 2) Section 861 means thatyour domestic income is taxable!While both are provably incorrect, it’s important to note that the two claimsdon’t even match each other. In our exchanges, Mr. Evans would insist that Ishouldn’t be looking to 861 at all—it was only for certain people in unusualcircumstances—until I bludgeoned him into submission by citing a pile ofregulations saying the opposite. (If you have too much time on your hands, go onthe internet and look up 26 CFR §§ 1.861-1(a)(1), 1.861-1(b), 1.861-8(a)(1),1.862-1(b), and 1.863-1(c), and you’ll see what I mean.) Then, once it becameabsurd to claim that I shouldn’t be looking there at all, Mr. Evans would jumpover to a new argument: Section 861 means your income is taxable anyway! ThenI’d show the history of the section (like the old Section 217, shown above), andthe regulations related to the current section, proving that that too is deadwrong, after which he would go back to saying I shouldn’t be looking there atall. Eventually we got to the point where, when I’d ask whether I should beusing 861 and its regs or not, Mr. Evans would keep his feet firmly planted onboth sides of the fence by saying that it doesn’t matter whether I use 861 ornot. While that is also not true, how weird is it for a highly paid tax lawyerto keep changing his mind about what parts of the law we’re all supposed to useto figure out what we owe? They can’t keep their own position straight!LIE BY OMISSIONAs a friend of mine likes to say, the hardest thing to see is what isn’t there.For over eighty years the federal income tax code has included sectionsspecifically about income from inside the United States (domestic income) andincome from outside the U.S. (foreign income). Over those eighty-plus years, thesections about domestic income have never once mentioned the income of theaverage American. Never. Meanwhile, those specific types of foreign andinternational trade have been specifically mentioned in the tax code since wellbefore my parents were born.And therein lies the trick: if you, as an American working in the fifty states,go to the tax code assuming that you owe federal income taxes, you will findnothing specifically and succinctly telling you otherwise. If, on the otherhand, you read the law hoping to find out whether your income is subject to thetax, you will find nothing specifically telling you that it is. So, if you wish,you can easily go about your life blindly assuming that your income is taxable,but the law has never said it’s taxable.Technically speaking, the law is perfectly valid. The law doesn’t have to tellyou what all is exempt; it only needs to tell you what all is taxable, and itdoes exactly that. If you baselessly assume that your income is taxable, eventhough the law never says so, that’s your own damn fault. (If, on the otherhand, you do as the law itself says, the IRS and the United States “Departmentof Justice” will put you on their list of people to destroy, and you might winan involuntary vacation at “club fed” too.)"},{"pageContent":"PART II:TESTING THE IDEATAKING THE PLUNGESo that’s the brief summary of the issue. To recap, here are the main thingsworth noting which the law, past and present, tells us:1) Some income specifically not exempted by the tax code is nonetheless exemptfrom tax because of the Constitution itself.2) Income from certain international trade is taxable (not exempt).3) There are certain sections of law to use for determining taxable domesticincome (now Section 861 and related regs).4) Those sections show U.S. source income to be taxable for foreigners and forpeople with possessions income, but not for the average American.5) One should not assume that tax laws apply to “matters not specificallypointed out.”Notwithstanding “common knowledge” to the contrary, what that logically adds upto is this: most Americans, including myself and my wife, do not owe federalincome taxes, and never have.(I should add that I don’t want the reader, based on the fact that I’m givingonly the short explanation of the issue here, getting the impression that I justglanced at a few sections of law and jumped to the conclusion that I don’t owethe tax. On the contrary, I spent many hundreds of hours reading, re-reading,and re-re-reading hundreds of pages of statutes, regulations, and courtcases—both recent and going back almost a century—before becoming convinced ofmy conclusions. But if I gave a detailed account of all my trips to various lawlibraries and all my long nights on the computer looking up and reading taxlaws, this book would be longer than the Code of Federal Regulations, andequally boring. Again, if you want a better understanding of the issue, readAppendix A of this book. Or you could grab a few hundred cups of coffee and readthe entire federal tax code from start to finish.)AN AWKWARD POSITIONWhether you accept my conclusions or not, stand back for a second and considerthe predicament I found myself in. To be blunt, I had compiled evidence of whatI believed to be the largest financial fraud in history. If what I had concludedwas correct, about a hundred million of my “neighbors” were being tricked androbbed on a yearly basis—and not of a few bucks here and there, but in amountsbig enough to cause millions of people real financial hardship, adding up to atotal of over a trillion dollars a year! It was too weird to be true. It wasimpossible. The significance of it was incomprehensible. The conclusion was toooutrageous to be credible, and yet there was no other explanation for all theevidence that I had right in front of me.“When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however unlikely, must bethe truth.” [Sherlock Holmes (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle)]And if my goofy-sounding conclusions were correct, what the heck was I supposedto do about it? I was a little nobody, with no credentials and no legalbackground or training. Who would listen to me? And if they did, who would evertake what I was saying seriously enough to look at the evidence? And if peopledid start paying attention—well, there were a lot of people with a lot of powerwho wouldn’t exactly be happy about it. But after all my work, was I just goingto throw it away and pretend I had never seen it? Pretend I didn’t know what Iknew? Heck, no. Regurgitating the red pill was not an option.After much hand-wringing, fretting and pondering, back in early 1998 my wife andI made the radical decision to stop filing federal income tax returns—notbecause we didn’t like paying taxes, but because the law itself had told us thatwe had no “taxable income” to report, and hence no federal income taxes to pay.In fact, from that point on it would have been a felony (under 26 USC § 7206)for either of us to have signed a return swearing that we had received taxableincome, when we had every reason to believe that that wasn’t true. (Of course,the government would never prosecute us for over-stating our tax liability, butit was the principle of the thing.)One thing we decided right away was that we were not going to hide what we weredoing, or be at all sneaky about it. Why bother sneaking when we were obeyingthe law? So we made it a point from the beginning to tell the government exactlywhat we were doing, and why. Instead of trying to hide, we spent much efforttrying to get someone from the government to discuss the issue with us, and toshow us anything in the law which we might have been missing. The results of ourefforts to have a reasonable dialogue about it, however, ended up beingdownright surreal.PAPER-PUSHINGIt started with letters. A lot of them. By themselves the letters between myselfand the IRS could fill a book, though mostly it would be a redundant, boringbook, since I was explaining the same things over and over again, and they weresending the same stupid non-responses back over and over again. Based upon allthe letters I’ve received from the IRS myself, and the letters other peoplereceived from the IRS and then showed to me, I have reached the followingconclusions:1) IRS employees are the ultimate paper-pushers, believing that sending outpieces of paper with ink on them, regardless of the content, completely fulfillsany obligations and duties they may have. Whether the words on the paper theysend out form any ideas that are factually, legally, or grammatically correct isbeside the point. In fact, being slightly coherent or remotely relevant doesn’tseem to be a requirement either; as long as they send you a piece of paper withink on it, they believe they have done their job.2) About the only thing IRS employees do well is demand money. They can’texplain why you owe it, or how they came up with the amount they’re demanding(which is usually rather large), but they can demand it nonetheless. Even inwhat should be run-of-the-mill, simple cases, the exchange often ends up beingsomething like this:IRS: “You owe us $12,642.53.”Citizen: “I’m not sure why you think that. Can we meet to discuss it?”IRS: “Now you owe us $17,312.58, and we really mean it.”Citizen: “I’ve enclosed a detailed analysis of my finances, including allsupporting records (put together by my expensive CPA). Please let me know whenwe can sit down and go over this.”IRS: “Now you owe us $43,625,125.05, and we intend to eat your children if youdon’t pay us right now.”Okay, that may have been a slight exaggeration, but only slight.3) IRS employees are (with very rare exceptions) incapable of thinking outsidethe box. In fact, calling it a “box” gives them way too much credit, since a boxhas three dimensions, and IRS agents have only one. To them, reality is a line:“We demand; you pay.”4) IRS employees do what they’re told to do, and nothing else. If what they weretold to do happens to be irrational, illegal, unfair, or utterly idiotic, itmakes no difference to them. In fact, they wouldn’t even notice. They can’tthink; they can only obey. Their careers can be summed up by the Nurembergdefense: “I was just doing what I was told.”5) IRS employees know less about tax law than the average high school dropout—orthe average loaf of bread. They acknowledge that there is something called “thelaw,” and that it is in some vague way related to what they do, but they’venever actually seen it, and are instantly turned to stone (blank-faced,stupefied stone) when it is put in front of them. Basic English is a challengeto them; the “legalese” of statutes and regulations might as well be written inSwahili.It is difficult for the average person to comprehend the nature of the IRS untilhe has experienced the insanity first-hand. Everyone has witnessedrun-of-the-mill stupidity or incompetence, but tax collectors take things to awhole new level. One fine example I had the pleasure of experiencing myself wasa many-months-long dispute with the Philadelphia Department of Revenue,resulting entirely from the Philadelphia tax collectors being incapable ofcomprehending the fact that I do not live or work in Philadelphia, and that Inever have. (That doesn’t seem like a very complex issue to me, but they hadmajor problems grasping the point.)And while, in most areas of life, you can simply choose to avoid stupid orincompetent people, that’s not the case with IRS bureaucrats. The inescapabilityof lunkheaded tax collectors, and their ability to ruin lives, is what makesthem so scary.But I digress. Back to the story.When my wife and I stopped filing after 1997, we also decided to ask, viasomething called a “claim for refund,” that the money we sent the IRS in 1994,1995 and 1996 be given back to us. (Correcting or “amending” previously filedreturns is a common procedure, though one must do it within three years offiling the original return.) And we had made a very big error that neededcorrecting: reporting our income as if it were taxable. We didn’t know anybetter at the time.We had many adventures concerning our claims for refund before our not filingfor 1997 or subsequent years really became an issue. Not long after the claimswere filed (in early 1998), I came to the realization that the most potentweapon the IRS has is the incompetence, stupidity and disorganization of itsemployees. No, I’m not being sarcastic. Let me explain.The IRS has millions of unwilling victims, which it bizarrely refers to as“customers” (which is about as appropriate as calling car-jacking victims“customers”). The people who really do serve customers know that you have toprovide customers with something they want. Not so with the IRS. When you have adispute with a store, you can always walk away and not come back. That doesn’twork very well with tax collectors. They have no incentive to be reasonable.They have the club, and they hit you with it until you “comply.” That is theirversion of “customer service.”But how does the IRS benefit from its own incompetence? Imagine a basic taxdispute. Suppose the IRS denied a certain deduction, and you think they werewrong to do so. (This is assuming you either had taxable income, or thought youdid.) If you challenge them on it, which of the following scenarios best servesthe IRS’s interests? 1) A polite, competent, knowledgeable employee considersthe case, and maybe even agrees with you and fixes the problem, or; 2) A bunchof bumbling idiots misunderstand the issue, lose your letters, send the case tosome equally clueless bozo in some other state, and finally send you a nastyletter saying you owe them an additional $3,252.61 in penalties and interestwhich accrued while they were playing “hot potato” with your file. See the powerof incompetence? The end result is that most people just give up and paywhatever arbitrary amount the IRS says they owe. (The other option is to pay atax attorney $1,000 to defend your $46.15 deduction, which isn’t much better.)On paper, the IRS’s official rules say that if the IRS folk disagree with yourreturn for any reason, you have a right to sit down with them to discuss thematter. But don’t hold your breath waiting for that to happen. Regarding ourclaims for refund, I wrote to or spoke on the phone with half a dozen differentIRS employees, in three different offices, before they even acknowledged thatthere were amended returns that they needed to do something about. To make apainfully long story relatively short, it took me two years from the time theclaims were filed to the time the IRS finally agreed to meet with me to discussthem. This was despite the fact that I always responded in writing (by certifiedmail) the same day that I received anything from the IRS. After all that, forthe 1994 claim they just made up a date when they said they received it, andthen said I had filed it too late. So I sent them a copy of their own priorletter, acknowledging that the claim was filed on time.As a humorous—or possibly depressing—aside, I know two different people whoreceived both of the following: 1) A letter from the IRS saying that a claim forrefund had never been received; and 2) A letter from the IRS attempting toimpose a fine on the person for having filed a “frivolous” claim—via the returnthey said they had never received. “Dear taxpayer, we’re penalizing you forsending us the thing we said you didn’t send us.” Behold, the awesome power ofsheer idiocy.So, in early 1998 my wife and I filed three claims (for three different years),one of which the IRS “lost” twice, and another of which they admitted receivingbut then ignored. Nearly two years after we filed the claims, they granted me ameeting.Before telling the grisly tale of what occurred at that first meeting, a fewwords must be said about the intimidating power of the IRS. Just the name,“IRS,” strikes terror into the hearts of millions. Receiving letters that say“Internal Revenue Service” in the return address invariably causes spirits todrop and blood pressures to rise (and don’t think that’s not by design). ThoughI’m now a bit ashamed to admit it, back then getting things from the IRS had thesame effect on me. It’s an amazing phenomenon, really. The first time I calledan actual IRS person, I was all nerves. Why? Did I think that Ms. Andreu—see, Ieven still remember her name—would reach through the phone and strangle me? No.At least probably not. And that first call was about asking for money back whichwe had already given the IRS, so the worst they could do was say no, and we’d beno worse off than we were before. Yet the terror was still there. How manydisputes simply never happen because people would rather put up with a certainamount of injustice than have to deal with the IRS?During that first call, in which I was disputing the IRS’s right to just ignoremy claims for refund as if they had never been filed, Ms. Andreu told me that Iwas just “delaying the inevible.” No, that is not a typo; that’s what she said(her “speako”). However, I guess being denied a meeting wasn’t “inevitable”after all, because I met with the infamous IRS in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, onApril 18, in the year 2000.MEETING THE BEASTAt first I considered omitting from this book the names of particular governmentagents, but have since decided against it. If shame and public humiliation isthe only punishment these people ever get, the only deterrent to theirmisconduct, then they’re getting off easy. So let the shame and humiliationbegin! The fact that several of these bureaucrats also lied under oath at mytrial removes any guilt I might have otherwise felt at exposing their idiocy tothe world.Let me set the stage. The scene: a simple conference room in the Jenkintownoffices of the IRS. On one side of the ring we had me, my mom, and anotherwitness. (My wife wasn’t at this first meeting.) In the other corner we hadthree IRS employees:1) Cathy Spaulding, the quintessential federal bureaucrat, looking neithercheerful nor alert. She was in charge of the case.2) Michael Enz, a belligerent IRS “specialist,” who looked and sounded like akneecap-smasher for the mob, who came all the way from the downtown Philadelphiaoffices of the IRS just for me.3) Mort Kafrissen, senior IRS supervisor, there to observe. Mr. Kafrissen, anelderly gentleman, holds the honor of being the only IRS employee I’ve ever hadofficial dealings with who did not say anything utterly idiotic or behaveobnoxiously. So my hat’s off to you, Mr. Kafrissen, even if you think I’m nuts.The issue was our 1994 and 1995 claims for refund. (By then our 1996 claim wasin bureaucratic limbo, from which it never escaped.) Having concluded that ourincome was not taxable, and that we therefore didn’t actually owe the IRS themoney we had given them in those prior years, we wanted it back. Notsurprisingly, the IRS wasn’t eager to give it back.I approached the meeting, not with any hope of bludgeoning them with law andreason until they agreed with me (which I knew wasn’t likely to happen), butwith the hopes of at least determining the precise points on which we disagreed,which I could then appeal to the next level. I also wanted to see what, ifanything, they could come up with that might make me reconsider my conclusions.So my main goal at the meeting was merely to state my position and then get theIRS to state its position on the specifics of the issue. Sounds simple enough,doesn’t it?Because of the complexity of the legal issue, a couple of weeks before themeeting I sent Agent Spaulding a detailed letter in which I explained thevarious points of my position, and included numerous supporting quotes from thelaw books (complete with citations so she could look them up for herself). Myletter included this:“In order to facilitate a meaningful and constructive meeting, I have attached abrief description of a few issues which I believe to be central to a possiblecontention between myself and the IRS. This is not a request for a writtenresponse; I am informing you of the relevant issues so that you may be preparedto address these matters at the time of the meeting. (This should give you timeto seek the assistance of district counsel if you are not personally familiarwith the legal issues involved.)”And now I was finally getting that meeting. Having been escorted deep into theheart of the enemy camp, and then closed—and even locked, as I recall—into anondescript conference room with three experienced IRS agents (I had my momthere to protect me), I had my chance to argue my case. Little old me, anon-lawyer peasant, on the IRS’s home turf, up against the all-knowing,all-powerful IRS.I audio-recorded the meeting (and so did they), having warned them ahead of timethat I was going to do so. Once both recorders were running, the meeting startedwith Agent Spaulding stating the date and time—and getting it wrong. (My mom hadto correct her. Way to go, Mom!) After Ms. Spaulding noted who was present andsummarized the reason for the meeting, I got my chance to make my case.I gave a brief overview of the issue, including the two independent lines ofreasoning which led me to believe I don’t owe the tax: 1) The law books in manyplaces say that I should use Section 861 and its regulations to determine mytaxable domestic income, and those sections do not show my income to be taxable;and 2) The regulations say that those common types of income listed in thegeneral definition of “gross income” are not always taxable, but are sometimesexempt, and then say that income from certain international trade is not exempt.And applicable to both is the legal principle that I should not assume that thelaw applies to matters not specifically pointed out.For each point I gave them printouts of several citations supporting myposition. And then it was time to ask the IRS folk to either agree or disagreewith me on each point. There I was, sitting across a table from the big, badIRS, braced for the awesome onslaught of their impressive and persuasive legalknowledge.What I got from them instead was a pitifully embarrassing display of ignorance,a complete inability to reason, and only a partial ability to read. My firstquestion, after summarizing my position, was whether they agreed or disagreedthat Section 861 and following, and the related regulations, determine the“sources” of income subject to the income tax. The question is actually a littlesilly, because this is the first thing the regulations under 861 say (and havesaid every year since long before I was born):“Part I (Section 861 and following), Subchapter N, Chapter 1 of the Code, andthe regulations thereunder, determine the sources of income for purposes of theincome tax.” [26 CFR § 1.861-1]So I was pretty much asking them whether they agreed with their own regulations.So they quickly agreed, right?Nope. Ms. Spaulding must have spent ten minutes either trying to understand thequestion or trying to avoid it (or both). She openly admitted (on tape,remember) that she was unfamiliar with the sections I was quoting, and admittedthat she could not answer the question. While Ms. Spaulding was floundering,Agent Michael Enz came riding to her rescue, and promptly fell off his horse. Hefirmly proclaimed, in his classic thug accent, that they disagreed with me onthat point.Hooray! An actual answer! Yes, it directly contradicted their own regulations,but at least it was an answer! Just to be sure, though, I asked the questionagain: were they disagreeing with my claim that Section 861 and following, andthe regulations thereunder, determine the sources of income for purposes of theincome tax? Mr. Specialist responded, “No, we’re not disagreeing to that... ” Ohwell, at least I had a solid answer for about twenty seconds, before Mr.Specialist put his own answer out of its misery. They never really answered thequestion again.Okay, so that was a little weird, but I remained determined to have a rationaldiscussion. My second question was whether they agreed or disagreed that Ishould be using Section 861 and its regulations to determine my taxable domesticincome. I argued that I should, and quoted from 26 CFR §§ 1.861-1(a)(1),1.861-1(b), 1.861-8(a), 1.863-1(c), 1.862-1(b), and Treasury Decision 6258(among other things), all of which clearly and unequivocally say that I shouldbe referring to 861 and its regs to determine my “taxable income from sourceswithin the United States.”This time I’d get an answer for sure. Or so I thought. After all, there wereonly two choices: they would either agree that I should use those sections, orargue that I shouldn’t.They responded with a firm “Um...” Again, Ms. Spaulding said she wasn’t familiarwith those sections, and couldn’t give me a definite answer. (At that point anuncertain wild guess would have been a vast improvement.) In other words, theyweren’t sure exactly how I should determine my taxable income. How can IRSemployees not know which sections to use to determine someone’s taxable income?All they do is figure people’s taxes! It’s like a mechanic not knowing where tofind the engine in a car.I was stunned. Having told them, weeks in advance, what my position was and whatI would be asking at the meeting, I expected at least some half-decentlawyer-spin, if not a substantive rebuttal. But for the entire meeting, every“answer” the IRS gave was the same: they couldn’t actually answer my specificquestions, but they really wanted me to look at the general definition of “grossincome” (in Section 61) and ignore everything else. (They didn’t explain why wehave a multi-thousand-page tax code if only one section actually matters.)The law is like a puzzle: lots of little pieces that must be put together toform a big, coherent picture. But these IRS folk, including a self-proclaimed“specialist,” didn’t have a big picture to present. They knew about one piece(the general definition of “gross income”) and didn’t seem to know about, careabout, or have any opinion about any other piece. They were apparently quitecontent with their one-piece puzzle. Mind you, I started the explanation of myposition by citing and quoting Section 61—the section they were so fond of—andacknowledging that it does indeed give the general definition of “gross income.”Then I showed how there is more to the law than that one section.In light of their love for Section 61, I decided to try something else. I put onthe table in front of them a copy of Section 61, printed right off of Congress’web site. I directed them down past the main text, to the cross-referencesbelow, one of which says this:“Income from sources —Within the United States see section 861 of this titleWithout the United States see section 862 of this title”Their entire position (though they never expressed it this succinctly) boileddown to “Just look at Section 61 and nowhere else (especially not 861).” Butthere, in the cross-reference under Section 61 itself, I was being told to lookto Section 861 regarding income from inside the U.S. (We agreed that all of myincome was from within the U.S.) I even gave them their own copy to keep, whichI’m sure they’ll treasure always. But they still didn’t want me looking at 861.Why not? Were they really incapable of seeing what was right in front of them?In many different places, the law says I should look to 861, and they could citenothing saying I shouldn’t, yet they wouldn’t budge. I had a hard timecomprehending this level of denial. Section 61, the love of their life, directsme to 861, and I showed them that. But they still insisted that I shouldn’t lookat anything beyond Section 61.Interspersed into this surreal discussion about tax law was a discussion about aprocedure called “technical advice,” whereby an IRS employee or a “taxpayer” canask that a legal question be referred to the IRS’s lawyers (instead of just thepaper-pushers, such as the ones at my meeting). So, since the folks sittingacross from me were obviously unqualified to address the issue (which theyadmitted), I asked that the matter be sent to their lawyers for “technicaladvice.” They refused my request. They openly admitted that they couldn’t answermy questions and then, in violation of their own procedures, refused to send thecase to someone who could.Am I the only one who senses something strange about that? They have lawyerswhose job it is to deal with legal questions, they have formal procedures forsending the questions to those lawyers, and their bureaucrats admitted that theyweren’t familiar with that part of the law and couldn’t answer my questions. Butno, they still wouldn’t refer my questions to their lawyers, and wouldn’t saywhy.Due to their inability to read and/or their inability to believe their own eyes,I didn’t bother spending much time on the other questions I had, which they didno better with: not familiar with it, can’t answer, we’ll get back to you. Themeeting was sprinkled with some interesting moments, such as when Agent Enzcomplained that I was “arguing over words.” What? Maybe his copy of the tax codehas cartoons or something; mine contains only words. (I suppose we could haveargued over punctuation, or perhaps font style.) On another occasion, Mr. Enzcomplained that I was reading sections of law “literally, word for word, forwhat they mean.” I kid you not; those were his exact words. Apparently I’m notwise enough to know that you’re not supposed to think that the law means whatthe words of the law literally say. Unfortunately, Mr. Enz wasn’t kind enough toshare with me whatever telepathic or channeling powers he uses to determine thetrue meaning of the law, but he demonstrated obvious disdain for simpletons likemyself who think we should read it to find out what it means.On another occasion, Agent Enz asked, “Who’d you buy this from? ” When I said itwas my own research, he omnisciently declared, “No it isn’t; who’d you buy itfrom? ” When I handed him a copy of my complete “Taxable Income” report, with myname on the front, he shut up.On a bright note, at least half a dozen times during the meeting Ms. Spauldingindicated that she would do “further research” into the issue. (Why she hadn’tdone that prior to our first meeting, she didn’t say.) So later, when I finallygot a letter from her, I eagerly opened it, anxious to see her scholarly,thorough rebuttal of my position. The letter said my claims were being denied.Why? Because under Section 61, my income was taxable. That was all. Onesentence. No mention of 861, no mention of any of the questions I asked, oranything else we had discussed. (And, of course, no mention of Section 61referring to Section 861.) Gee, I hope Ms. Spaulding didn’t over-exert herselfdoing all the in-depth “research” required to come up with that awe-inspiringresponse.So that was it. Those are the people who make so many Americans shake in theirboots. That was the all-knowing, all-powerful IRS at its finest. I went inexpecting at least some impressive spin, maybe even a few actual citations oflaw, but came out with nothing. (I’m still not sure why it took three of them,including one brought in from downtown Philadelphia, to not answer myquestions.) Even with weeks of advance warning of what I wanted to talk about,the all-knowing IRS had a grand total of nothing to refute anything I haddiscovered, and I found that very curious indeed. If I needed any furtherconfirmation that my conclusions were correct, that was it. All they could dowas tell me that they really didn’t want me looking anywhere but Section 61, nomatter what the law books say.Within a few days I had transcribed the entire meeting and posted it on theinternet, so the world could appreciate the awesome competence of our federalpublic servants.FOLLOW-UP EVASIONSA few more letters went back and forth concerning my request for “technicaladvice” (sending the case to the IRS’s lawyers), which they continued to refuse.Mind you, it’s not that the lawyers made a ruling against me; it’s that theyrefused to give me a ruling at all.As the IRS regulations and publications explain, when someone can’t reach anagreement with the IRS at the first level (called “Examinations”), they have theright to meet with the “Appeals” division of the IRS to discuss the matter. So Irequested such a meeting. After a while I got a letter from IRS Appeals refusingto meet with me at all. Why? Because, they falsely claimed, I was refusing “tocomply with the tax laws based on moral, religious, political, constitutional,conscientious, or similar grounds.” Does any of the above sound to you like “Irefuse to obey the law”? The only thing I ever brought up was what the lawitself says about how to determine what I owe. But based on a bald-faced lie,IRS Appeals refused to meet with me, or consider the case at all.If my conclusions were incorrect, why was the IRS trying so hard to avoidexplaining why? Shouldn’t they want to take the opportunity to show me that Iowe them something? Why were Examinations, Appeals, and the IRS lawyers all soreluctant to answer simple questions about how to determine what (if anything) Iowe? The published IRS “Mission Statement” says that the IRS’s purpose inexisting is to help America’s taxpayers understand and comply with their taxresponsibilities. So why were multiple IRS offices trying so hard to avoidtalking to me, even when that meant violating their own procedures?A SNEAK PREVIEW OF INSANITYWhile April 18, 2000, was the first time I met with the IRS regarding my owncase, it was not the first IRS meeting I attended. About a week earlier, I wasdown in Sarasota, Florida, at another “Examination” meeting between the IRS anda friend of mine. The format of the meeting was similar to my own: an informaladministrative meeting at which Mr. John Greer, having reached the sameconclusions I had, wanted to explain his position to the IRS and ask them toshow him any error he might be making, or at least state the specifics of theirown legal position.We sat in a crowded little conference room, with Mr. Greer and his threewitnesses (including me) on one side of the puny table, and Agent Steward Stichand his manager, Anna Schrammel, on the other. (Agent Stich looked and acted asif he had just been let out of a straitjacket.) Mr. Greer had informed themahead of time that he would be recording the meeting, so once settled in, Istarted our audio recorder, and calmly announced that I had done so. Agent Stichjust about exploded. “Turn it off! Turn it off! ” Had I put a ticking time bombon the table, the response could hardly have been more extreme. I didn’t turn itoff, and after several minutes of psychotic tantrums from Agent Stich—in whichhe threatened, among other things, to terminate the meeting on the spot—Ms.Schrammel came up with the brilliant solution: the IRS turned its recorder on,too.Anyway, in order to avoid being too redundant, I’ll just give some of thehighlights (or lowlights) of the meeting:1) The IRS never answered Mr. Greer’s specific questions (essentially the sameones I had asked).2) When asked whether he was referring to Section 861 and its regulations todetermine Mr. Greer’s taxable domestic income, Agent Stich said that the IRS wasusing the sections “that are out there,” but could not or would not say justwhich sections those were (or where “out there” those elusive sections mightbe).3) After being handed copies of their own regulations plainly showing that theyshould have been using 861 and its regs, the IRS responded with “Well, we haveother sections, so we’re not going to get into this.” (I suppose those would bethe “other sections” that are “out there” at some undisclosed location.) 394) Agent Stich’s supervisor, Anna Schrammel, left the room at least three timesfor the express purpose of retrieving their own copy of the regulations. Forsome reason, however, she never produced them, or cited anything from them.5) Mr. Greer’s insistence on knowing just how the IRS was determining hisalleged tax liability eventually resulted in Agent Stich threatening to call theU.S. Marshals to have them come and forcibly remove Mr. Greer and his threewitnesses (one of them being me) from the building. So that apparently was their“answer” to his questions, and that concluded the meeting. No doubt Mr. Stichand Ms. Schrammel were proud to later discover that their professional, qualitytreatment of Mr. Greer had been posted on the internet for all to see.As in many other cases, the IRS continued to harass Mr. Greer, without everanswering his questions, or even stating the specifics of their own position.And just as in my case, various other IRS offices also refused to address theissue with Mr. Greer. So much for helping people “understand” their taxresponsibilities. Perhaps the IRS needs a new “Mission Statement”: “To get yourmoney by any means necessary, whether you owe it or not.” (Or, as thebumper-sticker says, “IRS: We’ve got what it takes to take what you’ve got!”)That’s some quality “service,” don’t you think?I hate to beat a dead (and rotting) horse here, but these meetings were aboutnothing more than how to determine what someone owes in federal income taxes,and the IRS couldn’t say. What the heck are they doing in that job if they don’tknow how to determine someone’s taxes? And how the heck are we supposed to knowhow to determine our taxable income if the damn IRS can’t even say how to do it?ROUND TWOOn September 22, 2000, about five months after my first meeting with the IRS, Ihad yet another meeting with them, this time about the fact that my wife and Ihad stopped filing (which we had been telling them for a couple of years at thatpoint). In many ways the meeting was a rerun. The setting was the same, and thecharacters were almost the same. Agents Spaulding and Enz made returnappearances, but this time Mr. Charles Judge (that’s his name, not his title)was there representing IRS management. And this time my wife came along, as didanother witness.The purpose of the meeting was pretty simple. Our income had been reported tothe IRS on “1099” forms, and the IRS assumed that that income was taxable andwanted us to file and pay up. Of course, the discussion quickly moved to theonly relevant question: How did they determine that our income was actuallytaxable? This time, however, they knew exactly what I would be asking, and sothey would be well prepared to put me in my place. I was once again anxious tosee the results of the research that Agent Spaulding had kept saying she wasgoing to do. This time I wouldn’t catch them off guard, so they’d really set mestraight.As it turned out, their “on-guard” response was indistinguishable from their“off-guard” response. I quoted the same regulations, asked the same questions,and they still couldn’t answer any of them, and said so (again, on tape).My wife and I again acknowledged receiving the income which was reported to theIRS. I then pointed out that while a 1099 form shows that we received income, itis not proof that the income is taxable, and I pointed out that at the priormeeting, the IRS supervisor had even agreed on that point, saying, “just becauseyou receive a piece of paper [a 1099 form] , you’re correct, doesn’t necessarilymean it’s gross income.”The ever-brilliant Agent Enz responded by saying that the IRS would have to do“third-party contacts,” meaning harassing our customers to confirm what we hadbeen paid—even though we had just acknowledged, again, having received themoney. (A rocket scientist he ain’t.) At the first meeting, the IRS’s ownsupervisor had to explain to Mr. Enz that we weren’t denying getting the income;we were saying it wasn’t taxable (making third-party contacts utterlypointless). So I explained it to Mr. Enz again.The discussion of the 861 evidence was just as weird as before, if not more so.I asked them if they were “trying to determine our taxable income from sourceswithin the United States,” and Cathy Spaulding said “Yes.” So I read to them aseries of citations, copies of which I gave to them (again), saying that 861 andits regs are the place to go to determine a person’s “taxable income fromsources within the United States.” They still couldn’t say why they were notusing 861, but they very much wanted me looking only at Section 61.When I once again showed them a printout of Section 61, from Congress’ own website, which at the bottom has a cross-reference pointing to 861 regarding“Income from sources within the United States,” Ms. Spaulding came up with thestrange response, “All right, you’re referring to 861, I believe, because itsuits your purposes.” Yes, she really said that. I only wanted to apply the lawcorrectly, to do what the law told me to do, for my own benefit. Well, excuuuuseme. (I also pointed out that it was Congress’ own web site which was referringto 861.)Agent Michael Enz had a couple of new gems to offer. During my attempt to havethem state the specifics of their own position, the following exchange occurred:Enz (IRS): “They don’t understand, we’re enforcement. We’re not judicial. We’renot—we just enforce the Code sections.”Me: “This [meaning the regulations] is binding on you. Are you aware of that?”Enz: “Yeah, and you can do whatever you want to do with it.” [What?]Me: “Could you get your copy of the Code of Federal Regulations?”Enz: “We’re only enforcement, right?”Me: “Yeah, but you’re enforcement of the law, not enforcement of blindassertions.”They never brought out their copy of the regulations. On another occasion, theywanted to cite the denial of my claims for refund (which they had issued) asproof that I was wrong. Got that? They said I was wrong before, so that provesit. So I brought out a copy of their “report” denying our claim.Me: “I would like to get it on the record, because this was the most ridiculousdodge of an issue I’ve seen in my life. In that report, her entire synopsis ofthe situation was ‘Per Internal Revenue Code Section 61, you are liable forincome taxes on the non-employee compensation that you earned in thecommonwealth of Pennsylvania during the taxable year.’ End of quote. No addressof the questions—”Enz: “That’s not a dodge, and ya know why it’s not a dodge? Because if we gettoo specific, then when we go to court, we limit our arguments.”In other words, if they actually state their position, they might get stuckhaving to defend it. So they flounder and evade instead. Swell. Nice dueprocess. Do they seem a bit defensive to you? All I was asking was how todetermine what I owe (if anything), and they didn’t dare to answer!On another occasion, when the discussion wasn’t going the way he wanted it to,Agent Enz said, “Why don’t we give them an estimate of what, ya know, the kindof money they’re messin’ around with? ” Messing around with? What does theamount have to do with whether it’s taxable or not? Apparently some people don’teven have enough self-respect to disguise their thuggery as something lessdistasteful. “Never mind the law, let’s talk about how much we’re going to stealfrom you.” Splendid view of due process.And the new supervisor, Charles Judge, wasn’t any more helpful.Charles Judge (IRS): “I believe that the income that was paid to [you] istaxable under Section 61.”Me: “And you don’t have a response to all the citations I’ve given you?”Judge: “Not right now, but—”Me: “Well, I’d like that before it goes past this stage, because otherwise it’sa violation of due process.”Judge: “Well, we—we’ll give you a report.”They never did.At that meeting I again requested that the questions be sent for “technicaladvice,” so their lawyers could deal with it. Again, they refused to do so. Thistime, Agent Enz even came out with this: “District Counsel’s already made aruling on this, and they said, ya know, no tech advice or anything like that, sowe’re just arguing stuff that’s been argued before.” He was admitting that theIRS lawyers had told them ahead of time not to send the issue to them. Yes, wehad “argued” about it before, with them admitting that they couldn’t answer myquestions or state the specifics of their own position. How, exactly, does thatremove any need for further discussion?Well, considering what passes for “discussion” in the eyes of the IRS, furtherdiscussion did seem kind of pointless.Charles Judge (IRS): “While we disagree on a lot of things here, we’re not hereto knowingly do anything wrong.”Cathy Spaulding (IRS): “—denying due process.”Me: “Why are you—I showed you the regulations and you aren’t following them.”Judge: “Yeah, but, but I’m citing another regulation.”Me: “Where?”Judge: “Section 61. Have you seen—”Me: “I gave it to you. I gave you a copy of 61, and it cites 861.”Judge: “Okay.”Me: “It’s a general definition, like he [Enz] just said, the statutes aregeneral definitions. The regulations specifically point out—”Judge: “Well we’re not—I’m not gonna convince you, and you’re not gonna convinceme today, so—”Me: “But what you’re saying is, you intend to go forward trying to collect fromus without giving a legal argument—without rebutting what I’ve showedyou—disregarding the Treasury regulations that I showed you.”Judge: “No, we, we’ll give an argument.”Michael Enz (IRS): “We’re not the attorneys. Our District Counsel is theattorneys, and they’ll argue with you.” [How? He had just admitted that theirlawyers said not to send the issue to them.]Me: “You’re also not authorized to ignore the law when I put it on the table infront of you. You are making a ruling of law.”Judge: “We’re not ignoring it. We’re not ignoring—”Me: “You are not authorized to do that, as he just said.”Judge: “Okay. Again, we’re just—I think it’s time to conclude the meeting.”I admit, my patience wore a bit thin this time. I pointed out, while trying toremain calm, that the IRS had had a detailed explanation of my position,complete with piles of supporting citations, for more than a full year. Keep inmind, these bureaucratic knuckleheads were claiming that we owed them tens ofthousands of dollars, yet more than five months after our first meeting, theystill couldn’t tell me the specifics of their own position on how they weredetermining our taxable income. (Try having some boneheaded bureaucrat tell you,“We think you owe us ten thousand dollars, but we can’t really say how wedetermined that,” and see whether you can remain calm and polite.)At one point, after giving them copies of their own regulations, and having themread along while I quoted the regs telling me to use 861, I asked whether theysaw what the regulations said. Yes, they said, they did. And did they understandwhy I believe what I believe? Yes, they did. And did they have anything to rebutit? Mr. Judge responded with “I don’t know why there’s not more of an obvious,ya know—I think we’re missing something somewhere here under 861.” Wow, what anunderstatement.Referring to their stumbling, bumbling uncertainty when it came to discussingtheir own regulations, I came right out and asked, “Is this what’s supposed toconvince me? ” Surprisingly, they instantly responded by saying no, it was notsupposed to convince me that I was wrong. (Well, that’s comforting.) Stilltrying to remain calm, with minimal success, I pointed out how much time theyhad had to come up with something, anything in the law to refute my conclusions,and to justify their demands for huge sums of money. If there was evidenceshowing that I was wrong, and that I really did owe the tax, I asked (ratherloudly), “Where is it? ” Agent Michael Enz, “specialist” in such matters,responded by saying that he had such proof, but that he had left it back at hisPhiladelphia office. His tone of voice bore an uncanny resemblance to a kidbeing asked for his homework and responding with “My dog ate it.”(Despite the IRS supervisor, Mr. Judge, saying that he wanted to review Mr.Enz’s missing evidence—apparently Mr. Judge thought it actually existed—themysterious proof that I’m wrong has never materialized. Gee, I wonder why.)Needless to say, the meeting was all downhill from there, with one exception. Imade it clear that I did not want this ending the way the first meeting had,with them baselessly asserting that my income was taxable while ignoring thesubstance of the issue and evading my questions. Charlie Judge, the IRSsupervisor, responded by saying, “We will not close the case without contactingyou in some manner first.” What a relief. (Wait until you see just how they next“contacted” me about the case.)REPEATED SILLINESSOn February 28, 2001, I got another chance to get a glimpse of how incompetentand ignorant IRS folk are, this time out in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where Iwas again a witness at someone else’s meeting with the IRS. John Hoffman hadpaid what he thought he owed for 1997, then concluded that his income wasn’ttaxable (based on the 861 evidence), and he wanted his money back. The IRSdidn’t want to give it back. After repeated requests, they finally granted Mr.Hoffman a meeting at which to discuss the matter. In his opening statement, Mr.Hoffman explained that in order to be afforded his due process rights, both atthe meeting and at any subsequent appeals meetings, “it is obviously necessaryto determine the exact points of disagreement between us.” Mr. Hoffman thereforewanted to run down a list of points and have the IRS simply agree or disagreewith each. Sounds simple enough, doesn’t it?Well, Stanley Escher, IRS “group manager” at that office, had other plans. Heresponded: “Let me start, before you go over your twelve points, let me go andtell you what our position is, and why our position is that, and let me show yousome of the regulations and some of the language in some of the tax servicesthat support our position.” Well, I guess that might be fun, too. Mr. Hoffmanand I then sat patiently, listening to a long, drawn-out monologue from Mr.Escher about tax law, hardly any of it actually relevant. After mentioning thegeneral definition of “gross income” in Section 61, Mr. Escher proclaimed that“any item of gross income that is not taxable is non-taxable because it isspecifically stated as being nontaxable,” and gave interest on municipal bondsas an example. (Does that not precisely match what I wrote above about taxprofessionals thinking that everything is taxable unless specifically exemptedby the tax code?) Then Mr. Escher went through, in needless, excruciatingdetail, how one fills out a tax return, and how one gets from “gross income” to“taxable income” by subtracting allowable deductions. Mr. Hoffman and I managedto stay awake long enough for Mr. Escher to finally get to his explanation of861:“Our system does not double-tax. So if you already paid money, say some of yourinterest income was earned abroad, or some of your wages was earned abroad, andyou paid tax on that in a foreign country, we’re not going—the government—theIRS will not double-tax you on that income. All right? And so what they do is,there is under the tax portion of the return, and credit portion, there is aforeign tax credit, so we’ll give you a foreign tax credit for the amount of taxyou paid on that foreign source income. All right? So we don’t tax your incometwice. That’s a very important point, because that’s where 861 comes in. Do youhave any questions so far? Am I being kind of clear?”That was his explanation of 861. There is a foreign tax credit, but it isdescribed in Section 901 and following, not in Section 861. In fact, the onlytwo mentions in 861 of the foreign tax credit are about an obscure rule havingto do with certain dividends from foreign corporations, and how the credit isnot allowed against certain “railroad rolling stock” income. No literate personwho reads 861 would think that’s it’s only about, or even mainly about, foreigntax credits. And, as usual, the IRS bureaucrat cited nothing from the lawsupporting his bizarre assertion about the purpose of Section 861. (Notice alsothat his claim doesn’t match what the IRS said at the three prior meetings Iattended, at which foreign tax credits were never mentioned.)On several occasions, between Mr. Escher’s sermons, I suggested to Mr. Hoffmanthat he just run down the list of specific questions, to get the IRS’s answerson the record and be done with it. But Mr. Escher didn’t seem very eager to dothat, and wanted to pontificate and evade instead. Then he went into yet anotherlong-winded diatribe about his own out-of-thin-air position. I hate to do thisto the reader, but no amount of summarizing could convey the lunacy of hiswords, so here is Mr. Escher’s second explanation of 861:“Let’s take a look at 861. You have to understand the purpose of 861. 861 isnot—861 is a sourcing—is the regulations, or is the Code sections determine ofsourcing of income between foreign and U.S. sources. And it’s used in computingtaxable income, foreign tax credits, all those items dealing with ‘Is the incomeI made abroad taxable in the U.S., or is it taxable somewhere else where I canget a foreign tax credit?’ I’m over-simplifying. [You call that simplifying?] Ithas nothing to do with the determination of gross income. This is thedetermination of gross income—and I’m pointing to, for the record, Code section61. This is gross income. If you read the very first sentence [of 861], and thisis where I think the disconnect comes in. [Reading from Section 861:] Grossincome from sources within the United States. [Note, he had just claimed that861 has nothing to do with determining gross income.] Like I said, 861determines—is a sourcing section, sourcing income foreign and U.S. And it’s usedin the computation of foreign sources income, and U.S. source income for—not forarriving at gross income, but for use in arriving at foreign tax credits,taxable foreign source income, those type of things. It has nothing to dowith—if you have no income at all earned abroad, you have nothing at all earnedabroad, everything that you have—you live, you’re a U.S. citizen and everythingyou have you’ve earned in the United States, okay—wages, interest from banks, orwhatever—it has nothing to do with Code section 861. The very first sentence of861 says the following items of gross income, it doesn’t say that the followingitems are the only thing in gross income, they’re just saying the followingitems of gross income shall be treated as income from sources within the UnitedStates. It has nothing to do with arriving at taxable—at your—if you don’t fitinto this situation where you have foreign source income, this section does notapply to you. Let me be a little more clear on that. [He could hardly be anyless clear.] And, um—Code section 61, Part I, which is what I just read from,and this I’m reading from the regulations. Categories of income. Part I, Section861 and the following, Subchapter N, Chapter 1 of the Code and the regulationsthereunder determine the sources of income for purposes of the income tax. [I’mnot sure he even noticed what he had just read.] These sections explicitlyallocate certain important sources of income to the United States, or to areasoutside of the United States, as the case may be, and with respect to theremaining income, particularly that derived partly from sources within andpartly from sources without the United States, authorize the Secretary or hisdelegate to determine the income derived from sources within the United States,either by rules of separate allocation or by processes of formulas of generalapportionment.”At this point he stopped reading from the regulation, right before theregulation says this:“The statute provides for the following three categories of income:(1) Within the United States. The gross income from sources within the UnitedStates, consisting of the items of gross income specified in section 861(a) plusthe items of gross income allocated or apportioned to such sources in accordancewith section 863(a). See §§ 1.861-2 to 1.861-7, inclusive, and § 1.863-1. Thetaxable income from sources within the United States, in the case of suchincome, shall be determined by deducting therefrom, in accordance with sections861(b) and 863(a), the [allowable deductions]. See §§ 1.861-8 and 1.863-1.(2) Without [outside of] the United States ...(3) Partly within and partly without the United States ...(b) Taxable income from sources within the United States. The taxable incomefrom sources within the United States shall consist of the taxable incomedescribed in paragraph (a)(l) of this section plus the taxable income allocatedor apportioned to such sources, as indicated in paragraph (a)(3) of thissection.” [26 CFR § 1.861-1]Weeks prior to the meeting, Mr. Hoffman had sent to Mr. Escher a letterexplaining the specifics of his position and quoting a bunch of supportingcitations, including what you see above. At the meeting, Mr. Escher had thatsection right in front of him. Yet he still chose to proclaim, without a shredof evidence backing him up, that “Code section 861 has nothing to do with thedetermination—if in fact you do not fit into any of these situations, again thesituation being if you are a U.S. citizen wholly residing in the U.S., having noconnection with foreign sourced income, all your income comes from the UnitedStates—wages, interest, dividends, whatever—operations totally in the UnitedStates, then 100 percent of your income is taxed, based on Section 61, and thereis no application in that circumstance for 861.” Where in what you see above (orin any of the many similar citations found in Appendix A of this book) is thereany support for that claim? Nowhere. Mr. Escher just made it up, and hoped Mr.Hoffman would take his word for it. But he didn’t.Then Mr. Escher brought up a New York Times story about a couple who had beenconvicted of using bogus trusts. Mr. Escher then falsely claimed that the IRS“had litigated this particular issue with a taxpayer,” when the trial hadnothing to do with the 861 issue. What really happened, which Mr. Escher triedto gloss over, was that at sentencing the defendants brought up the 861 evidence(apparently having only just heard of it, after having been convicted). The NewYork Times said that the judge increased the defendants’ sentences because, asMr. Escher read from the story, they “insisted on speaking and telling the judgeabout the 861 position, and how as a sovereign citizen of California, thefederal courts had no jurisdiction, and all sort of—in the New York Timesarticle, ‘gibberish’.” So it’s wrong because someone got punished for saying it.Nice logic.In between Mr. Escher’s barely coherent ramblings, I kept trying to get to thelist of specific questions, until Mr. Escher said this: “Well, I guess what I’msaying to you, and what I’ve tried to demonstrate to you from the get-go is thatit is our position—and that we’re not gonna waver from this position—that 861does not apply to your situation. And we can go over every one of thosearticles, and it’s not gonna change that. What I’m saying to you is I’m notgonna go over those articles with you; I’m not gonna go on this point by point,because it’s my contention that in the very first sentence of 861(a), it isclear in my mind that 861 is not applicable to your situation.”Really? The very first sentence of 861(a) shows that it’s not about us? Let’sread what that first sentence says: “The following items of gross income shallbe treated as income from sources within the United States... ” Then it listsvarious types of domestic income, including compensation earned for work done inthe U.S. How, exactly, does that “clearly” imply that Mr. Hoffman shouldn’t belooking there? Mr. Hoffman had given Agent Escher half a dozen citations whichstate, in English plain enough for even an IRS agent to understand, that Section861 and its regulations are the sections to use to determine one’s “taxableincome from sources within the United States.” No conditions, no qualifications,no exceptions. In response, Mr. Escher simply hallucinated something saying thatMr. Hoffman shouldn’t look there.When I again tried to get to the list of questions, Mr. Escher said, “Well, I’msaying to you before even going into them, we disagree with every one of yourpoints.” Every one? Well, not quite. He added, “Any point there that you’reindicating 861 has relevance to you as a taxpayer, based on the income that youearned in that year, in the year 1997, we disagree with that position. Now, Idon’t know how much clearer I can be.” Why do you suppose he didn’t want toanswer the specific questions?Mr. Hoffman, calmly and politely, replied: “I’m not here to argue with you. Andyou’ve had the questions for quite some time. And I don’t want this to be athing where we just pretend like we’re going through due process. I wanted it tobe taken seriously, because I believe the position is serious. But why wouldyou—”Mr. Escher interrupted to say this: “Well, but I have taken it seriously. I’veput in several hours in researching this.” Several hours? I would bet money thatthose “several hours” consisted entirely of going over insulting, threatening(legally non-binding) IRS form letters, rather than reviewing anything from thelaw itself. No one who actually reads Section 861, or Section 1.861-1 of theregulations (which is what Mr. Escher quoted from), would conclude that a U.S.citizen should ignore 861 unless he has foreign tax credits to compute. There’sjust not a shred of support for that claim in the law. The only way he wouldhave gotten that impression is from the IRS form letters which made up thatprovably false claim.Eventually Mr. Hoffman ran down the list of questions, most of which Mr. Escherdidn’t even seem to comprehend. When he got to the question about some incomebeing exempted, not by any statute, but by the Constitution itself, Mr. Escherwas at least nice enough to admit: “Without further research, I don’t reallyhave a response for that one. I can’t really tell you without researching ananswer to that question.” Again, the IRS folk simply aren’t aware of the factthat the Constitution exempts some income. Oddly, it wasn’t long before AgentAmnesia once again proclaimed that “gross income” means “anything that youreceive, unless it’s specifically exempt.” Wrong again.I don’t mean to be nasty, but I was stunned at Mr. Escher’s inability to followsimple trains of logic, or even comprehend basic English. No matter how slowlyand simply we explained them, he couldn’t understand the most basic questionsabout determining what is taxable, and had to resort to a sort of blanketevasion: “I don’t believe that 861 applies to your position,” and later, “that’show I’m gonna answer—that is my answer from now on for anything with 861.” Notexactly open to rational discussion, was he? Also of note, twice at the meetingMr. Escher insisted that 861 and following, and related regulations, determinethe “sourcing” of income, but not the “sources” of income. This was a bit odd,since he himself had just read aloud from the regulations which say that thoseare the sections which “determine the sources of income for purposes of theincome tax” (as you can see above). Incidentally, nowhere does 861, or any ofthe regulations thereunder, ever use the term “sourcing.” One section of relatedregulations (1.861-8), on the other hand, uses the word “sources” seventy-onetimes.)So the meeting ended, with Mr. Escher still insisting that Mr. Hoffman shouldn’tbe using 861, and still having nothing in the law supporting that claim. So,just as I had done in my own case, Mr. Hoffman asked that the legal questions besent to the IRS lawyers for “technical advice.” Once again, the IRS refused,even though their own manual says that “Technical advice should be requestedwhere taxpayers or their representatives take the position that the basis forthe proposed action is not supported by statute, regulations, or publishedpositions of the Service” (IRM, § 4.2.7.2.10), which was obviously the casethere (and in my case as well). Once again, no technical advice, no appeals, norefund, no due process. Par for the course.DEBATING STYLESThe rantings of Mr. Escher make a nice segue into an important point regardingpersuasion. There are two general methods of argument that people use to try toconvince other people: they can either 1) try to simplify things, make themunderstandable, lay out a trail of logic and evidence, and try to have peoplegrasp the truth for themselves, or they can 2) try to confuse people to thepoint where they just want to give up and take the guy’s word for it. I may notalways succeed, but I hope it’s obvious that I always opt for the first method:trying to get people to understand things for themselves.On the other hand, it sure seems to me that a lot of government folk (such asMr. Escher) try to sound learned and informed, while trying to confuse theiraudience into just giving up and blindly believing them. If you want to knowwhich method someone is using on you, the dead giveaway is what happens when youtry to simplify things, slow it down, and methodically move from one step to thenext, in an effort to understand what’s going on. Can the person answer basicquestions and explain his position point by point? Or does he give a confusingmonologue, blurt out his conclusion, and then get annoyed or impatient when youwant to back up to make sure you understood?I have talked to a lot of people regarding tax law issues. A few of them werepeople who, though I disagreed with them, tried to argue logically andmethodically. None of those people worked for the government. I have never metanyone in government who gave the impression of wanting to actually persuade melogically. Yes, they wanted me to accept their conclusions, but they did notwant to get into a step-by-step, well-reasoned discussion and analysis ofanything. When I put the evidence in front of them, they reacted like Draculabeing offered a pile of garlic.Why would that be? Very simply, it’s because somewhere deep down inside, theysuspect they might be wrong. Why else would they very carefully avoid addressingthe evidence? Why would they be afraid of answering questions, as everygovernment official I’ve ever talked to has been? I’ve always made it a habit toinvite the government to ask me anything they wanted. They never did. Theyalways wanted to cut meetings short, say they would get back to me, say theyweren’t prepared to answer questions, and use other excuses to weasel out ofcalm, rational discussions of the law. Would someone who was familiar with theevidence and confident in his conclusions act that way? Of course not. Suchpeople enjoy getting into the “nitty gritty,” diving head first into theevidence, to try to prove their point. As you’ll see later on, we got to thepoint where we had to try to blatantly bribe supposed tax experts—both insideand outside government—with thousands of dollars, in an effort to get them totalk about the issue in public! Getting a rational discussion of the issue islike pulling teeth.BLACK DRESSES, WOODEN HAMMERSAfter I had met with the IRS several times, it was clear to me that they werecompletely clueless about Section 861 and its regulations, and couldn’t come upwith anything in the law even hinting that I shouldn’t be using those sections.They didn’t seem to want me looking there, but had absolutely nothing tocontradict all the citations I showed them saying I should be looking there. Inshort, they were using the Wizard of Oz argument: just look where we want you tolook, and pay no attention to that section behind the curtain! Needless to say,I was neither impressed nor persuaded by the response of the all-knowing IRS. Istarted wondering if I’d ever get anyone to make at least a half-decent attemptat refuting my conclusions.At some point, the 861 issue started showing up in Tax Court cases here andthere (in cases other than mine). The U.S. “Tax Court” is not actually aJudicial Branch court. It is a glorified administrative hearing (ExecutiveBranch), formerly called the “Board of Tax Appeals.” And, as the InternalRevenue Manual admits, the IRS does not consider Tax Court rulings to be legallybinding, except for the specific case before the court. In other words, theydon’t consider Tax Court rulings to constitute binding “precedent.”To illustrate the point: in July of 2003, the Tax Court rightfully chastised theIRS for not allowing people to record certain in-person meetings with theAppeals division, in blatant violation of 26 USC § 7521. That section states, inno uncertain terms, that “[a]ny officer or employee of the Internal RevenueService in connection with any in-person interview with any taxpayer relating tothe determination or collection of any tax shall, upon advance request of suchtaxpayer, allow the taxpayer to make an audio recording of such interview.” (I’mnot sure what part of that the IRS had trouble understanding.) For months theIRS simply ignored the Tax Court’s ruling—not to mention the law—and continuedits policy of harassing citizens off the record, behind closed doors, and withno witnesses. Eventually the IRS folk changed their “policy,” however, notbecause they really care what the Tax Court or the law says, but probablybecause they knew that a lot of people would just drag them into Tax Court overand over again, and the Tax Court would keep telling them to let people recordthe meetings.So the IRS only treats Tax Court rulings with respect when it wants to, andignores them when it wants to. Not only is the IRS not bound by Tax Courtrulings, but no other court is bound by them either. Nor am I. Nonetheless, myattitude has always been that if I was making an error or missing something, Iwanted to know about it, whether such enlightenment came from a Tax Court judgeor a janitor (the latter being a lot more likely). So I kept my eyes out for any861-related “rulings,” non-binding though they may be.“Frivolous!” (Froth, froth, froth.)In one Tax Court case after another, that was the careful analysis providedregarding the 861 evidence. One or two cases at least made the lame, provablyincorrect claim that Section 61 makes everything taxable, while other rulingsrelied completely on insult and demonization of whoever raised the issue.Take, for example, the case of Dashiell v. Commissioner, in which the Tax Court“judge” said that Section 61 “prefaces its use of the word ‘source’ by the word‘whatever,’ thereby making the particular source of a U.S. taxpayer’s income(and the income sourcing rules of sections 861-865) irrelevant for purposes ofthe definition of income under section 61.”So 861 is now “irrelevant” to 61? Interesting, since:1) Section 61 itself has a cross-reference pointing to 861;2) Section 61 uses the term “sources” of income, while the regs say that 861 andrelated rules “determine the sources of income for purposes of the income tax”;3) The regulations under 861 say the items listed in 61 are not always taxable;4) The regulations, past and present, say there are constitutional limits on thebroadly worded general statutory definition of “gross income” (now found inSection 61);5) Half a dozen regulations say, without any qualifications or conditions, that861 and its regs are the place to look to determine one’s taxable domesticincome;6) The indexes of the tax code point to 61 as the general definition of “grossincome,” and point to 861 for specific rules regarding “gross income” fromsources within the United States; and7) A Supreme Court justice has said: “‘From whatever source derived,’ as it iswritten in the Sixteenth Amendment [which is where the wording of 61 came from], does not mean from whatever source derived” ( Wright v. United States, 302U.S. 583 (1938), dissenting opinion).But no, the Tax Court can see only one sentence of the multi-thousand-page taxcode, and feels no need to explain or even mention anything else.A couple of Tax Court rulings quoted an older lower court ruling ( Crain v.Commissioner, 737 F.2d 1417 (5th Cir. 1984))—which had nothing to do with 861;it was about someone claiming the tax is unconstitutional—where the court saidthat it felt “no need to refute these arguments with somber reasoning andcopious citation of precedent,” because to do so “might suggest that thesearguments have some colorable merit.” So, using that as its excuse, the TaxCourt refused to address the substance of the 861 evidence. It must beconvenient for them to have a blanket, one-size-fits-all cop-out: “If I arguewith you, or politely explain why you’re wrong, it might make people think yourposition is arguable, so I’ll just call you names instead.” Interesting methodof jurisprudence.One attorney and former federal prosecutor who ended up agreeing with mysupposedly “frivolous” conclusions explained to me that while the label of“frivolous” shows up in many court cases, about all sorts of things, usually thecourts will at least explain why something is frivolous instead of having theattitude of “it’s frivolous because we say it is,” as they have done with the861 evidence.That same former federal prosecutor also commented on the whisper-down-the-lanebasis of many court rulings, which works like this: one judge says “that’sfrivolous”; then another judge quotes the first one saying it, then a thirdjudge quotes the first two, and so on. Some call this “precedent.” I call itintellectual cowardice. Sometimes it’s just a symptom of mental laziness: thejudge doesn’t want to have to bother actually researching some issue, so he justfinds what some other judge said, and quotes that. But it can also be used as away for a judge to get out of having to address inconvenient evidence. Eitherway, the end result is a collection of “case law” (assertions from guys who wearblack dresses and carry wooden hammers) which bashes the issue without everactually addressing it.(As one strange example, in one case a Tax Court judge—I believe it was JudgeWolfe—asserted that the 861 issue is “frivolous,” without explaining why, andthen in a subsequent case quoted his own prior assertion as proof that the issueis indeed frivolous. “This is true because yesterday I said it was true.” Howdelusional does someone have to be to use that arguing method with a straightface?)In addition to “case law” without a shred of substance, the IRS also cites “caselaw” that isn’t even about the issue at all, knowing full well that putting acase name and number will impress the average peasant, who never in a millionyears would actually look up the case to see what it says. For example, severalIRS form letters poo-poo the 861 evidence and cite the Tax Court’s ruling in the“Solomon” case. Trouble is, that case had nothing to do with the 861 evidence.It does mention Section 861, but in a completely different context: thepetitioner was making the peculiar argument—for reasons we don’t need to getinto here—that Illinois is not part of the “United States,” as that term isdefined in the tax code, and that his income therefore constituted income fromoutside of the U.S., not income from within the U.S. per Section 861. What doesthat have to do with the issue explained above? Not a dang thing, but thatdidn’t stop some IRS propagandist from citing it as if it proves something.(Note that when I cite a court case, I actually quote the words of the ruling,and then give the citation.)As another example of citing irrelevant cases (and this came up at my trial),some IRS form letters also cite the “Madge” Tax Court case when insulting the861 issue. Very persuasive, except that nowhere does the ruling in that caseever mention Section 861 or any of the related regulations. But hey, it looksgood as a citation. And since almost no one is going to look it up (or wouldeven know how to look it up), flinging in irrelevant citations looks veryimpressive. Like this: Two plus two equals five ( United States v. Eduardo vonGleekleheimer, 123 2Fd 456 (1953)). Doesn’t that look spiffy? (I just made itup.) So, after there is a collection of non-binding, substance-free and mostlyirrelevant “case law,” an IRS bureaucrat can simply quote the guy who quoted theother guy who quoted that other guy, and pretend that that counts as proof thatthe 861 evidence is bogus. But, as those who investigate the issue in more depthdiscover, nowhere in the chain of parrots is the law itself seriously examined.Sadly, to most Americans this method of repeating baseless assertions is seen asa compelling argument, especially if those flinging assertions around are inpositions of authority, or are thought to be experts. In the eyes of Joe Q.Public, some mere peasant armed only with evidence and logic can never competewith the unsupported opinion of some political appointee who is accustomed tobeing called “honorable” (for no apparent reason).Allow me to give a quick example of the “honorableness” of Tax Court judges,most of whom are former IRS lawyers. The present I got for my thirty-seventhbirthday (on 6/24/05) was a story in the press exposing the fact that the TaxCourt had lied its butt off. In short, a civil tax trial ended with a specialtrial judge ruling against the IRS and in favor of a Mr. Kanter, in a caseinvolving $30 million. The trial judge stated that “the court cannot find orconclude that [the IRS’s] claimed kickback schemes existed or ... that there wasfraud.” However, under the Tax Court rules at that time, the ruling in favor ofMr. Kanter was kept secret, after which a different judge, Tax Court judgeHarold Dawson—who had not presided over the trial, and wasn’t even there—decidedto rule in favor of the IRS. Of course, one judge overruling another is not allthat unusual, but Judge Dawson did not say he was overruling anything; he saidhe was just adopting the findings of the original trial judge, which was anoutright, bald-faced lie. (The victim of that lie, Mr. Kanter, died before thelie was exposed.) Even legal experts and law professors raised an eyebrow or twoat that. What’s the point of having a trial when the ruling is kept secret, andthen the Tax Court just lies about the outcome of the trial, and punishes theone who won at the trial? The lawyer for Mr. Kanter’s estate was quoted assaying, “I am aghast at what has happened. After 35 years of trying these cases,believing that taxpayers got a fair adjudication, I have found out I was wrong.”(I could have told him that.) The “honorable” scumbag judge, when asked forcomment, said, “I’m not free to discuss this and I don’t have any comment tomake,” and also added, “The case is still in litigation and I think it would beunethical for me to make any comments.” Oh, now he suddenly has ethics? Right.Where were his ethics when he was telling that thirty-million-dollar lie? AndI’m supposed to accept on faith the baseless assertions of these people? No,thanks.Granted, there are occasions when one would be justified in saying, “That’s toostupid to dignify it with a response,” but the 861 evidence isn’t anywhere nearbelonging in that category. (I hope the reader will at least skim over my“Taxable Income” report, Appendix A in this book, so he can see that forhimself.) Yes, the conclusion that most Americans don’t owe federal income taxesis obviously contrary to popular opinion, but that conclusion is the result ofsound logic applied to ample legal documentation. If the punchline really isfrivolous, then (by definition) it should be very easy to point out at least oneglaring flaw of logic or law somewhere in the argument. But no one seems able todo that. The feds can’t even decide just which points they disagree with; theyjust really don’t like the conclusion which all the points together lead to,because it threatens their power.ASKING QUESTIONSIf only one or two people, or even a few dozen, were making some wacky-soundingclaim, I might have to sympathize with government lawyers who didn’t want toinvest the time and effort to carefully refute such a claim point by point.After all, they can’t be expected to give a comprehensive, detailed rebuttal toevery question or argument anyone can come up with. They just don’t have theresources.That excuse does not apply here, however. By the time of my trial, there werejust over 6,400 people subscribed to my e-mail update list. There were alsosomewhere around 13,000 copies of my Theft by Deception video (which I’ll talkabout later) in circulation, and several hundred thousand “861 Evidence”mini-CDs (which I’ll also talk about later) out there. And over a span ofseveral years, my free “Taxable Income” report had been downloaded nearly half amillion times.So this was not some isolated, insignificant happening. (They wouldn’t havebothered to prosecute me if it were.) Within a couple of years after my “TaxableIncome” report came out, the 861 issue had become a huge problem for the IRS,and they knew it. They issued several public notices bashing the issue andthreatening to fine anyone who brought it up, while they continued to dodge thesubstance of it. Once again, if there were a substantive rebuttal available,don’t you think they would have focused their efforts on getting it out thereinstead of just shouting “frivolous” over and over again?Not content with the insults and threats coming from our “public servants,”several thousand of us uppity folk started organizing letter-writing campaigns.Rather than complaining or preaching, all the letters did was to ask severalspecific questions about how to properly determine our taxable income. That’sall. Surely providing specific answers to a few basic questions that were beingasked by thousands of Americans would be in the IRS’s best interest. (Or rather,it would be in their best interest if there was any way to answer the questionswithout exposing the largest financial fraud in history.) So let’s examine theresults of our efforts to get some answers.1) King GeorgePerhaps the most pathetic response to our questions came from President Bush’soffice. In response to three specific questions about how to determine taxableincome, he thanked the person for contacting the White House “about the taxburden of the American people.” Huh? The rest of the letter, which said nothingeven remotely related to the questions asked, was a sales pitch for Mr. Bush’salleged “tax relief agenda.” Well, it’s hard to get any more nonresponsive thanthat.2) Charles Rossotti, Commissioner of the IRSSeveral hundred Americans (at least) sent Mr. Rossotti three basic questionsabout how to properly comply with the tax code—how to accurately determine one’staxable income. The two main questions (which are the primary theme of all ofthe following letter-writing campaigns) can be paraphrased as: “Should I useSection 861 and related regulations to determine my taxable domestic income?”and “Do those sections show my income to be taxable?” Reasonable enough, don’tyou think?These are not trick questions, nor are they complicated. For any given person,either he should use those sections, or he shouldn’t. You can’t “kinda” use asection of law. And either those sections do show his income to be taxable, orthey don’t. Income can’t be “kinda” taxable. Surely it should be easy for theIRS Commissioner to answer a couple of questions about determining what we owe,right? I mean, a hundred million of us are expected to do it every year, sosomeone in the IRS ought to be able to explain how to do it.To make a long story short (again), after literally years of people sendingthose questions to Commissioner Rossotti, I never saw anything from his officethat was anywhere near being an answer to any of the questions we asked. Forevery letter-writing campaign, I asked the participants to send me copies ofwhatever responses they received from the government. And they did. I have quitea collection of “response” letters, though none of them actually respond to anyof the questions.3) CongressWe also did several letter-writing campaigns targeting members of Congress withthose same basic questions about how to determine taxable income. We didn’t geta letter to every one of them, but we got most of them (several hundred). Surelythe ones who enact laws could answer questions about them, right?Of the representatives who did anything at all with the letters, most simplyforwarded them to the IRS. Think of that: the group of people that writes thelaws deferred the questions to those who administer the laws. In fact, inresponse to the questions, the office of Senator Zell Miller sent back aresponse saying this: “Thank you for your recent letter regarding theapplication of the federal tax code; unfortunately, this issue falls outside thejurisdiction of a United States Senator.” What?! I guess they only write thelaws; you can’t expect them to be able to explain what they mean.With very few exceptions, the remainder of the “representatives” just did a “cutand paste” from a non-responsive IRS form letter, and put it on their owncongressional letterhead so it would look as if they had actually looked intothe matter (but we weren’t fooled). Others did not hide the fact that theymerely referred the questions to the IRS. For example, John McCain responded tothe questions with a three-line cover letter, along with an IRS form letter.Senator McCain’s letter said only this: “Thank you for your informationregarding your tax questions. I am always interested in matters that affect myconstituents. Thank you again for bringing this matter to my attention.” Nicegeneric politician drivel. And if you think that was lame, below is what theaccompanying IRS form letter said. Remember, this is in response to a guy doingnothing other than requesting answers to a few basic questions about determiningtaxable income.“I am responding to your inquiry dated July 10, 2004, on behalf of [nastyquestion-asker] . His inquiry was about the federal income tax. [Nastyquestion-asker’s] recent letter and other similar letters he sent to you and theInternal Revenue Service seem to reflect personal opinions and frustrations withthe federal tax system, which we cannot address. The federal courts haveconsistently ruled against the issues [question-asker] has raised, and we havegiven him all the information that we have. Unfortunately, we do not have theresources to continue to respond to each of [question-asker’s] letters.Therefore, we cannot respond to future correspondence from him about the sameissues. ”Personal opinions? Frustrations with the tax system? And how the heck did “thefederal courts” rule against questions? The IRS gave the guy all the informationthey have? You mean they don’t know how the guy is supposed to determine his taxliability? And if the IRS is so low on resources, why didn’t they just answerthe guy’s questions the first time he asked them, instead of repeatedly evadingthem?Other congressfolk sent their constituents a report from the “CongressionalResearch Service.” For the first few years, the rather lengthy CRS report saidexactly nothing about 861. A later version included a short blurb, paraphrasedfrom an IRS form letter, which carefully avoided the questions we were asking.(I must mention, with some disappointment, that even the office of CongressmanRon Paul, who certainly talks as if he’s pro-freedom, pro-Constitution, andagainst the income tax, sent out the same insulting, evasive drivel as all theothers. I expect that that was not Dr. Paul’s idea, but some boneheadedunderling’s doing.)4) Mark Everson, Commissioner of the IRSAt a press conference on September 16, 2003, Commissioner Everson (Mr.Rossotti’ssuccessor) boldly proclaimed that “the IRS must help people understand their taxobligations,” which is just what the IRS “Mission Statement” says. Hear, hear!Within a week of making that statement, his office received over 1,200 lettersfrom different people across the country, all asking him to please answer a fewquestions (shown below) about how to properly determine taxable income.Mr. Everson’s initial response was to ignore all of us completely. A couple ofmonths later, however, the IRS began sending out a flood of form letters tohundreds, if not thousands, of Americans. Hooray! Answers at long last!Well, no. The form letter didn’t even mention 861 at all. Nor did it mention thequestions asked, or even hint that any questions had been asked. No, the massmail response—presumably directed by Mr. “Customer Service” Eversonhimself—instead lamented the fact that some people “encourage others todeliberately violate our nation’s tax laws,” and warned that nasty things mighthappen to anyone who listens to those people. (How exactly does “Go ask thegovernment how to obey the law” translate into “Go deliberately violate thelaw”?) The letter ended by bluntly saying that the IRS “will not respond tofuture correspondence concerning these issues.”So let’s recap: 1,200 citizens: “How do we properly comply with the law?” IRS:“You better obey the law or else! And we’re not gonna talk to you anymore!” Niceattitude, Führer Everson. Astonishingly, that same form letter also gushes abouthow the IRS strives to act “in a manner that warrants the highest degree ofpublic confidence in our integrity, efficiency, and fairness.” How Orwellian canyou get? Do as you’re told, or the Ministry of Love will grind you to dust! Goodgrief.And just so you can see what that was in response to, here are the actualquestions all those people sent to Commissioner Everson:Questions Regarding Determining Taxable Income1) Should I use the rules found in 26 USC § 861(b) and 26 CFR § 1.861-8 (inaddition to any other pertinent sections) to determine my taxable domesticincome?2) If some people should not use those sections to determine their taxabledomestic income, please show where the law says who should or should not usethose sections for that.Reasons for first two questions: The regulations at 26 CFR § 1.861-8 begin bystating that Sections 861(b) and 863(a) state in general terms “how to determinetaxable income of a taxpayer from sources within the United States” after grossincome from the U.S. has been determined. Section 1.861-1(a)(1) confirms that“taxable income from sources within the United States” is to be determined inaccordance with the rules of 26 USC § 861(b) and 26 CFR § 1.861-8 (see also 26CFR §§ 1.861-1(b), 1.862-1(b), 1.863-1(c)). Cross-references under 26 USC § 61,as well as entries in the USC Index under the heading “Income Tax,” also referto Section 861 regarding income (”gross” and “taxable”) from “sources withinU.S.”3) If a U.S. citizen receives all his income from working within the 50 states,do 26 USC § 861(b) and 26 CFR § 1.861-8 show his income to be taxable?Reason for question: Section 217 of the Revenue Act of 1921, predecessor of 26USC § 861 and following, stated that income from the U.S. was taxable fornonresident foreigners, and for U.S. corporations and citizens deriving most oftheir income from federal possessions, but did not say the same about thedomestic income of other Americans. The regulations under the 1939 Code (e.g. §§29.119-1, 29.119-2, 29.119-9, 29.119-10 (1945)) showed the same thing. Thecurrent regulations at 1.861-8 still show income to be taxable only when derivedfrom certain “specific sources and activities,” which still relate only tocertain types of international trade (see 26 CFR §§ 1.861-8(a)(1),1.861-8(a)(4), 1.861-8(f)(1)).4) Should one use 26 CFR § 1.861-8T(d)(2) to determine whether his “items” ofincome (e.g. compensation, interest, rents, dividends, etc.) are excluded forfederal income tax purposes?Reason for question: The regulations (26 CFR § 1.861-8(a)(3)) state that a“class of gross income” consists of the “items” of income listed in 26 USC § 61(e.g. compensation, interest, rents, dividends, etc.). The regulations (26 CFR §1.861-8(b)(1)) then direct the reader to 26 CFR § 1.861-8(d)(2) which providesthat such “classes of gross income” may include some income which is excludedfor federal income tax purposes. (Section 1.861-8(d)(2) merely redirects thereader to 1.861-8T(d)(2).)5) What is the purpose of the list of non-exempt types of income found in 26 CFR§ 1.861-8T(d)(2)(iii), and why is the income of the average American not on thatlist?Reason for question: After defining “exempt income” to mean income which isexcluded for federal income tax purposes, the regulations(26 CFR §1.861-8T(d)(2)(iii)) list types of income which are not exempt (i.e. which aresubject to tax), including the domestic income of nonresident foreigners,certain foreign income of U.S. Citizens and residents, income of certainpossessions corporations, and income of international and foreign salescorporations; but the list does not include the domestic income of the averageAmerican.6) What types of income(if any) are not exempted from taxation by any statute,but are nonetheless “excluded by law” (i.e. not subject to the income tax)because they are, under the Constitution, not taxable by the federal government?Reason for question: Older income tax regulations defining “gross income” and“net income” said that neither income exempted by statute “or fundamental law”were subject to the tax (§ 39.21-1 (1956)), and said that in addition to thetypes of income exempted by statute, other types of income were excluded becausethey were, “under the Constitution, not taxable by the Federal Government” (§39.22(b)-1 (1956)). (This is also reflected in the current 26 CFR § 1.312-6.)Yeah, we’re a bunch of nasty scofflaw “tax protestors,” aren’t we? How dare weask how to properly comply with the law?5) Pamela Olson, Assistant Secretary of the TreasuryIn our long quest to find someone in government who wouldn’t treat us like dirtfor asking perfectly reasonable questions, I thought I saw a ray of hope in Ms.Pamela Olson. We had learned that her office in the Treasury Department (TaxPolicy) was the highest office with actual hands-on dealings with the income taxregulations. More interestingly, on the internet I found the transcript of aspeech Ms. Olson had given, talking about how to improve “compliance” with thetax laws. (An iron maiden and the rack would no doubt be Mr. Everson’s choice.)Ms. Olson’s comments on August 8, 2002, to a committee of congressfolk includedthe following:“Mr. Chairman, you were among the first to highlight concerns about taxshelters, tax scams, and schemes. ... I believe our self-assessment system isstrong, but keeping it strong requires the confidence of the citizenry. Researchby social scientists suggests that when it comes to complying with the law, thebelief that the laws are legitimate and should be obeyed has a strongermotivating effect than the fear of being caught.”So, convincing people that they actually owe the tax will do more for“compliance” than threatening to hurt them! No kidding. At last! Someone whowould give us answers instead of threats!Actually, she gave neither. She completely ignored the first volley of letterswhich over three hundred of us sent in late 2002, asking those six peskyquestions shown above. A few months later we tried again (with another 300letters), and a bunch of us called her office, asking when we could expectanswers to our questions. Her “answer,” which came shortly thereafter, was toresign. Oh well. (Her predecessor, Marc Weinberg, had also resigned after afriend of mine kept sending him those darn letters asking questions about 861.)So another high official refused to answer, But there was more to the Pam Olsonsaga, which I didn’t learn until much later. On February 5, 2003, I sent out ane-mail message to a lot of the people paying attention to the 861 evidence. Thatmessage included the following:“So far Ms. Olson has only gotten letters. I bet a few hundred letters got herattention. It probably caused her some stress when she realized she can’t answerthe questions. She may not know the truth yet, but she at least knows somethingis fishy. How much do the letters bother her? Maybe none, maybe pretty much. Howmuch would a full-page ad in the Washington Times bother her, that said… PAMOLSON, ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTIONS! (…and then briefly explained the situation.)How about if that appeared in newspapers across the country? How about if 500people showed up at her office in DC one day, asking her to answer thequestions? How about if eight people a day (one an hour) took turns visiting heroffice, every day for the next few months? How about at her house? How about if500 people called her office every DAY, asking when she was going to answer thequestions? How about if people could ask their ‘representatives’ to please tellPam Olson to answer the questions? What if it was 5000 people, instead of 500?What if a few thousand people called every talk show they could find, andmention the insanity of the feds being unable to answer basic questions abouthow we are supposed to determine what we owe (and have a handy-dandy web pageabout it to point to)? A few hundred letters to the editor, all mentioning PamOlson in particular?”Brace yourself because this gets a little weird. In December of 2004, almost twoyears after I sent that e-mail, a story ran in the Wall Street Journal about aMs. J.J. MacNab, who had taken it upon herself to act as a spy for the IRS,lurking in online chatrooms under a fake identity, spying on people in the “taxhonesty movement” and reporting her findings to the feds. The feds even creditMs. MacNab with being “instrumental in shutting down a variety of illegal taxshelters, from high-end estate-planning techniques to low-end tax-protesterscams.” Trouble is, by “scams” they don’t just mean people hiding stuff or lyingabout stuff; they also include those annoying people who ask inconvenientquestions about the tax laws. They can’t afford to describe us as what we are:people who have reached unconventional—but solidly supported—conclusions aboutthe proper application of the law. No, they have to demonize us. Get a load ofhow the Wall Street Journal article did it:“Last year, Ms. MacNab—using the Patriot alias—intensified her scrutiny ofantitax guru Larken [sic] Rose. On an online discussion group with 2,500followers, Patriot came across veiled threats of violence against U.S. taxofficials.”First of all, notice how when people disagree with the government, they’re nevera bunch of independent thinkers; it’s always a “guru” and his “followers” or“adherents.” But more amazingly: threats of violence?! Now back up a fewparagraphs, and see what the WSJ and MacNab were characterizing as “veiledthreats of violence.” Of course, they didn’t actually quote those supposed“threats” from me, because it would expose the insanity of their “spin.” Butwait, there’s more. The government propaganda in the WSJ article continued:“Ms. MacNab alerted Ms. [Pam] Olson, then a Treasury assistant secretary, whowas being lambasted online for speaking out against tax shelters and scams. At a63 breakfast quickly arranged by Ms. Olson, Ms. MacNab showed the Treasuryofficial e-mails prodding the tax protesters to harass and stalk her. Ms. Olsonsays she immediately arranged to receive Secret Service protection. ”Harass and stalk her? Ever heard of the idea that the people have the right to“petition the government for a redress of grievances” (First Amendment) whenthey think they’re being mistreated, Ms. Olson? And who the heck was“lambasting” her for “speaking out against tax shelters and scams”? No one. Wewere complaining that she was refusing to answer a few perfectly reasonablequestions being asked by hundreds of hard-working, honest Americans. And she ranto the Secret Service because of that?! Why not just answer the damn questions,Ms. Olson?Considering how wildly inaccurate the WSJ story was, the next day I sent aletter to the author, Monica Langley, pointing out how many things wereblatantly untrue in her article. I also pointed out how ironic it was that shetried to paint me as the one using threats and intimidation, in light of some ofthe things the IRS, by that time, had done to me (which you’ll learn about lateron). My letter concluded as follows:“Whatever you think about my conclusions regarding the tax laws (if you’ve evenheard of them before), I hope you don’t approve of government-sponsoredcensorship, slander, libel, and demonization. And if you learn that someone haslied to YOU, and you have printed that lie for all to see, I hope you arewilling to publicly correct it.”Well, Ms. Langley corrected the misspelling of my name, but that was all. Shedid write back to me, however. The only other thing she could come up with tojustify the “veiled threats of violence” claim was another e-mail I had sent tomy list, in which I talked about a person who had decided to go on a hungerstrike until the IRS would answer various questions about the tax laws. In mye-mail I opined that I would rather see someone like Pam Olson not getting anyfood until she answers the questions; that way the criminals, not their victims,would be the ones suffering. Of course, any moron reading my message could seethat I wasn’t suggesting that anyone do that to Ms. Olson. But the government,with the help of the lazy mainstream media, managed to characterize a bunch ofpeople doing nothing more than asking questions as violent terrorists.(Incidentally, the Wall Street Journal is not the only paper which has helpedthe government’s efforts to paint us as nasty criminals. In an article in Aprilof 2004, David Cay Johnston of the New York Times wrote a piece about payrollpersonnel dealing with more and more Americans who didn’t want anything withheldfrom their paychecks, because they didn’t think they owed federal income taxes.Consider the following snippets, all of which appeared in that one story: “WithInternet promoters fanning the flames”; “a class on how to deal with taxprotesters”; “payroll clerks being assaulted by workers enraged over taxes beingwithheld”; “comparing [“tax protestors’”] ‘pseudo-legal arguments’ to ‘theUnabomber’s manifesto’”; “Payroll officials should be careful with such people”;“They may not be very nice. ... They could be dangerous”; “That prompted DennisCarroll, who handles tax-denier claims by United States Postal Service workers,to announce, ‘I work behind three locked doors’.” The message the “story” wasdesigned to imply should be pretty obvious: people who don’t think they owetaxes are violent, nasty criminals. Apparently demonizing the messenger iseasier than refuting the message.)6) IRS Lawyers Specializing in 861Somewhere along the line, with a little research and a little luck, we managedto find a list of IRS attorneys who specialize in specific sections of the taxcode. So, naturally, we looked up the IRS experts on Section 861, and found thenames of Barbara Felker and David Bergkuist. Surely they would be able to answerour questions! If anyone could, it would have to be them—they were the IRS’snational experts on that particular part of the law.So the same friend of mine who wrote to Marc Weinberger—Tom Clayton, M.D., downin Texas (whom you’ll hear more about later on)—started exchanging letters withthe IRS’s 861 experts, and sent me copies of everything he sent to them andeverything he received from them. The results were more than a little curious.The questions being asked were (again) about who should use 861 and itsregulations, and what those sections show to be taxable, which any real 861“expert” should be able to answer in his sleep. After Dr. Clayton had asked thesame questions a few times, the IRS “experts” sent back the same nonresponsiveform letter that other IRS offices had been sending out. Remember, we’re talkingabout the IRS lawyers who are the top 861 experts in the country, working for“Chief Counsel” at IRS headquarters in Washington, D.C. Their entire job is tointerpret Section 861 and following, and the related regulations.So Dr. Clayton wrote to them again, thanking them for their nonresponsiveresponses, but pointing out that they hadn’t even come close to answeringanything he had actually asked. Then he asked once again that they pleaseprovide specific answers to his specific questions.Their final letter to the good doc stated that, having sent him the worthlessform letter, they had given him “all the general information” they had on thetopic. (How about some specific information, instead?) In other words, the IRS’sown national experts on 861 would not or could not answer the questions.Obviously they couldn’t plead ignorance (unlike most IRS paper-pushers). So whywouldn’t they answer?One truly bizarre incident must be mentioned here, though I still cannot explainit. When Dr. Clayton first starting sending questions to the 861 experts at theIRS, he made no reference to me, or my “Taxable Income” report, or any web site.He just asked a few specific, succinct, reasonable questions about the properapplication of Section 861 and its regulations. Then one day Dr. Claytonreceived a thick envelope from the office of David Bergkuist (IRS lawyerspecializing in Section 861). Could it be answers at last? Well, yes and no. Theonly thing in the envelope was a complete printout of my “Taxable Income”report. There was no cover letter or any sort of explanation with it, andneither of us had ever sent them my report. The printout showed that the reporthad been printed straight off of our web site—someone at IRS Chief Counsel hadprinted out my report and sent it to Dr. Clayton!Needless to say, we both considered that to be a pretty strange response. (Mydad informs me that, after I told him of the incident, he laughed about it foran entire day.) We could only come up with a few guesses at what it might mean,none of them very believable. Maybe this was their way of saying, “We know younasty people are working together!” But since we weren’t pretending otherwise,what would be the point of that? Or maybe Mr. Bergkuist was going over thereport, had a copy lying around, and some underling paper-pusher misunderstoodand sent it out, thinking it was supposed to be a response to the questions.Again, sounds unlikely.Or maybe, in a fluke fit of honesty, Mr. Bergkuist decided to send Dr.Clayton acopy of the most thorough, well-supported answer to his questions then inexistence: my report. (That is probably the least likely explanation, however,mainly because it would involve a government lawyer being honest.) We may neverknow why it happened.7) Jim South: Anti-861 CoordinatorAt one point we had spies inside the IRS who sent me some of their internalmemos (not meant for public consumption) showing that the IRS’s nationalanti-861 plan was headed up by someone named “Jim South.” (That might be a fakename, which IRS agents—and other unscrupulous crooks who don’t want others toknow who they really are—often use.) Well, I thought, if Mr. South was qualifiedto head the team dealing with us pesky 861 folk, maybe he could answer thequestions. So in early 2003, I gave out Mr. South’s office address and phonenumber to my e-mail update list (which was relatively small at the time),suggesting that as potential victims of Mr. South’s anti-861 designs, they mightwant to politely ask him how they should be applying the law. To make a longstory short (since you’ve heard it before), we melted Mr. South’s phone line,flooded his office with letters, and got no answers. (A few callers gotthreatened with audits and/or collections for daring to ask such hereticalquestions.) Apparently “answering questions” never occurred to Mr. South as apossible means of dealing with us pesky 861 folk. In fact, one person who calledhim reported to me that Mr. South said that the courts are the ones to answerquestions about the law, not the IRS—and then he hung up. Wow, how do the IRSbureaucrats enforce the law if they don’t know what it means?So, are you starting to find all this a little suspicious? Well, keep reading.8) Federal ProsecutorsDoesn’t it seem reasonable that anyone willing to prosecute people fordisobeying the tax laws should, conversely, be able to tell people how to obeythose laws? It does to me. So I suggested that people write letters to a fewfolk at the U.S. Department of Justice, asking those same questions about how toproperly determine one’s taxable domestic income.In addition to the Attorney General himself, we sent letters to Eileen O’Connor,who heads the Tax Division of the DOJ, and who had been particularlycondescending and insulting in DOJ “press releases” demonizing those evil,nasty, terrible people like me who dared to mention the forbidden number: 861.We also sent letters to Floyd Miller, the lead prosecutor in my case, andPatrick Meehan, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (andFloyd Miller’s boss). (The letters to Mr. Meehan and Mr. Miller are included intheir entirety later in this book.)As far as I know, neither Attorney General Ashcroft, Ms. O’Connor, Mr. Meehan,nor Mr. Miller ever sent any kind of response to any of the letters whichhundreds of people sent in. (I know I never got a response from any of them.)What Mr. Miller did instead was whine to the court about all the letters theywere receiving. Well, boohoo. Somehow Mr. Miller saw my suggestion that peopleask the government about how to comply with the law as something naughty, if notillegal. So apparently those who prosecute people for supposedly breaking thelaw either cannot or will not tell people how to obey the law. I guess the lawworks by trial and error: if you get prosecuted, you did it wrong. If not, youeither did it right, or they just haven’t gotten around to you yet. What aninteresting system.The same former federal prosecutor I mentioned before—the one who ended upagreeing with my conclusions—related to me the fact that he was never trained intax law. In the few tax cases he helped to prosecute, both sides just assumedthat the defendant’s income was taxable, and therefore assumed that he owed thetax, and then just argued about whether he had hidden anything or lied aboutanything. So if you’re tempted to assume that prosecutors must be familiar withthe law (as I once would have assumed), think again.(On another occasion, when someone asked DOJ officials to answer those six peskyquestions, the response they received went like this: “Because all of thequestions relate to Internal Revenue Code (hereinafter ‘I.R.C.’) § 861, I willaddress them all by stating that I.R.C. § 861 deals with foreign income and isnot relevant to your case unless you received income from a foreign country.”What? A section entirely about income from sources inside the U.S.—which doesn’tsay a thing about foreign income—only applies to people who have foreign income?Yeah, that makes loads of sense. More on this later.)9) Various IRS officesPeople across the country also sent those same questions to all sorts ofdifferent IRS officials and bureaucrats, most of whom didn’t respond at all.Most of those who did write back just sent out non-responsive form letters.This calls for a brief detour from the story. Some people have made an art formout of evasion and obfuscation. (They’re usually called “lawyers.”) They manageto dodge simple questions, and instead give misleading, long-winded answers toquestions which nobody asked. Consider this analogy: Suppose Bob is on trial forthe murder of Fred, who one afternoon was found lying dead in his own livingroom. At trial, having been coached by his lawyer, Bob truthfully states all ofthe following: “I did not stab Fred, I’ve never even been in Fred’s house, and Iwas home all afternoon.” If those are all true, then surely Bob must beinnocent, right? Wrong. Bob shot Fred (didn’t stab him) through his living roomwindow (he was never in the house) at 11:45 a.m. (not in the afternoon), andthen went home. But using careful lawyer-spin, and meticulously avoiding thequestion of whether he killed Fred, he could say things which were literallytrue yet misleading. If you think that sounds far-fetched, remember, this iswhat lawyers are paid to do: “spin” facts and the law to try to get the desireddecision for their clients. What they carefully avoid saying, and the questionsthey carefully dodge, are often more telling than what they do say. With thataspect of “lawyer-speak” in mind, let’s look at what the IRS form letters do anddo not say.For starters, most of the form letters talk about various “tax protestor”theories and arguments which have nothing at all to do with the 861 evidence. Ifyou ask whether you should be using Section 861, you might, for example, get aform letter back refuting the claim that the Sixteenth Amendment wasn’t properlyratified, or that the term “income” means only corporate profit, or that the taxis unconstitutional, or that only gold is money, or that the tax is “voluntary,”and so on. The IRS has a nasty habit of responding to what they wished you hadasked (things they have answers for), while ignoring what you actually did ask.And even the few form letters which do mention 861 manage to carefully avoidanswering the questions. They use linguistic tap-dances, throw out a fewassertions, dodge the heart of the matter, and end in a flurry of insults anddire warnings. (How hard can it possibly be to send a letter which either says“Yes, you should use those sections” or “No, you should not use thosesections”?)Often the strawman method of argument is used: changing the opponent’s positionto make it easier to respond to it. For example, one common IRS form letterdisputes the claim that “only foreign source income is taxable,” even though noone familiar with the 861 evidence would ever make such a claim. After all,there wouldn’t be sections for determining “taxable income from sources withinthe United States” (meaning 861 and its regulations) if income from inside theUnited States is never taxable.Another IRS form letter argues that Section 861 does not exempt the domesticincome of U.S. citizens from taxation. That is also very true, but also veryirrelevant. No one is arguing that 861 exempts anything from tax. That’s justnot at all what sections 861 through 863 do, or how they work. Again, the formletters change the issue in order to be able to refute it. Why not just answerwhat was actually asked?Most of the form letters refer to the broadly worded general definition of“gross income” found in Section 61. A couple of form letters also reference theregulations at 26 CFR § 1.1-1, which explain that the tax applies to “taxableincome” and that citizens are liable for the taxes imposed by the tax code,whether their taxable income comes “from sources inside or outside the UnitedStates.” What those form letters do not mention, for obvious reasons, is thatthe regulations (at 26 CFR § 1.863-1(c)) also say that “The taxpayer’s taxableincome from sources within or without the United States will be determined underthe rules of Secs. 1.861-8” and following (the regs under 861). The taxes“imposed by the Code” apply only to one’s taxable income (not all income), sowhy does the IRS response try to sneak around the question of how to determineone’s taxable income?With all the verbiage put into their non-responses, one has to wonder, why notjust answer the @#&%$ questions?! “Should I use these sections?” “Yes, youshould,” or “No, you should not.” See how easy it should be? Since they send outthousands of form letters anyway, why not write one that actually answers thequestions, and send out thousands of copies of that? But the government, fromtop to bottom, refuses to just answer a simple question with a simple answer.Why do you suppose that is?Here is why they can’t (or won’t) answer the question about whether we’re allsupposed to use 861 and its regulations: because if they say “no,” they aredirectly contradicting their own regulations, whereas if they say “yes,” thatwould lead many people to conclude (correctly) that they don’t owe anything infederal income taxes. The questions, though simple, put the IRS in aninescapable trap. So they just refuse to answer them.One IRS response which someone forwarded to me was particularly amusing. Itwhined that “The questions are constructed in such a way that any answer couldbe construed to support arguments that the tax laws of this country do not applyto the questioner or his/her income.” Time out! The two main questions amount to“Do I use 861 and its regs?” and “Do they show my income to be taxable?” If theanswers were “yes, you should use those sections” and “yes, they show yourincome to be taxable,” where’s the problem? Or if the first answer is “No, youshouldn’t use those sections,” where’s the problem? The only combination ofanswers they would have any reason to not want to give are the correct answers:“Yes, you should use those sections, and no, they don’t show your income to betaxable.” So their refusal to answer clearly implies that they know those to bethe truthful answers. Why else would they hesitate to answer? (“Mr. Jones, isthis your gun, and did you shoot Bob with it?” “Well, those questions areconstructed in such a way that if I answer them, you’ll think that I killedBob.”)Basically, the feds “pleaded the Fifth,” essentially confessing that answeringthe questions correctly would make people think they don’t owe the tax. Inshort, their response amounts to “If we tell you how to determine what you owe,you’ll think you don’t owe anything!” Well gee, I wonder why. That particularletter went on to insult the question-asker, saying that “the IRS cannot providefodder for those who promote or accept these frivolous and self-servingarguments,” therefore concluding that it was perfectly proper for the IRS torefuse to answer the questions, which the IRS mischaracterizes as an “argument.”(The letter also says that the IRS is willing to help resolve any “legitimate”problems, so apparently they think that wanting to know how to determine whatyou owe isn’t “legitimate.”)In 2004, the IRS issued “Revenue Ruling” 2004-30, so they’d have somethingofficial-sounding to use to bash the 861 issue. However, the officialness is inappearance only. The IRS’s own manual—the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM)—saysthat Revenue Rulings “do not have the force and effect of Treasury DepartmentRegulations” (IRM § 4.10.7.2.6.1). But what made the Revenue Ruling curious isthat it didn’t at all match the normal format of Revenue Rulings, which areusually issued in individual cases to express “the conclusions of the Service onthe application of the law to specific facts stated in the ruling” (IRM §4.10.7.2.6). If, for example, you wanted to take a particular questionablededuction, the IRS might issue a Revenue Ruling explaining why they were denyingit. Except for Revenue Ruling 2004-30, such “rulings” are just technicalanalysis, not demonization and threat pieces.In between warnings and insults, the ruling only says a few things about the lawitself. For example, it says that “there is no authority in sections 861 through865 that permits an individual to take the position that either the individualor the individual’s U.S.-based income is not subject to federal income tax.”Literally, that is quite true. Sections 861 through 863 themselves divide allincome—whether taxable or not—into “within” and “without” income. Since 1932,those statutes themselves don’t say when such income is actually taxable. TheIRS ruling also correctly states that “Sections 861 through 865 do not limitgross income subject to United States taxation to foreign-source income.” Again,true: there wouldn’t be a Section 861 if income from within the U.S. were nevertaxable. Then the ruling says this: “The rules of sections 861 through 865 havesignificance solely in determining whether income is considered from sourceswithin the United States or without the United States, which is relevant, forexample, in determining whether a U.S. citizen or resident may claim a creditfor foreign taxes paid.”To some extent, that’s true. Those statutes give the geographic “source” rules,but do not specify when domestic income and/or foreign income are actuallytaxable. The related regulations, as well as the statutes throughout the rest ofSubchapter N of the tax code, do that. But the implication—for which the rulingdoesn’t give a shred of legal support—is that most folks don’t need to lookthere at all to determine their taxable domestic income. As you can see above,there is no basis in the law for that statement, and half a dozen regulationssaying the exact opposite.Keep in mind, the things mentioned here are what the IRS sends out to people whoask a few basic questions about determining taxable domestic income. Neitherthat “Revenue Ruling,” nor anything else they send out, actually answers any ofthe questions. There must be correct answers to the questions, and if 100million of us are expected to properly determine our taxable income, shouldn’tfolks in the IRS know how to do that? Furthermore, shouldn’t they be willing toexplain to us how to do it?“Mission of the Service: Provide America’s taxpayers top quality service byhelping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying thetax law with integrity and fairness to all.” [IRM § 1.2.1.2.1]With that in mind, let’s go beyond the template form letters, and see howdifferent IRS employees have responded to those basic questions about how todetermine what we owe. Remember, it is literally impossible to determine “yourtaxes” if you can’t answer these questions. We’ve already seen how several IRSoffices floundered and evaded. Here are a few more responses from different IRSfolk across the country.Example #1:A Mr. Morris (IRS ID# 04-04588), in response to someone asking whether he shoulduse 26 CFR § 1.861-8 to determine his taxable domestic income, said this: “Thesimple answer to your question is that you would use 26 CFR 1.861-8 to determineyour taxable income.” Hooray, he got it right! (So why am I sitting in prisonfor doing that?) He even quoted from the beginning of 26 CFR § 1.861-8 to backit up, just as I do. However, his response then took a strange turn:“While the answer to your question per the above quote may be to the affirmativethat 26 CFR 1.861-8 is used to figure your taxable income from income sourceswithin the United States, it is also the case that such a regulation is not adirect source that is usable to laymen for making the determination you want tomake.”Huh? What does that mean? Yes, it’s the section to use, but not for us merepeasants? His response continues:“The above regulation is a technical arbiter that is a basis for rules found inpublications, which are the actual tolls [tools?] for determining taxableincome.”What? The publications are legally worthless, yet this guy wants people ignoringthe regulations and just relying on the publications. Why?“As a practical matter, the above regulation [Section 1.861-8] would beconfusing to most people who may try to use it for figuring taxable income evenas it serves as the basis for their ultimate calculations.”In other words, Yes, that’s the section to use—but don’t, because it will onlyconfuse you. Huh?“This regulation is more or less useful to lawyers and accountants who need toresolve specific client situations or misunderstandings that arise from laypublications like publication 17, which is one of the more general publicationsfor individuals. Most of publication 17 in one way or another is dedicated tohelping you determine your taxable income.”So apparently only lawyers should look there, and only if some worthlesspublication doesn’t answer their questions. In case you doubt what I said aboutpublications versus regulations, here is what the IRS’s own manual says:“Publications are nonbinding on the Service and do not necessarily cover allpositions for a given issue. While a good source of general information,publications should not be cited to sustain a position.” [IRM § 4.10.7.2.8]“The Service is bound by the regulations.” [IRM § 4.10.7.2.4]Ready for the grand finale? Mr. Morris’ response concluded with this: “To sum upmy response, you can use 26 CFR 1.861-8 to determine your taxable income, but Iwouldn’t recommend it.” Wow. (I guess I wouldn’t “recommend” it either, since Igot thrown in prison for doing it.)Example #2:When asked if one should use 861 and its regs to determine his taxable domesticincome, a Mr. Emirides (IRS ID# 04-03296) responded as follows:“Thank you for your email regarding what is the code section and federalregulation titled Taxable income from sources within the United States. [Whoasked that?] Yes, code section 861(b) is titled Income from sources within theUnited States, and the applicable Federal Tax Regulations is [sic] section1.861-1(b).”That was the entire response. While not quite coherent or grammatically correct,it seemed to be agreeing that 861 is the place to be for determining taxabledomestic income. So again, why am I in prison for doing exactly that?(Incidentally, for the hyper-picky folk out there like me, Section 1.861-8 ofthe regs, not 1.861-1(b), corresponds to Section 861(b) of the statutes, and thetitle the IRS guy quoted is the title of Section 861, not 861(b).)Example #3:When someone asked whether 861 and its regs show the income of the averageAmerican to be taxable, here was the response he got from a Mr.Shuman (IRS ID#59-06262): “Thank you for your inquiry dated 11-20-03. Please refer to Title 26of the United States Code. Section 6012, or Publication 2105.”That was it. Section 6012 says that one who receives a certain amount of “grossincome” must file a tax return. It says nothing about 861, “taxable income,” oranything remotely related to the question. Publication 2105, on the other hand,is just a long-winded, legally worthless insult to so-called “tax protestors,”which says absolutely nothing about 861 or its regulations. This should tell youa lot about how the IRS paper-pushers are trained: If anyone mentions 861,insult him, threaten him, and tell him to pay his fair share. Why not train themto answer the questions instead?Example #4:As you can see above, one of the six questions is whether one should “refer to26 CFR Section 1.861-8T(d)(2) to determine in which situations the items ofincome listed in 26 USC § 61 are excluded for federal income tax purposes.” Herewas the response to that question from a Mr. Brown (IRS ID# 04-01770):“It appears you are reading I.R.C. 61 backwards. I.R.C. 61 is a list (but notlimited to the items listed) of items which are included as gross income. I.R.C.861 concerns Income from sources within the United States. Based on thesedefinitions, the answer to your question is NO, if you are talking about a U.S.citizen or resident. Such individuals are taxed on their worldwide income,unless a particular item of income is made exempt, or made nontaxable, by a lawof the United States. This information is from I.R.C. 61, and 861, of theInternal Revenue Code of the United States.”There is a lot worth mentioning in those few sentences: 1) The IRS guyacknowledges that 861 is about domestic income, which is nice. 2) For somereason, he then implies that one should not look to 861 if he is a U.S. citizen(even though 1.861-8T(d)(2) specifically includes matters involving U.S.citizens). 3) He ignores the point of the question, which is that the regs under861 specifically say that the “items” in Section 61 sometimes include exempt orexcluded income. 4) He implies that only income exempt by statute can benontaxable (just as I said tax folk believe).But notice the complete absence of logic in his argument: Section 61 listsitems, and 861 is about income from within the U.S., therefore you should notlook at 1.861-8T(d)(2) to determine whether your income is exempt. Where onearth is the logic in that, or even anything remotely resembling a connection?“Wombats are marsupials, and cheetahs have spots, and therefore snails can’tread.” Do these people think that the office they hold, plus lots of words (nomatter how irrelevant or incoherent), should be enough to persuade people?Sadly, for many it probably is.Example #5:The above examples were from e-mail exchanges, but below is an exchange whichoccurred on the phone (in early 2004). Someone who had asked the questions inwriting received an irrelevant, insulting form letter from the IRS folk in Ogden(containing the usual rubber-stamp “signature” of the probably-mythical IRSoverlord, “Dennis Parizek”). So the citizen gave the Ogden office of the IRS acall. Here is what happened:IRS: “Thank you for holding, this is [name inaudible], I.D. #0462546926. How canI help you?”Citizen: “I need to speak to a Dennis Parizek, please.”IRS: “Okay. He’s actually our boss and his name is on our computer-generatedletters.”’Citizen: “Aha.”IRS: “Is there something I can help you with?”Citizen: “Yes. I just received a letter that said it was in response ‘to myrecent correspondence,’ and I’m wondering which correspondence that was, becauseI’ve sent several in the last year and this is the only reply that I’ve gotten.”IRS “Okay, and what was, let’s see—Okay, what was your response, did they put inthe letter anything about it? Or, what was in the letter?”Citizen: “The letter that I sent—I had some questions regarding how to determinemy taxable income, and the response that I got—there was no answer to any of thequestions whatsoever and there was a response of ‘the courts have ruled againstthe arguments’ that I have made and they would ‘not respond to any futurecorrespondence concerning these issues’ from me. Uh, I didn’t make anyarguments. I just asked some simple questions about determining my taxableincome.”[five-second pause]IRS: “Okay, well, that is a frivolous action towards us and that—we do notrespond to any of those.”Citizen: “I’m sorry??”IRS: “We do not respond to any of those letters. That’s just the way it is.”Citizen: “I don’t understand. Isn’t the IRS supposed to help me understand mytax obligations?”[three-second pause]IRS “Well, in a way, yes, but—”Citizen: “Well, if I can’t go to the IRS to understand what my tax obligationsare, where am I supposed to go to?”IRS: “Well, your tax obligations are—you make wages, you pay taxes, that’s justthe way it is.”Citizen: “Well, that’s what I’m saying. I got—in the law—I have some questionsabout what the law says.”IRS: “Well, I’m—we’re not to discuss the tax law with you, sir.”Citizen: “Okay. Um, who do I go to?”IRS: “Well—you can go—to the books—whatever—but we’re not discussing those kindof tax laws with you.”Citizen: “Ha, ha, ha. Now you got me really confused. Okay, well maybe we can dothis. In the letter that was sent to me it said the federal courts haveconsistently ruled against the ‘arguments’ that I have made. Could I get—couldyou direct me to the rulings that the federal court has made against theseso-called arguments that I guess you think that I have made?”IRS “No.”Citizen: “No??”IRS “We can’t do that either. I’m not going to discuss the tax laws or the courtrulings or anything like that with you.”Citizen: “Okay, well—somebody has to—I mean, that’s what the IRS is supposed todo. I mean, other than just say, you know, send it in. You’re supposed to helpme understand what I’m sending in and why I’m sending it in, right?”IRS “No, that’s just—that’s the way things are—I’m sorry, but—If you have anylegitimate tax questions then I’ll continue the call, if not then I am going todisconnect.”Citizen: “This isn’t a legitimate tax question?”IRS “Good-bye.”Citizen: “Hello, wait a minute. What did you say your name was again?Hello?”Wow, that’s some top-quality service, don’t you think? Let me point out, thatcall happened almost six years after my “Taxable Income” report was released, soit wasn’t some issue that was just sprung on them; this wasn’t the first personto ask this, or the hundredth, or the thousandth. If there were answers to thequestions that would preserve “conventional wisdom,” the folks at the IRS wouldbe eagerly giving them out every chance they got. Their responses, spanning manyyears, are obviously an indication that they cannot afford to address the issuerationally and openly. And, quite obviously, IRS personnel are trained to refuseto talk about this issue; they are warned beforehand to never discuss that partof the law. The guy said he had some questions about how to determine what heowes, and they called that a “frivolous action” against the IRS. Nothingsuspicious there, huh?Example #6:The IRS has what is called a “Taxpayer Advocate” office, whose stated purpose isto help citizens having problems with the IRS. Below is a transcript of a callsomeone placed to that office. Unfortunately, only the last part of theconversation was recorded. Here is some of what was caught on tape:TA (IRS): “Well, you’re not going to get answers, probably.”Citizen: “Why not?”TA (IRS): “Because you’re asking to have a legitimate—you are really needing togo to a lawyer and you won’t get a suit heard because the Justice Departmentwill throw it out as frivolous. And they would have a right to assess you apenalty of up to $25,000.”Note the interesting contradiction: he wants to send the guy somewhere else withhis questions (i.e., to a lawyer), but then turns around and admits that the DOJand the courts would fine him big bucks just for bringing up the issue. Inshort, he’s making it abundantly clear that there is nowhere inside the systemwhere one can go to get these questions answered.Citizen: “Why is it frivolous to ask a question regarding the proper applicationof the federal income tax, and not get an answer? What is frivolous about that?”TA (IRS): “Court cases have proved that your income is taxable and that’s theend of the story.”After the individual pointed out that Tax Court rulings are not binding, theTaxpayer Advocate person asked if the citizen had any “background in law,” andthe citizen answered that he did not.TA (IRS): “Okay, well maybe you might want to talk to someone you might know whodoes. And maybe they’ll be able to help you.”Citizen: “I’ve been in contact with lots and lots of CPAs, forensic accountants,tax attorneys, and former IRS agents, who all back this particular argument.So—”TA (IRS): “Well, power to you, sir. I guess I’m gonna disconnect the callbecause if that’s all you want to discuss, Mr. [redacted], I’m not at liberty todo that.”Citizen: “Well, okay. I was just hoping to get some answers to these questions.”TA (IRS): “Well, I apologize, but you won’t get them from this office. Have anice day.”Mind you, that’s from the office that’s supposed to be an advocate for citizensin their dealings with the IRS. And they’re “not at liberty” to answer questionsabout the law?! If that doesn’t make you suspicious, you deserve to be defraudedand extorted. This would be a good time to quote a few more things from theInternal Revenue Manual (try not to laugh):“Since taxpayers must compute their taxes under a body of laws and regulations,some of the provisions of which are complex, the Service has the responsibilityof providing taxpayers with all possible information to assist them in theperformance of their obligations.” [IRM § 1.2.1.2.38]“The public impact of clarity, consistency, and impartiality in dealing with taxproblems must be given high priority: In dealing with the taxpaying public,Service officials and employees will explain the position of the Serviceclearly.” [IRM § 1.2.1.6.2]“The Service will issue quality responses to all taxpayer correspondence. ... Aquality response is timely, accurate, professional in tone, responsive totaxpayer needs (i.e., resolves all issues without further contact).” [IRM §1.2.1.6.4]That doesn’t exactly match how they respond to folks who mention 861, does it? Iguess for us, their definition of a “quality response” goes like this: “Stopasking questions about the law! You’re evil and stupid! We’re gonna hurt you!And we’re not gonna talk to you anymore!”Oddly, even when a federal judge orders the government to answer the questions,they still don’t. In late 2003, a guy I know named Ken Evans filed a civil suitagainst the IRS, trying to get money back. His suit explained in detail why hebelieved his income to be non-taxable, and included this:“The federal income tax is imposed under Section 1 on ‘taxable income.’ Othersections of the law generally define the terms ‘gross income’ and ‘taxableincome.’ But, these definitions can easily be misread as if they apply to allmoney earned by everyone in the world. Which we all know isn’t true. Section 861and its related regulations, along with what the law calls other ‘operativesections,’ spell out exactly when income is taxable. The federal regulationsstate repeatedly that these are the sections of law to use to determine whenincome earned within the United States is taxed.”Sound familiar? The government chose not to file a response at all to Mr. Evans’memorandum, which is a little weird. What made it weirder was that in apre-trial conference, the government lawyers said they were going to file aresponse, but then never did. But it gets worse. Mr. Evans also filed“interrogatories” in the case, whereby one party formally asks the other aquestion, in order to narrow down the points of disagreement. The first questionhe asked was: “Are 26 USC § 861 and the related regulations beginning at 26 CFR§ 1.861-8, applicable in determining Plaintiff’s taxable income from sourceswithin the United States in the instant case? ” And guess what. The judgeordered the government to answer! Hooray! Now they’ll answer! They have to, orit’s “contempt of court”!Well, no. They don’t. The government never filed a response and never answeredthe questions. The judge dismissed the case, called the issue “frivolous,” andfined Mr. Evans $1,000 for mentioning 861 (and grossly mischaracterized hisposition, to boot). Incidentally, nowhere in the court’s ruling did it sayanything about the correct application of Section 861, so neither the judge northe government ever explained how Mr. Evans should determine his taxabledomestic income, or just where his position went wrong. But they don’t need toaddress such issues, you see, because they have the ability to hurt peopleinstead. What a swell justice system.PAY NO ATTENTION!The closest thing we ever got to any kind of answer from government folk, mostlyfrom low-level bureaucrats and anonymous form letters, consisted of variousrenditions of: “Pay no attention to 861! That section is about someone else, notyou!” Oddly, I’ve seen a half-dozen different, conflicting opinions from variousbureaucrats about who should use those sections. Some said 861 was only aboutforeign-source income (a silly argument, considering the fact that the entiresection is about income from within the U.S.); some said it was only for peoplewith foreign and domestic income; some said it was only for foreigners; somesaid it was only for people who had to determine a foreign tax credit; some saidit was only for those who have to apportion income and/or deductions betweenforeign and domestic income, and so on. Meanwhile, as you can see above, someadmit that we should all be looking there. Basically, what their convolutedbeliefs boil down to is this: “If those sections show your income to be taxable,use them; if they don’t show your income to be taxable, don’t use thosesections!”Once again, when someone who should be knowledgeable about the law asserts thatsome section is only about certain people, there’s a tendency among usnon-experts to take his word for it. If Section 861 and its regulations reallyare only for certain people, and not for most of us, how would we know? Well,the law would tell us. Sections of law are constantly saying things like “in thecase of this person or that person...” or “for purposes of this part of thelaw...” When the law includes a rule with limited application—which applies onlyto certain people or in certain situations—the law says it has limitedapplication, loud and clear, right up front. Let’s again take a peek at what thelaw says about 861, and see if it gives any hint that you and I are not supposedto be looking there—that those rules are only for someone else. First, let’slook at the table of contents, to see where in the law Section 861 itself isfound:Subtitle A - Income TaxesChapter 1 - Normal Taxes and SurtaxesSubchapter N - Tax Based on Income From Sources within or without the U.S.Part I - Determination of Sources of IncomeSection 861 - Income from sources within the United States(Note: If you look up Part I of Subchapter N in most current printings of thetax code, you will find it under a different title. Though that gives yetanother fine example of an attempted cover-up, it is technical and complexenough that for now I’ll just refer those who wonder about it to my “TaxableIncome” report, Appendix A of this book, which addresses the point in detail.Suffice it to say, what you see above is the correct title of Part I ofSubchapter N, despite what some printings of the code now erroneously show.)See any reason why you shouldn’t be looking there? Now let’s see how the IRS’s“Cumulative Bulletin” sums up the purpose of that part of the law:“Rules are prescribed for determination of gross income and taxable incomederived from sources within and without the United States, and for theallocation of income derived partly from sources within the United States andpartly without the United States or within United States possessions. §§ 1.861-1through 1.864. (Secs 861-864; ’54 Code.)” [Treasury Decision 6258]Where does that even hint that those rules are only for certain people, but notfor you and me? How about the related regulations? Where are they located? Hereis the table of contents for the regs:Part 1 - Income TaxesTax Based on Income From Sources Within or Without the United StatesDetermination of Sources of IncomeSection 1.861-1 Income From Sources Within the United StatesSee any reason for us not to look there? The first thing those regulations sayis that these sections of the law (861 and following, and related regs)“determine the sources of income for purposes of the income tax.” It doesn’t sayfor purposes of some people; it doesn’t say for use in unusual circumstances; itsays “for purposes of the income tax.” So why, exactly, are most of us supposedto ignore those sections?Section 861(b) of the tax code is about “Taxable income from sources withinUnited States,” and here is how the related regulations begin:“Sections 861(b) and 863(a) state in general terms how to determine taxableincome of a taxpayer from sources within the United States after gross incomefrom sources within the United States has been determined.”[26 CFR § 1.861-8]Read that carefully, and read it twice. How much more plainly could it bestated? Where is the part that says that you and I should ignore these sections?In contrast, when a section of law really is only supposed to be used by certainpeople, or in certain situations, the law makes that abundantly clear right upfront. Consider, for example, the section which comes right before 861. Lookwhere it is located, and look how obvious the limited application is:Subtitle A - “Income taxes”Chapter 1 - “Normal taxes and surtaxes”Subchapter M - “Regulated investment companies and real estate investmenttrusts”Part III - “Provisions which apply to both regulated investment companies andreal estate investment trusts”Section 860 - “Deduction for deficiency dividends”Subsection (a): “General rule - If a determination with respect to any qualifiedinvestment entity results in ...”Subsection (b): “Qualified investment entity defined - For purposes of thissection, the term ‘qualified investment entity’ means - (1) a regulatedinvestment company, and (2) a real estate investment trust.”Both the titles and the text of that part of the law (not to mention all of therelated cross-references, indexes, and regulations) make it glaringly obviousthat the rules are only about certain companies and trusts. In sharp contrast,none of the dozens of statutes, regulations, tables of contents, indexes, orcross-references which refer to 861 give any hint that only certain peopleshould use those sections to determine their taxable domestic income. Not asingle one.So why on earth do some in government insist that we shouldn’t look there, whennothing in the law itself even remotely suggests such a thing?Simple: because if we do look there, we might discover that we don’t owe thetax! (The fact that they can’t even agree among themselves about who should belooking there also ought to tell you something.)NOTHING SUSPICIOUS HEREDoes my conclusion that most Americans don’t owe federal income taxes at firstsound wacky? Absolutely. “Everyone knows” that we all owe income taxes. Butdon’t you find it just an itsy-bitsy, teensie-weensie bit strange that allAmericans are required to determine what taxes they owe (if any)—which requiresthem to first determine their “taxable income”—but no one in government seemswilling or able to answer a few simple questions about how to do that? What yousee above is just a small sampling of the myriad of incoherent, contradictory,belligerent, irrational, delusional, insulting and/or threatening diatribes theIRS has thrown at the thousands of Americans who have politely asked about 861.About the only thing I have never seen them respond with is actual answers.They call my position “frivolous,” “nonsensical,” and other nasty things, butthe government folk still can’t agree with each other on how the law applies.Should I be using 861 and its regs? Most of them can’t (or won’t) answer at all,and among those who do answer, some say “yes” and some say “no.” Do 861 and itsregs show my income to be taxable? Most of them can’t (or won’t) answer at all,and among those who do answer, some say “yes” and some say “no.” And this hasbeen going on for eight years.Remember IRS “specialist” Michael Enz saying that 861 is only for certain peoplein certain unusual circumstances, and not for me to use? Well, as luck wouldhave it, someone else sent me a letter they received from the same Mr. Enz,stating that the person should use 1.861-8 to determine his “taxable income fromsources within the United States.” And remember how the IRS bureaucrats at mymeetings didn’t want me looking at 861? Well, Diana Loden, the Vogon (see below)who eventually took over the case, in internal memos said my income was taxablebecause of 861(a)(3), implying that I should be looking there. Well, which isit? Can’t these people at least get their alibis to match?(Pardon the obscure reference, but while reading Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’sGuide to the Galaxy here in prison, the book’s description of the creaturescalled “Vogons” was all too familiar: “They are one of the most unpleasant racesin the galaxy. Not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious, andcallous. ... They don’t think, they don’t imagine, most of them can’t evenspell, they just run things.” Wow, a job description for IRS employees.)And how about the rest of the questions? What about where the regs say that the“items” in Section 61 are not always taxable? What about that strange list ofnon-exempt income, which only includes certain international trade? What aboutwhere the regs show that the Constitution itself makes some income non-taxable?I have never seen any IRS form letter or notice, or any court ruling at anylevel, which even mentions those issues, much less actually addresses them.This bears repeating: in all of my research and dealings with the government,over a span of eight years, I have never once seen any court ruling even mentionthe regs saying that some income is exempt because of the Constitution, or theregulations which say that the common “items” of income are sometimes exempt, orthe lists (past or present) in the regulations of non-exempt income (whichinclude only international activities). Never. I guess if they don’t evermention them, maybe most people will never know they exist. So far it seems tobe working pretty well.If I may be so bold, I would suggest that there’s something downright looneyabout the government prosecuting and imprisoning me for ostensibly determiningmy taxable income incorrectly (thereby coming up with a tax liability of zero),while being unable or unwilling to say for sure how I should have done it. Butapparently that’s how our lovely system really works. Forget looking at the law.It doesn’t mean what it says, and it means what it doesn’t say, and no one isentirely sure what all it means, and please don’t ask the folks in governmentwhat it means because they don’t want to talk about it, but you damn well betterobey it! Never mind the law, the statutes and regulations, and all that. Thereality is a lot simpler: you have to pay it because they will hurt you if youdon’t. That’s all you need to know.THE BLOCKHEADSThough H&R Block is not part of the government (obviously), presumably the folkwho work there are familiar with the tax laws, since they make billions ofdollars telling people what “their taxes” are. So, we theorized, maybe theycould answer the questions which the IRS seems incapable of addressing.Starting in February of 2003, a friend of mine, Peter McCandless, a collegeprofessor who had a radio show in Kansas City, organized a letter campaigntargeting H&R Block. The campaign was pretty simple. Numerous people across thecountry looked up and sent a letter to their local H&R Block office, asking justone question: Do the folks at H&R Block use Section 861 and related regulations(in addition to any other pertinent sections) to determine the taxable domesticincome of their clients? Simple enough. Around six hundred different H&R Blockoffices across the country were sent that question, with copies also being sentto H&R Block headquarters in Kansas City. All the letters offered to pay for ananswer to the question if necessary.No one reported receiving an answer. (One office said it was forwarding thequestion to their headquarters—which we had already done anyway.) Beingpersistent, Professor McCandless placed a follow-up call to H&R Blockheadquarters and spoke to one of their attorneys. Had they received the letters?Yes, they had. Did they intend to answer the question? Nope. Why not? Because,according to their attorney, it is not their “policy” to answer that question.Um, what? A company that makes many millions of dollars determining people’staxable income (which you have to do to determine a tax liability) has a“policy” of refusing to answer a simple question about how they do it? How weirdis that? In any given case, they either use those sections or they don’t. Whathonest reason could they possibly have for being reluctant to say when (if ever)they use those sections?Along with the letter campaign, at least two people decided to go to H&R Blockoffices to ask the question in person. They reported their experiences to me asfollows.1) One person spoke to the office manager at one H&R Block office, whose awesomeresponse to the question was “We use the IRS regulations,” adding that therewere a lot of other sections other than those mentioned. Well, no kidding. (Theactual question asked was whether, in addition to any other pertinent sections,the Blockheads used 861 and its regs to determine the taxable domestic income oftheir clients, so the manager’s answer was completely worthless.) The managerthen went into veiled-threat mode, saying that “people a lot smarter and richerthan us,” like Leona Helmsley, have learned the hard way that we all have to paytaxes. So apparently we don’t owe it because the law says we owe it; we owe itbecause we’ll get put in a cage if we don’t pay. Due process, Mafia-style. Theoffice manager then suggested that the guy asking the question get a lawyer.(What the heck is H&R Block good for if it refers tax questions to someoneelse?) One other thing: after the office manager said “We go by the tax code,”the questioner asked, “Don’t you use the regulations? ” Removing any residualfaçade of competence or expertise, the H&R Block office manager responded,“Isn’t that the tax code? ” (For those of you who don’t claim to be tax experts,the “tax code” consists of the statutes of Title 26 of the United States Code;the regulations are a separate publication, written by the Treasury department.)2) A different person spoke to a different H&R Block office manager, asking thesame question. The office manager tried, to no avail, to find anything in theircomputer program mentioning 1.861. After evading the question a while longer,the office manager then made a rather interesting (and disturbing) admission. Hesaid they do not use individual sections of the law to do their job; they useIRS Publication 17. So they use a legally worthless publication, instead of thelegally binding regulations. That’s good to know. (And the public defers tothese people as the “experts” on tax law?) One more thing: H&R Block takes theIRS’s Publication 17, puts its own cover on it, and calls it “H&R BlockPublication 17.” Remember what I said about H&R Block not being part of thegovernment? I take it back. These people are nothing more than pseudo-privateparrots for the federal extortion machine.Interestingly, in response to an e-mail, another H&R Block employee, regardingthe “861 Evidence” presentation (discussed below), said he found it “veryinteresting,” but concerning the part about H&R Block refusing to answer onesimple question, he said that “H&R Block has had a longstanding policy of notpublicly responding to conspiracy theory type questions regarding the tax code,”because “any response is a no-win situation for the company.” Why wouldanswering one question about how H&R Block applies the law be a “no-win”situation? And how can asking which sections of law they use be a “conspiracytheory type” question?On another occasion, when H&R Block had an online forum for asking taxquestions, Professor McCandless took the opportunity to ask this: “Are 26 USCsection 861(b) and the related regulations beginning at 26 CFR section 1.861-8the sections to use to determine one’s taxable income from sources within theUnited States? ” And this was the response from “HRBlockTaxPros”:“That sounds like a tax protestor scheme that has become popular. Taxable incomeis determined throughout the tax Code. There is no one Code section that definesit. We caution you against proceeding related to this matter. Please see a taxprofessional for more information on filing requirement.”A question sounds like a “tax protestor scheme”? It’s a yes-or-no question. Sowhich is the correct answer, and which is the “tax protestor scheme” answer? Hedidn’t say. Instead, this tax professional refused to answer a question andthen, bizarrely, told the person asking the question that he should go ask a taxprofessional. Uh, he just did, and the “tax professional” refused to answer. Healso “cautioned” Professor McCandless against “proceeding related to thismatter.” Related to what matter? Asking questions? Examining the law?As for the claim that no one code section defines taxable income, the federalincome tax regulations (e.g., 26 CFR § 1.863-1(c)) seem to have no troublesaying, unequivocally and unconditionally, that 26 CFR § 1.861-8 and followingare the sections to use for determining one’s “taxable income from sourceswithin the United States.” Furthermore, since no one, including any taxprofessional, has ever read the entire tax code—dang near none of them have evenread 26 CFR § 1.861-8—it’s pretty silly to claim that one must use the entirecode, but no section in particular. The real goal of that cop-out is to convinceus mere peasants that we shouldn’t look at the law at all, because we couldnever begin to understand it all. As if the “experts” do.It should be obvious by now that many tax professionals and IRS employees haveheard of 861 (though they don’t understand the issue), and have beenspecifically coached about what to say if it ever comes up. If you say the magicnumber, no matter how politely or reasonably, you will be insulted, threatened,and then ignored. Maybe if you’re really lucky, you’ll get flung into prison.AD HOMINEM RESPONSEFor years now it has been the case that if you search the internet for “861evidence” or similar terms (or my name), you will find two very different kindsof web sites: those which discuss the actual wording of the statutes andregulations, and those which bash and insult the people who discuss the law.Unfortunately, in sound-bite America, personal attacks may persuade more peoplethan evidence and logic do.It seems that if you say “frivolous,” “nonsensical” and “ridiculous” over andover again, and throw in an occasional “the courts have never agreed with this”for good measure, it sways a lot of people. One web site which uses this method,and which is particularly substance-free and slanderous, is called “Quatloos,”owned by a Mr. Jay Adkisson, who specializes in asset protection (and who would,therefore, probably be out of business if the “income tax” deception were tofall). This is how his web site describes me:“When a scam gets rolling, all sorts of human cockroaches come out of thewoodwork to try to cash in. This is the perfect description of Larken Rose, ascammer come lately to the world of tax protesting who runs the tax scam websitehttp://www.taxableincome.net.”Wow, “scam” three times in two sentences. Sounds objective. (I’m not sure howwww.taxableincome.net can be a “scam,” or how it lets me “cash in,” wheneverything on it has always been free.) The article continues:“Not being smart enough to come up with any unique theory of his own, Larken hassimply latched on to the ‘861’ or ‘Income Can’t Be Defined’ arguments that endup with the conclusion that only foreigners are required to pay income tax.”Aside from starting with a slanderous personal attack, they also manage to maketwo mistakes in one sentence when describing my position: I have never arguedthat “income can’t be defined,” nor do I conclude that only foreigners owefederal income taxes. Obviously, accuracy isn’t a major concern for the peoplewho run that site. And why should it be? They know that if they just bash anyonewho even pays attention to the 861 evidence as a stupid, tax-protesting,malcontent criminal, most people will quietly go away and not look into theissue any further.Their site smears anyone who does not accept on faith the conventional wisdomabout the income tax, and gloats over the fact that various people who havementioned 861, and people with other unconventional beliefs, have been fined,silenced via court injunction, and/or imprisoned. In other words, “They’rewrong, because they got hurt” (i.e., might makes right). It’s hard to think ofan insult low enough to describe someone who delights so much in the sufferingof others simply because they hold a different opinion.THE UNMENTIONABLE SECTIONThe list of supposed tax “experts,” government and private, who have run awayfrom basic questions about the tax laws goes on and on, but I’ll mention just afew more here. In early 2005, one person sent the six questions to someone whohas been a lawyer for twenty years, has a master’s degree in tax law, and hasbeen teaching federal income tax law for more than a decade. Here is how heresponded to the six questions, asked by one of his students:“Although the questions you pose are impressive, I do not believe that they areappropriate for an introductory tax class at a community college. To be honest,they remind me of the anti-government tax protestors who are happy to benefitfrom our nation’s prosperity but balk at paying for the privilege of livinghere. I am sure that that is not your motivation or frame of reference, but ourtypical students DO NOT want a philosophical debate over the authority of theIRS and the constitutionality of our tax system—they want to know how to fillout their tax 1040, what itemized deductions are commonly available, what thepenalties are for late filing, etc. I think your questions are moreappropriately directed to the Courts, Congress, the IRS, or a graduate course ontax policy. I’m sorry that I can’t be of help to you!”Notice how all the “experts” think that we should be asking some other expert.The IRS tells people to ask a CPA, the CPA tells people to ask theircongressman, the congressman tells people to ask a lawyer, the lawyer tellspeople to ask a law professor, and the law professor tells people to ask theIRS. And this is all about how a hundred million people are supposed todetermine their tax liabilities. Shouldn’t every tax professional know theanswer to that?Note also that the law professor impugns the motives of the one asking thequestions, with terms like “anti-government tax protestors,” while refusing toanswer the questions. He also mischaracterizes the questions as a challenge tothe constitutionality of the tax, when they have nothing to do with that. Thenhe goes into a philosophical rant, which of course doesn’t have the slightestrelevance to the question of how to determine one’s “taxable income.”(Personally, I believe that anyone who thinks that taxation is the reason fornational prosperity is an imbecile.) But perhaps what is most telling is hiscomment that his students don’t want to think about such things; they just wantto know how to fill out their tax returns. Sad, but probably true.Not all tax professionals were as polite as the law professor quoted above. InFebruary of 2005, one sweet attorney/CPA sent me an e-mail stating the following(without specifically saying what his tantrum was in response to):“You are either an idiot or are intentionally misinforming the public. TheInternal Revenue Code, beginning with Section 861 deals with taxing foreigncitizens and entities. It is not intended to be used as a definition for taxingUS citizens. There is no general disagreement among tax professionals. The onlydisagreement is in your published material. If you believe there is a validdisagreement, email me one article written by a CPA or tax attorney which agreeswith your views. I also note you fail to disclose your formal education. Is thatintentional?”In response, I pointed out that the regulations under Section 861 specificallymention matters involving U.S. citizens in several places (e.g., 26 CFR §§1.861-8(f)(1)(i), 1.861-8(f)(1)(vi)(E), 1.861-8T(d)(2)(iii)(D)), obviouslyproving that the section is not only for “foreign citizens and entities” (aclaim he supported with absolutely nothing). But after his utterly falseassertion, notice that his entire rant had to do with what the tax professionalsthink, and what credentials and education people have, rather than what the lawsays. So I quoted a bunch of credentialed, highly educated tax professionals whohad come to agree with me. I got no further response. (By the way, my web sitedid state that I am neither a CPA nor a lawyer, and that I have had no formaltraining in tax law, so he was wrong about that, too.)But why is it that discussion of this particular section of the law triggersemotional responses in so many supposed “experts”? It’s not a philosophicalthesis; it’s a section of the tax code, for Pete’s sake! Why does no one on theother side seem capable of having a plain old academic discussion about whatthat part of the law says? Is it so impossible to talk about a section of lawwithout flinging insults and threats around? If tens of thousands of people holda belief you disagree with, even if they’re all completely mistaken, wouldn’t itbe a little more effective to explain why they’re wrong, rather than justcalling them idiots and threatening to fine or prosecute them? Is there someunwritten rule that people with unorthodox beliefs have to be treated like dirt?Along those same lines, another high-ranking tax official—in fact, the top IRSattorney in the country—had either a sudden, inexplicable fit of repentance andrehabilitation, or a fit of profound hypocrisy. Shortly before he resigned inmid-2003, B. John Williams (IRS Chief Counsel) said this:“The courts have repeatedly and consistently rejected these arguments and areimposing substantial penalties on taxpayers and promoters for taking frivolouspositions. These schemes carry a heavy price, for both the promoters and theparticipants.”Notice the insult (”frivolous”) and the threat (”heavy price”). Shortly after heresigned, however, he said the following, while talking about how the IRS shoulddeal with improper tax shelters:“One of the foundation stones of the credibility of the [IRS] with the Americanpublic is that the Service proceed analytically rather than emotively. ‘Abusive’reflects the indignation that the Service feels about a transaction, but theServicès feelings about a transaction do not state a legal basis for disallowingthe tax benefits from a transaction. ‘Abusive’ is not an analytical term, it isan emotive term, and the mission of the Service is to apply the law fairly andimpartially, not to apply the law in a manner that is biased toward a result thegovernment wants.”How about the terms “frivolous” and “schemes”? How analytical are those? But itgets better. Mr. Williams went on to say that “the Service does not need anattitude that ‘we’re looking for a fight,’ it needs an attitude that ‘we’reinterested in determining and collecting the right amount of tax’ and ‘we acceptyour disagreement with us as legitimate’.” Well, which is it, Mr. B. HypocriteWilliams? Are we evil poopy-head tax protestors who should be insulted,threatened and punished, or should we be treated as people with an honestdifference of opinion? And instead of being so holier-than-thou now, why didn’tyou answer the damn questions when you were in office and could have actuallydone what your empty pontificating now suggests that government folk should do?(Of note, the feds are so accustomed to resorting to vilification andintimidation that even when it comes to the multitude of flawed “tax protestor”theories to which there are rational responses which could be given, they stillusually don’t bother. Instead of politely responding to those claims that can beeasily and substantively refuted, the government almost always resorts tothuggery. The authoritarian attitude shines through: if you disagree with themfor any reason, you don’t deserve answers, you don’t deserve due process, youdon’t deserve respect, you have no rights, and you should be destroyed.)NOW WHAT?In light of what I described above—which is a relatively small sampling of myattempts, in vain, to get honest answers to honest questions—what was I supposedto think? Sure, I was a little “nobody,” with no credentials and no formaltraining in the law. But when I went to the “experts,” inside government andout, and put the law right in front of them, they had no coherent response, theyhad no rational explanation for the evidence I had, and in fact were usuallyvery open about the fact that they were not familiar with what I was showingthem. If my seemingly ridiculous conclusion was wrong, why was no one able tosuccinctly explain or demonstrate why it was wrong?My goal was to get to the bottom of it all; to find the truth. I didn’tparticularly want to incur the wrath of a superpower. Trying to pick fights andmake enemies—really powerful enemies, at that—is not one of my favoritepastimes. It’s not as if I had been sitting around thinking, “Gee, how can I getmyself into as much trouble as possible?” I wanted the truth, not trouble.Unfortunately, I got both. As Voltaire is quoted as having said, it’s dangerousto be right when the government is wrong. But once I had the truth staring me inthe face, proven not only by the law books themselves but also by the stunninginability of those in government to explain it away, what was I supposed to doabout it? Again, should I have just pretended I hadn’t seen it? Feign ignoranceand hope it would all go away?“Occasionally men stumble across the truth, but most pick themselves up andhurry off as if nothing ever happened.” [Winston Churchill]Unfortunately, probably due in part to my upbringing (blaming one’s parents is apopular fad these days), I was of the opinion that if I knew that a hundredmillion people were being robbed, I should probably say something about it. So Idid. Loudly."},{"pageContent":"PART III:OPINIONS VS. CENSORSHIPSPREADING THE WORDIn case there is any doubt, and in case the spin doctors have caused someconfusion in your mind about what I believe, let me be perfectly clear aboutwhat I’m alleging here (so clear that even an IRS employee can understand it):• Since 1913, there has been a perfectly valid, constitutional federal incometax applicable to income from certain international trade (commerce crossingcountry borders). Foreigners with U.S. income and Americans with foreign incomehave always been subject to that tax.• Income from purely domestic commerce, such as that which a U.S. citizen earnswhile living and working in the fifty states, is not subject to the tax. The lawitself shows that, and has done so for over 80 years.• The law was intentionally written to have such a limited application, to keepit in line with the constitutional restrictions upon the power of the federalgovernment.• At the same time, government lawmakers and regulation-writers have, over theyears, changed the wording and arrangement of the law (but not its substance orcorrect application) in an effort to conceal the very limited nature of the tax.• As a result, hundreds of millions of Americans have been deceived intobelieving that the tax applies to their income, when, according to the lawitself, it does not. As a result, the American people continue to be defraudedby their own government to the tune of well over a trillion dollars($1,000,000,000,000) every year.Clear enough?Having reached these disturbing conclusions, I felt the urge to tell peopleabout what I had learned. So sometime in 1998, I released the first version of awritten report entitled “Taxable Income” (thrilling title, huh?), detailing anddocumenting my findings and conclusions. That report was soon posted on at leasttwo web sites, for all the world to see. One person who read that report was TomClayton, M.D. (whom I mentioned before). After exchanging a bunch of e-mails,and after many phone calls, Dr. Clayton offered to finance a new web site, to bejust about the 861 evidence. We chose the domain name www.taxableincome.net. Thesite featured my “Taxable Income” report, which we kept updating as we continuedto find new relevant information. We also started posting many other articles onthe site, all related in one way or another to the 861 evidence, includingtranscripts of several IRS meetings.(Twice in the following years my “Taxable Income” report was published in “TaxNotes Today,” an online publication read by a lot of tax professionals.In the versions I saw, there were no comments, pro or con; just the report,unedited and in its entirety. I didn’t even know they were doing it until asubscriber of that publication showed it to me. Not that I minded.) Everythingon our web site was available for free to anyone who wanted it (and had internetaccess). There was nothing for sale, nothing to sign up for, no members area,etc. It was a free offering to the victims of the biggest financial fraud inhistory, because we thought they had a right to know. And it wasn’t long beforewe were seeing thousands of downloads of the report.But Dr. Clayton and I were always looking for bigger and better ways to get thetruth out there. For some reason, neither of us was very happy about the factthat a hundred million of our neighbors were being robbed every year by theirown government (which pretends to protect people from that sort of thing). Giventhe attitudes of our fine “public servants”—something along the lines of “shutup or we’ll hurt you”—we saw educating the public, and publicly exposing thefraud for all to see, as the only hope of ending it. Dr. Clayton, beingextremely passionate about letting the people know what was being done to them,selflessly threw lots and lots of his time, energy, and money into thisendeavor.And via the report and the web sites, we were starting to have some success. Thebest evidence of that success was when the government began its efforts toforcibly shut us up.THE SILENCE TREATMENTIn 2001, I received a letter from Chris Roginsky at the IRS, informing me thathe wanted to have a meeting with me about my “abusive tax shelter.” Huh? Mywhat?!A little legal explanation is in order here. When someone puts together someplan or arrangement, and then falsely tells people that by participating in theplan they can become entitled to some tax benefit (exemption, deduction, etc.),that is an “abusive tax shelter.” A classic example would be someone claiming tobe able to make clients tax-exempt by forming sham “trusts” for them.What does that have to do with me publicly expressing my conclusions about thetax laws? Not a darn thing. So why would the IRS fabricate such a baselessaccusation? Because it had worked in other cases, as a means of forcedcensorship. At least two other web sites which dealt with the 861 evidence(www.nite.org and www.taxgate.com) were successfully shut down by the governmentthrough a gross misapplication of the “abusive tax shelter” laws. In January of2003, the court ordered Thurston Bell—the author of the “Gross Income” articlethat first caught my attention—not only to take down his “nite.org” site butalso to post something saying he was wrong about his legal conclusions. The NewYork Times, defender of the First Amendment, gloated over that obscene exampleof censorship and state-sponsored propaganda.Unlike our site, those sites did assist people with their individual disputeswith the IRS (helping with letter-writing, seeking due process, and variousdiabolical things like that). However, I never saw anything on those sites whichbegan to approach the meaning of “abusive tax shelter.” Nobody was selling anyplan which claimed to create a tax benefit for anyone, which is the onlybehavior that the “abusive tax shelter” laws are about. The sites merelyexplained how existing law applied to people’s already-existing situations.The bottom line is that the IRS, the DOJ, and the courts all eagerly andintentionally misapplied the law, in order to circumvent that pesky FirstAmendment and forcibly silence your fellow Americans, to stop them from voicingunapproved opinions. And since it had worked so well on others, they decided totry it on me, too.I agreed to meet with the IRS about my non-existent “tax shelter,” and told themI intended to bring witnesses and audio-record the meeting (which I did). Ialso, however, told them that I would not be bringing the laundry list ofdocuments their letter commanded me to bring, including my high school diploma,a list of all the computers which contained the materials from my web site(sound a tad fascist to you?), and a list of my “clients.” I suppose they meantall the non-existent clients who had purchased my non-existent tax shelter.After they started the meeting and gave their little introduction, I asked themost obvious question: What “tax shelter” were they trying to investigate? Ihanded them a copy of the law defining “abusive tax shelter” (26 USC § 6700),and said this: “It makes it absolutely clear that an abusive tax shelter issomeone selling or giving away a plan, and telling people that by participatingin the plan they become entitled to a tax exemption or tax benefit of some kind.What am I doing that even remotely resembles that? ”I expected some sort of creative spin in response. Instead, Mr. Roginskyresponded with “That’s what we’re here to determine today.” What? Apparentlythey weren’t sure what it was they were investigating. They were there todetermine if I was doing what they had baselessly accused me of. (Can you say“fishing expedition”?) So I asked why they even thought I might have been doingsuch a thing. Again, they told me that that’s what they were there to find out.Somewhat stunned, I asked if they just randomly pick names out of the phone bookto “investigate,” to which Mr. Roginsky gave the moronic response of “notnecessarily.”I knew full well the truth: they didn’t like me expressing my opinions, and werehoping to find some half-baked excuse to shut me up. (First Amendment, schmirstamendment.) In fact, they eventually admitted their true motivation. I keptasking what they were trying to “investigate,” until Mr. Roginsky described mysin: I had a web site, and on it expressed my conclusion that most Americansdon’t receive taxable income and therefore don’t owe federal income taxes.Expressing that opinion—while selling nothing and giving no advice (paid orotherwise)—was the cause of their pestering me, and possibly attempting to get acourt injunction against me, as their letter had mentioned.An “injunction” is a court order, commanding someone to do something or to stopdoing something. So I asked the next logical question: What, exactly, did theywant to stop me from doing (via court order)? They wouldn’t say, so I made iteven simpler by asking them directly if they were trying to shut down my website. They wouldn’t say. (Of course that’s what they were trying to do.) I evenasked them to point out what on my web site they disapproved of. They couldn’tsay, other than not liking my conclusions. Got that? They admitted that I wassummoned to their office and interrogated, not for breaking any law, but forvoicing an opinion they didn’t like. In the United States of America.After a while the meeting wandered into an argument about the 861 issue itself,with rather bizarre results. At one point, during a discussion about Congress’constitutional taxing power, Mr. Roginsky made the odd claim that theConstitution authorizes the United States Congress to tax everyone in China ifthey want to—but that it would be really hard to collect, so they didn’t. (I’mnot making this up.) An attorney from IRS Office of Chief Counsel, Jim Beyers,was also at the meeting, but every time I tried to engage him in thediscussion—such as regarding Mr. Roginsky’s “unique” (idiotic) constitutionalanalysis—he would slither out of it and change the subject. But hey, he is agovernment lawyer, so that’s to be expected.The highlight of the meeting was Mr. Roginsky’s attempts to refute my legalposition. (Prepare yourself, because this gets a little weird.) He argued thatmy income, which we agreed came from inside the United States, was taxableincome, even though it may not have been “taxable income from sources within theUnited States.” Put another way (as if rewording such insanity could improveit), he was saying that I could have “taxable income” from sources within theUnited States even if I had no “taxable income from sources within the UnitedStates.” If that makes sense to you, you belong either in a mental institutionor an IRS office—which are pretty much indistinguishable from each other anyway.As I had done a zillion times before, at the meeting I handed them a writtenexplanation of my position, complete with piles of supporting citations. Asusual, they wanted me to look at the general definition of “gross income,” andto ignore everything else. I agreed that that section does indeed give a generaldefinition of “gross income.”Me: “And it [Section 61] lists the common items of income: compensation,interest—it doesn’t say who’s getting them or in what commerce, and, to quotethe regulations, section 861 and following, and the regulations thereunder,determine the sources of income for purposes of the income tax. ”To that, Mr. Roginsky responded with: “Okay. Okay, you already stated that, andwe’ll have to just let that go for now, because that is what the regulationsays.” Wow, nice comeback. They wanted so much for me to blindly assume thateverything is taxable, instead of paying attention to what those darnregulations actually say.After a heavy dose of Mr. Roginsky’s unabashed lunacy, I ended the meeting, toldthem they could feel free to try to get an injunction, and walked out. Theynever filed for an injunction, and I never heard about it again until I was inprison, five years later, when they tried to fine me exactly one penny for mynon-existent “abusive tax shelter.” No, I’m not kidding: the letter said theamount of the fine was one cent, because the amount of the fine is based uponhow much income the person makes from his “abusive tax shelter,” and I hadn’tmade anything from the web site. (I’m not sure how they rounded it up to apenny.) Incidentally, I didn’t pay the one-penny fine. I appealed it, and theyignored my appeal. They haven’t yet sent thugs to seize the penny.As it turns out, though they gave up on getting an injunction, they foundanother, equally effective way to illegally silence our perfectly legal websites, albeit temporarily. But that part of the story comes later.MAKING THE VIDEOI must admit, I was as proud of my “Taxable Income” report as the government wasscared of it. Trouble is, most people don’t really want to read a 60-page legalanalysis. (Go figure.) It was clear to me and Dr. Clayton that we needed a moremainstream-compatible way to spread the word.Sometime in 2000, the idea of making a video occurred to me—not just a video ofsome guy giving a speech, but a video that would use the full potential ofcomputer animation to make complex ideas easier to grasp. I had played aroundbefore with Maxon’s Cinema 4D, and had some idea of its potential. (Similartypes of software were used to make movies like Toy Story and Antz.) But asnifty as such programs are, I also knew that the software and hardware for sucha project wouldn’t be cheap. Far from it. But once again, Dr. Clayton cameriding to the rescue, and offered to donate the tens of thousands of dollarsnecessary to make the project happen. (Yes, I said “donate”—he wasn’t evenasking to be paid back.)Without getting too technical, let me just say that rendering/animation requiresa lot more computer power than just about anything else you can do with acomputer. For the last month or two of the project, five or six computers werenetworked together in my basement, all of them processing 24 hours a day at topspeed.I can’t possibly convey in a paragraph or two just how much time and effort Iput into making the video. (Granted, it would have taken less time if I hadactually known what I was doing when I started, but I had to learn how to usethe software as I went along.) To make a really long story really short, I spenta year and a half creating the video, with every detail of every scene createdand animated inside the computer, and all of them carefully synchronized to thenarration. Unless you’ve seen the video, and have some idea how computermodeling and animation works, it may be hard to imagine why on earth it wouldtake so long. But it’s not worth explaining here.The video was finally released in April of 2002, and was called “Theft byDeception (Deciphering the Federal Income Tax).” It was the first time I hadever sold anything related to the issue. Since all the same information wasstill available for free in the written report, and I’d worked for a year and ahalf on the video, I didn’t at all feel bad about selling the thing for twentybucks. I also gave anyone permission to broadcast or show it, publicly orprivately, which many people did. It ran dozens of times on various “publicaccess” cable stations, as well as being shown in cities and towns across thecountry by anyone who wanted to show it.A lot of people liked the video very much, although ultimately we realized thatit was still too much for “sound bite” America to digest. For those who didn’tunderstand everything presented, the video apparently doubled as an effectivecure for insomnia. Nonetheless, I remain proud of the video, while having nodesire to start over and try to do it better. Apparently it was effective enoughto worry a lot of people in government, partly because of the fact that one ofthe first things I did when the video was finished was to send out over ahundred free copies of it to various IRS employees across the country. You canguess how much the top dogs at the IRS liked that. (Later on my spies inside theIRS sent me copies of their internal memos, telling any IRS examiners that ifthey received the video they should report it to the IRS’s 861-squelching teamsimmediately.)SPEAKING OUTBacking up a bit, it was after coming across my “Taxable Income” report onlinethat Peter McCandless, the college professor mentioned above, contacted me. Hefound the report interesting, but like any good investigator, he wanted toanalyze it thoroughly and with a healthy skepticism. At some point he asked ifhe could visit me, and in late 2001, he came out to Pennsylvania. We spent manyhours going over the relevant documents, with Peter playing devil’s advocate,trying to punch holes in it, to really put it to the test. Ultimately, hedecided that my ridiculous-sounding conclusion was, in fact, correct. Not longafter we first met, he was offered a chance to have his own radio show, and heinvited me on as his first guest. And over the next few years, we did manyfollow-up shows.Eventually we started making public offers to pay any tax professional a couplethousand dollars to come on Dr. McCandless’ show for two hours to answerquestions about how to determine taxable income. It was a long time before wegot our first taker, but when we finally did, the fellow assured Dr. McCandlessthat he would be happy to answer any tax-related questions on the air. Daysbefore the show, Dr. McCandless sent him the questions we intended to ask.Shortly thereafter, the guy backed out. (I guess he meant he could answer anytax-related questions except those.) And remember that tax attorney, Dan Evans,the self-designated refuter of so-called “tax protestor” theories? When weoffered him thousands of bucks to come on the air and answer the questions, hedidn’t respond at all. In fact, after several years of publicly making the offerto any IRS employee, CPA or attorney, we got a grand total of one person tofollow through on the deal. His entire position was that all of the dozen or soreferences pointing to 861 were negated by one sentence in Section 1.861-8(which didn’t even exist until 1978), which says that the rules of 1.861-8 applyin determining taxable income from “specific sources,” meaning those listedtypes of international trade. Basically, his position amounted to the same oldbackward logic: those sections don’t show your income to be taxable, so don’tlook there. He was nice enough to agree that 861 and its regs do not show theincome of the average American to be taxable. He also admitted that he didn’tknow what income was exempt due to the Constitution—so he didn’t actually answerall the questions, but we paid him anyway.I also started going on other radio shows, and did an occasional public talkabout the issue. I was sending my report and my video to whoever I thought mightpay attention to it. A lot of other people across the country were distributingthe report as well. Every way we could think of, we were trying to get the truthout there to the general public—the victims of the fraud.KICKING THE DRAGONTime passed. We had ample evidence of the biggest financial fraud in history,but although word was spreading, it was not fast enough for my liking. Despitethe web sites, the video, the radios shows, etc., those in the mainstream mediawere mostly ignoring the issue, and mischaracterizing it whenever they didmention it. I learned the hard way that “reporters” are good at quotinggovernment bureaucrats, but not much else. We had solid proof of a crime—a hugecrime, committed by our own government—but relatively few people were hearingabout it or looking into it. We had tens of thousands of people on board, buteven that counts as “few” when compared with a population of several hundredmillion. By then we even had a fair number of CPAs, attorneys, and even formerIRS employees who had come out and publicly voiced their agreement with the 861evidence. Most “tax experts,” however, still refused to even consider the issue.Time marched on—years went by—while on a daily basis people were being harassed,extorted, financially destroyed, and even prosecuted, by the IRS and the“Department of Justice” (a misnomer if ever there was one). In spite of all ourefforts, the lie was still louder than the truth. We needed a way to get publicattention. With that in mind, I decided to do something that even most of myfriends and allies thought was nuts (and apparently they were right). I startedrunning full-page ads in newspapers, which read as follows:Dear Federal Government,PLEASE PROSECUTE ME.I, Larken Rose, have not filed a federal income tax return for 1997 or anysubsequent year. This is not because I am protesting any law, or because I donot want to pay my “fair share”; it is because I refuse to be a victim of thebiggest financial fraud in history. I also refuse to remain silent whilegovernment lawyers illegally defraud my fellow Americans.People by the thousands are learning that the “conventional wisdom” about thefederal income tax is just plain wrong. As more and more Americans arediscovering that the law itself shows that the income of most Americans is nottaxable, DOJ and IRS officials are desperately trying to distract from the issueby dishonestly portraying it as a frivolous “tax protestor” argument, and bytrying to silence (via court injunctions) those who publicize the issue. Thissummary shows why the IRS and the DOJ refuse to have an open, honest discussionabout what the government’s own regulations say:Point 1: The federal income tax applies only to one’s “taxable income,” not toall income, and the income tax regulations (e.g. 26 CFR §§ 1.861-1(a)(1),1.861-8(a)(1), 1.863-1(c)) clearly show that one’s taxable domestic income is tobe determined under the rules of 26 USC § 861(b) and the related regulationsbeginning at 26 CFR § 1.861-8. (Other sections explain when income from outsideof the U.S. is taxable.)Point 2: So why does it matter whether we use those sections to determine ourtaxable domestic income? Because more than 80 years of statutory and regulatoryhistory prove beyond any doubt that 26 USC § 861(b) and 26 CFR § 1.861-8 showincome to be taxable only when it comes from certain types of international orforeign commerce. In other words, contrary to what “everyone knows,” mostAmericans do not receive taxable income, and do not owe federal income taxes.IRS employees across the country refuse to honestly address the issue, andinstead resort to threats, evasions, and accusations, because their own lawbooks expose the biggest financial fraud in history: the misrepresentation andmisapplication of the federal income tax. (See www.taxableincome.net for moreinformation.) The nationwide pattern of Gestapo-like tactics by the IRS and DOJagainst those who speak the truth is shown in detail atwww.Theft-by-Deception.com/declaration.html.I will not stand by and allow myself, my family and my neighbors to be extortedsimply because some power-happy bureaucrats huff and puff about all the nastythings they will do to anyone who does not “comply” with the IRS’s misapplication of the law. To the DOJ and the IRS I say this: You know I am amongthe most vocal about this issue. Stop terrorizing the American public and comeget me. Make an “example” of me. Surely if my position is “frivolous” andcompletely devoid of merit, then the DOJ attorneys can easily refute my positionin front of a jury, and have me convicted and imprisoned. (I’m not exactlyhiding, am I?) You already have what would be “Exhibit A” in my defense: myTheft By Deception video. So take your best shot.www.Theft-by-Deception.comwww.861.infoIt’s time for the fraud to end.I ran that ad starting in 2001, and it appeared in papers in several states,including Texas, Hawaii, Idaho and Missouri. It was also printed up as aone-page flier, and I invited anyone to post it wherever they wanted. Oneparticularly enthusiastic ally spent hours in front of IRS and DOJ headquartersin Washington, D.C., handing out around 900 copies of the flier to passers-by,especially those going in and out of the government buildings. In January of2003, part of the ad was read on CNBC, though they didn’t mention my name, nordid they get into the substance of the issue at all.(Several papers actually refused to run the thing, even as a paid advertisement.As one example, the St. Petersburg Times down in Florida was all set to run itat one point—for a lot of money, I might add—when the guy handling theiradvertising pages called to tell me that the higher-ups at the paper hadsuddenly said that the ad could not be run. They didn’t say why. Even the Times’ad guy found that to be a little strange.)So, you may be wondering, why on earth would I do such a thing? It was anattempt to bring more attention to the issue, as I said before, but there wereother reasons, too. For starters, if the government was going to prosecutesomeone for something 861-related, I wanted it to be me, because I didn’t seeanyone in a better position to defend himself than I was. I knew the issueforward and backward, could quote most of the relevant sections from memory, andhad my video and report to show what I believe and why. More importantly, it wasmy research; I didn’t have to point to what someone else had done and say, “Ibelieved this guy.”It also helped that I hadn’t done anything sneaky or deceptive. I wasn’t acriminal, and I wasn’t breaking the law, so I felt no need to behave like acriminal. I had gone out of my way to tell the IRS about my income, to tell themI had stopped filing, and to explain why.The IRS is a big bully, and everyone knows it. Just like a schoolyard bully, itroutinely picks some victim to publicly beat the tar out of in order to keepeveryone else scared. The IRS’s own manual openly acknowledges (and advocates)this method of achieving obedience via intimidation.“News coverage to advance deterrent value of enforcement activities encouraged:The Service will endeavor to obtain news coverage of its enforcement activitiesin order to: (a) help deter violations of the internal revenue laws, and (b)increase the confidence of conscientious taxpayers that the Service prosecutesviolators.” [IRM § 1.2.1.2.41]And such scare tactics usually work. But even one loss can seriously damage abully’s reputation of invincibility, and that reputation, and the fear itcreates, is the source of every bully’s power. If some 50-pound weakling on theplayground stands up to the bully and beats him, the thug’s bullying days areall but over. I didn’t see anyone in a better position than I was to take a shotat the IRS bully. So, picturing all the nice little kids who’d had their nosesbloodied by the bully, I volunteered to be the 50-pound weakling taking a shot.All joking aside (just for a moment), while individual IRS agents often seem tobe merely stupid and incompetent rather than malicious, what the agency does asa whole is often downright evil. It grinds up and spits out financial lives, notjust of “cheaters” or of those who challenge the conventional wisdom about thetax, but also of thousands of innocent folk whose only sin was to have theircase selected for “review” by some paper-pusher at the IRS who can’t add orthink, but who can send threatening letters, levy bank accounts, file liens, andso on. The horror stories are numerous. Just to give you a taste, below are afew comments of an IRS employee who testified at Congressional hearingsconcerning IRS abuses:“Sadly, some [IRS] employees repeatedly do not follow proper collection policiesand procedures and thereby repeatedly abuse taxpayers. There are several reasonswhy this occurs: … When management condones the abuse, the Revenue Officerbelieves the mistake is acceptable and is free to repeat the error again. …Revenue Officers capitalize on the taxpayer’s inherent fear of the IRS and theintimidation that they can inflict on taxpayers without any consequences fortheir improper enforcement.”“I have witnessed Collection Division Branch Chiefs, Assistant Division Chiefs,Division Chiefs, Problem Resolution (PRO) employees, and even an AssistantDistrict Director, violate or ignore Internal Revenue Manual procedures andTreasury regulations simply because they wanted to punish a taxpayer.”Most people know someone who has been through the IRS wringer and is stilltrying to recover. Now add to the routine heartless thuggery of the IRS the factthat most of its victims never owed a dime of federal income taxes to beginwith, and you might begin to understand why I was so desperate to try to dosomething about it. The act of running those “please prosecute me” ads is what Icompare to some little peasant kicking a dragon. Some would view that as an actof sheer stupidity more than anything else, and they might be right.Nonetheless, I saw it as my duty, being in the position I was in, to at leastmake the attempt to do some good. (Personally, I think a dragon is far toomajestic and noble a creature to associate with the IRS, but “Kicking the GiantBloated Maggot” just doesn’t have the same ring to it.)(As a quick aside, if you want an example of profound hypocrisy, get this: InOctober of 2004 a story hit the press about how tax “noncompliance” was on therise among—brace yourself—IRS employees. Yes, you read that right. And though a1998 law says that any IRS employee who doesn’t file tax returns is supposed tobe fired, the IRS refused to do so. Why? They said they feared that it woulddampen enforcement efforts. What? Enforcing the law—at least their twisted viewof it—would dampen enforcement efforts? Yeah, that makes loads of sense. Soremember, when I say that the IRS gang thinks it’s above the law, I’m notkidding.)MAKING IT CRIMINALThere were several reasons why I wanted the fight to be in the form of acriminal trial, instead of just daring them to try to swipe my money through the“civil” process. (Personally, I don’t consider stealing people’s property to bea very “civil” thing to do, but that’s what they call it to distinguish it froma criminal prosecution.) First of all, a prosecution is more noteworthy and morelikely to get public attention than a lawsuit or the IRS levying a bank account.Furthermore, as I had already seen, civil cases usually last just long enoughfor some judge to holler “frivolous” and throw the case out.In a criminal case, on the other hand, the defendant has one importantadvantage. Federal tax crimes all have a component of “willfulness.” In short,it is not a crime to accidentally determine your taxes incorrectly. (If it were,a million or so tax preparers would be locked up—and then it would be reallyboring here in prison.) It is only a crime to intentionally report or pay thewrong amount. This is an exception to the usual rule of “ignorance of the law isno excuse.”In the case of Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192 (1991), the Supreme Courtexplained that acting “willfully” means intentionally violating a “known legalduty.” As a result, if someone truly believes he was not required to file orpay, there is no “willfulness” (and therefore no crime), “however unreasonable acourt might deem such a belief.” In any criminal trial, the prosecution has theburden of proof, and must convince the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that thedefendant committed the crime. So in my case, to get a conviction, thegovernment would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that I believe myincome is taxable, and that I therefore believed I was required to file.(Receiving tax-exempt income doesn’t trigger a filing requirement.) In case youdoubt the opinion of a nasty convict like me, here is what the DOJ’s ownprosecutor’s manual says about “willfulness”:“[I]n a failure to file prosecution, the government is required to establishthat the offender voluntarily and intentionally failed to file returns which heknew were required to be filed. ... Willfulness is thus established when thegovernment proves that the failure to file was ‘voluntary and purposeful andwith the specific intent to fail to do that which he knew the law required’.”[Criminal Tax Manual, § 10.04[5]]So, unless one is trying to break the law, intentionally doing what he believesto be illegal (which I wasn’t), there is no crime. I know what I “believe” (andwhat I know), and I had a paper trail a mile long documenting in great detailwhat I believe and why, including piles of statutes and regulations supportingmy conclusions. And while my position was consistent and well-documented, theIRS, from top to bottom, for eight years had been unable to refute my position,unable to answer my questions, and unable even to state the specifics of its ownposition. (I don’t consider frothing at the mouth and screaming “frivolous” toconstitute a substantive rebuttal.) When you add in my “Taxable Income” report,my Theft by Deception video, and dozens of other articles and letters I’vewritten about the issue, I couldn’t imagine how on earth the government couldeven try to prove that I don’t believe what I’m saying.Furthermore, in a criminal case the final decision is not made by a governmenthack, but by a jury of (supposedly) average Americans. The following is from amessage I sent to my e-mail list several months before my trial began,explaining that point:“If I thought the final decision would be made by someone whose fat paycheckcomes from the system, I would never have done this. The one hope for justice ina case like this—as intended by the authors of the Constitution—is the JURY.Yes, lots of nasty things can be said about some juries, and even about juriesin general. They can be biased, ignorant, unintelligent, etc. BUT they are stillmere peasants, like you and me, which makes them far more trustworthy thananyone whose life blood comes from the system. And yes, judges can tamper a lotwith what a jury will hear. (How much that happens in our case remains to beseen.) But unless Judge Baylson [the judge assigned to my case] declares at theopening of trial, ‘the Court has decided not to let the Defendants speak at allat this trial,’ the government still has a major problem on its hands. Would YOUlike to have to prove to twelve people, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Tessaand I BELIEVE that our income is taxable? I wouldn’t. They know we havecommitted no crime, and they know they have no case. What they present will be100% fabrication, deception and slander, because that’s all they have.”Amen. Other than having hope that a jury would do the right thing, my predictionwas dead-on, including the part about Judge Baylson pretty much prohibiting mefrom defending myself, as you’ll see. I did what I know the law requires, and soI committed no crime. I expected those in government to lie and cheat all overthe place—and they did—but I found it hard to imagine, given the evidence I had,that any jury would in the end be able to say, “Yes, we’re sure he believed hisincome was taxable.” To even take the case to trial would be absurd.There was another motive behind my decision to “kick the dragon,” which did notdepend upon the outcome of the trial. Having witnessed the IRS’s brainlesspersistence in various meetings, it had become quite clear to me that merereason and proof were not going to deter them from their lawless, unthinking,mechanical routine of extorting people. But at least I could publicize theiractions, for all the world to see (or at least the small percentage payingattention).I’m no Gandhi, but he used an interesting tactic against the British soldiers inIndia. He couldn’t force them to stop being butt-heads, but he could make theirbutt-headedness very public and obvious, so as to encourage more anti-butt-headresistance. I decided to apply the same approach to the United Statesgovernment: whatever the outcome, I could at least publicize everything thefederales did, in an effort to show the American people what their governmenthas become. And, as you may have guessed, that’s also why I’m sitting in frontof this typewriter in prison, writing this book.As you also may have guessed from the fact that I’m in prison, the fedseventually took me up on my request to be prosecuted (several years after I ranthose ads), but some other things happened in the interim which must bementioned.ONE DAY IN MAYI described above how my second meeting with the IRS ended with their promisingme that they would not close the case without first contacting me. Eventually,they did. They didn’t send a bill, or ask for another meeting. Instead, the nexttime the IRS “contacted” me concerning the fact that my wife and I had stoppedfiling returns came two and a half years later, on the morning of May 6, 2003,when a dozen or so armed federal agents showed up at my front door, forced theirway into my house, scared the heck out of my wife and then-six-year-olddaughter, and then spent eight hours rummaging through our house, taking awayboxes and boxes of our records and personal belongings.Hmmm, that wasn’t quite the “contact” I was picturing when they said they wouldget back to me.In planning this book, I knew I wanted to avoid making it too technical or tooserious, mainly because that stuff isn’t usually fun to read. However, there aresome things I don’t want to make light of. My little girl ran and hid under adresser in her own bedroom, reduced to tears as a dozen armed strangers dressedin combat black invaded her home. There is nothing funny about that. Some peopleI know opined that I had every right and moral justification to respond to suchfascist thuggery with force, even deadly force. And if you must know, I agreecompletely. Furthermore, I had the means to do so, locked in my gun safe (whichI easily had time to retrieve). But, though some have criticized me for it, Ileft the guns locked up, and I unlocked the front door. Why? Because unlike thejack-booted Nazi bastards who work for the IRS, it is my deep desire to see thisissue settled without violence.After hearing them banging on the door, yelling “Federal agents, open thedoor!”—and after a few moments of disbelief, in which I wondered whether itmight be a friend of ours joking around—I unlocked the door, opened it a crack,and demanded to see a warrant. I got that several minutes later, but only afterthey had forced their way inside, spreading throughout the house, temporarilyseparating my wife from our daughter.For a while after the initial invasion, the three of us sat on our living roomcouch, watching as a dozen unthinking, order-obeying thugs violated our home.The feeling of that, both during and afterward, is beyond my ability todescribe, so I won’t even try. (One notable little anecdote was when IRS agentGerald Loke, slimeball extraordinaire, with a big grin on his face, commented onmy ability to use a camera, referring to the glamour and topless photos of mywife he had just rummaged through. So if I do a little “name-calling” regardingthese walking heaps of putrid excrement, please forgive me.)Again, I could never put into words just what it feels like to watch helplesslyas your home is invaded by armed scumbags and thugs (no wonder the Founders hada revolution over it), but there are two things worth telling about thiscompletely unwarranted (pardon the pun) invasion of our home-sweet-home: thelegal excuse for the raid, and the real reason for it.The legal excuse was a search warrant, purportedly authorizing a search forevidence of various possible crimes, including tax evasion, failure to file taxreturns, corruptly interfering with the administration of tax laws, signing afalse return, filing a false claim, and the ever-popular, all-encompassing“conspiracy” (to do what?). What they did not give me on the day of the raid,because a magistrate had ordered it “sealed,” was the “affidavit of probablecause”—the legal document supposedly justifying the search.As an aside, there was no arrest warrant, and we were always free to leave. Mywife and daughter left shortly after the raid began, but I chose to stay,sitting on my living room couch for the whole eight hours, to at least try tokeep half an eye on the jack-boot brigade. (When I had to go to the bathroom,they let me do so only with an agent in the room, and with the door open. When Iwas finished, I asked if I had urinated in the proper, federally approvedmanner. They wouldn’t say.)During their eight hours of rummaging, they wouldn’t let me make or receivephone calls, and when Tessa returned some time later, they wouldn’t let her backin. After a while I was “interviewed” by “Special Agent” Donald Pearlman, thehead fascist on the scene (who has about as much personality as a dead fish).Mostly he asked things that any decent investigator—or even a mildly observantspectator—would already have known, about the video, the web sites, etc. At onepoint, some other inferiority-complex punk on a power trip summed up the realreason for the raid, saying, “When people hear you’ve been raided, no one’sgoing to listen to you anymore.” Thanks for the tip, Adolf. In reality, theyweren’t seeking any “evidence”; they were trying to silence me.(A couple of people have made the odd argument that I shouldn’t complain aboutmy home being invaded by a dozen jack-booted imbeciles, because I had invitedthe government to prosecute me. But had I meant “Please needlessly and illegallyinvade my home,” I would have said that. Instead, I had already given them allthe relevant information they could have wanted, thus rendering any “search”completely unnecessary.)Below is the account of the raid from my wife’s perspective, from a swornaffidavit filed with a court motion:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The date was Tuesday, May 6, 2003. It was about 9:45 in the morning. I hadreturned from a walk in the park. Elyssa, my six-year-old daughter, had put onher dance clothes. I was about to give her some breakfast and take her to danceclass. Larken was awake, half dressed, and still in bed. I heard a loud knock atthe door. I went to the door, pulled back the curtain to see who was there, andsaw a bunch of men in black, yelling “Federal agents, open up!” or somethinglike that, in a very loud, very threatening manner. I was not sure what to do;just letting these loud, violent people into my house didn’t seem like the bestidea, so I ran back to get Larken, saying something like “Larken, it’s federalagents!” He’d gotten his pants on and went to the door, saying, “It’s probably ajoke, it’s probably Mark and Chad” (two people who do work for us). By the timeLarken was unlocking the door, they were preparing to break it down. He yelled,“I’m unlocking it!” and opened the door a little. There were a few moments ofLarken holding them all off with the door, yelling “Show me the warrant!” beforethey all swarmed in. There were about ten of them, in black jackets, with handson their guns, ready to draw any second. I don’t think anyone actually drew agun—I’m sure I would have remembered if someone actually pointed one at me—butthey were all ready to. And they started yelling about guns right away. “Whereare your guns?”A lot of thoughts went through my head very fast at this point. I was sure theseguys had something to do with Larken’s video, but I didn’t know exactly whatthey were there for, or whether this was a legal raid or not. All I knew forsure was that these loud, threatening, armed men wanted us defenseless and gaveno reason. It was possible they wanted us dead. So my first action was to pickup the phone to call 911 and get the local police there. An agent swiped thephone from my hand before I could dial three numbers, and I was surrounded inthe dining room, cut off from my husband (in the living room) and my daughter(in the bedroom). They kept on yelling, demanding our guns. My memory is a bitfuzzy, because this all happened so fast, but this is my best recollection ofthe order in which things occurred and what people said. I think Larken waslooking at the warrant, and he was surrounded in the living room. They wereyelling something about “securing the site” and I yelled back that the site wassecure before they broke into it. At some point I yelled, “There’s a child inthis house!” hoping to shame them into calming down.A female agent, who was between me and the bedroom, said “Where’s the child?” Ithink I indicated the bedroom, but when she started moving in that direction, Iscreamed, “I don’t care if you’re a woman, don’t you touch my child!” (trying tosound as intimidating as a petite, defenseless woman surrounded by large, armedthugs can possibly sound). She stopped moving that way, and the armed thugsaround me must have made some space so I could move toward the bedroom, but theywere all harping on about where the guns were. I wouldn’t tell them (still notknowing why or under what authority they were in my home). They wouldn’t let meenter the bedroom to locate my daughter. I said, “Okay, watch me. I’m standingright here.” I stood in the doorway, but I couldn’t see Elyssa. I called forher. She peeked out from under the dresser and said, “I’m here, Mommy.” Herlittle face was streaked with tears. For a while I was standing in the doorway,between them and Elyssa, and it was a standoff. They wanted to go in there andlook for guns, but they didn’t want me in there first, and I didn’t want thembetween me and my daughter. She was obviously frightened enough without thesehostile strangers swarming into her bedroom while she was all alone in there. Iwas determined to get to her first. But I was afraid they would shoot me if Iwent in there first. I slid down to the floor so I could see Elyssa better asshe cowered under the dresser. If I couldn’t go to her, at least I could talk toher and soothe her. The thugs kept demanding to know where the guns were. At onepoint I said I wouldn’t talk to them and I wanted to see my husband. I said ifthey wanted to know where anything was, to ask him. One thug said that “themelodramatics aren’t necessary,” as if I were the one “creating a scene” there.I was trying to act as rationally as possible to protect my child and myselfwithout actually knowing what was going on.This standoff continued until Larken told them that the guns were in the safe inthe bedroom closet. Then I told them that I would go in first, and take Elyssathrough the bedroom into the front room so they could look in our closet. Iscooped up Elyssa and headed for the front room. We were about halfway therewhen the thugs noticed there was a closet in the front room also, and starteddemanding to know which closet the guns were in. I was afraid they would shootme, and I indicated the bedroom closet, which of course was exactly what Larkenhad told them. All I wanted was to get myself and my daughter away from thesenervous, hostile, and heavily armed people, who seemed to think that loaded gunswere just lying around the house and that we were just waiting for a chance toshoot them. Our family has always been peaceful and law-abiding; the localpolice who know us know this very well. The hostile and suspicious demeanor ofthese federal thugs was completely unreasonable and only served to make mewonder if they were acting unlawfully.I don’t remember how we got back to Larken in the living room. I think Ieventually demanded that they let me go to my husband, and they let me comethrough holding Elyssa. Larken was sitting on the couch looking at the warrant.I rushed to him with Elyssa in my arms and sat next to him on the couch. I don’tremember what happened then very well. Elyssa was crying and clinging to me, andI spent some time comforting her, and Larken spoke to her too. We told her thatthese people were the IRS. I told her that these people wanted to scare Daddybecause they don’t like Daddy talking about the income tax. I told her thateverything would be okay, and hoped I was telling the truth.An Abington police officer was leaning over Larken’s shoulder, discussing thesearch warrant with him. I had not seen him up until that point, and didn’t knowthat any local police were present. He must have been behind the pack of federalthugs as they swarmed in. I remember one of the thugs saying that Larken shouldbe ashamed for bringing this on his family. I don’t remember Larken’s retort, ormine, but it was a ridiculous thing to say under the circumstances, as well asbeing inflammatory and (again) gratuitously rude. Larken established that thesearch warrant was valid as far as he could tell, although there was a lot hecouldn’t tell at the time.The first concern of the thugs was to “secure” all our weapons. That’s what theysaid, but of course the weapons were much more secure before they arrived. Theybrought out the safe from the bedroom closet, and Larken had to tell them how toopen it. There was only one gun, and Larken remembered that the other one waslocked in the car because he’d gone to the 7-Eleven late the night before. Oneof the thugs said something about paranoia, and said to the Abington cop, “Iguess he doesn’t trust you to do your job,” or something like that, probablytrying to turn the local cop against us. Larken gave them the key to the gunsafe downstairs. The guns would have been quite secure if one of them just heldthe key to the safe. But they insisted on taking all the guns out of the safe,“seeing if anything else was in there,” and taking all the guns, other weapons,and ammunition out to the trunk of one of their cars.A guy read us some rights, and asked us to waive some of them, which we bothdeclined to do. I said I was going to take Elyssa to dance class, and they saidI could go. I asked the local cop if he would be staying until the federal thugsleft, and he said yes. I told him I didn’t trust them not to harm my husband,and that I was asking him to stay. He assured me that he or another cop would bethere. Some thugs were sent out to search the car.One thug made a big point of telling me not to talk to anybody while I was outthere. He said that this was a very good piece of advice, and many people hadcome to grief for not following it. He said something like “You just want to letthis happen quietly.” I got my purse and keys and left with Elyssa. I was veryrelieved to find my cell phone in my purse. I was sure they would haveconfiscated it if they knew it was there. Some guys were working on the waterlines on the street right in front of our house on the Pike. As a guy waved methrough to the road, I stopped and said, “By the way, we’re the good guys. Myhusband is telling people the truth about the income tax, and they’re trying toshut him up.” So it took me about two minutes to throw the fascist’s advice outthe window. I figured if he stressed that so much it must be something thatwould help him, not me.I drove a little way and then called Tom (Clayton) and told him about the raid.Then I called Chad. I said that it would be good if they showed up as soon aspossible, to keep an eye on things. Tom called back, and gave me the name of alawyer I could call who would understand what was going on here. I called thehouse to tell Larken that, but couldn’t get through. I tried and tried. Then Icalled Tom again. He said a search warrant had just been served at his homealso, and he had to go. He was at work, and his wife was home with a sick childwhen this happened. ...I called Larken to see if he was okay. No one answered the phone. I left amessage, saying “Larken, pick up the phone,” but no one picked up. I calledagain and again, always leaving messages like that. “Larken pick up the phone,”or “Will you people let my husband pick up the phone?” or “Let my husband pickup the phone!” I called about ten times and the phone was never picked up. I gotback to the house, and Chad and Mark were there outside on the Pasadena sidewalknear Mark’s car. I gave Chad my cell phone so it wouldn’t be confiscated, and Iwalked to the house. On my way up the driveway, a thug blocked my path, and whenI tried to continue, he pushed me back. “I told you not to talk to anyone!” heshouted. I shouted back, “Let me through! I have to pee, and I want to see myhusband!” I was worried about Larken in there, since I couldn’t get through onthe phone. What were they doing to him? Was he alive? The guy told me I wasn’tallowed back in. I yelled at them, but there was nothing I could do. I couldn’tforce my way in through a bunch of armed men. I had no way to find out if myhusband was okay, and I felt frantic. ...Chad and Mark told me that while they were watching, before I came back, thugscame out and took our guns out of the trunk of the car and measured all the gunbarrels. (Guns were not mentioned on the search warrant.) ...At the end of the day, a bunch of spectators (neighbors and friends) werestanding around watching the thugs as they brought out our computers and boxesand boxes of papers and piled it all into their cars. We watched them take thefirearms and other weapons back into the house. Finally Larken came out, and abig cheer went up as I hugged him in the middle of the street. The thugs leftshortly after that. They left an inventory of the stolen goods, and promised wewould have it all back on Friday. This turned out to be a lie. We got all thecomputers back by the end of the next week, I think. And we’ve gotten a fewpapers back. But the vast majority of what they took, they still have, ninemonths later.Tessa David Rose--------------------------------------------------------------------------------During the raid, one IRS agent claimed that he was “putting me on notice” thatmy income was taxable. I found it amazing that he thought that there was anyauthority behind such a comment, and that his unilateral decree could make meowe a tax, and I told him so.One or more IRS agents tried to tell me what my own beliefs are, one claimingthat I didn’t think wages are income, and another claiming that I think the taxlaws are invalid, neither of which I’ve ever claimed. So these bozos didn’tbother finding out what I believe or what I say before storming my house. Oneagent arrogantly said that he would come visit me in prison. (He hasn’t so far.Darn.)The agents asked several questions about our firearms, questioning the need forus to own or carry such weapons, one calling me “paranoid” for having carried afirearm to the 7-Eleven at 1 a.m. the night before. (I am licensed to carryconcealed firearms in Pennsylvania.) After they continued to ask me why I ownedfirearms, which I perceived to be an attempt to imply that I’m some dangerouscriminal, I responded by saying that I could quite easily have come to the doorarmed and “blown your [expletive] heads off,” but that I instead chose to leavethe guns locked up, came to the door unarmed, and unlocked the door for them, sothey should just “shut the [expletive] up.” As I recall, that ended theirquestioning about the firearms.At one point I loudly proclaimed to anyone in the house that I would give any ofthem $1,000 if they could answer six questions about how, according to the law,I should determine my taxable income. No one took me up on my offer.While we’re on the subject of the IRS Gestapo tactics, I might as well include amessage written by Dr. Clayton about his own experiences, which I forwarded tomy e-mail list in June of 2004. They raided his home down in Texas on the sameday they raided mine. His message is a bit long, but it gives yet anothertelling view of the issue, and of what “our” government does to people who saythings it doesn’t like. (The underlined emphasis is his own.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------One year ago CID [the IRS’s “Criminal Investigation Division”] special agentsJack Bell, Jacob Avery, Paul Howard, and approximately ten other agents came(with firearms) to my private residence in Texas (about 30 minutes after theyshowed up at Larken’s house) after I had gone to work. My 11-year-old daughterwas home alone sick, while my wife was taking my youngest daughter to school.They yelled, “THIS IS THE POLICE; WE HAVE A SEARCH WARRANT, OPEN THE DOOR!” Mydaughter became hysterical, saying “You aren’t going to arrest my mommy anddaddy!”This single event galvanized me into coming out from behind the scenes, where Ihad been working with Larken for over five years for the sole purpose ofeducating the public about the correct application of the federal income tax law(i.e., those parts of the law that show that the only incomes that are taxableare related to international commerce, which of course does not include theincomes of most Americans).I am sure my becoming more public was the exact opposite of what the DOJ washoping for. I’m sure they thought that they would be able to intimidate me intoshutting up. What were they threatening? To indict me and to throw me in jail?Just like they threaten everyone else? What for? Because I read the law andcould prove that I did not owe federal income taxes? Or because I dared to showothers what the law said?What was wrong with this picture? I had broken no laws. I had provided financingso that the public would have free access to the evidence in the law (via thetaxableincome.net web site), and this type of activity is protected by the FirstAmendment. I had worked with Larken for years for the sole purpose of undoingwhat the government had done, which was to write and arrange the law in such amanner that it was virtually impossible for the public to read the law andunderstand it. The truth is in the law, but it is buried so deep and in suchconvoluted regulations, that most of the public was being deceived.I became involved so that the public could read and understand what the law saidfor themselves. Some crime, huh? But the DOJ will have a hard time proving thatI or Larken broke any laws. How about their tactic of avoiding what the law saysin the courtroom by painting “tax protestors” (sorry, guys, we are “governmentlie protestors”) as dirtballs, or as people who are engaged in get-rich-quickschemes? They have bitten off a very unpleasant snozzcumber (remember RoaldDahl’s The Big Friendly Giant, or BFG?) that is hard to eat and even harder toswallow. They have come up against honest people and the truth in the writtenlaw.I am at least $50,000 in the hole and I am giving more money all the time inorder to keep showing the evidence in the law to the public. I had never giventax advice or done anything such as hiding income, and yet here were armedGestapo agents invading my home, stealing hundreds of videos (which as you allknow is a gross violation of constitutional rights) because they were “mad” atme for funding the video. Larken has done a wonderful job of using the pile of300 videos as an obvious proof of their deliberate violations of the law andcivil rights.Do any of you think that this is a reason to break the law and violate rights?When you get mad at your neighbor, do you go over and hold their child atgunpoint? It was this episode that convinced me that the federal governmentdoesn’t care what the law says; doesn’t care about the constitutional limits onwhat they can and cannot do. This is a very ominous situation indeed. This raidoriginated by command of the top lawyers at the DOJ in Washington, those chargedwith enforcing the laws and protecting the public. The fact that they areviolating the law for political ends will only backfire on them, and it alreadyhas.These lawyers are supposed to be held to a “higher standard,” yet here they wereusing thugs to knowingly break the law (the term they like to use when attackingthe public). Which DOJ lawyers knowingly broke the law to try and shut us up?What do they think, that the public will not find out eventually?My involvement in this educational mission has never been “because Larken saysit,” it has been because this is what the law says. When I read an earlierversion of the “Taxable Income” report on the “Taxgate” web site, I realizedfrom the written and published evidence in the law itself that he quoted wordfor word that the law really was much more limited in scope than the public hasbeen led to believe.Since the beginning, independent of Larken, I realized that the focus of thisbattle must be on the written law, because the government has always said that Iam (just like any other citizen) required to go to the law, read it, anddetermine on that basis alone what the law did or did not require me to do.Before the Internet, this was extremely difficult. The Internet and computersearch engines (that could search the entire law almost instantly) made certainthat nothing critical was “overlooked.” Once the structure of the deception wasunderstood, when it came to determining “taxable income,” every single reference(including the indexes of the United States Code and Code of FederalRegulations) pointed to Subchapter N, Section 861 and following. The evidence isnothing less than overwhelming, but most of the public had never seen the lawbefore the Internet. This needed to be remedied.I offered to finance Larken’s own website (he did not ask me) so that therewould be nothing else to interfere with the educational process of helping thepublic understand what the law says, where it says it, and why it says what itdoes. He and I were as one when we agreed to have no theories or speculations;nothing but the written law itself from the government’s own law books. In otherwords, nothing but what the government has told every citizen that they must do.Since I strongly believe in following the law as written, whether or not I“agreed” with what the law said was irrelevant, it was not a “choice” that Icould make. I could not file an incorrect return (reporting my income as“taxable income”) just to “keep out of trouble.” If I did file a federal incometax return stating that I had “taxable income” and signed it under penalty ofperjury when I knew and could prove that I did not, I would be knowinglycommitting a crime, which I refuse to do.But this was not a personal issue; it really bothered me that most Americanswere being deceived. It really bothered me that a person had to have excellentreading comprehension to understand the law even with the regulations (which aresupposed to explain the correct application of the statutes so that the publiccan understand what the law does or does not require them to do). It reallybothered me that the Treasury Department was knowingly stealing from the public,taking advantage of their lack of knowledge about the law. How many “taxprofessionals” were in on this, getting lots of income from turning over clientincomes with no basis in law to do so? More importantly, how many taxprofessionals were honest and had been deceived as well?I decided that no matter what it cost, I felt that I had a social obligation tohelp the public understand how to read and understand the law correctly. Nomatter what the government tried to do to stop the public from seeing the law,it would not work. The law does not lie and the evidence will not go away. Themore publicity that is brought to the issue, the better it is.When confronted with such a massive contradiction between what was being done bythe IRS and the Treasury Department and what the law actually said, I did theonly thing that seemed reasonable: I wrote directly to the regulation-writinglawyers in the Treasury Department to find out why their own regulations saidsomething so very different than the public has been led to believe (see below).I knew that my situation was exactly like that of most Americans. I knew thatthe law required them to answer me truthfully; in fact, government lawyers aresupposed to be held to a higher standard, according to their own ethicspublications. Not IRS lower-level employees; the government lawyers who writethe law and to whom even the Supreme Court defers. How could they lie, with thepublished law to prove that they lied?How would they respond? I must confess, initially I felt reasonably sure thatwhen confronted with the irrefutable evidence, they would have no ethical, moralor legal choice but to admit that the regulations do mean what they say (whichof course, they do whether a government bureaucrat says so or not).As you have seen on the www.taxableincome.net website, I was the (anonymous)person who first asked these “experts” the questions about the regulations,written very clearly, using language from the regulations themselves. They wereasked in such a way that they could be answered “yes” or “no.”These “experts” answered me with everything but the law I asked about, answeringquestions that I did not ask. It was obvious that I was not asking about the“items” (types) of income in Subchapter B and elsewhere that may be taxable, Iwas asking about the taxable sources (types of commerce which generate theincome), as specified over and over again in the regulations under Section 861and following. After that, they refused to answer the questions.The government lawyers have not only been stealing from the public, but whenfaced with what the law itself said, refused to correct their error. It made mesick to my stomach. They try to distract and confuse you first, and when thatdoesn’t work, they stop responding.I am a doctor. I am a formally educated person (which is no guarantee of beingable to think objectively, by the way) who can read and write and who presentedthe evidence in the law to them in a very logical fashion. It was obvious that Iwas not a tax protestor or fringe person. Here was the massive administrativestructure of the federal government with a “chain of command,” where (you wouldthink), as one proceeded up this chain, the people in those more responsible(higher paid) positions would actually be more responsible, honest, and, oncenotified of the fraud, would do everything in their power to stop the robbery.Instead, every single person in power, including the Inspector Generals of theDOJ and Treasury Department, charged with dealing with and preventing employeemisconduct, and politicians such as Charles Grassley (Finance Committee) didnothing. For over three years, I have documented letters to Andrew Card,President Bush’s Chief of Staff, of the deception, asking him to stop it andstop the misconduct of the executive branch agencies that are desperately tryingto keep the evidence in the law from being understood by the public.In the summer of 2001 I think that I got through to Marc Weinberger, AssistantSecretary of the Office of Tax Policy, the person in charge of all the federaltax regulations, because he resigned after only one year of his two-year term,at the top of his game. Was this because he was honest? But how is it that thehonest people resign and the fraud continues? Who is directing this theft? Doesthat mean that whoever is left is determined to keep stealing from the public?Are they “lifer” bureaucrats?This in and of itself reveals corruption of the federal government on a scalethat most of the public cannot even imagine. They will not police themselves andwill not follow the law as written; meanwhile they are beating up the privatesector for fraud, and attacking people like Larken and me for exercising ourFirst Amendment rights to freedom of speech, for simply showing the public whatthe law says.If we do not stop this corruption now, then it will only get worse. We are anation of the rule of written law, and, armed with the Internet, we will nolonger be ignored. I know that all of you see how serious that this is; we mustdo what the founders of this country did, which is to confront tyranny and stopit, no matter the cost. Like the Terminator, we will not stop until this fraudis ended.Sincerely,Tom Clayton, M.D.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------After reading the above, do you think that the raids on my home and Dr.Clayton’s home were designed to obtain actual evidence of actual crimes? Iunderstand that people don’t usually want to think ill of their “leaders,” butjust how blatant do tyranny and oppression have to be before the public facesthe ugly truth?FISHING EXPEDITIONRegarding the raid on my home, the list of things they were there to steal(”seize” is their term for it) included dozens of types of items and documents,including anything remotely resembling a record of anything financial, as wellas anything expressing anyone’s opinion about anything tax-related, allcomputers and disks on the premises regardless of content, and last but notleast, every copy they could find of my “Taxable Income” report and my Theft byDeception video.With that in mind, the real motivation for their raid should be obvious: it’scalled censorship. All they needed was the rubber-stamp blessing of U.S.Magistrate Thomas Rueter, and they had official permission to forcibly stealevery copy they could find of a perfectly legal video. And Mr. Rueter, inkeeping with the usual contempt for the Constitution shown by the federaljudiciary, gave his blessing to the IRS’s Gestapo routine.(Later on, after I publicly criticized Magistrate Rueter for endorsing suchunconstitutional terrorism, someone apparently sent him a threatening letter. Asa result, U.S. Marshals showed up at my house. They told me what had happened,but since I hadn’t threatened anyone, or told anyone else to, they couldn’treally say what the purpose of their visit was. To be fair, they were relativelypolite and professional—and made it a point to quickly say that they were notfrom the IRS. Obviously Magistrate Rueter had sent them out to try to make menervous, even though I hadn’t done anything wrong, which the Marshals had toadmit. I then put out another message to my e-mail list, as I had done before,telling people to please not threaten violence, as it only causes trouble, makesus look bad, and makes U.S. Marshals show up at my house. But I also have a wordof advice for people like Mr. Rueter: If you don’t want people hating you somuch that they would threaten you, maybe you should stop giving your blessing tofascist police state oppression. Just a thought.)The IRS spent eight hours swiping thirty-five boxes of property and records frommy house. Despite the impressive laundry list of alleged (made-up) violationsthey claimed to be investigating, the end result, years later, was (drum roll,please) an indictment for several counts of one misdemeanor charge: willfulfailure to file federal income tax returns. To justify the raid, the IRS claimedto have “probable cause” to think that they’d find evidence of half a dozendifferent alleged offenses, most of them felonies. The fact that we were chargedonly with the least serious offense, a misdemeanor (which we also didn’tcommit), shows that the raid was nothing more than a giant fishing expedition.Was the raid even necessary for the one misdemeanor they eventually charged mewith? Well, maybe they wanted to find evidence proving that I didn’t reallybelieve what I had been saying for five years—that I was just pretending tobelieve it. They certainly got a lot of information about my beliefs, includingdozens of letters I had sent to government officials, in addition to my video,my “Taxable Income” report, and around ten thousand private e-mails. Guess howmany of those e-mails showed that I don’t really believe in all this 861 stuff.Zero. And, due to the element of “willfulness,” if I believe I don’t owe thetax, there is no crime, whether I’m right or not. The IRS bureaucrats can try tocollect if they think I’m wrong, but the criminal tax statutes are not supposedto be used to punish people for having a “frank difference of opinion” about theapplication of the tax laws. So said the Supreme Court in the case of Spies v.United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943).MODERN-DAY BOOK BURNING“What distinguishes a democratic state from a totalitarian one is the freedom tospeak and criticize the government and its various agencies without fear ofgovernment retaliation.” [Wichert v. Walter et al., 606 F Supp 1516 (3rd cir)]Well then, I guess it’s obvious which kind of government we have. The nextsentence from the ruling in that case said this: “It is difficult to envisionany right more fundamental to the establishment and continuation of a freesociety.” Amen.When “law enforcement” officers do something, most people like to assume that itprobably has a legal basis. The very label “authority” implies that what they dois legal and proper. Because of that, it’s difficult for me to fully convey howlegally (not to mention morally) bogus it was for IRS agents to come to my houseand forcibly steal every copy they could find of my video, my written report,and even a box of www.Theft-by-Deception.com” bumper stickers. Was there somedispute over the legality of any of that stuff? Nope. Not a bit. The governmenthas never alleged that the video is itself illegal. Nonetheless, when I askedDonald Pearlman (head IRS thug at the raid) when I would get my videos back, hesaid never. What about when the investigation is over? Nope, not then either, hesaid. He said those things while still at my house, during the raid,demonstrating that he showed up with the premeditated plan of taking every copyhe could find of a perfectly legal video, with the intention of never returningthem.Soon after the raid, I sent Stormtrooper Pearlman a letter, pointing out thatthe Supreme Court says that it’s illegal to do what the IRS had done: swiping abunch of videos or books under the guise of searching for “evidence.” As you’llsee below, their own sworn affidavit acknowledged that they already had thevideo, because I had previously given it to them voluntarily. So they didn’teven need to take one, much less entire cases of them. But despite the fact thatI provided Agent Pearlman with Supreme Court citations proving that he broke thelaw by swiping the videos, in a subsequent phone call he again said that thevideos would never be returned, even after the case was over.(Almost two years later they did return the videos and “Taxable Income” reports,shortly before my trial, probably at the suggestion of some government lawyerwith enough brain cells to realize how utterly, indisputably, blatantly illegalit was for them to take them in the first place. The videos were stillshrink-wrapped, and many were still in the unopened cases the factory sends themout in. When they were sent back to me, there was no letter with them, so atfirst I thought they were just cases from the factory, until I noticed the DOJreturn address. They also returned the “Theft-by-Deception.com” bumper stickers.After two years of storage in who-knows-where, I couldn’t in good consciencesell the VHS tapes anymore, not knowing whether they would still play properly.So instead, I sold them for $40 each as censorship souvenirs, and gave allproceeds to the 861 Evidence mini-CD project, described below.)“The use by government of the power of search and seizure as an adjunct to asystem for the suppression of objectionable publications is not new. ... TheBill of Rights was fashioned against the background of knowledge thatunrestricted power of search and seizure could also be an instrument forstifling liberty of expression.” [Marcus v. Search Warrant, 367 U.S. 717 (1961)]Yep, it sure can be used for that.Let’s review. I made a video accusing the government of wrongdoing—precisely thetype of “speech” that the First Amendment was specifically intended toprotect—and the IRS barged into my home and stole every copy of that video thatthey could find, with the admitted intention of never returning them. You cantry all you want to come up with some legal, logical, or moral justification fortheir actions, but you will fail. Or, instead, you can face the obvious factthat we now live under a police state which has no qualms about forciblysilencing opinions it doesn’t like. The IRS, the Department of Justice, and two“judges” gave their blessing to what was the equivalent of a modern-day bookburning. It was censorship, plain and simple.Incidentally, if you’re thinking, “Well, if your legal conclusions are wrong,you shouldn’t be allowed to speak them”—first of all, you’re a fascist; second,the Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear that whether an idea is incorrector unpopular has absolutely no bearing upon one’s right to express it ( NAACP v.Button, 371 U.S. 415 (1963)). Incidentally, after the raid we contacted both theleft-leaning ACLU (at its Texas, Pennsylvania, and national offices) and thesupposedly libertarian-leaning “Institute for Justice,” but neither would lift afinger to help us fight the modern-day book burning the IRS had carried out.So it wasn’t enough for the government to ridicule and threaten thousands ofAmericans who had started asking questions about the law, and it wasn’t enoughfor them to insult and vilify me and others for reaching legal conclusions theydidn’t like. They were no longer content to merely publicly slander and demonizeus; too many people were being exposed to the truth, so the government haddecided it was time to forcibly silence us.But we wouldn’t shut up.THE MINI-CDSome people like to actually understand things, but most are content to merelybelieve things. The Theft by Deception video was (and is) helpful for thosewilling to put in some mental effort to examine the evidence, but in ourten-second sound bite culture, most people (we soon realized) would never investthe time and thought it takes to really grasp the substance of the issue. Theywouldn’t watch an 88-minute video, much less read a sixty-page legal report.Eventually I and some of my fellow conspirators (us nasty folk who like to tellpeople when they’re being robbed) came to the depressing conclusion that to getthe message out to the general public, we needed to use a lot less evidence andlogic and a lot more snazziness and salesmanship. We needed a way to explain theissue to those people who don’t really want to have to think about stuff (youknow who you are), and we needed it to be easy to distribute far and wide.Shortly after my home was raided, the idea of making a “mini-CD” slowly startedto come together. (A mini-CD is one of those spiffy little miniature compactdisks that works in almost all computers, though many people don’t know it.) Theplanning and production of the presentation ended up being a fairly haphazardimprovised rush job, done by several people who had never met each other, andwho for the most part didn’t entirely know what they were doing (including me).Nonetheless, I’m still pleased with the outcome, the quality of which in largepart came from the fact that I’m not the one who put it together.The presentation ended up being just under an hour long (which was still pushingour luck with the attention span of the average American) and included thebasics of the legal issue, but also included interviews with various people,information about our letter-writing campaigns, the government’sless-than-polite tactics, etc.In addition to trying to deal with the very limited attention span of a lot ofpeople, we also kept in mind the expert-worship mentality that so many peopleseem to have. Since credentials apparently carry more weight than actualevidence and logic, at least in a lot of people’s eyes, we included a heapingdose of credentials. By that time, more than a few CPAs and attorneys had comeout and publicly agreed with the 861 evidence, including a few who used to workfor the IRS and DOJ.There was Sherry Peel Jackson, a feisty former IRS Revenue Agent who has gone togreat lengths to try to combat the lawlessness and lies of the IRS. (As aresult, she too has been subjected to the harassment, intimidation, andpersecution tactics of our beloved federal government, including having her homeinvaded by armed IRS thugs in July of 2004.)There was Joseph Banister, a former IRS Special Agent for the CriminalInvestigation Division of the IRS, who has also been very vocal about the IRS’sdisregard for the law. (Mr. Banister was fired from the IRS—or told to resign,which amounts to the same thing—for asking some of his superiors to answer someof the questions the so-called “tax protestors” were asking, though they weren’tspecifically about 861.) He was so vocal, in fact, that the federal governmentprosecuted him in an attempt to silence him. I’m happy—if slightly envious—toreport that in June of 2005, the day before my 37th birthday, a thoughtful juryfound Mr. Banister “not guilty” on all of the bogus charges thrown at him.There was Terry Croghan, a former federal prosecutor, who was nice enough toappear in the presentation despite the government’s nasty habit of terrorizinganyone with credentials, especially former government folk, who dares to say“861” in public.There was Robert Lock, an experienced attorney who had helped to writelegislation (relating to telecommunications laws), and who therefore knew morethan a little about how law works, and how it is to be read and understood.And there were several other individuals such as John Green, who were veteranattorneys as well as very principled individuals. (Imagine someone being both ofthose things at the same time.) There were quite a few others who, if they arereading this, are probably hoping I don’t mention their names, lest they be thenext to incur the wrath of the federal leviathan. (Actually, everyone in thepresentation had his or her face and name there for all to see, so none of themare cowards by any stretch of the imagination.)It took a lot of work and a lot of organization, mostly from a few fairlydisorganized people (including me), to put the whole “861 Evidence” mini-CDproject together. But we intended to make obscene profits from the results, soit was worth it.Just kidding. Actually, it was a non-profit endeavor from the beginning. Thegoal was to mass-produce the disks, and then sell them in bulk at cost for lessthan twenty cents apiece. And that’s just what we did.A lot of people, whom I can’t thank enough, donated money for the productioncosts. And then, when the disk was released in April of 2004, a lot of peopledonated even more time, effort and money to get it distributed. At this point,somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 copies of the mini-CD are in circulation.Or maybe they’re in garbage cans; it’s hard to know which.In addition to spreading the little disks around, we made the entirepresentation downloadable and viewable on the internet at “www.861.info,” andmany thousands of people viewed it online. (What might be on that web site, ifanything, by the time you read this, I have no idea, for reasons which willbecome apparent shortly.)PROSECUTING THE INNOCENTSo we were getting the word out, by way of my “Taxable Income” report, my Theftby Deception video, the “861 Evidence” mini-CDs, and several web sites. (Afterthe www.taxableincome.net, www.theft-by-deception.com and www.861.info sites, wemade www.861evidence.com, the main purpose of which was to have a place wherepeople could download scans of all the older tax statutes and regulations notavailable elsewhere online.) Tens of thousands of people—if not hundreds ofthousands—were out there talking about the issue. Meanwhile, the government wastrying to come up with some way to keep the issue quiet.As you digest the rest of this story, an important question to keep in mind isthis: Did those in government at least think I had broken the law? It goeswithout saying that trying to put someone in prison for a crime the prosecutionknows the defendant did not commit is both illegal and profoundly evil. In fact,trying to imprison someone for exercising his First Amendment rights is actuallya crime in itself (see 18 USC § 241). So, is there any way that the prosecutorsin my case at least thought they were going after a criminal? Is there any waythey could have had legitimate and legal motives for prosecuting me?Remember, because of the issue of “willfulness,” as long as I did what Ibelieved the law required—even if my beliefs were wrong, unpopular, orunreasonable—then no crime was committed. So, did the feds have some reason tothink that I was lying about my beliefs, in all those dozens of letters I sentthem, explaining in great detail my legal conclusions? Or did they know fullwell that I was doing what I believed to be legal and proper, but chose toprosecute me anyway, for a crime they knew I hadn’t committed? The evidenceshows that whether or not I was guilty of any crime didn’t matter to them in theslightest; their goal was to shut me up using any means necessary.Don’t believe me? Consider this: When the IRS raided my home and the home of Dr.Clayton, they stole every copy they could find of my Theft by Deception video.When Dr. Clayton called the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ to complain aboutthe blatant violation of our First Amendment rights, he got a very interestingresponse. The DOJ attorney he talked to said that Dr. Clayton could file acomplaint if he wanted, but it probably wouldn’t go anywhere. Why not? Because,the government lawyer replied, it would be a “conflict of interests.” How so?Because, according to the attorney working for the Civil Rights Division, theDepartment of Justice was trying to “stop the distribution” of our perfectlylegal video. Remember, they have never alleged that the video itself is illegal,yet there was the “civil rights” branch of the DOJ (how ironic is that?) openlyadmitting that the DOJ was trying to suppress the video.Talk about the fox guarding the hen house. The “Civil Rights” division of theDOJ is the one with jurisdiction over 18 USC § 241, which makes it a crime forgovernment agents to “oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State... in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to himby the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having soexercised the same.” When the IRS and Tax Division of the DOJ did exactly that,the “Civil Rights” phonies just looked the other way.And if the DOJ attorney who just happened to take Dr. Clayton’s call justhappened to know off the top of his head that the DOJ was trying to silence thevideo, you can bet that a lot of DOJ folk, all the way up to the AttorneyGeneral, Führer Ashcroft, knew of, approved of, and participated in thisblatantly illegal attempt to crush free speech. Who cares about the law? Whocares whether the troublemakers broke any law? There is power at stake! Lock upthe dissenters! Crush the resistance!It should be mentioned that the IRS isn’t exactly subtle about its terroristtechniques. At one press conference, an IRS spokesman (Terry Lemmons) was askedabout a bunch of people protesting outside, objecting to the government’sfailure to answer various questions about the tax laws (including 861, amongothers). Mr. Lemmons’ response was that the IRS was “answering” those questionsvia “enforcement actions.” In other words, fining or prosecuting people is howthe wonderful Internal Revenue Service deals with anyone who has questions aboutthe law.That was in keeping with the attitude of Mark Everson, the new IRS Commissioner,who publicly stated in October of 2003 that “effective enforcement of the taxlaws rather than further improving customer service” would be the main focus ofhis administration. Yeah, the heck with helping people understand and complywith the tax laws; it’s time to crush, kill, destroy! (When the fraud eventuallycollapses, I wonder what “enforcement actions” the victims of Mr. Everson’sGestapo will impose upon him.)“Service employees, in handling such matters in their official relations withtaxpayers or the public, will conduct themselves in a manner that will promotepublic confidence in themselves and the Service. Employees will be impartial andwill not use methods which are threatening or harassing in their dealings withthe public.” [IRM § 1.2.1.2.1]Yeah, right.HARASSMENTThere are many ways in which the government misuses its power in order tosilence opinions it doesn’t like. Overt censorship, like stealing videos, is oneway, but there are many more subtle ways in which the government creates whatthe courts call a “chilling effect” on freedom of speech, causing people tochoose not to speak their minds in order to avoid trouble. It’s indirectcensorship, and it’s just as unconstitutional as the direct kind. The fines andprosecutions are pretty obvious, but the feds also have the power and resourcesto engage in large-scale, prolonged harassment techniques, all disguised as “lawenforcement,” against anyone they don’t like.Granted, it’s sometimes hard to tell the difference between law enforcers justdoing an investigation, and government thugs intentionally engaging inintimidation tactics. It’s also true that most people who have run-ins with thecops complain that they are being “harassed.” So I’ll give you a few examples ofthe IRS’s methods of “investigating” me, and you can decide for yourself whatyou think their motives were. See if you think they were simply followingpossible leads to evidence of criminal conduct, or whether they were engaged ina giant fishing expedition and terrorism campaign.1) I happen to have a very generous relative who once loaned me and my wife asignificant chunk of money, interest-free, when we were having a tough timefinancially. For that good deed, she had two IRS goons show up at her houseunannounced, to question her about me. The two goons apparently had to driveseveral hours to get there, and yet they seemed to know almost nothing about thecase (and admitted as much). Did they have any reason to suspect somethingshady? Not at all. The relative loaned us money, and we paid it back, as shetold them. There was nothing even hinting at anything illegal, but that didn’tstop them from pestering her.2) I’ll let a message I sent to my e-mail list (in late March of 2004) describethe next example of IRS harassment.“Well, darn. My wife and I almost got away with it, but that oh-so-resourcefulfighter for truth and justice, Donald Pearlman (the same IRS agent who led thearmed invasion of our home last year) has just uncovered documents which showthat my wife and I are nasty, evil criminals. We had hoped they wouldn’t findthese documents, but alas, our nasty crime spree has come to an end. It turnsout that unbeknownst to any of you, last year my wife and I gave severalthousand dollars to a privately run orphanage in Nepal, which takes in abusedand abandoned children, and gives them a home, a family, and an education. (Itis run by people we know personally who went over to Nepal to do this.) Goodthing our valiant public servants are protecting all you good folks, byharassing people who run an orphanage in one of the poorest countries in theworld. I feel safer already. Don’t you? Someone has to uncover all the nastydeeds of the nefarious ‘tax scheme promoters,’ right?”The IRS called up the people who run the orphanage, demanding all the recordsthey had related to us. Why? How could us giving away money possibly be evidenceof a crime? It couldn’t, of course. But that didn’t stop the IRS from harassingthem.3) A cousin of mine ran a home-school type preschool/play group that ourdaughter attended for a while. Sounds criminal, huh? Well, that paragon ofvirtue, Special Agent Donald Pearlman, showed up at her house to interrogate herabout us. He asked her lots of questions about the preschool, when our daughterstarted attending, when she finished, etc.—all things that are none of hisbusiness, and which can’t possibly be evidence of any crime. But my cousinreported to me that Pearlman’s “questioning” of her was more like a lecture thanan investigation. He didn’t seem to be in search of any particular informationor evidence, but wanted to tell her that my legal conclusions are “fraudulent.”When Pearlman asked her if she knew that, she responded that she knew that theIRS thought my position was “fraudulent.” Then Agent Pearlman said he was“putting her on notice” that my legal conclusions are incorrect. Wow, how muchof a delusional nutcase does someone have to be to think that his unilateral,unsupported assertion would be legally binding on anyone, or persuade anyone?(Amusingly, when my cousin said that she thought that it might be educationalfor her own home-schooled kids to observe the IRS’s “investigation” techniques,Pearlman said he’d prefer they didn’t. Gosh, Mr. Pearlman, what is it thatyou don’t want the youth of America to see?)4) Pearlman also made an unannounced visit to the home of friends of ours—amarried couple. The wife had worked as a typist for us years before. Whatimportant evidence was he after that time? Hard to say. He asked whether theyhad seen my video, and asked about the husband sending a copy of those peskyquestions to government officials. The husband responded that he didn’t think itwas illegal to ask the government questions. (Silly him.) The “interview” onceagain seemed entirely legally pointless, and again turned into an anti-melecture by Stormtrooper Pearlman. Of note, Agent Pearlman warned them, as hewould warn others, that I’m “very persuasive.” (Maybe that’s because I’m right,you fascist jackass.)5) The IRS thugs also showed up unannounced at the home of someone who didoccasional housework and baby-sitting for us. Since she wasn’t at home, theywent to her place of work (again, unannounced). What for? To ask her if she hadever been in our basement, and what she had seen there. Luckily she didn’tmention the meth lab and the human body parts. (For any federal employeesreading this, that was sarcasm.) She reported that she saw me working at acomputer. What a shocker.6) IRS thugs visited the home of another former typist and her husband, andagain lectured them about us and asked asinine questions about their working forus. Let’s see: IRS “Criminal Investigation Division” agents just showing up atall these places, without having any idea what evidence of a crime they werelooking for, but determined to inconvenience and harass all these people weknow, and tell them what awful people we are. Anything seem a little creepy toyou yet? Well, there’s more.7) The IRS also paid a visit to the home of yet another person who used to typefor us. In addition to wanting to go over every check we had every sent thetypist (hoping to find something suspicious, though I can’t imagine what), AgentPearlman asked the former typist if he ever hung out with me and my wife, andwhether he was aware of my “Taxable Income” report. Pearlman then asked theguy’s wife, whom we also know, if she had anything negative to say about us.(Too bad for Pearlman that the Berlin wall fell; otherwise he’d have a greatalternative career with the East German Stasi if the IRS gig falls apart.)Eventually the victims of this pointless harassment got tired of Führer Pearlmantrying to coerce them into saying something bad about us, and told him to getlost. (Interestingly, though none of the victims of the IRS harassment ever hadany legal obligation to say anything to the IRS inquisitors, this was the onlyinstance we know of where a victim of the harassment tactics actually cut theconversation short.)8) IRS thugs showed up at the medical practice we performed medicaltranscription services for, and interrogated the office manager there. Um, why?Everything they paid us was reported, and we had already told the IRS—in writingand in person—what we did, and what we got paid, and by whom. What criminalevidence were they looking for? None. They just wanted to harass our businessassociates.9) IRS thugs also called the people who managed the estate of my wife’s father.They wanted all the records related to a trust, for which Tessa was abeneficiary. We didn’t own the trust, control the trust, or ever put money intothe trust, and the trust had always paid its (supposed) taxes. So what was thepoint? Harassment.10) In late April of 2004, two IRS CID thugs showed up at the Kansas Cityuniversity at which Peter McCandless teaches, to ask him about the post officebox we used there for “861 Evidence” mini-CD orders, and to ask Peter what hethought my “motivation” was for what I was doing. Peter told them my motive wasspreading the truth. I don’t think they liked that. So, what was the supposedcriminal act they were “investigating”? Speaking my mind? When the IRS thugswere done with their lecture/harassment/interrogation, Peter asked them if theyhad ever read Section 861 or the related regulations. They said they werefamiliar with the issue, which isn’t what he asked. So he asked again. This timethey confessed: No, they had never read that part of the law. Figures.11) The IRS/CID called and then visited a lawyer who happened to be the fatherof a friend of mine who was also vocal about the 861 issue. Why? They wanted toask the father if he had ever seen my video, and if he knew anything about atalk I had given on the subject six years before. He hadn’t, and he didn’t, buthow would either of those be evidence of a crime anyway?12) In April of 2004, the same IRS bonehead who was investigating mynon-existent “abusive tax shelter” sent PayPal a summons, demanding all therecords of anyone who donated to our non-profit 861 mini-CD project. Why? Whendid donating to a non-profit, perfectly legal endeavor warrant governmentnosiness and harassment?13) In July of 2004, the IRS thugs harassed and questioned the people whomaintain the web service business that hosts my e-mail list (the one I use tosend messages to thousands of subscribers). Why? What “crime” were theyinvestigating?Keep in mind that lots of people, if they received such unannounced visits fromIRS jackboots, wouldn’t say anything to us about it. So the incidents listedabove are just the ones we found out about (and not even all of those). I don’tknow how many others were harassed and didn’t tell us about it.In short, the feds harassed just about everyone they could find with anyconnection to me, without ever hinting at the existence of any actual evidenceof any actual crime. Don’t think for a moment they aren’t aware of, and don’tintend to cause, the natural effect of such tactics. They are designed to makepeople mad at us for causing them inconvenience, make people suspicious of us bypainting us as criminals, and so make people not want to do business with us orassociate with us. Just imagine if all of your friends and businessacquaintances started getting unexpected and unwanted visits from “criminalinvestigators” pretending to “investigate” you. Wouldn’t that be fun?And these harassment tactics kept going right up until the trial. In late Julyof 2005, we attempted to reduce the feds’ harassment and terrorization campaignby filing a motion to quash subpoenas issued to five people who had done workfor us and four people we had done work for. The federal rules say that a court“shall quash or modify the subpoena if it ... subjects a person to undueburden.” As our motion explained, trying to drag all these people into court totestify about things we had freely admitted, such as the nature of our business,amount of our income, etc., was nothing more than a harassment technique. Theirown subpoenas cited testimony about “income evidence” and “the operation ofdefendants’ medical transcription business”—which was all an open book—as thereason for dragging in people who had typed for us. Likewise, they wanted toharass our clients and drag them into court to testify about “income evidence,”despite the fact that we had stipulated to the accuracy of all of theincome-related documents they wanted to present. They even wanted to drag in anold friend of Tessa’s, for the express purpose of authenticating a letter thatshe had already stipulated was authentic. Obviously all of their subpoenas wereintended to harass our friends and business acquaintances—a tactic the IRSroutinely uses on its enemies, to try to embarrass them and put them out ofbusiness.At one point, after Tessa and I had stipulated to the authenticity of all of thegovernment’s proposed exhibits for my trial, while refusing to stipulate thatthey were admissible, the lead prosecutor on the case, Floyd Miller, told me tomy face that if we did not stipulate to their admissibility, he would proceed toissue the twenty or so subpoenas in retaliation. The only thing the witnesseswould be for was to testify that documents were what they appeared to be, whichwe had already stipulated. Whether such documents are admissible at trial, i.e.,whether they are legally relevant to the case, is something the court decides.Amusingly, twice the judge had to explain to Mr. Miller that stipulating to theauthenticity of something—which we willingly did for all of their exhibits—wasnot at all the same as stipulating that something is relevant and admissible attrial. In our stipulation letter, we even made it a point to say this: “Ofcourse, the stipulation of the above facts will not constitute an agreement thatany such documents are relevant or should be admitted at trial.”Mr. Miller was clearly trying to bully us into giving him permission tointroduce all sorts of irrelevant garbage into the trial, by threatening toneedlessly subpoena over twenty of our friends and business acquaintances. Slimybastard. So we asked the court to sanction him for it. Since the motive for thesubpoenas was so obviously illegitimate and malicious, in the motion we pointedout that, according to the rules, anyone requesting a subpoena “shall takereasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subjectto that subpoena,” and that the court has the authority to impose sanctions onanyone who fails to take such steps, which is just what I requested: sanctionsagainst Floyd Miller for imposing an undue burden on all those people.A hearing was held about our motion, and Judge Michael Baylson said that hewasn’t going to impose sanctions at that time, because there hadn’t yet been aburden on anyone. He added, however, that if Mr. Miller did pull people intocourt only to testify about matters already stipulated, he would reconsider. Iguess Mr. Miller got the message, since in the end they didn’t call any typists,and only one business associate, to testify (though even that was unnecessary).But that didn’t stop all those people from getting the subpoenas, though in theend they weren’t required to appear in court.Of course, for all the stress and inconvenience they imposed upon numerousfriends and acquaintances of ours, there were never any adverse consequences foranyone at the DOJ or IRS. They know they can act like Mafia thugs and get awaywith it, and they know the fear, stress, and inconvenience it causes. That’s whythey do it.SCARE TACTICSAs should be obvious by now, neither the IRS nor the DOJ gives a rodent’sbuttocks about “enforcement of the tax laws.” They are interested only incoercing people into giving them lots of money, whether they owe it or not. If“law enforcement” was their actual goal, their enforcers would know what the lawsays, and would be eager and willing to tell the public what the law means,neither of which is the case. They are no more “law enforcers” than the thugswho smash kneecaps for the Mafia. They are extortionists and thieves, and thefact that they wear suits and put up a façade of being “legal” does not changethat. People who have not been the targets of the lawlessness of the federaleshave a hard time believing this; they want to believe that “law enforcers” justenforce the law. Those of us who have met the beast face to face knowbetter. Fear is their bread and butter; intimidation and terrorism are what theydo.The feds particularly like high-profile cases with lots of publicity—as long asthey win. So they target lawyers, doctors, and whenever possible, famous folk(like Willie Nelson and Leona Helmsley). As of the time of this writing, theyare going after Hollywood actor Wesley Snipes (star of the Blade series,Undisputed, U.S. Marshals, and about a zillion other movies). Mr. Snipes filedclaims for huge refunds—which he never received—based upon the 861 evidence, sothe feds would really love to make an example of him, dishonestly characterizingthose self-explanatory amended returns as “false claims” against the U.S. (Themedia assisted in the slander, saying that Mr. Snipes was being charged with“tax evasion” and “tax fraud,” neither of which was true.) However, the feds’method of public terrorism occasionally backfires.When they went after Vernice Kuglin, a FedEx pilot who had stopped filing (forreasons not specifically related to 861), they bit off more than they couldchew. In August of 2003, Ms. Kuglin was acquitted of all charges, and afterwardthe story hit the mainstream media. Not surprisingly, for the most part thewell-indoctrinated mainstream “reporters,” including the supposedly conservativeSean Hannity, did little more than bash Ms. Kuglin as an unpatriotic tax cheat,without bothering to find out the true story.The government, by way of the lazy mainstream media, loves to make a big showwhen it convicts someone, but when someone is acquitted—such as those mentionedabove, as well as Lloyd Long and “Whitey” Harrell—the media usually does anexceptionally bad job of reporting it. And, of course, the real reason the fedswere prosecuting me was to have another trophy head mounted on their wall, toscare away anyone else who might otherwise look into matters like the 861evidence.Last-Minute Addition: While this book was in the editing phase, the IRS and DOJlost another big one, when Louisiana attorney Tom Cryer was acquitted of willfulfailure to file. Mr. Cryer had relied upon the 861 evidence, in addition to someother issues. As of the date of this writing, the mainstream media had, for themost part, ignored the story entirely."},{"pageContent":"PART IV:THE WITCH HUNT BEGINSTHE NOT-SO-GRAND JURYBefore the government can put someone on trial, it must first (with someexceptions) get a grand jury to sign off on an “indictment” (which, for somereason, is pronounced “in-dite-ment”). In theory, requiring the government toget a grand jury indictment before prosecuting someone is supposed to determalicious or vindictive prosecutions. The Supreme Court says that, in additionto determining whether there is “probable cause” to think a crime has beencommitted, a grand jury is also supposed to act as the “protector of citizensagainst arbitrary and oppressive governmental action” ( U.S. v. Calandra, 414U.S. 338 (1974)), and to prevent prosecutions which are “dictated by anintimidating power or by malice and personal ill will” ( Wood v. Georgia, 370U.S. 375 (1962)). In reality, however, since the grand jurors almost always seeonly what the prosecution wants them to see, they do little or nothing toprotect anyone from malicious prosecution. In fact, prosecutors have hijackedthe process and converted it into an extra power for themselves, since the grandjury has the power to issue subpoenas and summonses, which the prosecution caneasily persuade them to do, in cases where a government subpoena or summonscould more easily be challenged.These days a federal grand jury “investigation” consists of prosecutors showingthe grand jurors (16 to 23 of them) whatever evidence the government wants toshow, while leaving out whatever it wants to leave out, all behind closed doors,without anyone associated with the defendant present, and with all of therecords and transcripts usually kept secret. No judge is present, and in mostcases the target of the “investigation” doesn’t even know he’s beinginvestigated. I found out I was under investigation only because I happened tofile a FOIA (Freedom Of Information Act) request at the right time, bycoincidence. The government would never have told me otherwise.To be blunt, most modern grand juries just serve as “rubber stamps” for theprosecutors. All the advantages are in the government’s favor. In addition tothose mentioned above, getting an indictment does not require the grand jury toconclude “beyond a reasonable doubt” that someone committed a crime (as a trialjury must); they just need to find “probable cause” that a crime was committed.Also unlike a jury trial, a grand jury does not need to be unanimous in itsdecision; just over half of the grand jurors can vote to issue an indictment.With that in mind, maybe you can understand why there is a saying that, if itwants to, the government can indict a ham sandwich. (No doubt if a ham sandwichwere unfortunate enough to have “861” written on it, it would be indicted,convicted, and burned at the stake.) My wife and I managed to make things alittle more difficult for the federal persecutors, however. Having learned thata grand jury was “investigating” me, I asked to be allowed to speak to it. (Tosay the grand jurors were “investigating” anything is a joke; they did nothingmore than sit around listening to government lawyers and IRS agents lying tothem.) After sending the government several letters asking if I could speak tothe grand jury, the lead prosecutor in the case, Floyd Miller, said I would beallowed to do that at the “appropriate” time—which I later learned meant “afterwe’ve been vilifying you in front of them for over a year.”(I must confess that Mr. Miller very likely could have prevented me from talkingto the grand jury at all, even though that would be against normal DOJ policyonce someone has asked to do so. For some reason I don’t think Mr. Miller let medo it out of the kindness of his heart.)The first time I thought that my wife and I might meet the grand jury was whenTessa received a subpoena, ordering her to “appear before the grand jury” inearly May of 2004, to give a handwriting sample (apparently to compare withsomething else she had written). Silly us, we thought appearing before the grandjury would involve being in the same room with them, so we prepared a fewcomments. Nope. “Appearing before the grand jury” actually meant sitting in aroom by herself, scribbling page after page of nothing.In fact, Tessa came close to walking out when the feds refused to give her eventhree minutes before the grand jury. Curiously, Mr. Miller at first denied thatthe subpoena said that she was to appear “before the grand jury,” even though wehad the subpoena right there, and it said exactly that. Eventually she decidedto just get it over with, after Miller threatened to request that the judge findher in “contempt of court” for refusing to give a handwriting sample. Of course,that’s not what we were doing; we were asking to see the grand jury as thesubpoena told us to. Mr. Miller responded that the grand jury was not going tosit there “while she writes her name twenty times.” Well, that’s not exactlywhat they made her do. They made her sit in a room by herself for a couple ofhours, making her handwrite forty-two pages of stuff, which she afterwardaccurately described as physical torture.The following week I got to do it too, sitting in a room by myself for hours,getting writer’s cramp scribbling out dozens of pages of nonsense. I laterrealized that this was all about a few words I had written before, which, hadthey thought to ask, I would gladly have admitted I had written. So the wholeepisode was mostly just another harassment tactic.However, while there, I took the opportunity to hand-deliver to Floyd Miller,the federal prosecutor in charge of vilifying—I mean “investigating”—us, thefollowing letter:May 11, 2004Mr. Floyd Miller (Assistant U.S. Attorney)15 Chestnut Street, Suite 1250Philadelphia, PA 19106Dear Mr. Miller,In light of your actions against myself and my wife, I would like to once againgive the government a chance to be open, honest and rational. It is clear thatthe government’s displeasure with me stems from the fact that based on my ownresearch, I have found that if I determine my taxable income (for federal incometax purposes) the way the law requires me to, my income does not show up astaxable, contrary to popular opinion. (Mostly the government is annoyed that Idared to publicly express that conclusion.) Clearly you believe that I amdetermining my taxable income incorrectly. I know several thousand people whowould like to avoid having their homes invaded, their friends and acquaintancesharassed, and the government trying to put them in cages, but who nonethelesshave reasonable questions about how they should determine what (if anything)they owe. As a public service, I would be happy to tell them how you believethey should determine their taxable income, so they might personally avoid suchan intimidation/harassment campaign as you’ve waged against myself and my wife.Please provide me with direct, written answers to the six enclosed questions(including any elaboration you deem necessary), and I will post your answers onmy web site (www.taxableincome.net). If my conclusions are in error, as you seemto think, what could be better for you than a chance to have me forward youranswers (unedited and in their entirety) to the people interested in the issue?That way you could “straighten out” the thousands of people currentlyresearching what you call my “tax fraud scheme.”When I gave the same opportunity to the IRS Commissioner and the Secretary ofthe Treasury, they failed to answer the questions, and instead sent outthousands of form letters insulting and threatening the people who had asked thequestions. When I (and others) sent the questions to your boss, Patrick Meehan(U.S. Attorney), he refused to answer. You have since tried to characterize mysuggestions that people ask the government how to determine what they owe as anattempt to interfere with the administration of the tax laws. (Frankly, that isinsane.)If you’re qualified to investigate alleged violations of the tax laws, surelyyou are capable of telling people how to obey the law. If even now you cannotexplain how I should have determined my taxable income, it might look to somelike you are nothing more than a hired thug, sent to punish me for speaking mymind, rather than someone involved in a legitimate investigation. You wouldn’twant people getting that impression, would you?Sincerely,Larken Rose[home address redacted]Enc: Questions Regarding Determining Taxable IncomeYou get one guess as to whether he ever responded in any way.Several times on the day that I did the silly handwriting exemplar routine, Mr.Miller suggested that I should seek counsel (have an attorney represent me). Nodoubt he would have much preferred to deal with some system-worshiping lawyerthan with me. Too bad.I also pointed out to Mr. Miller that it was up to the grand jury, not him, todecide what evidence to hear, and when. He insisted that that was not the case;that it was totally up to him when we would be allowed to speak to them. TheSupreme Court, however, says that the grand jury “may determine alone the courseof its inquiry” and “may compel the production of evidence or the testimony ofwitnesses as it considers appropriate” ( United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338(1974)). And in Hale v. Henkel (201 U.S. 43 (1906)), the Supreme Court disagreedwith the idea that “grand juries are confined, in their inquiries, to the billsoffered to them, to the crimes given them in charge, and to the evidence broughtbefore them by the prosecutor.” But hey, who cares what the law says when thereare troublemakers to silence; right, Mr. Miller?MY VISIT WITH THE GRAND JURYMany weeks later, over a year since I started asking to talk to the grand jury,I was finally allowed to do so. In preparation, I put together twenty-threeidentical folders, one for each grand juror, containing various citations oflaw, copies of correspondence I had sent to the government, a copy of my Theftby Deception video (on DVD), and a copy of the 861 Evidence mini-CD. I wasallowed to give them the folders, though whether any of them ever actuallylooked at any of the contents, I don’t know. When Tessa later had her chance totalk to them, the comments and questions of the grand jurors implied that theyhadn’t looked at any of it. Thanks, guys, for doing such a swell job ofprotecting the citizenry from over-zealous, lawless prosecutors.Each of the folders I gave them contained, in addition to the things mentionedbefore, a copy of a letter from Sherry Peel Jackson, CPA and former IRS RevenueAgent, which she had written to me for the express purpose of forwarding to thegrand jury, to show that there are tax professionals who agree with myconclusions. Her letter began with her credentials, showing that she was a CPA,a CFE (Certified Fraud Examiner), and a former IRS Revenue Agent who hadreceived numerous awards, including one from the IRS Commissioner himself, forher work at the IRS.She then described her own journey that brought her into the realm of unorthodoxtax “theories,” eventually leading to the 861 evidence. Her 134 researcheventually led her “to understand that the salaries and wages of most Americansis not taxable, and what is taxable is income from engaging in commerce withother countries.” Sound familiar? She stated that she was “very impressed” by myresearch, and the fact that even though I “do not even have a business degree,”I “tore the IRC [Internal Revenue Code] apart and logically made sense of that‘mound of mass confusion’, ” adding that my “efforts to show the correct andlogical flow of the evidence, from the beginning through the changes, aresuperb.” (Sorry if this sounds like bragging, but I’m just quoting what shewrote for the grand jury to read.) She further agreed with my conclusions thatthe changes which have occurred to certain sections of the law over the yearsdemonstrate “a deliberate attempt by someone or some group to make mostAmericans believe that they are liable to pay the federal income tax,” when inreality they are not.Her letter went on to say that she had become skeptical of people’s motives, butafter meeting me and talking to me, she found my motives “to be as pure as [my]research,” saying that she saw me as a “seeker of truth,” like herself. She thendiscussed the government’s extremely curious inability or unwillingness toanswer perfectly reasonable questions about the tax laws, which were being askedby so many Americans: “The government’s refusal to answer these questions speakslouder than the church bell rings on Sunday.” Her letter also included this:“Most of the rank and file IRS employees don’t know anything beyond IRC Section61, and when I have attempted to talk to my former co-workers about it, theyhave stated that they were not allowed to discuss these things with me, norcould they accept any questions or inquiries about anything questioning theincome tax. This is another sad state of affairs—people can’t talk freely aboutwhat should be their job.”Each folder for each of the 23 grand jurors also contained a copy of a letterfrom Terrill Croghan, attorney and former federal prosecutor, also sent to mefor the express purpose of being forwarded on to the grand jury. In it, Mr.Croghan spoke of his recent research into federal tax laws, and explained that,up until recently (long after working for the DOJ), his “knowledge about theactual wording and meaning of this body of law was, I am embarrassed to admit,superficial and based solely upon assumption and what I’d been ‘told’ the lawsaid and meant.” He reviewed many theories which left him “less than satisfied,simply because they didn’t address what the law actually said, or meant,” butinstead just “protested its existence” or were the result of “questionable legalanalysis.” (Sounds a lot like the beginning of my own journey.) Then, his letterexplained, he came across my “Taxable Income” report. And, just as I had been,he was initially very skeptical about the idea, based on his past experiencewith anti-tax “theories.”He added that since I’m not a lawyer, he wasn’t very hopeful that he could“learn anything of value or substance about the tax law” from my report. Afterreading my report, however, he decided that he “had been very wrong about that.”He read the report looking for “analytical weaknesses or deficient logic,” andfound none. “The deeper my analysis of the law became, the more I becameconvinced that the conclusions expressed in Mr. Rose’s report were correct.” Hedescribed his own fruitless attempts to get a half-decent rebuttal from those ingovernment, and how, because of their utter failure to give any real refutationof the issue, he became “more and more convinced there must be none thatexists.”Interestingly, Floyd Miller, in front of the grand jury, then implied that Mr.Croghan had never actually worked for the DOJ, which in turn implied either thatI was lying or that I had been tricked by someone pretending to be a formerfederal prosecutor. Mr. Miller explained how he had done a search for Mr.Croghan’s name, and had come up with nothing. That’s not surprising, since hespelled Mr. Croghan’s name incorrectly. Nonetheless, since he had made theinsinuation, very soon after that, and at my request, Mr. Croghan sent a rundownof his credentials and history, giving the name of a sitting federal judge whomMr. Miller could contact if he wished to verify Mr. Croghan’s previousemployment at the DOJ. When Tessa later appeared before the grand jury, she gavethat document to Mr. Miller, in front of the grand jury.In addition to giving each of the grand jurors a folder of the preparedmaterials, I also wanted to give them a brief overview of my case in person.Once I was sworn in, Mr. Miller said he would let me have fifteen or twentyminutes to talk. I hate to bring up the law again, but legally he has no saywhatsoever in what the grand jury chooses to hear. Nonetheless, expecting thistactic, and taking into account the ten-second attention span of the averageAmerican, I had planned to keep it short anyway.I gave a quick overview of the basic facts, gave a quick lesson on what“willfulness” means, and spoke briefly about how one of the main functions of agrand jury is to prevent government misconduct—a concept I suspect Mr. Millerfailed to tell them about. After that, I spent a couple of hours answeringquestions from the grand jurors and from Mr. Miller. It was very interesting toobserve a group of people who had been regularly exposed to an ongoingdemonization of me for over a year. The government’s lies seemed to have donethe trick, at least on many of the grand jurors.Of particular note were two perpetually grouchy middle-aged women who my wifeand I thereafter referred to as the “wicked witches.” They were an interestingcombination of clueless, bitter, and judgmental. Here is what one of them saidto me:“Mr. Rose, I think your interpretation of the law is totally irrelevant. I don’tcare what your interpretation is. As an academic exercise, that’s fine. You havea right to think what you want. It’s putting your—having the arrogance to actupon your interpretation. If everyone in the country interpreted the laws andacted upon those interpretations, that’s the definition of anarchy.”Wow. What an interesting (and delusional) attitude. Incidentally, whilst foamingat the mouth with her righteous indignation at the diabolical nonconformist(me), she apparently failed to realize that if I believed I had no taxableincome, as she seemed to concede, then it’s impossible for me to have committedany of the crimes alleged, because of the “willfulness” element. But littlethings like law and logic weren’t about to get in the way of this witch-ledwitch hunt. She also wasn’t satisfied when I pointed out that it’s a crime forany person to sign a return which he doesn’t personally believe to beaccurate—i.e., which doesn’t coincide with his own understanding of what the lawrequires.At one point the other wicked witch commented that it was up to “the courts,”not to me, to “interpret” the law. (Later I’ll have a few words to say about themisuse of the term “interpret.”) Oddly, when I then quoted the Supreme Court(from United States v. Correll, 389 U.S. 299 (1967)) saying that it is primarilythe job of the regulation-writers, and not the courts, to administer andinterpret the tax laws, she didn’t want to hear about it. So apparently, in herview, the hierarchy of legal authority has me at the bottom, the courts in themiddle, and her at the top—and the written law itself isn’t even in the picture.Ironically, I believe it was the same witch who, on another occasion, opinedthat even if my income wasn’t taxable, I still had to file returns. When Iquoted from memory the regulations saying the opposite, she used the preferreddebating method of grouchy witches the world over: scrunched up her face (evenbeyond its baseline degree of scrunchedness), looked down, and shook her head.So when I say that what the statutes and regulations say didn’t matter at all tothe witches, I’m not kidding.Curiously, the witch sitting more or less in front of me, while asking mequestions, kept turning all the way to her right to face Mr. Miller, as ifseeking his approval, hinting at what a fine, independent, objectiveinvestigation these people had done. At another point, one of the witches alsosaid, in a tone that made it quite clear that it was supposed to be an insult,that I was a very “complicated” person. (I’ll try to be more of a simpleton nexttime, to please the wicked witch contingent.)I have no doubt that many of the comments from the grand jurors were simplyechoes of the lies Mr. Miller had been drilling into their heads for so manymonths. To wit, in his closing arguments at my trial, Floyd Miller repeatedalmost verbatim the line quoted above, about how each person interpreting thelaw for himself is the definition of “anarchy.” Well, now I know where the witchgot that goofy idea. She wasn’t even being original in her idiocy; she wasplagiarizing it.THE INQUISITIONWhat a prosecutor is supposed to do in front of a grand jury is presentevidence. He is not supposed to ramble on about his own opinions, and he is notsupposed to demean or vilify the accused. In fact, such behavior is oftengrounds for having an indictment thrown out by the courts. (One court threw outan indictment because the prosecutors engaged in “unrestrained, abusivehistrionics, giving their personal evaluations of what a low-down fellow thedefendant really is” in front of the grand jury.) Nonetheless, even when I wasthere, Mr. Miller was in full demonization mode, openly accusing me (without ashred of evidence) of doing what I did just for monetary gain, not for any“patriotic” reason. For all the days I wasn’t there, when the proceedings wereheld in secret, I can only imagine how Mr. Miller characterized me.One thing I am sure of is that Mr. Miller was not exposing the grand jury to therelevant evidence, such as my meetings with the IRS, my letters to the IRS, myvideo and my report, etc. How do I know this? Because when I was there, one ofthe grand jurors asked me to summarize my legal position. He was not asking fora lot of details; he just wanted the general idea. How on earth could this groupof people have been “investigating” my case for over a year and still not knoweven the general gist of my legal position? Answer: the prosecutors carefullyavoided dealing with the real issue (which Mr. Miller continued to do while Iwas there), and instead spent the time drilling into the grand jurors’ headsthat I am a nasty, greedy, unpatriotic, scheming villain.Even in legal filings, the prosecution made a habit of referring to my legalconclusions as a “scheme” or a “fraud,” implying that I was doing somethingdeceptive or dishonest instead of just stating what I believe. They had to usesuch slimy vilification rhetoric because to admit that I honestly believed myincome was not taxable would be to admit that I had committed no crime. And thatwouldn’t help the government’s inquisition-style, demonize-and-punish agenda.Floyd Miller even took the opportunity of my visit to the grand jury to try todemonize me some more. He brought up several private e-mails that the IRSacquired when they raided my home, and asked me about them. This is what hethought would make me look like a criminal:1) He brought up one e-mail (I don’t remember to whom) which I addressed: “Toanyone who is the enemy of my enemy.” Mr. Miller asked me who my “enemy” is, andI responded, “Those who try to defraud my fellow Americans.” In that e-mail Iexplained how I think that the overall “propaganda war” is what we should focuson, informing Americans of the truth until the fraud becomes unenforceable,rather than trying to find some procedural solution to make the IRS obey thelaw. I started to explain to the grand jury that, despite the usual negativeconnotation, the term “propaganda” does not mean only false information. Mr.Miller interrupted me, however, and moved on to another topic.2) He brought up another four-year-old e-mail in which I said that a few lowercourts were wrong in claiming that the “income tax” is a direct, unapportionedtax. Mr. Miller wanted to make a big deal out of the fact that a mere peasantlike me dared to say that a judge was wrong. So I pointed out that the SupremeCourt also disagreed with that lower court judge, and I quoted from memory thehigh court’s rulings from the Brushaber, Stanton, and Peck cases as examples.3) Mr. Miller brought up another e-mail I had sent to Dr. Clayton, in which Iwas telling him to take money from video sales out of our merchant account, tostart to pay him back for what he had put in. The message included this flippant“command”:“You will not argue with me on this one. I am the High Exalted Pain in the AssEmperor of Anarchy. I have spoken. As soon as the merchant account has the moneyin it to reimburse the copying and shipping costs for this 5000 [copies of thevideo] , TAKE IT.”I was wondering why Mr. Miller would bring that up. It was too bizarre for me toguess: he pointed out the phrase about me being the “High Exaulted Pain in theAss Emperor of Anarchy,” and asked me, with serious suspicion, what that phrasemeant. I could barely keep from laughing while explaining that it was sarcasm.(I hate to have to state the obvious here, but “Emperor of Anarchy” is acontradiction in terms. It’s called a joke. Maybe the feds should investigatethe concept.)So that was it. That was what was supposed to make the grand jury think I was acriminal. If you want an indication of just how non-existent their case againstme was, this was it: they had a chance to question me, under oath, without alawyer, in a setting where anything I said could be used in court, and that waswhat Mr. Miller asked me about. Incidentally, defense lawyers really don’t liketheir clients talking to grand juries, for that very reason: the government canquestion them and use their statements against them later. Guess how much ofwhat I said in front of the grand jury came up at trial? None of it.In the end, what most of the grand jurors were thinking—or whether they werethinking at all—was hard to tell. But two men, one being the grand jury foreman,seemed both attentive and thoughtful. Each of them, on separate occasions, madecomments along the lines of “you obviously believe in what you’re saying,” andsaid they sensed that I was both intelligent and well-informed on the subject.Once again, I’m not sure they were aware that if I “believed” I didn’t owe thetax, it was impossible for me to have committed any of the crimes beinginvestigated. Anyway, I said my piece, and left my freedom in their hands.TESSA VISITS THE GRAND JURYWeeks later, Tessa got her chance to speak to the grand jury, and her experiencewasn’t much different from my own. The following are some excerpts from hercomments to my e-mail list about the experience:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I explained what a willful tax crime is, and told them that the prosecutor mustshow evidence that I’m doing something other than what I believe the lawrequires. I explained why Miller’s attempt to paint Larken as doing all this formoney is ridiculous, not to mention irrelevant to the crime in question. Iexplained that an indictment would have a chilling effect on speech about thisissue and all speech criticizing the government.Some of the grand jurors obviously didn’t look at Larken’s stuff (he gave themDVDs of Theft by Deception and the 861 Evidence and some written material). Thisjust demonstrates that many of them are already so prejudiced they don’t evenwant to look at the other side. ...One dude said, “You have to pay your taxes whether you believe it or not!” Ireplied that I DO pay my taxes, and that I have to do what I believe the lawrequires. In retrospect, I should have pointed out that there are thousands oftaxes in this country. Which ones should I pay—the ones I believe apply to mysituation, or ALL of them? Of course paying every tax that exists would beimpossible, so there must be SOME way to tell which ones apply to me. Hey, whatabout LOOKING AT THE LAW?Miller brought up that the judge in Thurston Bell’s case said this “argument”was “nonsense.” So shouldn’t I believe him? I said that the only thing thatmatters is what the law says. Saying something is nonsense doesn’t make itnonsense. A number of jurors also asked questions like that—would you believethis kind of judge? or this kind of judge? I just kept saying that I believewhat the law says. If the judge says something that’s firmly and logically basedon legally binding statutes and regulations, then I would agree with him. But ifhe’s just shouting “frivolous!” based on nothing, or based on one statute out ofcontext, that has no merit.One lady asked if it would be possible for anyone to come up with a differentinterpretation that I would believe. I said theoretically yes, and this is whatwe’d been asking the government for, over and over again, from the beginning—aninterpretation based on statutes and regulations that makes our income taxable.After six years of asking for this and not getting it, however, I am convincedthat such an interpretation does not exist.I told them that what most convinced me that Larken’s interpretation was correctwas the IRS response, or lack of response, to his questions. We truly wondered,back at the beginning, if we were missing something that might change thepicture. We wanted to make sure we were doing the right thing. We asked andasked and asked. Surely if there was a missing piece, the IRSwould have found itand showed it to us. But they never answered the questions, never came up withcitations to support a different position, never clarified what their ownposition was, and ultimately just tried to bully us into changing our minds.Even when thousands of other people asked the same questions, they neveranswered. ...I did note some of the taxes we do pay—property, school, sales. No one reallysaid so, but I got the feeling some of them didn’t think this was “enough,”which is really sad. And I think Miller tried to play on this by notingsomething (totally irrelevant) about our credit card statements, and how we,according to him, went out for dinner a lot. He also brought up something Iwrote about “sources of stress,” and noted that “these things are stressful forall of us.” I think this was all intended to make the jury folks envious andhateful towards me. Some people are so attached to their depressing way of life,and so unable to think outside their little public-education/mass media thinkingbox, that they really hate people who try to open the cage door and show themthe way out. We can only hope that some of them were smart enough to see throughthis. At least one or two men asked me intelligent questions, and one of themasked Miller if they could have an 861 expert come in and testify. I think itwas a different guy who asked if it would be someone from the government. Ofcourse, Larken is the number one 861 expert in the country, and he was alreadythere. Do they really think the government is going to allow an expert whodisagrees with them to testify? Are they really incapable of seeing the conflictof interest here? If the grand jury had any sense, they’d be doing their ownresearch, not asking Miller to spoon-feed it to them.Another man said he would like to see the legal basis of judges’ opinions (theones who say our interpretation is “nonsense,” or “frivolous”). That would seemto indicate a bit of open-minded rationality in one person at least.Miller asked me what I will do when I’m 65 or if I become disabled, which Ipointed out was completely irrelevant to the issue before the jury. He asked meif I thought I should get money from the government if I hadn’t paid into SocialSecurity. After duly noting the irrelevance of this for the record, I pointedout that I HAD paid into Social Security for many years. But I want no moneyfrom the government anyway. I said, “I think people who pay into it should getsomething out of it, and people who don’t pay into it shouldn’t.” So much comesto mind on this topic, I could write about it all day, but it didn’t belong inthat room.Miller then asked me what I thought would happen to the country if ourinterpretation of the law were taken to its logical extreme. He did use the word“extreme,” which was sort of odd. As if applying the law correctly to EVERYONEwould be an EXTREME measure. After duly noting the irrelevance of this for therecord (again), I said that I thought we’d most likely have an economic boombecause the government wouldn’t be wasting so much of our money.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Much later we received the transcripts of our testimonies before the grand jury.In addition to the things mentioned above, there was one other thing she said tothe grand jury that is worth quoting here.“Now, Mr. Miller has had approximately 16 months, I think, since a bunch ofarmed men attacked and robbed my home, to pick through all our computers and allof our personal papers, and find things to take out of context and twist, andfind something that would make you not like us. I’m pretty sure, if I were giventhe same chance with his computer and some personal papers, I could probablymake you not like him, too. But I seriously doubt that, even after all thesearching and picking and twisting and taking things out of context, that he’scome up with anything that demonstrates that we don’t believe what we’resaying.”She was exactly right. Mr. Miller had absolutely nothing even hinting that webelieve we owe federal income taxes. Mainly he harped on the fact that ourfinances improved, in an obvious attempt to stir up envy among the grand jurors,and implied that the world would come to an end if we were right, but hepresented nothing at all suggesting that we thought we owed the tax, which wasan essential element of all of the alleged crimes they were “investigating.”AVOIDING THE WILLFULNESS ISSUEI guess it wasn’t enough for the prosecutors to lie to the grand jury about thefacts, because they also lied to them about the law. When I met the grand jury,and later when Tessa met them, the prosecutors mischaracterized and/or omittedentirely the concept of “willfulness.” Common sense and established law (whichdon’t usually agree) both dictate that an indictment is bogus if the grand jurydidn’t understand the basic elements that constitute the alleged crime. (Youobviously can’t find “probable cause” to think a crime has been committed if youdon’t know exactly what the alleged crime is.) Because of this, after theindictment was issued, I filed a court motion to have the grand jury transcriptsunsealed, so I could use Mr. Miller’s gross misrepresentation of what“willfulness” means to have the indictment thrown out.Normally grand jury transcripts are kept secret, and the Supreme Court explainsseveral reasons for this: 1) witnesses might be “hesitant to come forwardvoluntarily, knowing that those against whom they testify would be aware of thattestimony”; 2) some witnesses might be “less likely to testify fully andfrankly, as they would be open to retribution as well as to inducements”; 3)those indicted might flee; 4) those about to be indicted might try to influenceindividual grand jurors to vote against indictment; 5) those accused but notindicted would be held up to public ridicule.To make sure that none of those would be of any concern at all, we asked only tosee what the prosecutors said to the grand jurors. We didn’t care what the grandjurors said, or what witnesses said. (Originally we asked for the testimony ofIRS witnesses, but later dropped that part of the request.) With that out of theway, the rules say that grand jury transcriptions should be unsealed if theaccused can even show that “grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss theindictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury.” We demonstratedthat we had reason to believe that: 1) the government had failed to properlyinstruct the grand jury on the law to be applied (specifically, the element of“willfulness”), and 2) the government had engaged in improper and irrelevantdemonization of me and my wife in front of the grand jury. Either of thoseissues can result in an indictment being thrown out.Not surprisingly, the prosecutors wanted to keep what they had said to the grandjury a secret. In their response to our motion, they argued that grand jurysecrecy is desirable “to preserve the freedom and integrity of the deliberativeprocess.” That’s nice, but we weren’t asking for anything from thedeliberations; we wanted to see only what the prosecutors had said. They alsoargued that a court “has no authority to dismiss [an] indictment on the basis ofprosecutorial misconduct absent a finding that petitioners were prejudiced bysuch misconduct,” and they added that “even if there was some improper conduct,there are more appropriate sanctions than dismissal of an indictment.” That’snice, but we weren’t yet asking that the indictment be dismissed; we were onlyasking to see the grand jury transcripts.Oddly, they then argued that “the prosecutor is not even required to give legalinstructions to the grand jury.” Huh? How are grand jurors supposed toinvestigate alleged crimes if no one tells them what actually constitutes acrime? Oddly, the same government motion went on to explain that a prosecutor’sjob in front of a grand jury is “to present evidence to the grand jury and toinstruct them on the applicable law.” Well, which is it? Then they argued this:“Even assuming, arguendo, that the grand jury was not fully instructed on thelaw, ‘erroneous grand jury instructions do not automatically invalidate anotherwise proper grand jury indictment’.” Again, we weren’t yet asking that theindictment be dismissed; we were asking only to see the transcripts. Theirmotion also cited language from the indictment itself, which says that we“willfully failed to make an income tax return,” despite “knowing” that we had arequirement to file. They were claiming that that was a sufficient explanationof willfulness, even though it says nothing about what the term means.The grand jurors clearly did not understand “willfulness,” as demonstrated bytheir comments (mentioned above) about how they didn’t care what I “believed,”that I shouldn’t have acted on my own “interpretation” of the law, etc. For goodmeasure, here is yet another quote from a grand juror, demonstrating completeignorance of the concept of “willfulness”: after Tessa said, “I am obligated todo what I believe the law says I should do,” a juror said that the grand juryhad looked at the law, “and I think it’s a matter of interpretation; so maybewe’re interpreting it differently, that’s all.” It’s not a crime to have adifferent interpretation of the law, and if they had been told what“willfulness” means, they would have known that.Regarding our accusation that Mr. Miller improperly demonized and personallyattacked us in front of the grand jury, the government argued that the fact thatwe were allowed to speak to the grand jury “all but eliminated any danger thatthe grand jury was misled or improperly influenced,” and so the government haddifficult seeing how the grand jury “could have been prejudiced by the allegedprosecutorial misconduct.” So the feds can say whatever they want about us forover a year, behind closed doors, but because we then each had a couple of hoursto talk to them, the grand jurors couldn’t possibly have been prejudiced orimproperly influenced. Huh? Talk about a “frivolous” argument.Well, we had a court hearing about our motion to unseal grand jury transcripts,and we won! At least Judge Baylson said we won, and ordered the government togive him the grand jury transcripts so he could see if anything needed to beredacted (blacked out) before the transcripts were given to us. Hooray! A littlejustice at last!Nope. What I later received was a copy of the transcript of only one day—thelast day of grand jury activity. I was not pleased, and immediately filedanother motion, asking that I be supplied with all of the transcripts, as thejudge said was supposed to happen. The government’s response to that secondmotion said very little about the issue, demonized us a bunch, and then saidthis: “Confident that the jury will reject the defendants’ claim, the so-called‘861 evidence’ will become, like other tax protestor scheme, a relic of a bygoneera.” Aside from deserving an “F” in basic English, that statement accidentallyreveals the government’s real motivation: to silence the issue.So we had yet another court hearing about my second motion, at which FloydMiller claimed that the very last day was the only day instructions about“willfulness” had been given to the grand jury. Huh? You mean the grand juryspent 18 months “investigating” me, but weren’t told what would actuallyconstitute a crime until the last day? Bullpoop, Mr. Miller. Insanely, the judgeruled that, without looking at the transcripts, he would take the government’sword for it that those were the only instructions given on willfulness. Afterall, Judge Baylson explained, lying about something like that could get aprosecutor in big trouble, so the court chose to blindly believe the habitualliar, Floyd Miller. How, exactly, would it get him in trouble, if no one(including the judge) is ever allowed to see the transcripts, to find out thatMr. Miller lied?So not only did the prosecutor decide what the grand jury would see and hear,but also, with the court’s permission, he was allowed to decide what the judgewas allowed to see. (Throughout this story you may notice a common pattern ofthe government trying to hide what it does, while I am completely open aboutwhat I am doing. That ought to tell you who the real criminals are.)Ironically, after all that, the one day of transcripts I received—whichpresumably would be the least damning to the government, since that’s what itchose to release—showed Mr. Miller misrepresenting the issue of willfulness. Hedefined “willful” failure to file as being the opposite of an “accident ormistake.” Obviously my not filing was not an oversight; it was very much onpurpose, based upon my discovery that my income isn’t taxable. But the way Mr.Miller mischaracterized the concept pretty much forced the grand jury to indict,while an accurate explanation of “willfulness” would have forced them not toindict. Just to make it perfectly clear, here again is what the Supreme Courtsaid about it, in what both the DOJ and the courts acknowledge to be thegoverning case on “willfulness”:“A good-faith misunderstanding of the law or a good-faith belief that one is notviolating the law negates willfulness, whether or not the claimed belief ormisunderstanding is objectively reasonable.” [Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S.192 (1991)]If the grand jury understood that, i.e., if Miller had told them what the lawmeans, they could only have indicted if they had found probable cause that webelieve our income to be taxable. Since there was no reason at all to thinkthat, and the government had no evidence of it (because it isn’t the case), Mr.Miller chose to lie to them about the law instead. And that was just on the oneday for which they let me have the transcripts. How badly he lied on all theother days he talked to the grand jury, I can only guess. In keeping with theDOJ’s avoidance of the issue, the indictment itself, in describing the offense,said nothing about our beliefs, and did nothing to establish “willfulness,” nordid it even talk about the issue of “willfulness” at all, despite it being anessential element of the alleged crime.So, based upon just two days of grand jury transcripts—the last day, and the dayI was there (which they had to give me for other reasons)—I filed a motionarguing that the indictment was invalid and should be thrown out, because: 1)the prosecution had grossly misrepresented an essential element of the allegedcrime (willfulness), and 2) the prosecution had personally vilified and malignedme in front of the grand jurors, in order to prejudice them against me. Again,each of those reasons alone is grounds for dismissing an indictment.As to the issue of vilification, the government simply ignored it, as did thecourt. They acted as if I had never raised the issue at all. Interestingtechnique, equivalent to closing one’s eyes, putting one’s hands over one’sears, and saying, “I’m not listening, blah, blah, blah.”Concerning the issue of misleading the grand jury about the nature of the crimesalleged, the prosecution made a couple of rather odd arguments (in writing,even). Not only did they again argue that the prosecution isn’t required toexplain to the grand jury all of the elements of the crimes alleged, but theyalso argued that the grand jury heard “extensive testimony from [me] regarding[my] interpretation of willfulness,” and therefore concluded that, “By the endof both defendants’ testimony, the grand jury was well aware of the concept ofwillfulness.” What? Now the accused has the responsibility of explaining the lawto the grand jury? (That argument is a bit ironic in a case where the governmentcontended that I am neither qualified nor authorized to interpret the law.) Andof course, the well-indoctrinated grand jurors are infinitely more likely tobelieve the government’s statements about the law than those of the accused.Nonetheless, the feds really did argue that because I had explained willfulnessto the grand jury, it was okay that they hadn’t—and in fact okay that they hadmischaracterized the issue.Incidentally, when I spoke to the grand jury, I quoted verbatim the SupremeCourt’s ruling in the Cheek case (shown above), after which Mr. Miller said thathe had a different “interpretation” of willfulness. So I guess Floyd Miller nowoutranks the Supreme Court as well.Our motion to have the indictment thrown out was denied. So, by lying to themabout the law and about me, while withholding all relevant evidence, thegovernment convinced at least half of the grand jurors to issue an indictmentfor misdemeanor “willful failure to file” federal income tax returns.“The prosecutor’s responsibility is to advise the grand jury on the law and topresent evidence for its consideration. In discharging these responsibilities,the prosecutor must be scrupulously fair to all witnesses and must do nothing toinflame or otherwise improperly influence the grand jurors.” [U.S. AttorneysManual (USAM), Section 9-11.010]In case you think there is some room for different interpretations about“willfulness,” or that its meaning remains debatable, the following is from thegovernment’s requested jury instructions in my case. Yes, this is what theyrequested the judge tell the jury about what “willfulness” means: “[I] f adefendant had a subjective good-faith belief, no matter how unreasonable, thatthe law did not require him to file a tax return or to pay federal income taxes,he did not act ‘willfully’. ” And this, too: “A good-faith misunderstanding ofthe requirements of the law can be based upon information given a person fromother individuals, a person’s interpretation of case law, meaning court cases,as well as statutes and regulations, no matter how unreasonable a person’sinterpretation seems to you.”Not exactly how they portrayed it to the grand jury, is it? So the grand juryindicted, with the impression that if my not filing wasn’t accidental (which itobviously wasn’t), it had to be “willful.” For whatever reason, however, theyindicted only on the least serious offense: misdemeanor willful failure to file.In the one day of transcripts we received, something else very interestingshowed up. One grand juror asked whether they had “investigated” all the otheralleged crimes (tax evasion, conspiracy, attempt to corruptly interfere withadministration of tax laws, filing false claims, etc.) for nothing. Here is theamazing reply by Assistant United States Attorney Floyd Miller:“No. You did, it is—it is because this is, I don’t want to sound like a patriot,but because this is the United States we have to make sure that before you,essentially, you know, fire the starting point that there is clearly evidencethere beyond a reasonable doubt that a jury could find that somebody committed acrime. I guess what I’m trying to say is, the problems that we’re trying tosolve are these, the Constitution, the First Amendment to the Constitutionallows certain individuals to have freedom of expression, I mean, to say somepretty horrible things even if you don’t like it.”Wow, there’s a lot of insanity in there. Let’s see:1) Mr. Miller doesn’t want to sound like a “patriot”? After all, only a totalextremist wacko would talk about constitutional rights, right? Don’t worry, Mr.Miller, you don’t sound like a patriot. You sound like a fascist.2) To our wonderful “Department of Justice,” the First Amendment is a “problem”to be “solved.” That about says it all. He might as well have just said, “Thereare these damn rights that we have to find a way around.”3) The First Amendment allows only “certain” people to speak their minds? Mr.Miller must have a different version of the Constitution than I do.4) Apparently discussing tax laws is a “pretty horrible” thing to do. I feel soashamed.Anyway, in the end the feds had to settle for only one false charge against meand my wife. Poor them.Incidentally, I had written to the DOJ ahead of time, asking that if we wereever to be indicted, they not do the dramatic Gestapo-style arrest routine, butjust send out a subpoena, which we promised to comply with by turning ourselvesin. And at least they did that (because they knew we were not a flight risk or adanger to anyone). After we got the letter saying we had been indicted, on March10, 2005, Tessa and I went downtown for our arraignment, at which we pleaded“not guilty,” and were released on a $20,000 unsecured bond each.So we were going to trial. We had been totally open and honest about our actionsand our beliefs, we had gone out of our way to tell the government what we weredoing and to ask them to show us anything in the law we might be missing (whichthey failed to do), and now they were going to try to put us in prison for it.It was time to prepare for battle.ONE ARM TIED BEHIND MY BACKWhen I let it be known that I was going to represent myself at trial, lots ofpeople, including several good friends, roundly criticized me for it. (As thesaying goes, he who represents himself in court has a fool for a client.) Butbeing a bonehead wasn’t the only reason I made that choice, though it probablycontributed. There were other reasons why I felt I had to do it that way, and Istill think so.My goal was not just to get myself out of trouble. Remember, I volunteeredmyself into trouble, and that wasn’t just for the fun of trying to get out of itagain. I was attempting to expose the biggest financial fraud in history, and toserve that purpose, I could not have an attorney represent me.First of all, attorneys are creatures of the system, and the system can expelthem from the game if they don’t behave. As a result, very few attorneys wouldwant to allege that my conclusions are actually correct, especially sinceseveral attorneys have already been punished for saying so. So where would thatleave me if I used an attorney? He would have to essentially argue, “My client’sconclusions are wrong, and stupid, but he really believed them.” That would bethe game plan of almost any defense attorney, in an effort to preserve his ownreputation while trying to defend me. Needless to say, having that as my defensewouldn’t exactly help a lot in the effort to expose and end the fraud.In addition, a lawyer couldn’t possibly demonstrate my beliefs better than Icould. In fact, it would take many hours—expensive, billable attorney hours—justto get the average lawyer to understand my legal position, at least well enoughto not botch it up in court.It was also important to me that I keep the trial understandable to the generalpublic. I didn’t want to win on some weird technicality, nor did I want a trialwhich was 90 percent procedural bickering and legalese gobbledygook. To inflicta real blow against the fraud, the issue had to be kept as simple as possible:Did I break the law by not filing federal income tax returns, or not? Aresounding “no” from the jury would have been devastating to the government’sintimidation and propaganda campaign. And, if I’m allowed a little wishfulthinking, it could have brought some real public attention to the fraud.On the other hand, had the trial consisted of the usual circus of legal tricks,incomprehensible to the general public, it would have accomplished little ornothing, even with a “not guilty” verdict.I also wanted to be the one to cross-examine the government witnesses, because Iwas more familiar with the facts of the case—and therefore better able to catchthe IRS in their lies—than an attorney would be. I could not do this if I wererepresented by a lawyer. Despite the fact that I lost, I still think that ingeneral I did pretty well cross-examining the government’s witnesses, but Iguess you can judge that for yourself from the following account of the trial.If nothing else, at least I had fun doing it.Yes, representing myself did put me at a distinct disadvantage in several ways,especially since I knew only a little about court procedure (after my self-studycrash course), and wasn’t sure what dirty tricks, “legal” or otherwise, theprosecution might try. But to accomplish what I had set out to do, I had torepresent myself. Had I won, as a little non-lawyer nobody, against theall-powerful federal government, it couldn’t help but make waves, and would haveput a huge crack in the IRS’s reputation as an invincible bully—an image ittries very hard to maintain.For all the court procedure, however, I decided I should have “standby counsel,”an attorney I could consult with during the trial about procedural and legalquestions. Due to scheduling problems and procedural details, there was quite astressful, complicated drama involved in getting standby counsel, pretty much atthe last minute. At the same time, Judge Baylson decided to split the trial intwo: one for me and a separate one for Tessa. That last-minute decision didquite a bit to mess up our plans for how to present our defense. Coincidence? Idoubt it. (I still think the judge’s legal excuse for splitting the trial wasmore than a little dubious.)I ended up using Larry Becraft as my standby counsel. He had been in battlebefore with the IRS and DOJ, and had given them at least a couple of black eyesalong the way. (He was involved in the cases in which Vernice Kuglin and LloydLong were acquitted of tax-related charges.) Even though he was essentiallystuck in the role of procedural assistant in my case, since I was stillofficially “pro se” (representing myself), he helped a lot with preparation,especially considering the fact that we had about two seconds to prepare (whichwas not at all his fault). I also don’t fault him at all for the verdict; he dida fine job of preparing and questioning me.Some people have suggested to me that “winning is everything,” no matter howit’s done, and that I should have had a lawyer represent me. But I stillmaintain—as I sit here in prison—that I had to do it the way I did. (I’m a bitstubborn, as you may have noticed.)"},{"pageContent":"PART V:PREGAME SHOWPRELIMINARY SKIRMISHESAnd that brings us almost to the story of the trial itself. Of course, therewon’t be any suspense about the outcome, since you know I ended up in prison.(At the moment people still don’t get thrown in jail after being found notguilty, but I’m sure the DOJ is trying to have that changed.) But despite thelack of suspense, what happened at trial tells a lot about just how far downhillour “justice system” has gone.Preceding the actual trial, however, a lot of preliminary legal skirmishesoccurred, some of which entailed just boring procedural stuff, but some of whichwere very educational.The legal motions and hearings regarding the illegality of the IRS’s raid on myhome, for example, actually began before I was indicted, and continued right upto the trial itself. Long before I was indicted, I filed a “Motion to Quash,”arguing that the search warrant should be declared unconstitutional and thateverything they swiped should be returned. After Tessa and I were indicted, myMotion to Quash evolved into a Motion to Suppress, asking the court to excludefrom the trial anything the IRS swiped during the raid, on the basis that theraid was blatantly unconstitutional. What follows is an overview of thearguments back and forth over the bogus search warrant.SHOW ME THE JUSTIFICATIONWhen any government agency wants a search warrant, an agent must fill out an“affidavit of probable cause” (APC), giving facts which are supposed to legallyjustify a search of private property. That “APC” is given to a magistrate, whosepermission is required to make the warrant legal. (These days, however, mostmagistrates simply rubber-stamp anything put in front of them.) Well, the everopen and honest IRS had its APC “sealed” by the court, meaning that no one wasallowed to see it. So I filed a motion to have it unsealed, so I could challengethe constitutionality of the raid on my home. On February 27, 2004, a courthearing about it was held in front of U.S. Magistrate Linda Caracappa.As an aside, I filed that motion to unseal in the same envelope as a motion toquash the search warrant, which is discussed more below. Judge Caracappainformed me that, by their arbitrary, asinine rules—though she didn’t use thosewords—they process only the first thing in the envelope and ignore the rest. Sothey pretended I hadn’t filed a motion to quash, which I then filed again. Forthe first hearing, I had prepared to discuss mainly the motion to quash. Ididn’t learn, until at the hearing, that only the motion to unseal would bediscussed.Judge Caracappa began by telling me that even though I had filed the motion prose, she would treat me just as she would a lawyer, and not give me any specialconsideration. Sounds fair.I received the government’s response to my motion to unseal the APC as I sat atthe table in the courtroom right before the hearing began. Apparently I wassupposed to give an impromptu, off-the-cuff response to their filing, which Ihad never seen before. (How many lawyers would have put up with that?) Swell. Noproblem.Judge Caracappa stated at the beginning that the government had the burden ofproving that the APC should remain sealed. So Floyd Miller gave his argument:the APC should continue to remain sealed because unsealing it might reveal theidentity of witnesses, other subjects of investigation, etc., and thereforewould jeopardize the government’s case. That was Mr. Miller’s entire argument incourt, and that was most of what his written motion dealt with: the supposeddangers of revealing the identities of potential witnesses and people underinvestigation.The idea hit me on the spot: how about if all names and identifying informationabout any such witnesses or potential subjects were redacted (blacked out) fromthe affidavit before giving it to me? Judge Caracappa agreed that that would bea reasonable solution. Well, that should have taken care of all of thegovernment’s concerns, right?Nope. Mr. Miller then completely changed his reason for wanting the APC toremain sealed (demonstrating that he was lying about why he wanted the thingkept secret in the first place). Then the truth came out: Mr. Miller wanted theAPC to remain sealed because he knew I intended to publicize it. I was a littlesurprised that he freely admitted that in open court. Judge Caracappa had tothen inform Mr. Miller that I had every right to publicize the document. In itswritten motion, the government whined that I wanted the APC unsealed “forpropaganda purposes, namely, to reassure their 4000 e-mail subscribers (andother potential adherents) that they need not follow the law and file taxreturns for the current tax year.” What? How the heck would publicizing thegovernment’s document, which was supposed to prove that I’m a nasty criminal,“reassure” anyone that “they need not follow the law”? (It may very well provethat the government need not follow the law, but that’s a different issue.) Whata peculiar thing to claim: that allowing the public to see a constitutionallyrequired document, supposedly justifying an armed invasion of my home, would“impede and impair the Internal Revenue Service in carrying out its statutoryduty which is to collect taxes.”In its motion, the government even whined about “numerous letters being sent toUnited States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the InternalRevenue Service questioning the authority of the Internal Revenue Service tocollect taxes on income of Americans earned in the United States.” Wow, that’ssome fine lawyer-spin. (Not surprisingly, the motion didn’t mention that neitherthe U.S. Attorney nor the IRS ever answered the questions; he just whined aboutus asking them.)I’m not sure what she had been told, or what she had been smoking, but out ofthe blue, Judge Caracappa opined that the government had “bent over backwards”trying to accommodate us. Yeah, they “bent over backwards” to refuse to answermy questions, to refuse to send the issue to their lawyers, to refuse to statethe specifics of their own position, to publicly slander and demonize me, to tryto silence my web sites, and to do an armed invasion of my home and steal myvideos and reports. Yeah, that was some quality “service” they provided. If allthat constituted “bending over backwards” to accommodate us, I wonder what JudgeCaracappa would consider to be IRS misconduct.The argument at the hearing ended with those as the only two issues: 1) the fedsdidn’t want identities of certain people revealed, and I agreed to have all suchinformation redacted from the APC before it was given to me; and 2) the fedsdidn’t want me publicizing the APC, though the judge admitted that I had everyright to do so. Since the feds had the burden of proof, and both of theirarguments had been utterly and completely demolished, it was an easy win for me.Well, no. Caracappa ruled against me anyway, and decided that the APC wouldremain sealed. The only justification she offered was to say that the country is“at war,” with the 9/11 thing and all, and so ten months isn’t a long time forthe IRS to keep my stuff and to hide its affidavit of probable cause. Um, how isthat even slightly relevant, since they showed no legitimate need to keep itsecret at all (in light of my suggestion that names be redacted beforeunsealing)? And how does being “at war” matter? Is Floyd Miller engaged inhand-to-hand combat with al-Qaeda when he’s not busy prosecuting me? Anyway,Judge Caracappa said I could wait a while and then try again to have the APCunsealed.I am thoroughly convinced that the outcomes of such hearings are often foregoneconclusions, and they hold a hearing and allow “arguments” just to give theappearance of due process, pretending that the judge is actually “judging”something. Considering the fact that the “argument” was a slam dunk in my favorafter it was acknowledged that the government had the burden of proof and yetJudge Caracappa didn’t hesitate to rule against me, I can only conclude that sheknew exactly what she was going to “rule” before even stepping into thecourtroom, and the “hearing” was all just for show.There were two other noteworthy occurrences at that hearing:1) When I mentioned that the IRS took all my Theft by Deception videos and saidthey would never return them (even after their “investigation” was finished),instead of denying it, Mr. Miller quickly alleged that those videos wereevidence of a crime, though he didn’t say what supposed crime they were evidenceof.2) Prior to the hearing on my motion, we sat in court through severalarraignments of accused drug dealers and bank robbers. Judge Caracappa sincerelywished each of them “good luck.” Neither I nor my wife ever heard JudgeCaracappa wishing us good luck. Gee, I wonder why. (Hint: drug dealers and bankrobbers pose no threat to the system of power which provides Ms. Caracappa withher paycheck and her prestige.)So in August of 2004, well over a year after the raid, I again filed a motionasking that the APC be unsealed. This time, I sent a letter to my e-mail listinviting the subscribers to write their own letters to Ms. Caracappa, sayingthat they too wanted to see the APC, because they too had questions about thelegality of the raid. So as to not annoy Ms. Caracappa too much, I had peoplesend the letters to me, and I sent them all in one package. There were 150letters from people across the country.The government again opposed my motion to unseal the APC, still wanting thelegal justification for invading my home to be kept secret. In a follow-upletter to Caracappa, Floyd Miller said this: “Mr. Rose recently sent an e-mailmessage to his ‘subscribers’ which suggested that the ‘subscribers’ should writeto you for the purpose of encouraging you to unseal the affidavit.” Since I toldher that myself, and sent her the letters myself, I don’t really think Mr.Miller needed to tell her. But then his letter said this: “I will refer to [sic]this matter to the United States Marshal’s Office for review. Mr. Rose haspreviously been warned about this type of conduct when he suggested to his‘subscribers’ that they write to Judge Rueter.”I bet some of you silly people were under the impression that we have the rightin this country to petition the government for a redress of grievances—in otherwords, tell them what we think and ask them to do what we believe is just. Well,in the eyes of Mr. Miller, that’s apparently a crime. Incidentally, I was not“warned” not to tell people to write to judges—I have every right to do that, asthe U.S. Marshals conceded when they visited me before, regarding a threateningletter Judge Rueter apparently received from someone else (as I describedabove). When they visited me then they admitted, though somewhat reluctantly,that I had done nothing wrong, neither threatening anyone nor telling anyoneelse to threaten anyone. Yet the U.S. Department of Justice (at least some oftheir goons) consider it criminal when the peasantry politely writes letters tojudges. Oddly, in his letter whining about my actions, he included copies of thetwo e-mails I sent to this list about it, which included this:“If you think that you have a right to see that Constitutionally mandated,‘public’ document (the affidavit of probable cause for the search warrant), thenby all means write a short (one page), polite letter to Magistrate LindaCaracappa, saying you believe the affidavit should be unsealed. But send yourletters to ME (not to her). ... I will then send all the letters at once toJudge Caracappa, in one envelope. It will let your voices be heard, withoutbeing an unnecessary annoyance (like 100 individual letters would be).” (Me,from 10/29/04 e-mail)Does anything about that look criminal to you? How about this one?“So now I think it’s worth letting the court know that you don’t like thegovernment acting in secret, and you want to see the Constitutionally requiredaffidavit justifying an armed invasion of a private residence. Again, I don’twant to annoy or anger Judge Caracappa, but I do want her to know what YOUthink. So if you want to send a simple, one-page letter, written to her but sentto ME (at the address below), then on November 6, exactly 18 months since theraid, I’ll send them all along to Judge Caracappa (in one package). ... Youdon’t need to rant, or be nasty (please don’t). It is enough to simply statethat you want to know WHY the feds would do such a raid, and so you want to seethe affidavit of probable cause justifying it.” (Me, from 10/31/04 e-mail)Yeah, that really sounds like something the U.S. Marshals need to look into,doesn’t it? Better pull a few of them off of kidnapping or serial killer cases,and have them investigate my e-mails instead. (Incidentally, the U.S. Marshalsnever contacted me about the obviously legal, polite, non-threatening letters toJudge Caracappa. They probably thought Miller was a bit batty to “refer” theissue to them at all.) Just for good measure, here is the letter I sent to JudgeCaracappa myself, along with all the letters from other people. See if thissounds criminal to you.November 8, 2004U.S. Magistrate Linda CaracappaU.S. Courthouse601 Market StreetPhiladelphia, PA 19106-1789Dear Judge Caracappa,It is now a year and a half since the IRS executed an armed invasion of my home,took hundreds of copies of a perfectly legal video ( Theft by Deception), aswell as dozens of written reports and bumper-stickers, confiscated all of myfinancial records, and copied or confiscated all of my computers. (See case#03-401-M.) As you know, I dispute the legality and Constitutionality of thatraid, and because of that I have been seeking to unseal the affidavit ofprobable cause on which the search warrant was based. Now, 18 months after theraid, it remains sealed.I am not the only one for whom the tactics of the IRS and DOJ in my case haveraised suspicions. I have every reason to believe that the raid was motivated,not by any need for evidence of any crime (the DOJ in a court motion evenconceded that I have done nothing to hide my actions), but by a desire tointimidate me into silence. The affidavit will show, one way or the other,whether the raid was justified and legally valid.Many people are watching my case, and I wanted you to hear their concerns.However, because I did not want to unnecessarily burden your office with dozensof individual letters about the case, I asked that people send their letters tome, so that I could forward them to you in one package (to avoid the annoyanceand inconvenience which dozens of separate letters would cause you). Enclosedare some (not all) of those letters.The public has a right to know what their government is doing, and a governmentwhich functions in secret is a threat to the liberties of everyone in thiscountry. Please unseal the affidavit, and let the people see for themselves whattheir government is doing.Sincerely,Larken Rose[home address redacted]Enclosure: 150 letters from concerned citizens(P.S. Some of the enclosed letters request a copy of the affidavit, but I willbe posting it publicly when it is unsealed, so fulfilling such requestsindividually is not necessary.)Note the ironic contrast here: the APC is required to prove that there is“probable cause” to believe that I’m a criminal. So why is it that the fedswanted it kept secret, while I wanted to publicize it? (Their legal excuse wasthat they thought that somehow unsealing it might jeopardize an ongoinginvestigation, which, not surprisingly, also turned out to be absolute bunk, asyou’ll see.)MOTION TO QUASHRight after the raid, long before I was indicted and long before I ever saw theAPC, I filed a “Motion to Quash” the search warrant, asking the court to declareit unconstitutional and force the IRS to give us our stuff back. Since I didn’tyet have their supposed legal justification (the APC), I had to guess a bitabout what their lame legal excuses might be.I should mention here that since 1998 I’ve been pushed into an involuntaryeducation about various aspects of federal statutory and constitutional law, bybeing harassed, raided, prosecuted, and otherwise terrorized for speaking mymind. One such topic is the Fourth Amendment, which outlaws unreasonablesearches and seizures. (It outlaws them, but it doesn’t actually stop them fromhappening, obviously.) The best way to explain what I learned about the FourthAmendment is simply to summarize what was in my Motion to Quash, and later myMotion to Suppress.My Motion to Quash began by giving some background about my research, mymeetings with the IRS, etc., and then gave a report about the IRS raid itself,what the agents were seeking, what they took, how they behaved, and so on. Themotion then argued that the “search” (i.e., armed invasion and robbery) wasunconstitutional for five separate reasons. Without quoting the entire motion,I’ll just summarize each point.“1. The search was unnecessary and the warrant was obtained in bad faith.”First of all, a search warrant is not supposed to be used at all unless it istruly necessary.“[A]ny intrusion in the way of search or seizure is an evil, so that nointrusion at all is justified without a careful prior determination ofnecessity.” [Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443 (1971)]The Supreme Court, and even the IRS’s own manual, explain that searchesshouldn’t be used at all unless it’s absolutely necessary for obtaining specificevidence of a specific crime that cannot be obtained from less intrusive means.And they already had all the pertinent info—about our beliefs, our finances, andour actions—because I had given it to them voluntarily.“2. The warrant is defective because of a total failure to show a legitimatereason for its issuance, and because it is outrageously overly broad.”A search warrant is supposed to be used to search for particular evidence of aparticular crime, which the government has “probable cause” to believe exists ina certain place at a certain time. Search warrants are not supposed to be usedto engage in a “let’s-see-what-we-can-find” fishing expedition. In my case, thewarrant sought twenty-eight categories of items, including just about anyfinancial documents imaginable, all computers and disks on the premisesregardless of content, and any documents written by anyone relating to “anytax-related issues,” as well as all IRS publications, documents related to thecreation of my web sites, all copies of tax statutes and regulations, and more.My Motion to Quash then considered each supposed criminal “offense” listed inthe warrant (only the least serious of which we were ever charged with), andconsidered what relevant evidence the IRS might have needed to search forrelated to each:1) Tax evasion (26 USC § 7201) and failure to file returns (26 USC § 7203). TheIRS knew we had income, they knew we had stopped filing, and they knew why,because we told them all that, at the meetings and in writing. The feds did notallege that we were hiding income or assets, or lying about anything (and weweren’t), or that we were being at all secretive about our actions or our legalconclusions. So what on earth did they need to “search” for related to thosealleged crimes? Nothing.2) Signing an incorrect return (26 USC § 7206(1)) and filing false claims (18USC § 278). Both of these were about the claims for refund we had filed, whichthey already had (obviously). Since the claims explained themselves, and therewas no dispute over any financial specifics, there was absolutely no furtherrelevant information or evidence which could possibly require a search.3) Corruptly interfering with the administration of the tax laws (26 USC §7212(a)) and conspiracy (18 USC § 371). Those allegations seemed to be relatedto my report, my video, my web sites, and my e-mail list, all of which the IRSalready had complete, unlimited access to.Those were all of the “offenses” alleged in their search warrant. Since theyalready had all the relevant information for all of them, and since the warrantdidn’t even allege the existence of any other evidence, or anything hidden, youmight wonder (as I do), Why the #@%$#& did they need to raid my home?Actually, I don’t wonder that. The answer is obvious. They invaded my house forseveral reasons: to do a fishing expedition in the hopes of finding some “dirt”on me, to try to scare me into shutting up, to try to take my report and videoout of circulation, and to try to scare other people away from listening to whatI have to say. In other words, the raid was done entirely to help with theircompletely illegal, terroristic censorship agenda.If you think I use the term “terrorist” lightly, think again. Even the way thefederal government itself defines the term describes the tactics of the IRSperfectly: “the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or propertyto intimidate or coerce ... the civilian population, or any segment thereof, infurtherance of political or social objectives” (28 CFR § 0.85(l)). Can you say,with a straight face, that the IRS doesn’t do that? (Ironically, there is a newlaw making it a crime to give money to terrorist organizations, which, if readliterally, would make it illegal to send money to the IRS.)Anyway, back to the Motion to Quash.“3. The warrant and seizure violated both the First Amendment to theConstitution of the United States of America and the Privacy Protection Act of1980 (42 USC Section 2000aa).”Not only does the Supreme Court warn that searches can be used as an instrumentfor censorship, but federal law also specifically forbids the use of searches todeprive people of the tools they use to publicly express their beliefs andopinions (42 USC § 2000aa). So wasn’t it a tad improper for them to use awarrant in such an obvious effort to shut me up? Of course. As it happens, theSupreme Court has specifically condemned the use of search warrants to carry outwholesale confiscation of books and videos—even if they are alleged to beillegal (which was not the case here).“[S]eizing films to destroy them or to block their distribution or exhibition isa very different matter from seizing a single copy of a film for the bona fidepurpose of preserving it as evidence in a criminal proceeding.” [Heller v. NewYork, 413 U.S. 483 (1973)].Note that the court said that seizing a single copy can be justified, but sinceI had already sent over one hundred free copies of the video to various IRSagents, even taking one would have been entirely unnecessary and unjustified.(I hope everyone who reads this story at least skims through my “Taxable Income”report, which is Appendix A of this book, or better yet, watches my Theft byDeception video, so they can see how asinine it is to portray them as something“corrupt.” Neither of them tells how to deal with the IRS, nor do they tellanyone to do anything—they are nothing more than purely academic explanations ofmy findings regarding what the law shows to be taxable. But the feds tried topaint them as part of some “corrupt” endeavor, in order to try to justify masstheft of perfectly legal items of free speech.)“4. The conduct of the search was abusive and the seizure of numerous articlesof property was unlawful.”This item had to do with various things the IRS did during the raid, such as notletting Tessa back into the house when she returned, not letting me use thetelephone or even answer incoming calls, “supervising” me while I went to thebathroom, and measuring the barrel lengths of my rifles (hoping to find thatthey were illegal—which they weren’t).“5. No Affidavit of Probable Cause was attached to the Warrant.”As mentioned before, the APC was sealed, and so it was not with the warrant. Thecase law about the legality of that tactic is contradictory, but we decided tobring it up.The motion concluded by asking the court to “quash” the warrant (declare it tobe invalid) and to order the IRS to return everything it stole. Attached to themotion were affidavits from myself and Tessa, describing the events of the dayof the raid. (Hers is quoted from above.)My Motion to Quash was the first official court motion I had ever filed, and Iwas quite proud of it. I considered it to be thorough, well-reasoned, andwell-supported. In preparing it I did get some help from a very nice gentlemanwho (amusingly) used to be an attorney for the IRS. (I would mention him byname, but I think the IRS already dislikes him enough as it is.) Not to toot myown horn, but I do want to add that most of the numerous Supreme Court andInternal Revenue Manual citations in the motion I found myself.With the motion filed, with all the various copies going where they should andall the obscure procedures and rules followed to the letter, I sat back andwaited for the government’s response. What awesome legal analysis andsubstantive rebuttal would the highly trained, experienced government attorneyscome up with? Well, they didn’t respond at all within the legal time limit, so Ifiled a “Motion for Default Judgment.” My Motion to Quash was officially“unopposed” because the government had filed nothing to rebut it. After thatcame their response.THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDSAbove is a drastically abbreviated summary of my motion. In reality it quoteddozens of legal citations, showing point by point how the IRS agents not onlydid everything the way the Supreme Court says not to do a search and seizure,they even directly disobeyed a dozen or so citations from their own InternalRevenue Manual explaining how warrants should be prepared, requested, andexecuted. For those interested in such things, I have included my subsequentMotion to Suppress—basically a second draft of my Motion to Quash—in full asAppendix B in the back of this book, to show just how thorough andwell-supported it was.When I finally received the government’s response to my motion in the mail andsat down to read it (tense and full of trepidation), I could barely believe myeyes. Let me begin by backing up and stating the obvious: my motion waschallenging the constitutionality and legality of their search warrant. Theirresponse, therefore, had only one legal purpose: to defend the validity andlegality of the warrant and the search.Their motion never even mentioned the warrant or the search.I’m not exaggerating, and I can’t overstate how bizarre that is. Other than onthe first page, where they stated that their motion was in response to ourmotion to quash an illegal search warrant, nowhere did their “response” evenmention the warrant, or any of the legal issues I had raised. Not one word aboutany of it. Instead, it was seven pages (double-spaced) of pure lunacy. Thehighlights are as follows:1) Their response stated that we had a medical transcription business and hadstopped filing tax returns, and then admitted this: “Notably, the Movants havenot attempted to conceal their conduct.” Well, nice of them to admit that. Butif we weren’t concealing what we were doing, why did they need to carry out asurprise, armed invasion of our home?2) Their motion also said: “In a daring display of willfulness, the Movants haveasked the government to prosecute them for failing to file tax returns.”Actually, it was a display of the exact opposite of willfulness, because itcarefully explained why we had every reason to believe that we weren’t requiredto file returns.3) Their response summarized my legal position regarding why our income isn’ttaxable, cited a worthless Tax Court case disagreeing with my conclusions, andthen spent a couple of pages making a fatally flawed attempt to refute myposition (alleging that I should look only at 61, not 861). Keep in mind,whether or not my conclusions about the 861 evidence are correct has nothing todo with whether the search warrant was constitutional or not.4) Their response said that I had devised a “get rich scheme,” selling my videoto “other individuals who may be disaffected with paying taxes in general.”5) Their response alleged that we claimed to have “discovered the path to taxnirvana” and that we were “engaging in a series of corrupt endeavors to impede,impair, obstruct and prevent” the IRS from administering the tax code. What“corrupt” endeavors? You mean asking questions? Or quoting the law?6) They alleged that we were “hoping to earn in excess of $2 million from theirtax fraud scheme,” meaning selling the video. Here is Tessa’s response to thatpoint (as sent to my e-mail list back then):“Mr. Miller must have found some notes I scribbled while playing with mycalculator and pondering questions like: What if every household in the countrybought a video? What if all 1040 filers bought a video? Mr. Miller’s obviousintent here is to cast doubt on the sincerity of our beliefs by arguing thatwe’re doing this just to make money. Anyone familiar with our history knows howlame this is.”When did hoping to make money from selling something perfectly legal become acriminal “fraud scheme”? Then their response showed how really diabolical weare, citing our motive of making enough money so that Tessa “can devote her timeto writing books for children.” I’m not kidding; that’s what their motion said.Aren’t we the scum of the earth? It also said the “exploitation of the emotionsof others” was what we hoped to use to “speed [us] forward toward [our] goal ofbecoming rich.” Again, this is from Tessa’s note to my e-mail list:“I believe it’s legal in the U.S.A. to exploit people’s emotions for profit. Ifnot, a great many advertising agencies and movie producers are in a lot oftrouble! That said, anyone who can watch Theft by Deception and call itemotional exploitation is off their rocker. What emotion, exactly, does this dryexplication of the history of federal tax law appeal to?”7) For the grand finale, their response opined the following: “Needless to say,if the Movants’ philosophy regarding the nonpayment of federal income taxes wasadopted, civilization in America, as it [sic] know it today, would cease toexist.” Wow. Once again, here are Tessa’s comments on the matter:“Our philosophy regarding the payment of federal income taxes is that peopleshould not be bullied and frightened into paying more than the law requires. Ourphilosophy is also that the government should be open and honest about its laws,answering the questions of citizens and helping them understand their taxobligations. If civilization in America (as we know it today) is incompatiblewith this, then it needs to be changed for the better.”In a footnote in its motion the government also bashed me for being ananarchist, and for once asking someone the question: “Do you believe there is amoral difference between killing a carjacker trying to take your car and killingan IRS agent trying to take your car? ” No answer, from me or anyone else, wasincluded.(The mother of all “program think” responses has to be the standard knee-jerkresponse to the label “anarchist.” Because so many people associate the term“anarchy” with death and mayhem, many have chosen the somewhat more cumbersome,but also more succinct label of “voluntaryist,” meaning one who believes thathumans should, whenever possible, interact and trade on a mutually voluntarybasis, without using force or coercion, including the force of “law.” In otherwords, libertarianism taken to its logical conclusion. How ironic is it thatsuch a belief routinely gets confused with bomb-chucking punks? And what doesthat have to do with the crime alleged? Nothing. It was included only toprejudice the judge against us.)That was it. That was their “response” to my Motion to Quash. They said nothingat all about the warrant, didn’t even try to rebut any of the arguments I hadmade (didn’t even mention them), but instead gave an absolutely irrelevant adhominem attack against us. Again, I can’t overstate how bizarre that is: weexplained in detail how their raid on our home had violated the law in half adozen different ways, and their entire response amounted to “But they’re bad,nasty poo-poo-heads!”So far in my research into constitutional law, I haven’t yet discovered the“bad-and-nasty-poo-poo-head” clause that makes the Fourth Amendment requirementsnot apply to searches against nonconformists like myself, but apparently ourwonderful “Department of Justice” thinks that saying “They’re bad people!” is asufficient legal argument to justify armed home invasion, confiscation ofvideos, and whatever other Gestapo thuggery they choose to use. They decidedwe’re bad, so we have no rights. That’s good to know.(That particular ad hominem attack/tantrum was by no means an isolated incident.In another of its pre-trial motions, the government claimed that we “choserather than file tax returns and pay taxes to engage in continuous acts ofdisobedience and antagonism toward the government agency tasked with enforcingthe tax laws.” Disobedience and antagonism? You mean like telling them what wewere doing, asking them to meet with us, asking questions about the law, and notaccepting “you owe because we said so” as a sufficient response?)OFFER FROM A TAX FRAUD SCHEMERIn response to their asinine, libelous, legally irrelevant diatribe disguised asa court motion, I sent the following letter to Patrick Meehan, Floyd Miller’sboss and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.May 24, 2004Mr. Patrick L. MeehanU.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of PA615 Chestnut Street, Suite 1250Philadelphia, PA 19106Dear Mr. Meehan,In early May of 2003, the IRS (with DOJ approval) executed an armed raid on myhome based on a warrant which was ridiculously overly broad, completely lackingin probable cause, and which constituted an unquestionable violation of theFirst Amendment, by using the guise of a search warrant to take videos out ofcirculation (see Fort Wayne Books v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46 (1989)). On March 2,2004, my wife and I filed a Motion to Quash that search warrant, citing severalreasons why the warrant and the search were unreasonable, unlawful, andunconstitutional.Your subordinate, Mr. Floyd Miller, filed (two months late) what purported to bea motion in response to our Motion to Quash. However, I was stunned to find thatnowhere in the supposed response did Mr. Miller even attempt to justify thesearch or the warrant, or respond to any of the solidly documented pointsindicating that the warrant and the search were illegal and unconstitutional. Infact, Mr. Miller’s “response” failed to even mention the warrant or the search,except on the first page summarizing the purpose of the motion.Instead of citing or arguing anything concerning First and Fourth Amendmentissues—the only issues actually relevant to the Motion to Quash—Mr. Miller choseto use the “Motion” as an opportunity to malign and vilify me, repeatedly makingthe asinine accusation that the expression of my beliefs constitutes a “taxfraud scheme,” and making the libelous allegation that my primary motive forspeaking out as I have done is personal financial gain (a “get rich scheme” asMr. Miller called it).To be blunt, if that emotional, libelous, unprofessional and legally irrelevant“motion” is any indication of Mr. Miller’s legal knowledge and competence, notto mention his respect for the law and the Constitution, he should be firedimmediately. (Your name also appeared on that motion, implying that you condonesuch a frivolous, substance-free filing.) But pointing out the absurdity of thatmotion is not the main purpose of this letter.If those at the Department of Justice truly believe that I am merely a “taxfraud scheme” promoter, out to make a quick buck by selling videos, then I wouldlike to offer you an easy way to put me out of business. Here is my offer:1) I will transfer the copyright of my “Theft By Deception” video (the onlything related to the tax issue which I have ever sold for profit) to someoneelse of my choosing (but no blood relation of mine), who would then receive allfuture profits from the sale of that video, and my wife and I would agree tonever accept any compensation or gift, directly or indirectly, from thatindividual.2) My wife and I would both agree to never again receive any money, directly orindirectly, from the sale of anything having to do with the 861 evidence.3) Finally, I would determine (with documentation) the total profits received todate by myself and my wife from sales of the “Theft By Deception” video, andwould voluntarily surrender that amount to the U.S. Treasury as a donation.In short, I would retroactively erase every dime from what Mr. Miller(dishonestly) calls my “get rich scheme,” and agree never again to profit fromany sales of anything (written, audio, video, etc.) concerning the 861 issue. Ipledge to do all of that immediately, if and when the government does this onething:The Commissioner of the IRS must assign three attorneys from IRS Chief Counsel(who he deems to be the best qualified for the job) to spend two hoursanswering—verbally, in-person, and on camera—the enclosed six questions abouthow to determine one’s taxable income, as well as any related follow-upquestions I may have.In short, the government need only do what it should already be doing: answeringreasonable questions which citizens have about how to properly determine whattaxes (if any) they owe. If the government will do that, I will shut down my ownso-called “get rich scheme,” and will donate all the profits from past sales tothe United States government.Mr. Floyd Miller, having no legal foundation, and having been caught cooperatingin a clearly unreasonable and unlawful fishing expedition under the guise of an“investigation” (while admitting that we are not hiding what we are doing), hasnow decided to insult me and my wife, impugn our motives, and mischaracterizewhat I am doing. Your response to the above offer will show the public quiteclearly whose motives should really be questioned.Sincerely,Larken Rose[home address redacted](P.S. If the government wishes to accept the above offer, the agreement can beput into the form of a legal contract acceptable to both parties. If thegovernment does not respond to the above offer by the last day of July of 2004,the offer will be revoked, unless I choose to extend it voluntarily.)cc:Mark W. Everson, CommissionerInternal Revenue Service1111 Constitution Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20224cc:John Ashcroft, Attorney GeneralU.S. Department of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20530-0001Enclosure: Questions Regarding Determining Taxable IncomeSo, in short, I offered to put myself out of business permanently, and donate tothe government every penny I had ever made from video sales—which by then, afterthe video had been out for more than two years, was in the tens of thousands ofdollars (not two million, unfortunately). All they had to do was have theirlawyers spend a couple of hours answering questions about how Americans aresupposed to determine what they legally owe—something they should have beenwilling and eager to do for free.Guess how they responded to my offer to give them lots of money and put myselfout of business.They didn’t.So, to sum it up, I filed a substantive, solidly supported motion challengingthe legality of the search warrant, and the government, after the filingdeadline, filed a temper tantrum and called me names, while forgetting to evenmention the warrant they were supposed to be defending.And guess what. The court ruled in their favor.Guess who made that ruling. None other than Magistrate Thomas Rueter—the one whohad rubber-stamped the unconstitutional warrant in the first place. (How manyjudges do you think would give an unbiased answer when faced with the question“Did you sign off on a constitutionally bogus warrant?”) Here was Judge Rueter’sreason for the denial: “After careful review of the motion, it does not appearthat the Government displayed a callous disregard for the constitutional rightsof the movants.”Careful review, huh? Now I feel much better. Thanks for that thorough andobjective constitutional analysis.UNSEALED AT LASTKeep in mind, all of the court skirmishes mentioned above took place before Iever got to see the supposed legal justification for the raid: the “affidavit ofprobable cause” (APC). Well, at long last, over a year and a half after the raidon my home, in January of 2005 the APC was finally unsealed and I received acopy.There was nothing redacted and all the names and facts in it were already wellknown to me, and the government knew it. Why does that matter? Because it provesthat the feds’ pretended fear of revealing identities—the excuse they gave forkeeping the APC sealed so long—was an outright lie.The first thing worth noting about the APC is that it was dozens of pages long,which by itself doesn’t mean much. Here’s the weird part: nowhere does the APCsuggest the existence of any supposed evidence not already in the IRS’spossession. In fact, the bulk of the affidavit talked in detail about theinformation I had already given to the IRS of my own accord. It shouldn’t take alegal scholar to figure out that an APC that doesn’t allege the existence ofanything not already in the government’s possession is bogus.Rather than being about anything I had hidden or lied about, the APC went on andon about what I had done right out in the open. Specifically, the APC explainedthat: 1) I told the IRS about my income, in person and in writing; 2) I toldthem we had stopped filing, and explained why; and 3) they already had mywritten report, my video, and everything from the web sites (which is allpublicly available anyway). Yes, in the very document requesting permission tosteal every copy they could find of my Theft by Deception video, theyacknowledged that they already had it. Nowhere did the APC even allege thatthere was anything we were concealing or lying about. Nice attitude: “We’re notsaying you hid anything or lied about anything, and we’re not alleging thatthere’s any evidence in your house we don’t already have, but we want to do anarmed invasion of your home anyway.” And the Honorable Führer Thomas Reutertwice gave his blessing to that fascist thuggery.(If you find my verbiage a bit too strident here, too bad. When I use terms like“thug” and “fascist,” I use them accurately, and in their literal sense. And ifyou’re wondering why I’m not more polite and civil in my terminology, let meremind you that I’m sitting in a stupid prison camp as a I write this, milesfrom my family, because I committed the sin of telling the truth. Does that makeme a little angry and bitter? Damn right it does. So if you don’t like my tone,you have my permission to put this book down and go jump in a lake.)For the allegations regarding “conspiracy” and attempts to “corruptly” interferewith the administration of the tax laws, the APC went on and on about how I had“advocated” my conclusions about the correct application of the tax laws, on ourweb sites, in my video, in my “Taxable Income” report, on my e-mail list, andelsewhere. If you’re thinking that none of that is illegal, you are exactlyright. If you’re horrified that the government in “the land of the free” wouldtreat speaking your mind—”advocating” your beliefs—as a crime, join the club.(It’s also more than a little nutty to call openly voicing one’s opinions a“corrupt” endeavor.)MOTION TO SUPPRESSThe best way to illustrate the insanity of the IRS’s APC is to cover some of thehighlights of the “Motion to Suppress” which I filed after finally getting acopy of the APC. In many ways that motion was just a beefed-up reincarnation ofmy previous Motion to Quash, but this time we were asking that the court bar thegovernment from using at trial anything it had obtained from the raid on ourhome, on the basis of the search being unconstitutional.The issues raised in my Motion to Suppress included (paraphrasing here): 1) thesearch was unreasonable and unnecessary, as all relevant information was alreadyin the government’s possession and the APC didn’t even suggest the existence ofany evidence the IRS didn’t already have; 2) the warrant was an overly broad,unconstitutional “general warrant”; 3) the search was motivated by a desire toretaliate against me for exercising my First Amendment rights and was not avalid search for evidence of a crime; and 4) the seizure of First Amendmentmaterials was unquestionably illegal.There is something called an “exclusionary rule,” whereby evidence obtained viaan illegal search is not allowed at trial. As my Motion to Suppress explained,the purpose of this rule “is to deter future unlawful police conduct and therebyeffectuate the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search andseizures” ( United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338 (1974)), and while innocentprocedural errors or technicalities should not result in relevant, properlyseized evidence being suppressed, such suppression should occur “where a FourthAmendment violation has been substantial and deliberate” ( United States v.Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984)). And if you think my motive in filing a “Motion toSuppress” was to keep any actual criminal evidence from the jury, read on.As much as I’d like to go into detail about all the points raised in my Motionto Suppress, and all the citations included therein, proving that in every waythey were wrong and we were right, doing so would probably either give a lot ofpeople headaches or put them to sleep. So instead, I will just summarize thehighlights here. For those of you with a high legalese tolerance level, Iinclude the entire motion in the back of this book, as Appendix B. Here are themain points:1) The courts have always held that it is extremely important that actions asintrusive as a forced invasion of someone’s home be used only when completelynecessary and justified.“The Fourth Amendment, and the personal rights which it secures, have a longhistory. At the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own homeand there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.”[Silverman v. U.S., 365 U.S. 505 (1961)]Nonetheless, contrary to what the Internal Revenue Manual instructs, the APCsaid absolutely nothing about why the search was necessary, what hidden evidenceit was needed to find, or why less intrusive means could not obtain the evidencesought.2) The APC itself gave no justification whatsoever for swiping every imaginablefinancial document in our house. In the feds’ response to my Motion to Suppress,here was the excuse they gave for doing so: “To accurately compute taxableincome, it is necessary to identify and account for income that is specificallyexcluded from taxation. Consequently, there are few financial records that arenot directly or indirectly relevant to computation of income. Moreover, thedefendants refused to provide business expenses, preventing the IRS fromaccurately determining taxable income.”Two things are worth noting here. First, they were arguing that they needed awarrant, not to find any hidden income, but to find documentation of exemptionsand deductions we might be entitled to. What? We’re supposed to believe thatthey needed to invade our home so they wouldn’t over-state the taxes theythought we owed?! (The only thing records of exemptions and expenses would do,of course, would be to lower the supposed tax due.) Wow, that was reallythoughtful of them. “We’re just stealing all your records to make sure we giveyou every exemption and deduction allowed.” How sweet. (By the way, they liedagain: the expense records they did swipe, clearly showing that well over halfof the money our business brought in went to the people working for us, nevershowed up in their calculations.)Second, as their own manual explains, neither a charge of tax evasion norwillful failure to file requires the government to calculate someone’s taxableincome: “the government need prove only that a person’s gross income equals orexceeds the statutory minimum” (Criminal Tax Manual, § 10.04[2]). So the 1099forms showing we received substantial income was all the “evidence” they wouldever need regarding our income, though they also had our repeated, openadmissions—on tape and in writing—that we had received that income. (If they had“probable cause” to think we were hiding income or assets, that would have beenanother story, but there wasn’t the slightest peep in the APC suggesting that wewere doing so, and we weren’t.)In its subsequent response, the government blatantly lied about the law (again),saying this: “Although computation of taxable income is not required to provewillful failure to file, it is required to prove tax due and owing for a section7201charge of tax evasion.” But the official manual of the Tax Division of theDOJ, speaking specifically of section 7201 charges, says the opposite: “it isnot necessary to charge or prove the exact amount of the tax that is due andowing” and that “the government only has to prove that a substantial tax was dueand owing”(Criminal Tax Manual, § 8.05[3]). In other words, the government’s bald-facedlie notwithstanding, there was no legal justification for swiping all of ourfinancial records, since the feds already had complete documentation of ourincome. They needed exactly no additional financial information about us for thecrimes alleged.3) The APC failed to even mention the issue of “willfulness,” though it is anessential element of the alleged crimes. An APC, to be valid, must show“probable cause” for each element of each crime alleged. Of course, the APCshowed no evidence even hinting that we believe our income to be taxable. Andwithout that, there can be no “probable cause,” and no justification for awarrant.4) The APC also brought up something interesting that I didn’t know before.After my second meeting with the IRS, I invited IRS supervisor Charles Judge todinner, not to discuss my case but to have an off-the-record chat about what hereally thought about what I had shown him. That meeting is discussed in detaillater on, but it was while reading the APC that I first learned that, without myknowledge or consent and in violation of Pennsylvania state law, Mr. Judgeaudio-recorded that meeting.I’m sure that in putting together the APC, Donald Pearlman really wished he hadsomething, anything, hinting that I don’t really believe in the 861 evidence.Well, he didn’t, so he just lied instead. Speaking of my meeting with CharlesJudge at the restaurant, the APC said this: “ROSE conceded that his argumentmight be wrong stating ‘even if our argument is the stupidest thing imaginable.’He further stated, at one point, that ‘I’m holding out the possibility that I’mjust plain wrong’. ”At the time I was responding to the APC, I didn’t yet have the recording or thetranscript of my meeting with Mr. Judge at the restaurant (I had only justlearned that it was taped), but I already knew darn well that Pearlman hadmisrepresented what had happened there. So in my Motion to Suppress I said thatI was “confident that the complete transcripts of that meeting, which [I] haverequested through the Freedom Of Information Act, will reveal that the selectivequoting of those sentence fragments in the APC was intentionally misleading.”And, of course, it was. Here is the first quote, in context:“I really appreciate you meeting with me, and it’s been really disturbing howfew people inside the system are willing to even talk. I mean, all they know howto do is threaten. I mean, even if I were arguing the stupidest thingimaginable, they should at least say, Here’s why you’re wrong...”Slimeball Pearlman was trying to paint that as me conceding that my “argumentmight be wrong.” To do that, he not only took it out of context, but changed thewords, to make it sound like I was saying that my position might be “thestupidest thing imaginable,” which I wasn’t saying at all.And here is the second quote, in context, which he also mischaracterized:“So, you know, more and more people are getting curious about, well, why can’tthey explain their law to us? This isn’t, you know—yeah, it’s a big mess, and Ieven, around the first of the year I was asking the Chief Counsel’s rep toanswer questions, I was saying look, I’m holding out the possibility that I’mjust plain wrong, and they’re going to come up with some section that says,‘notwithstanding blah, blah, blah—.’ And the fact that they can’t or won’t hasgotten a lot of people’s attention.”Did that look as if I was confessing that I didn’t really believe in the 861evidence? Of course not. So, are we to believe that Agent Pearlman read thetranscript of that meeting and concluded that I don’t actually believe what I’msaying? I guess he missed this part of the transcript:Me: “I seriously would bet my life on the fact that I’m right, and I wouldn’tbet my life on very many things.”Charles Judge: “You believe that strongly in it.”Me: “Yeah.”Oh yeah, that really sounds as if I’m unsure or saying I might be wrong, doesn’tit? Hey, Mr. Pearlman: Liar, liar, pants on fire! Funny how these are the samejackasses who accuse people like me of taking things out of context.5) If you think it’s bogus for the IRS to characterize me voicing my opinions assomehow a “corrupt” endeavor, which the APC did repeatedly, you’re not alone.The courts say that the word “corruptly,” as used in the very section the fedsreferred to (26 USC § 7212(a)), doesn’t just mean being inconvenient: “there isno reason to presume that every annoyance or impeding of an IRS agent is doneper se ‘corruptly’.” (Again, that’s from the DOJ’s own prosecutor’s manual.)What the term actually means is “to act with the intent to secure an unlawfuladvantage or benefit either for oneself or another.” How exactly does saying “Idon’t think my income is taxable” give me (or anyone else) an unlawful advantageor benefit? (What it gave me was a dozen armed thugs invading my home and a yearin prison—not quite what I’d consider an advantage.)6) Further misrepresenting what the law is, in an effort to characterize myperfectly legal activities as criminal, the APC, under the heading of “Rose’sAttempt to Defraud the United States,” went on and on about how I “advocated[my] claims” on web sites, on my e-mail update list, in my “Taxable Income”report, and in my Theft by Deception video, and how I said that the Tax Courtwas wrong, that I hoped the fraud would end, and otherwise spoke my mind. Over adozen pages of the APC consisted of nothing more than whining about all the waysin which I expressed my beliefs. As my Motion to Suppress put it, “rather thanalleging conduct designed to conceal or mislead, the APC instead seeks tocharacterize the mere expression of opinions as criminal fraud and conspiracy.”First Amendment? Never heard of it.Again, First Amendment protections do not depend upon “the truth, popularity, orsocial utility of the ideas and beliefs which are offered” ( NAACP v. Button,371 U.S. 415 (1963)). And even if I were wrong, since when does honestlyspeaking one’s mind constitute “fraud”? Again, the government’s own Criminal TaxManual—why do they even have that thing?—says that “deceit or trickery in thescheme is essential to satisfying the defrauding requirement in the statute”(Criminal Tax Manual, § 23.07[1][b]). The Supreme Court agrees, saying that thewords “to defraud” “usually signify the deprivation of something of value bytrick, deceit, chicane, or overreaching” ( Hammerschmidt v. United States, 265U.S. 182 (1924)). Where did I ever do anything like that? Nowhere, and theynever alleged that I had. In short, their APC proves that they raided my homebecause I had publicly voiced an opinion they didn’t like.Lest you think I exaggerate, the APC puts Agent Pearlman’s delusional attitudeon display for all to see when it opines that Dr. Tom Clayton and I expressingour beliefs using two web sites and a video constitutes “efforts to reach a massaudience in an effort to gain support for ROSE’s agreement, with others, toattempt to defraud the United States and to corruptly interfere with, andimpede, the administration of the Internal Revenue Code.” Wow. Speaking yourmind is now a crime, especially if you hope to convince others to agree withyou.7) The APC mentions that I sent free copies of my Theft by Deception video tonumerous IRS employees, along with a cover letter asking them to take personalresponsibility for their actions and to do the right thing, and that I posted onmy web site the names and office addresses of IRS employees who had been sentthe tape. The APC characterized that as an attempt to “corruptly” interfere withthe administration of the tax laws, because my letter was (they claimed) “adirect attempt to have IRS employees stop enforcing the internal revenue laws.”(Actually, I was hoping they would apply the law correctly for once.) In myMotion to Suppress, however, I pointed out that the Supreme Court says that theFirst Amendment is important, precisely because it allows the people tocommunicate their thoughts and opinions, “whereby oppressive officers are shamedor intimidated into more honourable and just modes of conducting affairs” ( Nearv. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697 (1931)).8) The APC whines about how I attended the meetings a few other people had withthe IRS. Once again, they tried to characterize that as a “corrupt” attempt tointerfere with the administration of the tax laws. Not even trying to hide hislunacy, Agent Pearlman (in the APC) opined that I was using one meeting “as anopportunity to get IRS reactions to his own views ‘on the record,’ therebycorruptly interfering with, and impeding, the administration of the internalrevenue laws.” So, asking the IRS to answer questions or to state its ownposition on the record is now a crime?! In my Motion to Suppress I responded toPearlman’s bizarre statement as follows: “Attempting to get the government tostate its own position on the record is not a crime, nor is it ‘corrupt’ by anysane definition, regardless of who is doing the asking, or in what context.”9) Adding to the list of what the APC pretends is “corrupt” behavior were my“non-violent threats” to take legal action, including the filing of formalcomplaints against IRS employees who ignore the law or procedures. Their ownprocedures say that that is what one should do if he believes that an IRSemployee is engaging in misconduct. Now it’s a crime to complain about IRSlawlessness? Once again, their own manual states that a “corrupt interference”charge “can not be based on nonfraudulent complaint against IRS agents,” and ofcourse there was nothing fraudulent about what I did, nor did the APC allegethat there was.10) The APC also complains about three other people (two of whom I don’t evenknow personally) quoting my publicly available materials in their own dealingswith the IRS. Yep, that too is somehow “corrupt.” Again, in their entire laundrylist of these supposed “corrupt” endeavors, nowhere do they allege that I didanything deceptive or fraudulent.11) The APC complains that Sherry Peel Jackson (former IRS agent) and Dr. TomClayton also had the gall to speak their minds, trying to spread their ownbeliefs, which match mine. I guess that too is “corrupt.” As it happens, thecourts have specifically cautioned that the “conspiracy” statute (18 USC § 371)is so broadly worded that “there is a danger that prosecutors may use itarbitrarily to punish activity not properly within the ambit of the federalcriminal sanction” ( United States v. Shoup, 608 F.2d 950 (3d Cir. 1979)). Yeah,tell me about it.12) Despite the requirements described in the IRS’s own manual, the APCcompletely failed to relate how anything the IRS sought to seize was connectedto any of the alleged crimes. Bizarrely, the government’s own response to myMotion to Suppress admits that “[t] he Affidavit must set forth in detail howthe objects seized constitute evidence of a crime or otherwise relate tocriminal activity.” Why they would say this, in a motion defending an APC whichdidn’t say one word about how any of the items sought were connected to anycrime, is beyond me.13) The APC, of course, completely failed to justify the insanely broad scope ofthe warrant, which sought (among other things), any documents (by any author)having any connection to “any tax-related issues,” and any and all computers anddisks, regardless of content. Amazingly, despite the all-encompassing scope oftheir fishing expedition, they still managed to swipe a bunch of things not onthe list, including the deed to my house, a transcript of a court hearing,“Theft by Deception” bumper-stickers, the list of numbers from my phone’s CallerID, a couple of newspapers, two blank checks, a family reunion video, scribblesmy kid made when she was a few years old, about fifty bucks in cash, and boxesand boxes of unsorted, irrelevant clutter.“It is familiar history that indiscriminate searches and seizures conductedunder the authority of ‘general warrant’ were the immediate evils that motivatedthe framing and adoption of the Fourth Amendment.”[Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980)]Oh, really? No kidding. Regarding their swiping or copying every computer anddisk they could find, my Motion to Suppress not only quoted from the InternalRevenue Manual saying not to do that, but also quoted extensively from a“Department of Justice” publication called “Searching and Seizing Computers andObtaining Electronic Evidence in Criminal Investigations.” In short, thatdocument explains in great detail how the Fourth Amendment forbids exactly whatthey did in my case. (As I pointed out in my Motion to Suppress, a search forany and all computers, hard drives, or disks, regardless of content, in this dayand age, “is the equivalent of conducting a search of someone’s home thirtyyears ago seeking ‘any and all pieces of paper’.”) 17414) The APC made no mention at all of the First Amendment, or gave the slightesthint that any precautions were taken to avoid tromping on our First Amendmentrights via the warrant. Instead, the APC goes on and on, citing the publicexpression of my beliefs as the reason for the warrant.“[W]hile the general rule under the Fourth Amendment is that any and allcontraband, instrumentalities, and evidence of crimes may be seized on probablecause ... it is otherwise when materials presumptively protected by the FirstAmendment are involved.” [Fort Wayne Books v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46 (1989)]You mean government agents have to be particularly cautious when swiping stuffthat could constitute protected “free speech”?“[T]he constitutional requirement that warrants must particularly describe the‘things to be seized’ is to be accorded the most scrupulous exactitude when the‘things’ are books, and the basis for their seizure is the ideas which theycontain.” [Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476 (1965)]I may not be the world’s greatest legal scholar, but “any publications, researchmaterial or other documents relating to the IRS, federal income taxes and anytax-related issues” (one of the classes of things the warrant sought to seize)doesn’t sound quite like “scrupulous exactitude” to me. As my Motion to Suppressput it, “It seems that the IRS does not share in the ‘profound nationalcommitment to the free exchange of ideas’ (Harte-Hanks v. Connaughton, 491 U.S.657 (1989)), or the ‘profound national commitment to the principle that debateon public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open” (New York Timesv. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964)).”Well, it’s pretty obvious why the government wanted to keep their APC hiddenfrom public view. The official document which was supposed to show that I’m anasty criminal did nothing more than complain that I believed something thegovernment didn’t want me to believe, and that I had the gall to publiclyexpress my beliefs. Um, why exactly did that make it necessary to send a dozenthugs to raid my home?“However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on theconscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas.” [Gertzv. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974)]That’s sure not what the IRS depends on. It can’t even come up with a coherentopposing view, much less one that is more compelling than the 861 evidence. Butit can come up with something which, at least to most people, is morepersuasive: terrorism. It’s not exactly a fair fight when one side is allowed touse only words and the other is allowed to use all manner of violence,intimidation, and harassment. My Motion to Suppress sums it all up:“One has to wonder what additional information the Defendants could have givento the government, or how the Defendants could have been any more open abouttheir actions and beliefs, in order to avoid an armed invasion of their home byfederal agents. To have the government committing such acts of forcibleintimidation and retaliation, and to have the courts condoning such actions,based on nothing more than an open, honest disagreement about the law, obviouslygoes against the core purpose of the Fourth Amendment, which is to allow anyone‘to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmentalintrusion’ (Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505 (1961).”FOURTH AMENDMENT? WHAT’S THAT?Judge Baylson ruled against my Motion to Suppress. (If he had ruled in my favor,I highly doubt there would have been a trial at all.) His discussion of theMotion to Suppress was less than two and a half pages, double-spaced (in otherwords, about one page of normal text), which contained a grand total of onemention of case law, which was this:“The warrant, and the affidavit in support, meet the requirements of the FourthAmendment pursuant to Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983) and many othercases.”His memorandum basically asserted, without support or real explanation, that: 1)there was probable cause for the search; 2) it wasn’t overly broad; and 3) itwasn’t based on an improper motive. And then, to top it all off, there was thisline:“The Court rejects the Defendants’ assertions that the government activitieswere in retaliation of the Defendants’ First Amendment activities as frivolous.”Frivolous? Don’t these people have a thesaurus? So Baylson’s ruling assertedthat it was utterly ridiculous (a.k.a. “frivolous”) to allege that the raid wasdone as retaliation against me for me speaking my mind—even though the IRS thugsraiding my home and Dr. Clayton’s home admitted it, and even though the DOJattorneys admitted it, and even though it should be obvious to anyone with an IQabove that of a cabbage. Is Judge Baylson so utterly idiotic that he couldn’tsee what any kindergartner could see: the censorship motivation behind the raid?Or did he intentionally rule against the truth and the law in order to give hisblessing to what he knew was, in essence, a modern-day book-burning?Well, there is a third option: he didn’t write the ruling at all. Either thegovernment wrote it for him, or some brainless authoritarian law clerk wrote itfor him. Though neither would be at all unusual (quite often judges do notwrite, or even read, their own “rulings”), it’s pretty darn pathetic to have afederal judge just rubber-stamp some idiotic diatribe which some doofus puts infront of him. (And these are the people whose “rulings” I’m supposed to revereas incontestable gospel.) But I suspect it was the prosecutors who chose theword “frivolous” for the ruling—it may be the only three-syllable word theyknow. It seems to be what they say when they can’t think of anything else tosay.LYING TO THE COURTAs most people know, lying to the court, or attempting to mislead it, is acrime. Regarding the theft of my Theft by Deception videos, the government didit twice.1) As mentioned before, during the IRS’s raid on my home, I asked Agent Pearlmanwhen I would get my videos back, and he said never. I asked him that again lateron the phone, and both he and Agent Gerald Loke said they would never bereturned, not even at the conclusion of their bogus “investigation.” (Butremember, Judge Baylson says it’s “frivolous” to think the raid was about theIRS trying to shut me up.) Not only was there no shred of legal justificationfor taking any of them, but the Supreme Court also specifically condemns suchcensorship-via-seizure, as cited above. Well, the issue came up in the courthearing about my Motion to Suppress (on May 19, 2005), where I had a chance toquestion Agent Pearlman on the stand, under oath. It went like this:Me: “Since you knew what was in the Theft by Deception video already, and theIRS was already in possession of at least one copy of it, what was the purposeof seizing every copy you could find from my home?”Judge Baylson: “Every copy of the same videotape?”Me: “Every copy of the same videotape, your honor.”Judge Baylson (to Pearlman): “Can you answer that?”Judge Baylson seemed genuinely curious at that point. (I guess he didn’t yetthink the issue was “frivolous.”) Pearlman’s response—his explanation for whythey took the videos—was priceless:Pearlman: “Yes. In consultation with the attorneys that we consulted prior tothe drafting, during the drafting and ultimately at the signing of the affidavitand the search warrant, that is what we concluded that we could seize at thesearch warrant, and we did.”What? No wonder this guy works for the IRS. He has the skill the IRS mostvalues: the ability to use lots of words to not answer a question. When I askedagain what the purpose of swiping all the videos was, Pearlman’s response wasslightly more coherent, if no more valid: he said the videos were evidence of“conspiracy” and attempt to corruptly interfere with the administration of thetax laws. Of course, that bogus accusation still gives no justification forswiping every copy they could find, all still in the shrink-wrapping.But aside from lame, tap-dancing cop-outs, Pearlman said he did remember measking when I’d get the videos back, but then said (under oath): “I don’t recalltelling you that [the videos] would never be returned.” Oh, really? I didn’thave it at that hearing, but later, through the “discovery” process, I obtainedAgent Pearlman’s notes, in which he acknowledged that I asked when I’d get thevideos back, and acknowledged that he said they would never be returned. Liar,liar, pants on fire (again)!But wait, there’s more. In the government’s response to my Motion to Suppress,they made the odd argument that because copies of my Theft by Deception videostill existed somewhere else, it was okay for them to swipe every copy theycould find from my house and from Dr. Clayton’s house. Here is how their motionargued it:“It should be noted that the ‘Taxable Income Report’ was always availableonline, and the videotapes were not wholly removed from circulation (another8,000 copies were warehoused in California, awaiting distribution). ... As theseizure of the videotapes and bound reports did not remove these items fromcirculation completely, there was no infringement of First Amendment rights.”On the stand and under oath, however, I got Agent Pearlman to admit that at thetime the search warrant was executed, he did not “know that any other [Theft byDeception] videotapes were stored in any other location.” In other words, as faras they knew, they were taking every copy in existence. The fact that they weremistaken—that there were other copies elsewhere—doesn’t make their censorshipattempt more benign (it merely makes them incompetent). Yet their motion wastrying to trick the court into thinking that they already knew there were morecopies at the time of the raid. Liar, liar, pants on fire (again)!It may occur to you that, even if they had known of those other copies of thevideo, their argument is still pretty lame. Just because we managed to have somecopies somewhere else that they couldn’t find doesn’t make it okay to swipeevery copy they could find. If you don’t believe me, ask the Supreme Court. Thefollowing is from a case regarding a seizure of materials which were actuallyalleged to be illegal (under obscenity laws). The government has never allegedthat my video is illegal, making its seizure far less justifiable. But even in acase where the government was claiming the materials to be illegal, and wherethey took every copy they could find, the Supreme Court said this:“But there is no doubt that an effective restraint—indeed the most effectiverestraint possible—was imposed prior to hearing on the circulation of thepublications in this case, because all copies on which the police could laytheir hands were physically removed from the newsstands and from the premises ofthe wholesale distributor. ... Their ability to circulate their publications wasleft to the chance of securing other copies, themselves subject to mass seizureunder other such warrants. The public’s opportunity to obtain the publicationswas thus determined by the distributor’s readiness and ability to outwit thepolice by obtaining and selling other copies before they in turn could beseized. In addition to its unseemliness, we do not believe that this kind ofenforced competition affords a reasonable likelihood that nonobscenepublications, entitled to constitutional protection, will reach the public.”[Marcus v. Search Warrant, 367 U.S. 717 (1961)]No kidding. So, to state the obvious, the fact that we had other copies of myvideo stored elsewhere, which the IRS did not know about when raiding my home,did not make it okay for them to steal every copy they could find at my houseand at Dr. Clayton’s house. But the courts didn’t care. One judge after anotherjust rubber-stamped the IRS’s blatant censorship tactics. Oh, I forgot: it’s“frivolous” for me to say that the IRS was motivated by a desire to shut me up.Sorry. I won’t let it happen again.TO SHOW OR NOT TO SHOWAfter the issues relating to the raid on our home, the next most importantpre-trial game had to do with the question of what would be allowed to beintroduced as evidence at trial. To save time and avoid inconvenience, it’snormal for the two sides to argue ahead of time about what the jury will andwill not be allowed to see and hear. (That’s not a good thing to argue about infront of the jury, for obvious reasons.) So, many weeks before trial, thegovernment filed its “motion in limine,” making its case for what it wantedincluded in and excluded from the trial.Keep in mind here, this case was all about the issue of “willfulness,” whichhinges entirely upon what the jury concludes I believed about the law when Istopped filing. If I believed I was required to file, then I committed a crimeby not doing so; if, however, I did not believe I was required to file, thenthere was no crime, whether my beliefs were correct or not. So, in a case inwhich the jury’s only task was to decide what I believed, let’s take a look atwhat the government wanted to keep them from seeing.First off, the prosecutors’ motion said they anticipated that at the trial I wasgoing to “challenge the constitutionality or legal authority of the 16thAmendment, the Internal Revenue Code, and the Treasury regulations.” Whoeverwrote their motion was either utterly clueless and hadn’t bothered to find outwhat I believe before prosecuting me for my beliefs, or he was intentionallylying. (My position has nothing at all to do with challenging theconstitutionality or legality of any law, and the Sixteenth Amendment doesn’thave a dang thing to do with my position.)Next, the government’s motion argued that “the Court should only permit thedefendants to present testimonial evidence that they relied upon legal authorityin good faith, without quoting bits and pieces of the legal authority.” So,according to them, I should be allowed to say I relied on the law, but Ishouldn’t be allowed to show the jury anything from the law. In other words,they wanted me to have to do what they do: give assertions with no evidencebacking it up. (I guess it would be unfair if I was allowed to cite the lawsupporting my position, since the government is obviously incapable of doing thesame for its position—or lack of position.)They also argued that I shouldn’t be allowed by the court to “mask” my“disagreements with the law in a facade of legitimacy by citing to legalauthority in the presence of the jury.” In other words, they wanted to lie,saying I just had a moral disagreement with the law, and they didn’t want me tobe able to correct their lie by showing that my conclusions are based upon thelaw.At least they were fairly blunt about their game. One paragraph of their motionbegins, “In short, juries may not decide what the law is and should not be giventhe opportunity to do so.” As odd as that may seem, and as contradictory tolong-standing principles as that may be, it’s actually standard procedure intoday’s court system. (You can bet that every April 15th, however, the IRSdefinitely expects those same jurors to decide what the law is—as long as theydecide they owe the IRS lots of money.)Then the government’s motion said that while I must be allowed to “testify as tohow [I] interpreted a particular code section or regulation,” I should not “bepermitted to quote portions of code sections or regulations.” Why not? Because,according to the feds, if I was “allowed to quote or display portions of thelaw, the jury might easily become confused as to what the pertinent law was.” Inother words, if I am allowed to show them the law, they might start to think myconclusions are correct. And we obviously can’t have that!Consider the insanity of their request. They acknowledged that “the primaryissue in this case will be the defendants’ willfulness,” but they didn’t want meto be allowed to actually show the jury anything from the law itself upon whichmy conclusions and beliefs are based. How exactly could I show the jury how I“interpreted” a section of law, if I’m not allowed to show them anything fromthe law itself? Luckily, in this case the court didn’t quite give theprosecutors everything they wanted.(Their battiness continued in a later motion, in which they argued that, becausethe question was whether I held a subjective belief that I wasn’t required tofile, “the basis on which defendant reached his opinion is of little relevance,”and therefore “documentary evidence, even that upon which the defendant arguablyrelied, is irrelevant to proving a subjective good faith belief.” In otherwords, since it didn’t matter whether my belief was reasonable, how I reached mystated beliefs and what they were based upon didn’t matter and the juryshouldn’t be allowed to see that stuff. If that makes sense to you, please gohave yourself institutionalized.)In keeping with their usual dishonesty, their motion referred to my report andvideo as “protest documents,” again trying to mischaracterize me as a “taxprotestor” who just doesn’t like the income tax. Their motion went on to saythat “any materials created by [me] such as the video and ‘Taxable Income’report, and offered by [me] into evidence would be either unduly prejudicial orlacking foundation,” and so they wanted all of that excluded from the trial. (Iguess “unduly prejudicial” is government-speak for “it proves he’s innocent.”)Oh, but the government was nice enough to say that I “can refer to thedocuments,” but “without having them admitted into evidence.” So I should beallowed to mention them, but not to quote from them or show them to the jury.Then, using their mind-reading powers, the authors of the government’s motionopined that my “only real purpose in offering these materials into evidence isto preach tax revolution to the jury.” Yeah, I couldn’t possibly have wanted toshow the jury that stuff to demonstrate what my beliefs are, in a case revolvingentirely around what my beliefs are. Since they were inlying-through-their-teeth mode already, they went on to say that those materials(my video, report, etc.) “are more indicative of the defendants’ disagreementwith the law” than of a different opinion about the proper application of thelaw. Of course, if that were true, they would want the jury to see that stuff.But it’s a bald-faced lie: nothing in the report, the video, or the web siteshas anything to do with objecting to or morally disagreeing with the law; it’sall about the correct meaning of the law.TWO KINDS OF DISAGREEMENTThe above brings up a legal technicality that is important to understand—whichis why the government tried very hard to make sure the jury wouldn’t understandit. There are two distinct ways in which someone can be said to be “disagreeing”with the law: 1) His reading and interpretation of the law, for whatever reason,doesn’t match what the law actually requires (in other words, he misunderstandsthe law) or 2) He thinks he owes the tax, but for whatever reason, he doesn’tlike the law.The second kind of “disagreement” (e.g., “This tax stinks!”) is not a validdefense against a charge of willful failure to file or tax evasion. If you thinkyou’re required to file and pay, then failing to do so is a crime, regardless ofwhether you like doing so or whether you think the law is unconstitutional orinvalid. And that is what the courts mean when they talk about “disagreeing”with the law.The first type of “disagreement,” on the other hand, is a complete defenseagainst such charges. As quoted above, the Supreme Court says that an honestmisunderstanding of the law is not a crime; only intentionally violating the lawis a crime (for tax cases). The government tried to muddy the distinction sothey could falsely claim that I was “disagreeing” with (objecting to) the law,when I was doing nothing of the sort.(Actually, in my case I wasn’t “disagreeing” with the law in either sense—Ineither misunderstood nor objected to it. I understood it and complied with it.But since at trial I wasn’t allowed to argue that my conclusions are actuallycorrect, and since I knew the judge would declare that my conclusions werewrong, the jury was only allowed to choose between: 1) I “misunderstood” thelaw; or 2) I disobeyed the law on purpose. Deciding I was right wasn’t allowed.)Last-Minute AdditionAt Tessa’s trial, which occurred well after mine, Cathy Spaulding testified thatTessa and I “felt that [we] weren’t required to file a return.” She also said,“Mr. Rose had his position of the law” and the IRS had “a different position.”She also said that our second meeting had ended at an “impasse,” adding that“they had their position, and we had ours, and that was it.” She also said thatmy position was somewhat convincing, and admitted that when she met with us, shesaid she understood why I believed my argument to be correct. Also at Tessa’strial, Charles Judge testified that at my second meeting with the IRS, I waswell-prepared and seemed passionate about my beliefs, and said he “knew that[we] were in disagreement with Cathy Spaulding’s position, which was thegovernment’s position.” He also said that we had a “disagreement about theinterpretation of the law.”Wait a second. Why would the government’s witnesses keep acknowledging that thiswas simply a case of an open, honest disagreement about the correct applicationof the law, when that is the opposite of “willfulness”? Again, the Supreme Courtsays that the criminal tax statutes are not to be used to penalize “frankdifference of opinion” about the laws ( Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492).If my wife and I simply had a different understanding or interpretation of thelaw, as the government’s witnesses kept admitting during her trial, then wecouldn’t have been guilty of the crimes we were charged with.For a long time—all the way through my prison stay, in fact—I assumed that thegovernment was trying to confuse our juries about the issue of “willfulness.”Only later did I stumble upon evidence conclusively proving instead that thefederal prosecutors themselves really are so clueless that they don’t know what“willfulness” means. In a motion in my wife’s case, the DOJ argued thefollowing:“As the Court correctly instructed the jury, and myriad courts including theSupreme Court have made clear, a disagreement with the IRS cannot constitute agood-faith defense. ... Tessa David and her husband’s ‘studied conclusion’ thatthe Section 861 argument was used to justify their failures to file returns andpay income taxes cannot form the basis of a good-faith defense. ”What?! That is the exact opposite of what the Supreme Court has ruled! The Courtdid say that a “studied conclusion” that the law is unconstitutional—somethingwe have never argued—is not a valid defense against willfulness, but alsoexplained that “a good-faith belief that one is not violating the law negateswillfulness, whether or not the claimed belief ... is objectively reasonable”(Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192 (1991)).The government’s own witnesses repeatedly admitted that we merely disagreed withthem about the proper application of the law, and that we believed our incomewas not taxable, and that we therefore weren’t required to file. But the federaljackasses prosecuting us misread the ruling in Cheek to mean that it is a crimeto disagree with an IRS bureaucrat. Wow, what fascist dictatorship did thesetwits come from? (I think it’s called “Washington, D.C.”) And since all federaltax crimes have the element of “willfulness,” how ridiculous is it forprosecutors specializing in tax cases to fail to grasp the concept?NO DEFENSE ALLOWEDJust when I thought the government’s “motion in limine” couldn’t get anyweirder, it said this: “The defendants should not be permitted to give legalopinions during their testimony, nor quote legal precedent to support theirtestimony.” What?!How the heck can we show that we did what we believe the law requires withoutgiving our legal opinions? They might as well have said, “The defendants shouldnot be permitted to defend themselves,” which is obviously what they were reallyrequesting.They then argued that we shouldn’t be allowed to show that other people,including attorneys and CPAs, have publicly agreed with our conclusions, inorder to show that our beliefs are not so “unreasonable” as they may at firstseem. Why not? Because, their motion said, whether my beliefs are objectivelyreasonable is “irrelevant.” Again, the Supreme Court says the exact opposite:while an honestly held belief does not need to be objectively reasonable inorder to negate willfulness, a jury can consider the reasonableness of a beliefin deciding whether the person truly held that belief. Oddly, the government’smotion then contradicts itself, saying the jury can decide the “reasonableness”of my conclusions in deciding whether I really believed them.(As you will soon see, the government’s entire case can be summed up as “Peoplewith credentials told you that you were wrong,” so it was more than a littleslimy for them to want me to be barred from also mentioning the people withcredentials who told me I was right. You see, in the persecutors’ eyes, it’srelevant and important for the jury to hear about people disagreeing with me,but it’s irrelevant and “unduly prejudicial” when people agree with me, whichthe jury should never hear about.)Their motion also argued that I shouldn’t be allowed to ask IRS agents, oncross-examination, “about Internal Revenue Code sections and definitions oflegal terms, such as what constitutes taxable income.” Hmmm.For the grand finale, their motion said this:“Incredibly, the defendants’ position, articulated on Mr. Rose’s website, duringmeetings with the IRS, and through various documented statements, is that theIRS is knowingly and intentionally misapplying the law. ”Right on! Damn straight! Yer darn tootin’! You finally got something right. And,at the same time, acknowledged that it is my position (i.e., my belief) that myactions are in accordance with the law and that the government’s actions arenot. And holding such a belief makes me not guilty of any willful tax crime. Sowhy did you prosecute me, after conceding my innocence?As an aside, their motion kindly conceded that I would, “of course, [be] free toplay recordings of [my] meetings with the IRS.” At trial, however, they changedtheir tune, and I wasn’t allowed to do that either.So there you have it. In a case where my beliefs about the law were the onlything the jury had to determine, the government asked the court to forbid mefrom showing the jury any section of law, from quoting from any section of law,from showing the jury anything I had written or said about the law (on the websites, in the video, in the report, in letters to the government, or anywhereelse), and even from stating my “legal opinion.” Yes, that’s what our fineDepartment of Justice asked for. And most of it they got.On many issues, Judge Baylson kept saying he wouldn’t make a ruling until later.A couple of months before trial, we were still under the impression that allcorrespondence with the IRS, and our meetings with the IRS, would be allowed,and that the government would not be allowed to bring up our political beliefsor our improved finances. But leaving many of those matters up in the air untiltrial made it a pain in the neck to try to plan the defense, because we didn’teven know what we’d be allowed to present (if anything).HEARSAY OR RECORDPLAY?In the end, the “hearsay” rules were used as the excuse to keep me from showingmuch of anything to the jury. It may be debatable whether the judge was bendingand/or breaking the hearsay rules, but either way the result was a “mock trial”if ever there was one.Genuine “hearsay” does pose a problem. A person testifying about what someoneelse said (the witness hears it and then says it, making it “hearsay”) can beunreliable. Having a bad memory, or misunderstanding or hearing wrong whatsomeone said, or just plain making stuff up makes “hearsay” unreliable asevidence. As a result, in many cases hearsay is not admissible in court, forgood reason.Now comes the lesson in how to take a reasonable concept and distort it intosomething outrageous and ridiculous. Suppose I write a letter explaining myposition and why I’m not filing tax returns, and I send that letter to the IRS.I admit I wrote the letter, and the government admits I wrote the letter. No onedisputes the authenticity of the letter, or that I mailed it to the IRS. So canI show it to the jury?Nope. Why not? Because, Judge Baylson proclaims, it’s “hearsay.” No one heardanything or said anything; I wrote a letter, and no one is disputing that. Nodeal: it’s “hearsay” and I can’t show it to the jury, even though none of thethings which make “hearsay” unreliable apply. So what rational excuse is therefor suppressing it?How about my “Taxable Income” report, which I’ve sent to all sorts of governmentofficials?Nope. Hearsay. Jury can’t see it.Well, at least I can play the recordings of my meetings with the IRS. Even thegovernment’s pre-trial motion conceded that.Nope. Hearsay.How can a digital recording, the authenticity of which no one disputes (the IRSmade their own recordings of those meetings) constitute “hearsay”? If anything,it’s “recordplay,” and unless someone is claiming it was doctored or edited (andno one was alleging that), it’s about as reliable and trustworthy as evidencecould possibly be.Nope. Hearsay. Jury isn’t allowed to hear it.How about all the stuff on the web sites, which I wrote, and which thegovernment admits that I wrote?Nope. Hearsay. Jury can’t see it.How about my video, the one I spent a year and a half making, for the solepurpose of explaining my legal conclusions? How could anything be more relevantto my “state of mind” than that?Nope. Hearsay. Jury can’t see it.How about my “Please Prosecute Me” ad? Surely the jury should see that.Nope. Hearsay.Let’s sum up the insanity here. I was completely denied a fair trial—or any“trial” at all, really, since defending myself was prohibited—under the excuseof the “hearsay” rules. I was supposed to show that I had a “good faith” beliefthat I was not required to file tax returns, and I had tons of evidence provingthat. And the judge, the prosecution, and the defense (me) all agreed that mystate of mind was the only thing the jury needed to decide. (We stipulated tothe other important facts: that we received income and didn’t file.) But, whiletrying to show that I acted according to what I believed the law to require, Iwasn’t allowed to show or play for the jury any statement I had ever made aboutthe issue, to anyone, in any forum, in writing or in person. In case you thinkI’m exaggerating, here is a direct quote from the government’s “trial brief”:“Documents created by Defendant Larken Rose are inadmissible hearsay.” In otherwords, they were claiming that I shouldn’t be allowed to show the jury anythingI had ever written or said that demonstrates my beliefs. Sound fair?What about the government? Oh, didn’t I mention that? There is an exception tothe hearsay rule: they could use any statement they wanted from me, to anyone,in any forum, in writing or in person. No, unfortunately I’m not kidding.PLAYING DEVIL’S ADVOCATEOne of the more unusual “statements” of mine the government wanted to present tothe jury was a recording of a sort of mock audit I did with a friend of mine,where I played the role of an IRS thug, so my friend could practice explainingand arguing the issue. (The IRS got the recording of that when they raided myhouse.) To use the government’s own words, they wanted to introduce therecording of that mock audit “to show that [I] knew and understood the positionof the IRS with respect to the taxability of domestic income and the 861argument.” Yes, I am well aware of the IRS’s completely bogus, inconsistent,baseless, constantly fluctuating position. I also know how to slice and dice it.(Incidentally, so does my friend. He soundly thrashed me in the mock debate. Butthen, it wasn’t exactly fair: he was arguing the truth, while I had the task oftrying to make the IRS’s convoluted and self-contradictory bunk soundconvincing.)I have to wonder: do federal prosecutors understand that when someone in a moviepretends to kill someone, he isn’t actually doing it? Because they didn’t seemto grasp that when I pretended to disagree with the 861 evidence—and theyadmitted that’s what I was doing—it doesn’t mean I actually disagree with it.The fact that I can articulate their stupid, incoherent position better than anyof them doesn’t mean I agree with it. Even the judge could see that mepretending to believe something I don’t really believe would confuse the jurymore than tell them anything worthwhile, so that tape was excluded from thetrial.SELF-SERVINGA phrase Judge Baylson used on several occasions, while saying why I couldn’tshow or play for the jury any of my letters, articles, web sites, radio showinterviews, etc., was “self-serving hearsay.” Of course, only a bonehead wouldintroduce evidence that is not “self-serving,” so what I presume Judge Baylsonmeant is that the statements were self-serving. In other words, I made thosestatements to show the good faith of my beliefs. Yeah, I did. So?So the jury wasn’t allowed to hear them.Consider the ramifications of that rule: There was nothing I could have doneduring all those years to show good faith, to demonstrate the sincerity of mybeliefs, that I would have been allowed to show the jury. Why? Because (thejudge proclaimed) it would constitute “self-serving hearsay.” So going out of myway to explain my position, to document my findings, to seek answers from thosein government (the jury wasn’t even allowed to see the questions I hadasked)—all the things that illustrated that I truly believed that I wasn’trequired to file, and all the things someone with an honestly held belief wouldand should do—were utterly worthless at trial. No amount of openness or honestymade any difference, because it was “self-serving” for me to be open and honestabout my beliefs, so the jury wasn’t allowed to see or hear any of it.I was put on trial for acting on my unorthodox but sincerely held beliefs, butthere was no way for me to demonstrate my beliefs, to show the jury my state ofmind, because all relevant evidence—everything I had said or written on thetopic—was excluded from the trial. Except, of course, whatever the governmentwanted to introduce.You can argue legal and procedural technicalities all you want, but a goodold-fashioned layman’s term describes it best. The term starts with “bull” andends with a synonym for poop. In short, defending myself was forbidden. Ifevidence was relevant, and demonstrated my state of mind and my honestly heldbelief that I did not owe the tax and was not required to file, then I was notallowed to show it to the jury. It’s really that simple, and that insane. It’shard to make a trial any more unjust than that.As an honest citizen who had reached an unusual conclusion, what should I havedone to demonstrate my sincerity? Write to the IRS? Did that. Write to theCommissioner of the IRS? Did that. Write to the Secretary of the Treasury? TheAttorney General? The head of the Tax Division of the DOJ? Write my senators andcongressman? The President? Did all of that. Explain my beliefs, publicly andrepeatedly? Did that. Provide extensive legal support for my position, andask—no, beg—the government to discuss the issue? Did that.I continually did all of that, for many years. And the Honorable Judge MichaelBaylson made sure the jury wasn’t allowed to see any of it. It was not a trial;it was a witch hunt. There was almost no relevant evidence presented: none fromme because I wasn’t allowed to present it, and none from the government becausenothing relevant helped their case. (That’s one problem with prosecutinginnocent people.) So I was looking forward to several days of vilification andcharacter assassination, all with the blessing of the kangaroo court, with noopportunity to actually defend myself. Gosh, what a swell legal system we have.SCUM OF THE EARTHIf you ask me, Floyd Miller and Shawn Noud, federal prosecutors, are the scum ofthe earth. (I mean that in a nice way.) It’s one thing to act as paid advocates,arguing some side of a dispute you’re paid to argue. Even that can get a tadslimy, but to intentionally prosecute someone—to steal a chunk of someone’s lifefor a crime you know damn well he didn’t commit—well, that about takes the cakefor slimeballness. My hat’s off to you—and my middle finger is up at you—Mr.Miller and Mr. Noud, for being unscrupulous, dishonest pawns of a tyrannicalregime.“The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to acontroversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is ascompelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, ina criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shallbe done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of thelaw, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocencesuffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor—indeed, he should do so.But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones.It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce awrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a justone.” [Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78 (1935)]Yeah, right. Go tell Miller and Noud that. (The above quote is from the U.S.Supreme Court, as you may have guessed.) In a case focused entirely on state ofmind, the prosecution did everything in its power—both legal and illegal—toprevent the jury from seeing the piles and piles and piles of evidence showingwhat I believe about my tax-related legal obligations. It wasn’t a pursuit ofthe truth by any stretch of the imagination; it was a desperate attempt toconceal the truth, to confuse the issues, to vilify and malign the accused, andto do everything except honestly examine what I believe. Perhaps their train ofthought in preparing for trial went something like this:“Let’s see, we have to show the jury what this guy believes, and what was in hismind. Well, to start with, let’s make sure they never see any of the things hewrote about his beliefs. Then let’s keep him from playing the recordings of hismeetings with the IRS, at which he explained his beliefs and invited adiscussion of the matter. Then let’s keep the jury from seeing anything he usedto express his conclusions, like his video, his report, his web sites, all theradio shows he was on, and all the letters he sent to the government. Then let’ssee if we can prevent him from even explaining his beliefs, by having the judgeprohibit him from showing or quoting anything from the law. Then we can provehis guilt by slandering him, calling him a tax cheat, and making the jury resenthim.”That was their game plan. It wasn’t an accident, and it wasn’t an “indiscretion”or two; it was a premeditated plan to cover up all relevant evidence in order toimprison someone they knew to be innocent. If they had any evidence suggestingthat I don’t really believe what I’ve been saying for years, of course theywould have used it. They had no such evidence because no such evidence exists.So not only did they have no evidence to prove to a jury that I was guilty, theyhad no reason themselves to even suspect that I might be guilty of a crime.Nothing I had done or said gave the slightest hint that I wasn’t being honestabout my legal conclusions—their own damn witnesses acknowledged that I seemedsincere in my beliefs—but they didn’t care. The truth didn’t matter a bit tothem. Miller and Noud acted as legal hit men, sent to shut me up at all costs. Ihope they are proud of having put an innocent man in prison.As you may have deduced, however, I’m still not going to shut up."},{"pageContent":"PART VI:HERETIC ON TRIALGAME DAYThe months leading up to my trial were frantic, to put it mildly. We gave ourmedical transcription business to someone we knew, both so we could prepare fortrial and so our customers wouldn’t be left high and dry if we were convicted.We did a sort of dress rehearsal of the trial in my parents’ living room, thoughthat was without Larry Becraft, who ended up being my “standby counsel.” (At themock trial, I was acquitted by a jury of my actual peers.) I also went throughthe annoying process of buying several suits and ties—which I hate wearing, andhadn’t worn for years.The trial date was postponed several times, due to our requests and the court’sscheduling conflicts. Once we thought the date was finalized, we arranged tohave our daughter’s favorite aunt come out and entertain her during the trial,and reserved hotel rooms downtown for all of us. Tessa and I had put in a lot ofwork planning our opening and closing statements, expecting a joint trial forthe two of us together. But when Judge Baylson decided to split the trial in twoat the last minute, we had to basically start over and prepare completelyindependent defenses. Then we had to reschedule hotel rooms and plane ticketsfor witnesses. Just before trial, we managed to sneak away for a quick break(with permission from our government babysitters) to land we had recentlypurchased up in New Hampshire.Finally, the day came for the trial to actually begin. We awoke in our hotelroom, got up, got dressed for trial, and took the shuttle to the courthouse,along with a fair number of our supporters who were staying at the same hotel.And then, on the morning of Monday, August 8th, 2005, we strolled into thefederal courthouse in downtown Philadelphia, to be put on trial for reading andobeying the law.BONEHEAD SELECTIONBefore the trial itself could , we had to go through the process of juryselection. Both sides, prosecution and defense, are present as potential jurorsare asked certain questions to see if they have any bias or situation that wouldget in the way of their giving an impartial verdict. The two sides whittle downthe jury pool, and eventually what is left is the actual jury, consisting oftwelve jurors and (in this case) two “alternates”—people who can step in if oneof the twelve can’t continue for some reason. Jury selection is pretty boring,but we were impressed by how many of our supporters showed up to witness it.Not much worth mentioning happened during jury selection. One potential juroropenly admitted, “I’m not very good friends with the IRS, as far as I’mconcerned.” (You and me both, pal.) When asked if he thought he could set asidehis anti-IRS bias and make an objective ruling, he said “no.” Not surprisingly,the judge dismissed him. (Darn.) I later received an e-mail from the anti-IRSgentleman, wishing me luck. I’m sure I would have had more “luck” with him onthe jury, but it wasn’t to be.I requested that another potential juror be dismissed because she was the motherof an IRS employee. I found it slightly humorous when the juror stated that herdaughter worked in “customer service” for the IRS, and when asked to elaborate,said that her daughter’s job is “calling people and telling them to pay up.”Wow, that’s some quality “customer service” she provides. Anyway, that juror wasdismissed as well.One potential juror was a nice lady who really had been a tax protestor in thepast, objecting to being forced to fund the military. She also admitted tohaving “an inherent distrust for the IRS.” Does that make her unfairly biased,or sane? (What kind of moron would trust the IRS?) She did not end up on thejury either.There were a couple of questions that I wanted potential jurors to be asked, onebeing whether they might hesitate to render a verdict of “not guilty” for fearof retaliation by the IRS, but the judge refused to ask them that. The judgealso refused to ask them whether their verdict might be influenced by thepossible political ramifications of a “not guilty” verdict. In other words,would they think “The country will collapse if we don’t find him guilty!”?Once the jury was selected, the judge gave the jury some initial instructionsabout the government having the burden of proof, the jury having to find guilt“beyond a reasonable doubt” in order to convict, and so on. One thing JudgeBaylson said to the jury—which isn’t an unusual instruction, but still seemsridiculous to me—was this: “I specifically instruct you, you may not go on theinternet, you may not open a dictionary, and you may not try to find outanything about the law.” Hmm. Slightly Kafkaesque, if you ask me.THE DEMONIZATION BEGINSThe trial began with the government’s “opening statement,” delivered by ShawnNoud of the DOJ. A transcript cannot convey a person’s demeanor, but all thepeople who were present at the trial can attest to the fact that Mr. Noud 192appeared extremely nervous, if not downright terrified, during his openingstatement. My own mother says that at the time she actually felt sorry for himas he fumbled, hesitated, stammered, and generally looked as if he was about towet his pants. (Mom has since gotten over her pity for him.) Mr. Noud looked alot more like a guilty defendant than a confident prosecutor. Then again, he wasknowingly lying in front of a courtroom full of people who were there to supportme, and I guess that could be a mite stressful. (I wouldn’t know for sure,since—unlike Mr. Noud—I’ve never lied to put an innocent man in prison.)Here is how he began, with all the conviction and gusto of a scared rabbit:“This is a case about a man who knew the law, who defied the law. The defendant,Larken Rose, failed to file tax returns for five years, even after receiving,time and time again, notice from the IRS that he had a duty to file his returnand pay taxes.”Note that so far he had given no hint as to why I stopped filing. Instead, hestarted with a lie, and then went right for envy and vilification tactics, goingon to say that instead of filing returns, I was paying off my mortgage early(which of course makes me the scourge of humanity), and going on a “campaign toharass the IRS.” Oh, that poor, innocent, helpless and defenseless IRS, being“harassed” by nasty old me, who wouldn’t stop asking them questions about how Ishould comply with the law. How heartless and cruel of me. (Good grief.)Mr. Noud went on to summarize the nature of the charges, and promptly lied aboutthe law, just as Floyd Miller had lied to the grand jury. There are threeelements to the alleged crime. Mr. Noud got the first one right: they had toprove I didn’t file (which was pretty easy, since it was formally stipulated,and I’d been admitting it for years). The second element he botched a bit,saying they had to prove I had enough “income” that I would be required to file,without a peep about whether my income was taxable.But on the third element—really the only issue the jury needed to consider—Mr.Noud lied outright. He said that to prove the third element, “willfulness,” thegovernment had to prove that I “failed to file [my] tax returns knowingly andintentionally; that is [I] was willful.” As you’ve seen, that is not what“willful” means. Obviously I “knowingly and intentionally” didn’t file. Itcertainly wasn’t by accident, or because I forgot. It was because I had notaxable income to report. He left off the part about intentionally breaking thelaw, which I did not do, and which is what “willfulness” actually means.Mr. Noud agreed that there was no dispute over the fact that my wife and I hadreceived income, and that we hadn’t filed tax returns for 1997 or since, as wehad been telling the government for years. But, just to play the envy cardagain, he proclaimed that in the five years in question, our medicaltranscription business brought in a total of around $500,000—a half a milliondollars! “That’s an average of one hundred thousand dollars a year,” he added.The obvious message was, They’re the evil rich and you should hate them!Apparently Mr. Noud “forgot” to mention that well over half of our businessreceipts went to pay our typists, with the result being that my wife and I, bothworking on the business, were bringing in less than $50,000 a year. But pointingout that fact, which the prosecutors were well aware of, wouldn’t make the juryresent us as much, so Noud didn’t mention it. (Remember how Pearlman said theyneeded to raid our house to get info about our expenses? He lied. All theexpense documentation they got, they ignored.)After that Noud touched on “willfulness” again, but this time got it right (moreor less). Then he again falsely asserted that I “knew [I] was required to file atax return for each year, and failed to do so.” Did he intend to introduce anyevidence showing that? Nah.The text alone of what he said next conveys some of the sniveling condescensionof the prosecutors:“The government anticipates that the defendant will try to put forth a storyabout how it was he didn’t really know he was required to file a tax return.This ridiculous story, which I’ll refer to as the 861 argument—”At that point the judge, to his credit, cut Mr. Noud off, since opining aboutwhat they think I might say in my defense is not appropriate for an openingstatement.“Ridiculous story”? If my mom wasn’t going to read this book (Hi, Mom), I mighthave a few choice words to say about Mr. Noud. But I’ll refrain.So, you might wonder, how was the government planning to prove that I believed Iwas required to file? Well, according to Mr. Noud, they intended to show that:1) I filed in the past (before ever looking at the law): “He knew how to file areturn.” (No kidding.)2) I knew I had income. (No kidding.)3) The IRS sent me “notices” saying they hadn’t received a return from me.(Yeah, and I sent them “notices” saying that I hadn’t filed one, and explainingwhy.)So far, what does any of that have to do with what I believe about my legalobligations? Nothing.Then Mr. Noud said that “the evidence will show that the defendant put forththis section 861 argument, which stated that he believed that his income was nottaxable.” Hey, he got something right! He went on to say that I had sent the IRSletters explaining “that the income that [I] received as a United States citizenwithin the United States wasn’t taxable.” Right again! So where is the evidencethat I don’t really believe that, without which there is no case?Mr. Noud then declared that the IRS had sent me letters saying “This argument ofyours is invalid; your income is taxable.” The IRS, said Mr. Noud, had told me“eleven times that this 861 argument was not valid.”So, I had explained why I believed my income was not taxable, and some IRSletters said they thought it was taxable. Based on that, Mr. Noud concluded,“This wasn’t about a mistake; this was about a defendant who knew the law andwho defied the law.”“WE TOLD YOU!”Take a moment to ponder the implications here. What they were trying to pass offas proof that I believed my income to be taxable was the fact that someone else(IRS bureaucrats) said my income was taxable. The only way that proves“willfulness,” or even suggests it, is if it is impossible to believe somethingcontrary to what some paper-pusher asserts. The implication is clear (butabsurd): I can’t have believed my position after a bureaucrat said I was wrong.Notice that they had nothing at all from me saying that I think my income istaxable; Mr. Noud had just acknowledged that I explained to the government why Ibelieve I don’t owe the tax.Let’s do a little mental exercise here: I hereby inform you that 2 + 2 = 5.From now on, don’t you go pretending to believe that two plus two adds up tofour, because I just told you it doesn’t. And, as the DOJ’s reasoning dictates,it’s not humanly possible to continue believing something after someone has toldyou that you’re wrong. Oh, I almost forgot:I hereby inform you that 2 + 2 = 5.I hereby inform you that 2 + 2 = 5.I hereby inform you that 2 + 2 = 5.I hereby inform you that 2 + 2 = 5.I hereby inform you that 2 + 2 = 5.I hereby inform you that 2 + 2 = 5.I hereby inform you that 2 + 2 = 5.I hereby inform you that 2 + 2 = 5.I hereby inform you that 2 + 2 = 5.I hereby inform you that 2 + 2 = 5.There, now I’ve told you eleven times (just as the IRS told me), so how can youpossibly claim to still think that two and two make four? (If this reminds you abit of George Orwell’s writings, especially 1984, you get a gold star.)Notice that Mr. Noud didn’t allege that anyone at the IRS ever explained why Iwas wrong, or cited anything from the law contradicting my position; no, allthey needed to do was tell me my income was taxable, and that (according to Mr.Noud) made it impossible for me to believe otherwise. And I do mean impossible:they were claiming that “we told you so” constitutes proof beyond any reasonabledoubt that I thought I owed the tax.(Considering the eventual outcome, apparently those on the jury agreed. I hopethey all get audited. Speaking of which, at one point during the proceedings,though outside the courtroom, Mr. Miller admitted, with obvious frustration,that the IRS was in the process of auditing him. Hmmm, maybe that had somethingto do with why he was willing to repeatedly lie through his teeth to get meconvicted. Maybe there was a little intimidation going on?)Ironically, more than two years earlier, in an e-mail to my list of subscribers,I had facetiously pondered what a prosecution of me would have to look like. Mycomments included the following:“Exactly how will the prosecutor prove that I didn’t really believe it? Imaginethe lunacy of it... Prosecutor: ‘Well sure, you have seven or eight legallybinding citations TELLING you to use 26 USC § 861(b) and 26 CFR § 1.861-8 todetermine your taxable domestic income, but you couldn’t possibly have reallybelieved that, because once a bureaucrat made a legally worthless assertion thatyou should ignore those sections!’” (Me, 5/18/03)As you can see, that’s exactly what they did argue—that was the basis of theirentire case! (I think that e-mail qualifies me for at least “apprentice prophet”status.)MORE OPENINGMr. Noud then said that prior to learning about 861, I had been “looking atother ideas about how to not pay your taxes,” which was also amischaracterization. I had looked into various theories and claims alleging thatthe income tax is invalid, unconstitutional, or was being misapplied. What Mr.Noud failed to mention is that I found such theories and arguments to be flawed,and publicly refuted them. I guess the mere fact that I would even look atunorthodox claims makes me a despicable creep. (How dare I be suspicious of thefederal government?)Now prepare yourself for something truly shocking. Mr. Noud then pointed outthat (brace yourself) our finances improved when we stopped giving the IRS$10,000 a year! No poop, Sherlock. What does that have to do with whether Ibelieved our earnings were taxable? Of course our finances did better, and wouldhave done better whether I believed I owed income taxes or not. But once again,Mr. Noud was not trying to prove guilt—he knew he couldn’t; he was trying tostir up more envy among the jurors.Then he explained how that noble, selfless public servant, Ms. Cathy Spaulding(IRS auditor) had twice “sat down” with me, letting me “explain this 861argument,” and then told me my income was taxable and my position was incorrect.Just listen to the sad story: “She sat down to help prepare the tax returns. Andwhat did the defendant do instead? Did he take her up on her offer? No, he fileda complaint against her and threatened to have her fired.”Oh, evil, heartless me—I wouldn’t take her up on her “offer” to help me preparefalse returns, incorrectly reporting my income as if it were taxable. Out of thekindness of her heart, the virtuous Ms. Spaulding was trying to “help” me givethe IRS money, and I was a meanie to her. Boo hoo. Of course, Mr.Convenient-Omission Noud didn’t bother to say what the complaint againstSpaulding was actually about. He wanted it to sound as if I filed a complaintbecause she tried to “help” me. Hardly. I filed a complaint because sheblatantly and intentionally disregarded and disobeyed both IRS procedures andTreasury regulations, even after I showed them to her, by refusing to properlyprocess my request for “technical advice.”As for “threaten[ing] to have her fired,” when did I acquire the ability to haveIRS employees fired? If I had such a power, there would be about 100,000 moreunemployed people tomorrow. I filed a complaint, which is what IRS proceduressay I should do when one of its bureaucrats disobeys the law and willfullydisregards proper due process. (Not surprisingly, under our fake system of dueprocess, Ms. Spaulding was never punished in any way for blatantly violatingofficial IRS procedures.)To further show what a really low-down sort of fellow I am, the governmentintended to show that I “wanted to end the IRS’s existence.” Damn straight I do!Call me crazy, but I don’t like organizations which illegally rob and defraud myfellow Americans of over a trillion dollars a year. In addition, the charge wasabout not filing tax returns; it wasn’t about wanting to put the IRS out ofbusiness. Just how does my animosity toward the IRS prove that I believe I owethe tax? Wouldn’t I be just as anti-IRS, if not more so, if I thought they weretaking money from people who don’t owe it? Of course I would.As icing on his substance-free cake, Mr. Noud talked about two “judges”asserting that my position (or a position like it) was wrong. That mightindicate what those judges believe, but how does it indicate what I believe? Oh,I forgot: disagreeing with people in government is impossible. That was theentire premise of the government’s case: that I couldn’t have honestly disagreedwith federal bureaucrats.(Incidentally, and as a reminder, the U.S. Supreme Court says that if someoneholds a belief that his actions are legal, there is no willfulness and thereforeno crime, “however unreasonable a court might deem such a belief” ( Cheek v.United States, 498 U.S. 192 (1991)). In other words, for “willful” tax crimes itdoesn’t matter a bit what any judge thinks; it matters only what the defendantbelieves.)So that was it. That was the prosecution’s opening, in which they summarized thecase they intended to present. They didn’t even pretend to have anything from megiving any hint that I didn’t really believe in my stated position. In short,their own opening statement demonstrated that I was being prosecuted, not forhiding anything or lying about anything, but for having an open, honestdisagreement with the IRS folk about the proper application of the law. Is thatsomething someone should be prosecuted for? Look at what the prosecutor’s manualfor the Tax Division of the DOJ says:“There are obvious questions raised as to willfulness when the law is vague orhighly debatable, such as whether a transaction has generated taxable income.... To aid in establishing willfulness at trial, items turning on reasonablydebatable interpretations of the Tax Code and questionable items of incomeshould be eliminated from the case.” [Criminal Tax Manual, § 8.06[2] (”Proof ofWillfulness”)]The manual goes on to quote from the Supreme Court case of Spies v. UnitedStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943), which, as the manual puts it, gave “excellentguidance on the type of evidence from which willfulness can be inferred,”including keeping double books, falsifying documents, destroying records, hidingincome or assets, or engaging in “any conduct, the likely effect of which wouldbe to mislead or to conceal.” Of course, in our case none of that happened, asthe government admitted. We hid nothing, and we lied about nothing. Here issomething from the same Supreme Court case, regarding the purpose of the federalcriminal tax statutes:“It is not the purpose of the law to penalize frank difference of opinion orinnocent errors made despite the exercise of reasonable care. Such errors arecorrected by the assessment of the deficiency of tax and its collection withinterest for the delay.” [Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943)]In other words, if they disagree with my understanding of the law, they aresupposed to try to collect money from me, not prosecute me. But in my case theynever tried to collect. They went right to prosecution, without so much assending me a bill first. Their own opening statement plainly shows that theywere doing exactly what their manual and the Supreme Court says that they arenot supposed to do: prosecuting someone for having a difference of opinion aboutthe proper application of the law.REALITY CHECKImagine yourself walking into a grandiose federal courtroom, about to be put ontrial, facing possible jail time. Now imagine that you’re representing yourself,even though you’re not a lawyer, have never had any formal legal training, havenever been on trial before, and have never even watched a trial before (unlessyou count a few episodes of The People’s Court from twenty years ago). Yourfreedom is on the line, and several experienced government lawyers are going todo their best to have you thrown in prison for up to five years. The courtdocket reads “United States v. [your name].” Wow: the whole government versusyou.I can tell you, it feels really weird. It helped to know that I wasn’t guilty ofthe charges and that the government had no evidence suggesting otherwise. Butsince it was up to twelve couch-potato Americans to make the final decision, itwas still rather stressful (to say the least). It did help to have dozens ofpeople in the courtroom who knew the truth, who knew who the real crooks were,and who were there to support me in my slightly insane endeavor.(At one point I had hoped to have the trial televised, and lots of supporterswrote letters requesting that that be allowed, but federal courts pretty muchnever allow that anymore, so that effort fizzled fairly quickly.)MY OPENINGIt was time for my opening statement. In retrospect, I think the fact that I wasnot very nervous may have counted against me in the eyes of the jury. In thisage of moral relativism and the worship of self-esteem, where everyone’sopinion—no matter how asinine it might be—is supposed to be considered equally“valid,” and therefore (paradoxically) no one is supposed to think that his ownopinion is the correct one, many people see confidence and being sure of one’sconvictions (no pun intended) as arrogance. Perhaps if I had appeared morenervous and worried, the jury would have liked me more. (It seemed to work forShawn Noud.) But having given many talks in public and on the radio, and knowingthe facts of the case backward and forward, I had no uncertainty about what Iwanted to say. Since my opening statement is pretty self-explanatory, mostlyI’ll just let it speak for itself. Here is how it started:“Good afternoon. My name is Larken Rose, and as you heard, I am the defendant inthis case. And with some help from Mr. Larry Becraft, my assistance of counsel,I will be representing myself here.”“As you’ve already heard, this case has to do with taxes. But this case is veryunusual, and should be rather interesting, for several reasons. For starters, asyou will hear when I testify, I requested this; I asked the United Statesgovernment to prosecute me. Now, when I testify you’ll hear why on earth I woulddo such a thing.”“You’ll also quickly learn that this is not your average tax case, where someonewas caught lying about something on a tax return, or hiding their income, ordoing anything deceptive. You will see that from the beginning I have beencompletely open and honest about what I have been doing, and why. You’ll seethat I made no secret about the fact that my wife and I earned income in all ofthe years in question from our medical transcription business, which we have runout of our home—and that that income, as the government stated, was reported tothe IRS on 1099 forms. You’ll also see that we went out of our way to make surethe government knew that despite receiving that income, and despite havingfaithfully filed tax returns for years and years, my wife and I stopped filingincome tax returns. We did not file tax returns for 1997 or any year since.There’s no dispute over those facts; there never has been.”“As an aside, looking at the government’s witness list and exhibit list, itappears they intended to spend a lot of time documenting the fact that we hadincome. I’m not exactly sure what the purpose of that is, because we freelyadmit that we had that income. We have never denied that, and we do not deny itnow. We stipulate to that fact.”(Just a word about stipulations here. When both sides in any case stipulatecertain facts, they don’t need to be proven or argued about. In the weeksleading up to trial, my wife and I kept trying to stipulate to all sorts offacts, only to have the prosecutors refuse to sign their own stipulationrequests. A little later on I’ll explain why they would do such a thing—why theydidn’t want us admitting certain facts.)“I also openly acknowledged, as I’ve said, that I stopped filing tax returns.The relevant question here is Why? Why did I stop filing tax returns? During mytestimony you’ll hear how years ago I assumed, as most people do, that the taxexperts, the people at H&R Block, the people who write TurboTax software, theCPA down the street—I assumed these people knew the law. And when they told mywife and I that we had a tax obligation, we believed them. We assumed they knowthe law and we acted accordingly, paying and filing every year.”“Now, many people dislike taxes, but when I testify, you’ll see that this casehas nothing to do with protesting the law, or complaining about taxes, oranything of that sort. You’ll hear that I used to openly criticize the incometax as being unfair, and economically and socially destructive, and generally abad idea. But at the same time, even in our toughest financial years, my wifeand I filed tax returns and kept paying every year, because we thought we owedit.”“Then you’ll hear how sometime in 1997 I stumbled on something that started meoff on a very strange, almost surreal journey. And when I testify, I will walkyou through that journey. You will see what I saw, and you will hear what Iheard, and you will see what led me to where I am now, standing in front of youon trial—a trial I asked for.”“You will learn how, based on what the law itself says, I came to the strangeconclusion, not that there was some trick or loophole for getting out of payingmy taxes, but that my income was never taxable to begin with—that it wasincorrect for me to file a tax return reporting my income as taxable.”I then went over a few technical points. For example, I explained that by therules of the court, I wouldn’t be allowed to argue about what the law is; Icould only talk about what I “believe” the law to be. While I find that ruleabsurd in a supposed “court of law,” it’s actually standard operating procedurein all federal trials, so I planned accordingly. I had to keep everything interms of my beliefs, while the judge would declare that he and he alone couldinstruct the jury on what the law is.Next, I explained to the jury the concept of “willfulness”:“For many crimes, what a defendant believes doesn’t make any difference, but infederal tax cases it’s different. There’s something called ‘willfulness,’ and awillful tax crime is where an individual does something other than what thatindividual believes the law requires of him. In other words, acting willfullymeans to intentionally break the law. As the court will instruct you, I believe,as long as someone does what he honestly believes is in accordance with the law,even if you think his beliefs are unreasonable, then there is no willfulness,and there is no crime.”I wanted to make the heart of the matter painfully obvious:“I will show you that I stopped filing because of what I found in the writtenlaw, where the law talks about what income is taxable and what income isn’t.That right there is the entire crux of the case: Did my wife and I owe taxes onthe income we received, or didn’t we? I’ll show you why I concluded that we didnot.”I also acknowledged how wacky my conclusions sound at first, saying this:“We all know that popular opinion says, ‘Of course your income is taxable,’ andat this point I can’t blame you if you’re thinking that any claim to thecontrary is preposterous. I can’t blame you, because that’s exactly how Ireacted to the exact same claim years ago.”I told the jurors that they would see that “when I examined the law itself, whatit actually said didn’t match the so-called conventional wisdom.” I continued:“And you’ll see and hear what happened when I confronted the IRS and others ingovernment about what I had found. You’ll see how they were quick to throw outterms like ‘frivolous’ and ‘tax cheater,’ and even ‘fraudulent scheme.’ And Iexpect the prosecution to use similar rhetoric, as they already have, but you’llsee that aside from insults and name-calling, for the last eight years thegovernment has had very little substantive evidence to present about the issue,and has shown me nothing from the law itself which contradicts my conclusions.And of course, that had a major impact on my beliefs.”To counter Mr. Noud’s mischaracterizations, I also threw in this:“You’ll also hear, when I testify, that this was not something I just believedright away. In fact, it was something I disbelieved right away. As thegovernment mentioned, yes, I had looked into many so-called tax protestortheories, claims that the tax was invalid, or we didn’t owe it, or things ofthat nature. But I found that those theories didn’t hold water, and I continuedto file and pay. I studied them for myself and found that, no, they wereinvalid. They sounded good—gosh, I wish they were true, but they weren’t, so Ikept filing.”“But then something very strange happened. I heard about another claim, with asimilar-sounding ‘punchline,’ if you will. But when I looked into it, instead ofdisproving it, I found more and more evidence supporting it—evidence from thelaw supporting it, which is not at all what I expected to find.”“You will see how the laws of this country, all by themselves, led me toconclude that popular opinion about the income tax is dead wrong. I will showyou sections of the law that I discovered that say something dramaticallydifferent from what I always assumed the law said. And you’ll see and hearevidence demonstrating that many tax professionals, including IRS employees, arecompletely unaware that these sections of law even exist, and so reach theirconclusions based on an incomplete picture of the law.”“When I testify, you will see things in the law you have never seen before. Now,the tax code is renowned for being insanely long and complicated, but this isnot about some loophole, or a typo, or a mistake. I’m talking about where thelaw addresses the most basic issue: who owes federal income taxes and whodoesn’t. This isn’t about some philosophical theory or some complaint abouttaxation in general. This case is about what certain specific sections of thelaw say about a certain specific tax: the federal income tax. That’s all.”After pointing out that the jury isn’t even allowed to decide whether myconclusions are actually correct, but is only to decide whether I believe myactions to be in compliance with the law, I made sure to add this: “At the end,when you deliberate, if you have questions about what the law is, I believeyou’ll have an opportunity to ask the judge.” In the end, however, they neverasked the judge anything. After the entire trial, they had a grand total of zeroquestions about the law. Keep that in mind when you see the things I showed themover the course of the trial.“When something runs counter to conventional wisdom, of course you hesitate tobelieve it. And you’ll see, not only that I did not reach my conclusions withoutfirst doing extensive and thorough research of my own, but that during myresearch I also went out of my way to seek out opposing views from those insideand outside the government.”“You’ll also hear how along the way, various credentialed individuals did theirown research into the issue, and ended up agreeing with me. And you’ll hear thatmany still disagree with me—obviously, or there wouldn’t be a trial about this.You’ll learn that I don’t believe that whether something is true or not isdetermined by how many people believe it. Almost everyone used to think theearth was flat, and all of the learned scholars of the time ridiculed the claimthat the earth is round, and even imprisoned some people for saying so. When Itestify, you’ll see that I believe the way to find the truth is not by blindlybelieving anyone’s opinion, but by examining the evidence.”“And when I testify, you’ll see the contrast between the responses of those whoended up agreeing with me, and the responses of those who still insist that I’mwrong. On the one hand, you’ll see thorough, objective analysis of all of theevidence, not just a section or two out of context. And you’ll see that as hardto believe as my conclusions are, more and more rational, educated Americanshave come to agree with it, including CPAs and attorneys, and including formerIRS employees and a former federal prosecutor, in addition to thousands of otherAmericans.”“On the other side, you’ll see that the people who are supposed to be experts onthe tax laws made it quite plain that they really couldn’t refute what I wasshowing them. Many have been quick to say ‘That’s ridiculous!’ Usually followedby ‘You’ll get in trouble if you believe that.’ Well, lots of people got introuble for believing the earth is round, too, but they were still right.”“You’ll hear how I asked to meet with the IRS to discuss the matter. Afterasking several times, they met with me, twice, as the government mentioned. Iintend to play the actual recordings of those meetings I had with the IRS, soyou can hear for yourselves how they responded to what I was showing them fromtheir own law books. You’ll also see what happened when I and many others sentletters to various government officials, politely asking for clarification,asking perfectly reasonable questions, based completely on what the law itselfsays, about how to determine taxable income. I think you will be stunned by someof the nonresponsiveness of some of our public servants; their garblednon-answers, their unwillingness to engage in a rational discussion, theireagerness instead to hurt anyone who would challenge conventional wisdom. Youwill see that our openness and honesty was met with threats and insults by somein government.”“You will learn how it wasn’t long before my journey wasn’t just about what mywife and I did or did not owe anymore. It was about uncovering what I believe isthe largest financial fraud in history, perpetrated by the United Statesgovernment, and my efforts to expose that fraud for all to see, in the hopes ofending it. You’ll hear how, for that purpose, I asked the United Statesgovernment to prosecute me. I was sure then, and I am sure now, that if anytwelve Americans are allowed to hear the whole story that has led up to this,they would easily see that I have committed no crime, and would never vote toconvict. And I am still willing to bet my freedom on that.”Since the jury was not allowed to see the whole story (as you’ll soon see), oreven a tenth of the story, the accuracy of my prediction remains uncertain.“In this case, in deciding which things I should talk about when I testify, andwhich documents to present as evidence, my challenge was not finding enoughstuff to present; it was figuring out how to limit it to just the most essentialthings, because we could easily spend months in here going through the volume ofcitations and information and evidence I went through before reaching myconclusions. Cutting it down to a couple days, however, creates a huge challengefor me, because I will have only a few short hours to expose you to some of theevidence that I have spent thousands of hours going over, and going over, andresearching, and questioning, and researching some more. And in that shortamount of time, I will be competing with your lifetime of hearing theconventional wisdom, including from those who are presumed to be well versed inthe law: CPAs and attorneys.”“I certainly wasn’t convinced in a couple days, and I don’t expect you to beeither. However, I am certain that even after just a few hours, based upon justa small sampling of the letters I’ve written, meetings I’ve had, sections of thelaw I’ve studied, you at the very least will know that I am doing exactly what Iunderstand the law to require, and that I strongly feel, not just that what Ichose was justified, but that I had a moral, legal, and patriotic duty to doexactly what I did.”I must say, sitting here in prison going over these transcripts, the more Ireview the case, the more I want (figuratively speaking) to strangle thebraindead jurors who unanimously declared, at the conclusion of the trial, thatthey didn’t even have a “reasonable doubt” about my beliefs: they knew Ibelieved I owed the tax. Gack.“Again, the facts of what happened here are not in dispute. I earned money and Idid not file. Really the only question for you is simple: Did I do what Ibelieve the law requires or not? If by the end you are convinced beyond areasonable doubt that I set out to break the law, then do your civic duty andfind me guilty. But if you instead conclude that I believed I was obeying thelaw, whether or not you think my beliefs are reasonable, then find me notguilty. I believe that the evidence will show, unmistakably and undeniably, thatI have committed no crime—that I have done exactly what I believe the lawrequires of me, and that my understanding of the law, though obviously contraryto popular opinion and contrary to what some people in government loudly assert,is nonetheless solidly based on the law itself.”“On a final note here, as the defendant I’m supposed to be on the defensive, butover the course of this trial, it should become obvious that this case is notjust about me proving my innocence. Keep in mind, this is not a case of someonegetting caught doing something sneaky. I ran full-page ads telling thegovernment what I was doing and asking them to put me on trial. I chose to gothrough this. Who would choose trouble just to try to get out of it again?Nobody. There is something far more important to me here than just being foundnot guilty. By the end of this trial, I hope you’ll understand what it is.”“Thomas Paine once said, ‘If there must be trouble, let it be in my day, that mychild may have peace.’ Well, I saw trouble which could not be avoided except bytolerating an injustice, and I was not willing to do that. I believe it is myduty to fight this fight.”“So after the government finishes its case, you’ll be hearing from me again, andI’m certain that by the end of this trial, you will know that if anyone here isbreaking the law, it certainly is not me. Thank you.”That was how day one of the trial ended. We all headed back to the nearby hotelwe were staying at and started preparing for the next day. At this point I wasfeeling good, and all our supporters seemed to think that things were goingquite well.DAY TWO BEGINSThe trial resumed a little after 9:00 a.m. the next morning (8/9/05), with thegovernment starting its case. I got to play the strange game of referring tomyself as “the defense,” just as Mr. Baylson called himself “the court” and theprosecutors called themselves “the government.” (Given the choice, I would havecalled them something considerably less polite but a lot more accurate.) At mytable, other than myself, were Larry Becraft (my “standby counsel”) and DonTraub, the guy managing the computer display stuff which was hooked up to thecourtroom’s electronic monitor system. At the other table sat Floyd Miller andShawn Noud, and their own technical dude (who wasn’t nearly as good as mine).For their first witness, the government called Mary Soma, an IRS employee I hadnever heard of before. She was being called to testify about what the IRSrecords showed about my case, which is basically that we received income butdidn’t file returns. Why, you might ask, would they bother calling a witness totestify about that when we openly admitted it? Good question, which I’ll answerlater.The prosecution had Ms. Soma testify, in the most boring and tedious mannerpossible, that IRS records showed no returns being filed by us for 1997 or anyyear since, and that the IRS had sent out notices “asking [me] for a return.”Those automatic form letters, she said, were sent out on 8/9/99 and 10/4/99.Whenever income is reported to the IRS by payors, but no return is filed by therecipient of the income, the IRS computers automatically spit out “CP” (computerparagraph) letters asking for a return. Therefore, because the people who paidus for doing medical transcription reported those payments to the IRS, the IRScomputers flung out those “reminder” letters to us.Ms. Soma then testified to the equally non-surprising fact that IRS recordsshowed that we had filed returns for years up to and including 1996, and thatthose older returns showed us making about $40,000 a year, about $10,000 ofwhich we sent to the IRS. (Again, all of this had already been stipulated.)Then Ms. Soma testified about the records showing that we later filed “claimsfor refund” for 1994 through 1996, asking for money back which we had alreadysent to the IRS for those years (before learning what the law says). Ms. Somatwice incorrectly stated that our claims for refund were alleging that we had no“income,” which is not at all the same as saying we had no taxable income, whichis what the claims actually said.Then she mentioned that the records showed that the IRS imposed two $500“frivolous return” penalties on us for daring to file claims mentioning 861.Actually, the IRS never sent letters saying they had imposed such fines, butinstead sent a letter demanding $1,000 (two times $500), without giving any cluewhat the demand was based upon. (After we figured out the reason for it, I wroteto the IRS, pointing out that despite their blatant lies to the contrary, theirown regulations said that we had the right to appeal any such penalties beforepaying them. We were never allowed to do so.)The prosecution then had Ms. Soma read what I had written on one claim forrefund, in the space provided for explaining the reason why the original returnwas being amended. She read it, with only a few errors, to say this: “Initiallywe incorrectly assumed the specific remuneration received was subject to thetaxes imposed by 26 USC § 1 and 26 USC § 1401 [the self-employment tax]. Onexamination of 26 USC § 861 and the regulations thereunder, it is clear that ourspecific type of compensation is exempt from these taxes.”Obviously we were not saying we had no income, and Ms. Soma corrected herselfthen, saying, “They’re changing the compensation they received as not beingtaxable income.” Then she read the explanation on another of our claims, whichsaid, “On filing the original return for 1996, we assumed that the paymentsreceived in 1996 were subject to federal taxation. We now realize that theincome did not derive from a taxable source and is exempted by law fromtaxation.” Then the claim said to see the attachment for further explanation,but the government’s exhibit didn’t include any attachment.Ms. Soma then explained that no refunds were issued to us, but letters were sentto us saying that the IRS was denying our claims. What was their reason fordoing so? The entire explanation, in a letter sent to us in late 1998 from a“Maryanne Joyce” at the IRS, read as follows: “Your claim has been reviewed, anda determination has been made that the income is taxable.” What determination?Made by whom? Based upon what? It didn’t say. In another letter denying ourclaims, the explanation was “The amounts you received are gross income asdetermined by the Internal Revenue Code.” Who determined that? Under whatsections of the code? How did they determine that? It didn’t say. (As you mayhave noticed, they are quite fond of the “because we said so” argument.)Then Ms. Soma read from another letter, sent to us by the IRS on April 3rd of2000, saying that “All the theories which [we had] presented have been contestedmany times in the courts, including the Tax Court and various United StatesDistrict Courts. They have been determined to be meritless and in some casesfrivolous.” Which cases? Determined by whom? Based on what? The letter didn’tsay, but it did go on to say this: “Therefore, we will not further debate yourtheories or legal decisions with you.” Swell. Nothing like a baseless assertion,followed by a refusal to talk, to prove me wrong.Ms. Soma then admitted that “anything that comes into any [IRS] service centerthat may appear to be frivolous information is all sent to Ogden for them tomake a determination.” In other words, if you mention 861 or any otherunpleasant ideas, you get special treatment, and your case is whisked off to thebuffoons in Ogden, Utah (buffoons like Jim South, mentioned before). Then youget an asinine form letter back, with a rubber-stamp “signature” from a probablynon-existent thug by the name of “Dennis Paiz” or “Dennis Parizek,” threateningand insulting you.Then Ms. Soma read from yet another letter, saying that my position “has nobasis in law” (oh, really?) “and represents a frivolous position.” That letteralso ended with the ever popular “we will not respond to any futurecorrespondence from you concerning these same issues.”(Remember, the IRS “mission statement” says that the IRS exists in order to helppeople understand and comply with their tax responsibilities, and, amazingly,their official regulations also say that the IRS “encourages the discussion ofany Federal tax matter affecting a taxpayer” (26 CFR § 601.501(c)). I guess theymean any matter other than 861.)Finally, Ms. Soma read from a letter that actually mentioned a section of law!It said this: “Section 63 defines taxable income generally as gross income minusthe deductions allowed by chapter one.” If that sounds familiar, it’s because myreport, my video, and this book all explain it. That was the extent of the IRS’slegal analysis. There were no more sections of law cited, and no more talk oftaxable income.So that was why the government called Ms. Soma: to say a bunch of things thathad already been stipulated (about our income, our not filing, and our claimsfor refund) and to read from IRS letters basically saying “that’s frivolous andwe’re not gonna talk to you anymore; nah-nah na-poopoo.”CROSS-EXAMINATIONThen it was my turn to cross-examine Ms. Soma. First, I asked whether those IRS“reminder” letters are the result of some legal analysis, or whether they’resent out automatically when payments are reported to the IRS but no return isreceived. Here is how that went:Me: “So if, for example, someone reported on a 1099 income which was actuallyexempt, would the computer know the difference, or would it still spit out oneof these notices?”Ms. Soma: “The 1099 information that we receive would generate this notice ifthere was no return. We’re not looking, at this point, if it’s exempt or not.That would be looked at further down the line.”So they weren’t even claiming that a Form 1099 is proof that taxable income wasreceived. I then asked her, when someone gets one of those notices and writesback to the IRS, “explaining why no return had been filed” (which I did inresponse to all of the notices I ever received), “would that have shown up onthe exhibits we’ve looked at? ” She admitted that it would not show up in thoserecords. “As far as correspondence coming back in, ” she said, “explaining yoursituation or whatever, no, there would not have been something like that putonto the master file” (meaning the IRS system of records we were looking at).How convenient for them. They can say, “Look, we sent him letters,” without alsoshowing whether the person responded to those letters (which, again, I alwaysdid). Next, I asked her to read a line from one of the letters—a line that theprosecutors did not have her read. It says: “If you believe you are not requiredto file or have previously filed, please contact us” by phone or in writing,which is just what I did. But they wanted to look only at records which don’teven show if anyone responded or not.(In a really bizarre twist, which I still cannot fully explain, the IRS’sinternal records about our case include an entry dated 3/19/2002, which saidthat Diana Loden, an IRS agent who took over our cases after the meetings,stated that the Examination division of the IRS “does not want Tessa David &Larken Rose to actually file tax returns.” Got that? The IRS didn’t want us tofile. The same entry later said that they might not want to continue “trying tosecure the returns if Exam does not want actual filing of tax returns.” Whywould they not want us to file? Heck if I know. Maybe they were afraid we’d filereturns showing no taxable income, or maybe they wanted to prosecute us for notfiling. Whatever the reason, for all their indignant whining about us notfiling, it’s interesting to note that they didn’t even want us to file. Thisprobably explains why the IRS fell silent for two years after our secondmeeting. I suppose they thought that the “Criminal Investigation Division” ofthe IRS would do a better job of shutting me up.)Next, I asked Ms. Soma about the attachment to one of our claims for refund,which was missing from the government’s exhibit. (I later found that attachment,which cites regulations supporting my position. And I found it in thegovernment’s “discovery” files. Gee, I wonder why the government chose to removeit from the exhibit.)Then I brought up the first IRS letter she had talked about, telling me myconclusions are wrong, and asked, “In this letter, do you see any quotationsfrom any income tax statutes or regulations explaining the basis of thatstatement? ” She said “no.” Did the so-called “notice” explain what the IRS’s“determination” was based upon, or give any sort of legal explanation? “No.”Then I brought up the second letter. “Do you see any quotation of any income taxstatute or regulation in this letter supporting the statements of the IRS? ” Sheanswered: “Not in this letter.” How about in the third letter? Was there anyquote from, or citation of, any statute or regulation? “No.” Same question forthe fourth letter: any law cited? “No.” In the fifth? “No.”Then Mr. Noud had a chance to do what is called “redirect examination” of Ms.Soma, to follow up on things addressed during my cross-examination of her. Hewanted to point out that one letter (as noted above) did mention, but did notquote from, sections 61 and 63. Whoopie. On follow-up I asked Ms. Soma if theletter made any mention of Section 861. “No.”So, after about an hour of mostly pointless testimony, Ms. Soma was dismissedand we took a mid-morning break. Just to keep it fresh in our minds, let’ssummarize the government’s case so far:1) We received income (stipulated).2) We stopped filing (stipulated).3) The IRS computers sent us form letters asking for a return.4) The IRS sent us letters asserting that my conclusions were wrong, withoutexplaining how or why, and with only one of them mentioning any statute orregulation (and that one was just about the general definitions I mentionedbefore).MORE TIME-WASTINGAt about 11:00 a.m. the government called its second witness, the office managerfor the doctors for whom we did medical transcription. What did they want her totestify about? What our business does and what we were paid. Wasn’t all of thatalready stipulated? Yes. So what was the point?Presenting testimony, displaying canceled checks, and generally putting on ashow about us making money tend to give the impression, even if onlysubconsciously, that we were hiding something, and that this was important“evidence” uncovered by the diligent prosecution. In reality, it was a big, fat,stupid waste of time.At one point I objected to their pointless dog and pony show, pointing out thatall of what they were talking about had been stipulated already. The judge evenexplained to the jury that “by entering into a stipulation, it sometimessimplifies the case, because instead of presenting lengthy testimony aboutdetailed documents, in this case they’ve reached a stipulation about certainfacts.” Well said. However, immediately after saying that, Judge Baylsonoverruled my objection and allowed the government to waste more time harping onundisputed facts and figures. So we got a chance to look at checks made out tous, one at a time, see bills we had sent to our customers, and heard testimonyabout other things that were never in question.After more of that, and no sign that it was ever going to end, I objected again,pointing out that “there are hundreds and hundreds of pages of stipulated factsand figures.” Judge Baylson then asked Mr. Noud what his intentions were, andpointed out that “the amounts [of income] themselves have been stipulated to;isn’t that correct? ” The unnecessary banter only dragged on a bit longer afterthat.(Interestingly, regarding Tessa’s subsequent trial, when her attorney askedFloyd Miller why the government wanted to include so much evidence and testimonyabout income numbers which were already stipulated, Miller proclaimed, right infront of me, that if he didn’t present that undisputed, boring, factual stuff,he would have no case. Well, then, maybe he shouldn’t have prosecuted her.)On cross-examination, the only thing I bothered to bring up was the fact thatthe amounts paid to us were not all profit for us, and that much of it went tothe typists who worked for us. As a result, contrary to what the governmentwanted the jury to think, we were not making anywhere near $100,000 a year fromthe business—in fact, it was less than half of that.THINGS HEAT UPNext the government called Cathy Spaulding (IRS agent) as a witness. At last,things were getting interesting, or at least stopped being painfully boring. Upuntil then, the SpongeBob SquarePants screensaver on Floyd Miller’s laptop (Ikid you not) had been the most interesting thing at the trial.Mr. Noud began by asking Ms. Spaulding to explain the nature of her job at theIRS, and then explain how she got involved with our cases, both concerning ourclaims for refund and the fact that we had stopped filing. Ms. Spaulding’s firstlie was saying that she contacted me about our claims for refund, asking, “Couldwe schedule a meeting to get together? ” In reality, I had been the onedemanding such a meeting for a couple of years, while the IRS was trying toavoid giving me one.Then Ms. Spaulding testified about our first meeting, back in April of 2000,regarding our claims for refund. She correctly said that at the meeting, Iclaimed that I had no taxable income, and therefore wanted the money back I hadalready sent to the IRS. Her summary of the disagreement was that the IRS’sargument was based “mainly on Section 61,” while I was “referring” to Section861. At least she acknowledged that I “didn’t deny that [I] received thisincome,” but that I said “that it should not be considered taxable income.” Verytrue. Then she said that I had argued that “861 should supersede 61,” which isnot true. When asked how she responded to my position, she answered as follows:“Well, my response was that, you know, Mr. Larken [sic] , you’re incorrect; 61dictates that compensation for services is one of the things that we considergross income.”She sounds pretty sure of herself, don’t you think? However, on the stand shethen admitted that initially she said (at the meeting) that she “wasn’t familiarwith 861,” but told me she thought I was incorrect, and said she “would do someresearch on that.” She testified that at the meeting she also told me that she“did not think 861 would apply in [my] circumstances.”Let’s pause the story for a moment to do what I was not allowed to do at trial:examine the actual transcripts of the meetings, to see what Ms. Spaulding reallysaid. For example, when I asked at the meeting whether she agreed that Section861 and following, and the regulations thereunder, “determine the sources ofincome for purposes of the income tax” (which is exactly what the regulationssay), she answered: “I cannot give you a definitive answer right now withoutdoing further research on Section 861.” Later on, she added, “At this point Iwould say, as I stated before, under Section 61 it is taxable income; under 861,I’m not familiar with it, but if you were gonna push me with it, then I wouldsay I would disagree with your findings, but I want to do some additionalresearch.” She doesn’t sound so sure of herself there, does she? At the samemeeting, I also asked her whether or not she agreed that “26 CFR 1.861-8 andfollowing are specifically what I should use to determine taxable income fromsources within the United States.” Her response was this: “I would say Section61 and Section 63 are used to determine gross income and taxable income. As faras the regs, I can’t answer. I admit, I’m much more familiar with the Code,because that’s primarily what we use.” (Actually, what they primarily use isrumor and wild guess.)Remember, at trial the government was claiming that Ms. Spaulding and her fellowIRS bureaucrats had told me I was wrong and shown me the error of my ways. Whatreally happened at that first meeting, when I kept asking how they thought Ishould determine what I owe, was that they kept responding with gems like this:“At this time I think you want to sort of tie us down to an answer, which Ican’t do right now.” Was I really supposed to be persuaded by such confessedcluelessness and uncertainty? At the actual meeting, I asked them just that:Me: “You personally have had my [Taxable Income] report for weeks. The Servicehas had my report for more than a year. This argument has been around forseveral years. And, as I understand it, there are special sections of the IRSdevoted to trying to come up with a response to this. Now, you’re implying thatI owe you something and that I have some requirement to file, and in your letteryou even mentioned that you were gonna ask me to file later returns. Is thisreally what’s supposed to persuade me here?”Ms. Spaulding: “No.”Me: “Am I supposed to be persuaded by this?”Ms. Spaulding: “No, we’re not saying you’re supposed to be persuaded.”But at the trial, where I wasn’t allowed to show the jury those transcripts orplay the actual recordings of the meetings, that is exactly what they weresaying: that the boneheaded stammerings of these ignorant paper-pushers shouldhave made me completely abandon my conclusions. In fact, the government wasimplying that it was impossible for me to still believe in the 861evidence,having been put in my place by the brilliant and knowledgeable Ms. Spaulding.(Ironically, at Tessa’s trial, Ms. Spaulding testified that she found myargument to be somewhat “persuasive.” I can’t say the same for hers.)During her testimony at trial, Ms. Spaulding then tried to pass the buck, sayingthat she had “mentioned that there were a couple of court cases” disputing myposition. In other words, she couldn’t tell me where I was wrong, but she toldme that some courts could. Only one problem: it was a lie. Ms. Spaulding nevercited any court case at either of the meetings I had with her. Michael Enz, IRSSpecial Buffoon, brought up one irrelevant court case which then exploded in hisface, with Mr. Enz eventually conceding, “I misread it.” That was all. At trial,Ms. Spaulding said she couldn’t remember which court cases she had cited, butthat “it’s in the transcripts.” Those would be the transcripts I was not allowedto show to the jury, which show that Ms. Spaulding never cited a single case.(In a pre-trial motion, the government claimed that at our meeting on September22nd of 2000, Ms. Spaulding “stated that the 861 argument was frivolous and hadbeen rejected by the courts.” Neither was true: she never used the word“frivolous,” or anything of the sort, and never once mentioned the courts ateither meeting. So apparently Ms. Spaulding and the DOJ lawyers suffer from thesame “creative memory syndrome.”)When asked whether the IRS had shown me anything at that first meeting thatproved me wrong, Ms. Spaulding mentioned the editorial explanation found in theCCH printing of the code (comments of the printers), adding, “it’s not,quote-unquote, the law, but it’s a good interpretation of the law.” Great,another opinion carrying zero legal weight.In her testimony, Ms. Spaulding admitted that, when I requested that the issuebe sent to the IRS lawyers via the procedure called “technical advice,” sherefused to send it to them. Then Mr. Noud had Ms. Spaulding read herawe-inspiring, extremely thorough rebuttal of my conclusions, as it appeared inher denial of our claims for refund: “Per Internal Revenue Code Section 61, [wewere] liable for income taxes” on our transcription business income. (I wonderhow much time and effort it took for her to come up with that brilliant treatiseon federal tax law.)Having dramatically mischaracterized our first meeting, Ms. Spaulding thentestified about her second meeting with me, this one concerning the fact that wehad stopped filing. She gave a brief story about how I had filed a complaintagainst her because, as she put it, I claimed she was “disregarding [my] rightsin connection with [my] claim for refund.” She was, and I did. She then saidthat at the second meeting I “was still carrying on this argument of Section861, that it was not to be considered taxable income.” Yep. Let’s see how shecharacterized her response to me this time: “My response was that we’ve alreadymade a determination on that issue, that 861 does not apply; 61 does.”(As an aside, I still marvel at the psychotic habit of government personnel toproclaim that a “determination” has been made about something. “I am the greatand powerful bureaucrat! I have spoken!” What profound arrogance, to think thatsaying “Yep, I decided it was taxable” precludes all further discussion andremoves all opportunity for disagreement. Imagine how they’d react if my entireposition was: “I’ve made a determination that my income isn’t taxable.”)Once again, let’s do a quick flashback to see what actually happened at thatsecond meeting—which, again, I was not allowed to do at the trial. Let’s see howMs. Spaulding proved that 861 doesn’t apply. This is from the transcript, rightafter I handed Ms. Spaulding a printout of their precious Section 61.Me: “This is on Congress’ web site. Look down in the cross-references. It’s afew lines down. It says, ‘Income from sources—within the United States, seesection 861 of this title.’ Section 61 itself, regarding income from sourceswithin the United States, directly refers to 861.”Spaulding: “All right, you’re referring to 861, I believe, because it suits yourpurposes.”Me: “Congress’ web site is referring to 861.”Spaulding: “Excuse me, can we just have a little bit of courtesy? I wasspeaking. I didn’t interrupt you. Please.”Me: “Go ahead.”Spaulding: “All right, 861 is referring to U.S. citizens who have sourcesoutside of the United States.”Me: “Cite, please?”Spaulding: “Okay, and—which is not the case here.”Me: “Citation, please.”Spaulding: “I’m just making a statement. Okay, I’m not actually citing the law.I’m just making a brief interpretation.”Me: “Based on what? I want to see what your interpretation is based on.”Spaulding: “All right, I’m just gonna discontinue that. I don’t like speakingwith somebody who doesn’t follow common courtesy.”Well, I don’t like speaking with somebody who: a) robs people for a living; b)can’t read simple English, much less legalese; and c) is dumb as a stump. If youthink I’m being too harsh, read on.Later at that second meeting, I read back to her numerous statements she hadmade at the first meeting saying she intended to do more research, and then Iasked her, point blank, if she had done that research. Here was her answer:“Yes, I did do research; 861, per my information, is referring to foreign sourceincome, which is not the issue in this case.” I wonder how many hours ofthorough, scholarly research it took for her to conclude that a section called“Income from sources within the United States,” which is entirely about incomeoriginating inside the U.S., is really only about income from outside the UnitedStates. It’s hard to get any more wrong than that. She couldn’t, of course, citeanything from the law supporting her patently asinine claim; no, she was merelygiving an “interpretation”—interpreting the section to mean the exact oppositeof what it actually says. And the government thinks the statements of thisdimbulb were supposed to persuade me that I was wrong? (Again, even the dimbulbsaid she didn’t expect me to be persuaded.)I don’t really know how to convey this without sounding pompous, so I’ll justsound pompous. I know a lot about Section 861 and its history. I know by heartthe eighty-year story of how the section evolved, what changes happened in whichyears, what all the corresponding regulations said, when they changed, and soon. Most of the pertinent parts I can quote from memory, from all three versionsof the statute over the years, and from the dozens of related regulations.Several people who know me well can attest to my borderline-psychotic ability torattle off verbatim section after section, tracing all the section numbers fromyear to year, which is the result of intensely studying one subject for severalyears. That being the case, it was a bit much to take to have to sit there whilesome absolute ignoramus (Ms. Spaulding) made one asinine blunder after another,while acting as if I should have some respect for her utterly worthless,provably idiotic opinion. The only thing I can think of to compare it to wouldbe some twit wandering off the street into a repair shop and telling a veteranmechanic that the engine of the car is really the radio.(Time for another “program think” check: Do you have a hard time believing thatIRS employees, federal judges, and other supposed “experts” could be completelyclueless when it comes to federal tax law? Do you find yourself assuming thatthere must be some basis for the opinions they give? If Bob Bureaucrat proclaimsthat you aren’t supposed to be using a certain section of the law, do you feelan uncontrollable urge to believe him, just because he ought to know the law? Imust say, time after time over the past several years, I have been absolutelystunned by how often people whom I expected to be knowledgeable displayedprofound ignorance of even the most basic, indisputable truths. It took a longtime for me to come to grips with just how inaccurate the “expert” label oftenis.)Back at trial, Ms. Spaulding then testified about how I was opposed to the IRSdoing a “substitute for return” (filing a return on my behalf, saying I owedthem money), pointing out their lack of legal authority to do so. (Incidentally,John Turner, a man who used to be an IRS Revenue Officer—the ones who do“substitute for returns”—has since done a great job of documenting the fact thatwhen someone does not file a Form 1040, the IRS does not have the legalauthority to file one on his behalf, or to assess a tax liability without areturn.Of course, having no legal authority doesn’t stop them from doing it.) Next, Ms.Spaulding bemoaned the fact that at the second meeting I “was harping on thefact” that they “were denying [me my] constitutional rights.” (Don’t you justhate that? What is the world coming to when an extortionist can’t violatepeople’s rights without the victims complaining about it?) She also claimed thatI said I could have them “arrested,” which I didn’t. I did say that if they didthings they knew to be outside their legal authority, while ignoring the law Ihad put on the table right in front of them, I would file complaints (criminaland/or administrative) against them. Again, Ms. Spaulding whined on the standthat “he kept on harping that we were denying him his rights.” That’s becausethey were denying me my rights. Here is a quote from their own regulations,which I read to them at the meeting, “harping” on the same point:“An exaction by the U.S. Government, which is not based upon law, statutory orotherwise, is a taking of property without due process of law, in violation ofthe Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.” [26 CFR § 601.106]Back at the trial, what she testified about next I had never heard about beforethe trial, and I believe it qualifies Ms. Spaulding as a paranoid schizophrenic.Here is what she said:“The second meeting, like I said, got a little heated, and he was coming onpretty strong as far as with, you know—and by this time I was informed that hehad filed a complaint against me, and his saying I was denying him hisconstitutional rights. I was just doing my job. It made me a little uneasy,because I also happened to live and work in Abington township, and it’s a prettyclose community—I said, to be on the safe side, I’m just going to notify mypolice and tell my neighbors, just in case there would be some kind of problem.There wasn’t, but I just wanted to put a few other people on notice.”She did what?! Good grief! She whined to the police because I filed a proceduralcomplaint against her (the way their rules say I should)? She called it “comingon pretty strong” when I kept asking for them to show some legal justificationfor their attempts to rob me of many thousands of dollars?! Obviously the IRSextortionists are used to dishing it out, but are, like other bullies, actuallythin-skinned cowards. (I also liked the use of the Nuremberg defense, à la “justdoing my job,” in order to avoid personal responsibility for extorting people.)“Waaah! He wanted me to cite the law justifying my demands for tens of thousandsof dollars! Help, help! Call the police!” There are only two possibilities I seehere: either Ms. Spaulding has some screws loose, or the government had her saythat to portray me as some dangerous villain. Or both.But since, as she admitted, I never had any contact with her at all outside ofofficial correspondence and meetings, how exactly were Ms. Spaulding’s neuroticdelusions relevant to the trial? They weren’t, obviously. Her unfounded paranoiawas brought up as one more way to demonize me.SPAULDING CROSS-EXAMSince Ms. Spaulding had done such a fine job of mischaracterizing what happenedat the meetings, my cross-examination began with a request that the actual audiorecordings of the meetings, which we had right there on our computer, ready toplay over the courtroom speaker system, be admitted into evidence. In one of thegovernment’s pre-trial motions, they had even said this: “Mr. Rose is, ofcourse, free to play recordings of his meetings with the IRS and offer them intoevidence in support of a good faith defense.”At trial, however, the government did an about-face, and objected to me beingallowed to play those recordings. And Baylson sided with them, calling therecordings “hearsay.” He said I could play “selected excerpts” just ofstatements by Ms. Spaulding, but not anything I said. Since we weren’t preparedfor that (it would have taken hours to go through the recordings to preparethat), I asked if I could just play the tapes later, during the defense case.Judge Baylson said, “We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.” I laterlearned that what that really meant was “no.” But at the time, I decided to justquestion Ms. Spaulding, and save the tapes for later.I brought up one of Ms. Spaulding’s letters to me (one of the government’sexhibits), in which she claimed that Section 861 is only for “U.S. citizens thathave U.S. source and foreign source income.” I asked her if that letter citedany statute, regulation, or court case supporting that assertion. She said “no.”I brought up their next exhibit, another letter sent to me by the IRS, and askedhow many quotations from the law were in it. She said, “One.” I asked her toread that quotation, warning her that I intended to interrupt her at certainpoints in the quote. So she started reading from where the letter quoted fromthe lower court ruling in Coleman v. Commissioner, saying that “some peoplebelieve with great fervor preposterous things that just happen to coincide withtheir self-interest. They have convinced themselves that wages are not income—”At that point I interrupted Ms. Spaulding’s reading of the letter to ask whetherI had ever argued that wages are not income. She answered “no,” and so I askedher to continue reading from the letter, which she did: “...that only gold ismoney—” I interrupted again. Had I ever argued that? Ms. Spaulding answered“no.” She continued the quote: “...that the 16th Amendment is unconstitutional—”Had I ever argued that? She answered, “I don’t believe so.” Then I asked, “Doesanything in that paragraph reference anything about 861? ” Her answer: “No.” Sothe one case cited in the letter had nothing at all to do with my legalposition, and mentioned only things I had never argued. (In fact, the ruling inthe Coleman case happened in 1986, before the 861 evidence had even becomepublic, so it was impossible for it to have been about my position.)Next, concerning the complaint I had filed against her, I asked Ms. Spauldingwhether the reason for the complaint was that she “had not followed thetechnical advice procedures as published in the Treasury regulations.” She saidshe didn’t know, claiming she never saw the complaint. Nice try, but I sent hera copy of it when I filed it. She was determined to make it sound as if I fileda complaint just to be mean, which of course was untrue.Next, I questioned her about whether, at those meetings, she had really been assure of herself as her prior testimony might imply. I asked whether, at themeetings, she had “showed me where the law itself shows my conclusions to beincorrect.” Her answer: “I don’t know. I don’t remember if I did. I do know fora fact that Mike Enz did.” Actually, neither of them did. Other than Section 61,none of them ever quoted one word from any statute or regulation, at eithermeeting. Wouldn’t it have been nice if I could have demonstrated that to thejury?Ms. Spaulding then said that Agent Enz had shown me “reference materials,” whichI again got her to admit was not the law but only some unnamed author’scommentary on the law. So I asked, “Are you bound by the law, or byinterpretations of a private company? ” Her answer: “We’re bound by the law.”(Yeah, I wish.)Then I brought up yet another of the “notices” the government introduced, andstarted to ask, “Does it contain any quotation from any statute, regulation,or—.” At that point Ms. Spaulding interrupted me to say, “No, it does not.” Sheseemed to be getting rather testy. (I wonder if I should have reported that tothe police, just in case she might show up at my house in the middle of thenight with a chainsaw.)A HALLUCINATED THREATI then asked Ms. Spaulding about her going to the police, and asked if I had“threatened to do anything illegal.” She responded, “You hadn’t in words;however, in body language you did. I mean, if—you could tell if you would hearthe tapes.” Those would be the tapes I wanted to play for the jury, which thegovernment prohibited me from doing. Ms. Spaulding continued: “I mean, your toneof voice, the use of words, your manner, your demeanor, your body language—itwas very intimidating.”Unfortunately, it’s impossible to show, in writing, just how delusional Ms.Spaulding’s claims were. The best I can do is to include the transcript of whatwas far and away the most heated part of either of the meetings. This happenedat the second meeting, after they had tap-danced and dodged the substance of theissue for many minutes:Michael Enz (IRS): “Uh, did you check with attorneys? The last time we met wewent to our attorneys before we proceeded.”Me: “And you still don’t have anything, do you?”Enz: “No, we do. We didn’t send for tech advice—”Me: “Where? Where?! You talked to your attorneys. Where is it?! [shouting]”[silent pause]Me: “Do I have to wait for hell to freeze over? Where is it? You called DistrictCounsel.”Enz: “We’ll present our case [pause] when you move on.”Me (laughing): “What, it’s some secret? Present it now. Come on, show me.”Enz: “I didn’t bring it with me.”Me: “Oh, yeah. Right.”Enz: “I didn’t. I didn’t bring the file.”Me: “Go get it. Go get it.”Enz: “I work in center city. You want to—”Me: “Call center city. Have them read it over the air.”Enz: “We’re not staying here that long. Get real [angrily]. Move on.”Charlie Judge (IRS): “Relax, relax.”My Brilliant and Beautiful Wife: “But why come to this case without that?”(Good question, dear.)Now ask yourself, would you run to the police because of such an exchange? Ofcourse not, because unlike Ms. Spaulding, you’re not a certifiable nutcase.(Note also that Ms. Spaulding wasn’t even in the conversation at that point.)A BIT ABOUT VIOLENCEThis calls for a sidebar, and a few words about violence, since the government(which constantly resorts to using force) wanted the jury, and the generalpublic, to view me as some horribly dangerous villain.Philosophically, I believe that forcible resistance to unjust government demandsis absolutely morally justified. (Before you faint from shock, remember thatthat principle is what this country was founded upon.) However, I also thinkthat as civilized human beings, we should seek nonviolent solutions to disputeswhenever possible. And that leads me to the ultimate irony in this case.Years before I had ever heard of 861, I was lamenting what I saw as thiscountry’s not-so-gradual transformation from its pro-freedom beginnings intowhat is essentially a police state. Without going into a political rant here(which I’ll save for later books), let’s just say I expected the situation tokeep getting worse, until the good old U.S.A. would follow in the footsteps ofthe not-so-good old U.S.S.R., or the Roman empire. In other words, I wasconvinced that the American experiment—a system designed around the idea ofindividual freedom—was very close to going belly-up for good.Then along comes this “861” thing, and suddenly I saw, not just a really nastyfraud that needed exposing and resisting, but potentially a means of achievingreal positive change (not the fictional kind that politicians endlessly yammerabout), without violence, and without even breaking the law. I could see that if100 million victims of the “income tax” fraud learned the truth, no amount ofgovernment huffing and puffing, or even robbing and prosecuting, would keep thedeception alive. Imagine that: a nonviolent way to rein in some of thegovernment’s gargantuan power. Sounds good to me. To be blunt, I still seeexposing the income tax deception as the only way to avoid an eventual (but nottoo distant) large-scale violent conflict between the U.S. government and thecitizenry.As for myself, so far I’ve survived thirty-seven years without even punchinganyone, much less having to do something really unpleasant, like shootingsomeone. I’d like to continue that record if at all possible. You see, I don’teven want stupid and/or evil people to suffer unnecessarily. (I’m such a radicalextremist.) And that applies to all of the boneheaded bureaucrats I love to bash(with words, not tire irons).To put it another way, I did what I did in part because I saw this endeavor asthe best hope for avoiding large-scale violence against those in government. No,that wasn’t a typo. I believe that ending this fraud is the best way for thosein government (as well as others) to escape a very nasty end, by allowing for a“revolution” that requires no bullets and no blood. In talking to hundreds ifnot thousands of people, mostly via e-mail, more than a few have opined that myefforts were (and are) futile, and that things are going to keep getting worseuntil we’re forced to “shoot the bastards.” I was determined to prove themwrong, and told them so. I thought I saw a way to push back tyranny without adrop of blood being shed. And, maybe stupidly, I’m still hoping for that.And what was the result of my burning desire to see a nonviolent solution? Adozen armed thugs invaded my home, the feds tried to forcibly silence me, andthen they threw me in prison, after trying to paint me as the violent one. Ifanyone now wants to tell me “told ya so,” I don’t have much of a rebuttal, but Ihad to try what I tried. I really wish I had some compelling argument leftsupporting some hope of success via nonviolence, but I don’t.To be blunt, if you read in the news that some IRS paper-pusher or collectionthug, or some pseudo-judge, got his or her “determination” overruled with abaseball bat or a pipe bomb, I won’t be very surprised. I’ve always discouragedpeople from resorting to violence, and I still do, but to be frank, I’m runningout of arguments to persuade people. What evidence is there that politelypetitioning the system has any chance of achieving freedom and justice? Just asthe Declaration of Independence described it when King George III wasmistreating the colonists, “our repeated petitions have been answered only byrepeated injury.” Yeah, tell me about it. The government, all by itself, isteaching a lot of people that the law does not matter to the government, thatthe last thing our “justice” system cares about is justice, and that being openand honest, and obeying the law, does nothing at all to keep one safe frompower-happy bureaucrats, police, prosecutors, and judges.I was recently interested to come across a Supreme Court ruling saying that themore important it is to prevent “incitements to the overthrow of ourinstitutions by force and violence,” the more important it is to protect therights of free speech, so that changes “may be obtained by peaceful means” ( DeJonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353 (1937)). John F. Kennedy expressed a very similarsentiment when he said that when you make nonviolent change impossible, you makeviolent change inevitable.I really do hope, even as I sit here in prison for a crime that the prosecutorsand the judge know I didn’t commit, that a bunch of IRS headstones don’t startto appear as a confirmation of JFK’s words. So many in the federal governmenthave done so much to vilify, hurt and forcibly silence many people whose sole“sin” was to be open and honest and seek a “redress of grievances.” I am onlyone of many, and many have paid a far higher price than I have. That being thecase, if someone decides that his only recourse against such a system isviolence, I’m fresh out of arguments to use against him. I tried things theopen, honest, legal, nonviolent way, and it didn’t turn out very well. But I’mjust dumb enough to keep trying.ON WITH THE SHOWAfter Ms. Spaulding admitted that I never threatened her and never contacted herin any way outside of the official meetings and correspondence, mycross-examination of her moved on to something else.One of the government’s exhibits was a letter I sent to Ms. Spaulding. (The jurywas allowed to see such letters only if the government chose to introduce themas evidence, which it did for this one.) The letter explained that I expectedthe IRS to misapply the law, reminded them that it is a crime for an IRSemployee to demand more money than the law requires (26 USC § 7214), and inlight of that, informed them “that the Secretary of the Treasury, by way of thefederal income tax regulations, has stated the following,” and then my lettergave several direct quotes from the regulations. After the quotes were up on thecourtroom monitors, so everyone could read along, I asked Ms. Spaulding if shehad looked up these regulations I had cited. She said she had. I then asked herwhether, as an IRS agent, she is required to obey the regulations. She admittedthat she is. What happened next speaks for itself, though it probably went wayover the heads of the jurors.Me: “Could you read that second highlighted [quote from the regs], the onethat’s three lines long?”Spaulding (reading from the regs): “Sections 861(b) and 863(a) state in generalterms how to determine taxable income of a taxpayer from sources within theUnited States after gross income from sources within the United States has beendetermined.”Me: “Have you also verified that this is an IRS regulation that’s binding onyou, or that these words are from the regulations themselves? Did you eververify that?”Spaulding: “Yes, I believe they’re from the regulations. Like I said, I don’trecall what I looked at four years or five years ago, but—”Me: “Okay, I understand. Could you read the next citation, please, the nextparagraph?”Spaulding (reading from the regs): “Determination of taxable income. Thetaxpayer’s taxable income from sources within or without the United States willbe determined under the rules of Section 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T fordetermining taxable income from sources within the United States.”Me: “Okay, could we see the next paragraph? That may be all you need to read.Okay, we can skip the next one. [It was just another section saying the samething again.] So you agree that the citations you just read were confirmed to bein the—you believe to the best of your recollection—I realize it was quite awhile ago—that those are the words of the regulations as quoted in my letter,and that they are binding on you; is that correct?”Spaulding: “Yes.”Me: “Could we zoom in on the third paragraph there, the short one? That one. I’mjust going to ask this one question, and then I’m done: Did you use Section861(b) and 863(a) to determine my taxable income from sources within the UnitedStates, after determining domestic gross income?”Spaulding: “No, I did not.”Read that carefully, until the lunacy of it sinks in. She was admitting that Ishowed her this in the regulations, admitting that the regulations say that,admitting that she is legally required to do what the regulations say, and thenadmitting that she had not done what those regulations commanded her to do. Thatis defying the law. That is knowing what the law is, and choosing to disregardit. That is “willfulness,” and the IRS employees were the ones guilty of it, notI. In retrospect, I should have really hammered this point home, verballybludgeoning Ms. Spaulding into admitting it over and over again, so that even mymoronic jury might have noticed the significance of what she had just said.After that amazing (albeit accidental) confession, we took our lunch break.After the jury left, there was a brief discussion about the audiotapes of themeetings, and Judge Baylson said, “I’m not sure I’m going to allow the tape tobe played just on the issue of tone of voice, because I’m not sure that it’sthat material.” So while Ms. Spaulding was allowed to talk about my supposed“tone of voice” (which she bizarrely imagined to constitute a threat), I wasn’tallowed to play the actual tape to show the jury the truth. Swell.Judge Baylson said that during the defense case, I could testify about my“recollection” of the meeting, but he hesitated to let me play the actualrecording of it (though he still didn’t give a definite ruling at this point).How goofy is that? The most reliable evidence, the actual recording, was goingto be excluded, while the least reliable evidence, five-year-old recollections,would be allowed. Then the judge said I could play “excerpts” of the tape, butonly to refute “specific statements” of Ms. Spaulding which I believed “arecontrary to what she said in court here this morning.” I could not use the tapesto show what I had said, to show the general nature and content of thediscussion, or to show how badly they had floundered and equivocated when facedwith the law. Nor could I use the tapes to show what they did not say at themeetings. Most of Spaulding’s lies consisted of claiming to have said things atthe meeting which she did not actually say, which of course cannot be refutedwithout playing the entire recording (which I wasn’t allowed to do). SinceBaylson’s ruling made the tapes worthless for cross-examination, I said I wouldsave them for the defense case.AFTER LUNCHOver lunch I decided I wanted to ask Ms. Spaulding a few more things, so mycross-examination of her continued when court resumed.I wanted to show the jury a letter I had sent to Ms. Spaulding prior to ourfirst meeting, and (of course) the government didn’t want me to. After a littleconfusion, I was allowed to put the letter up on the courtroom monitors, andhave Ms. Spaulding read from it, but I wasn’t allowed to have it actually“admitted into evidence” so the jury could have a copy during theirdeliberations.I had Ms. Spaulding read the first sentence of the letter, which said, “In orderto facilitate a meaningful and constructive meeting, I have attached a briefdescription of a few issues which I believe to be central to a possiblecontention between myself and the IRS.” (I wonder if Ms. Spaulding interpretedthat as a threat, and ran to the police.) I then had her read another part ofthe letter, which said this:“It is my position that 26 USC § 861(b), and the related regulations in 26 CFR §1.861-8, are the sections to be used for determining taxable income from sourceswithin the United States.”The letter then referenced a separate sheet of citations supporting my positionon that point, a couple of which she had read earlier. Note the difference: Istate my position in clear, specific terms, and then provide legally bindingcitations supporting my conclusions, while they throw out baseless, oftenidiotic assertions, backed by absolutely nothing.Next, I wanted to address a handout I had given to Ms. Spaulding at themeetings, which showed how Section 61 includes a cross-reference referring toSection 861 regarding “Income from sources within the United States.” However,Ms. Spaulding said she couldn’t recall me giving her that, so I wasn’t allowedto show it to the jury. In fact, I had given her a copy of it at both meetings,and she had once responded to it (as mentioned above) by saying that she thoughtI was citing 861 because it “suits my purposes.” But she now conveniently“couldn’t recall” me giving it to her.(Incidentally, Sherry Peel Jackson—former IRS agent, current truth-teller, andvery courageous lady—later explained to me how IRS agents who testify at trialsare trained to give vague and forgetful answers on cross-examination, whilegiving concise, definite answers when testifying for the government.)Oddly, when I asked Ms. Spaulding about the cross-reference again, but in adifferent way, her memory improved. But then her psychological denial kickedinto high gear. I mentioned the cross-reference (from 61 to 861), and askedwhether she recalled me pointing it out at our meeting. On the stand sheresponded, “Yes, I do. However, that also—you’re bringing out a very littlenarrow scope of it. You’re not bringing in the whole thing.” I asked her toexplain what she meant by that, and she continued: “When it says ‘sources withinUnited States, see section 861,’ they’re also saying for people who have incomeas in addition to that, outside of the United States.”The cross-reference says nothing of the sort, and never has, and she had itright in front of her while she was testifying. So I asked if she was looking atit at the moment, and she then said that it “does not appear to be part of theCode or the regs,” but instead appeared to be “some interpretation that you cameup with.” What?! What was sitting right in front of her was a printout directlyfrom Congress’ own web site. (Did she think I wrote Congress’ web site?) Whenall else fails, the bureaucrats just go into complete psychological denial.That’s what she did at the meeting when I showed it to her, and she did it againon the stand at trial. She couldn’t accept what she was seeing, so she simplypretended it wasn’t there, or decided I had made it up or something. Here iswhat that cross-reference under Section 61 says:“Income from sources—Within the United States, see section 861 of this titleWithout the United States, see section 862 of this title”What part of that is too complicated for Ms. Spaulding to grasp? Where is thepart that she thinks means “not for you!”? She was simply incapable of believingthat what she was looking at was from the government’s own law books, because itdidn’t match her foregone conclusions, so she went into utter denial. “It can’tmean that, so I’m gonna plug my ears, close my eyes, and go ‘blah, blah, blah’.”Ah, due process at its finest.WHAT IS BINDINGI then got Ms. Spaulding to admit that at the meeting she had acknowledged thatstatutes and regulations are legally binding. I then asked whether sheremembered me showing her citations from the IRS’s own manual saying that theIRS does not consider lower court rulings to be binding. She said yes.I then asked whether she remembered me explaining that “the regulations statethat the items in 61 are sometimes exempt.” Yes, she remembered that too, thoughshe couldn’t remember exactly what citations I had shown her. Got that? Sheadmitted that the regs say that the things listed in their beloved Section 61are not always taxable! But she still didn’t want me to look beyond Section 61anyway.After that, Mr. Noud was allowed to do some “redirect” questioning of Ms.Spaulding. The only thing he brought up was a letter Ms. Spaulding had readbefore, which asserted that my conclusions were incorrect. On follow-upcross-examination, I asked if that letter was an actual regulation. She admittedit was not. I asked whether she thought IRS form letters were legally binding.She said “It depends on which form letters,” which she knew to be a lie (formletters never carry any legal weight). She couldn’t say which form letters mightcarry legal weight, and said she didn’t know “what the legal weight is of thisparticular document.” I do: it has no legal weight whatsoever. Could it be thatmaybe she really didn’t know? Let’s do a little flashback to the first meeting Ihad with her:Mort Kafrissen (IRS): “The Code is the law. The regs try to define it, giveexamples where they feel they need examples.”Me: “Is an interpretation of it. Right.”Spaulding: “Interpretations. Right.”Kafrissen: “A lot of Code sections don’t have regs, period.”Me: “Right, but the regulations are the interpretation that is binding on youand the public, when published in the Federal Register. Do you agree to that?”Kafrissen: “Sure.”Spaulding: “Yes.”Kafrissen: “We have—we put out books, ya know, to try to simplify for thetaxpayers to read.”Me: “Right, but the regulations are actually binding. The publications and stuffaren’t.”Spaulding: “Yeah, that’s correct.”So why, at trial, did Ms. Spaulding suddenly “forget” what is and isn’t legallybinding? Simple. Because if they admitted that none of those so-called “notices”carry a shred of legal weight—which they know to be true—there goes their entirecase. I believe Ms. Spaulding, and the other IRS witnesses, were instructed bythe prosecution to not answer questions about what is legally binding. (Asyou’ll see, Ms. Spaulding was not the only government witness who danced aroundthe question.)And what a coincidence that when I later asked the judge to give a juryinstruction explaining that different documents carry different legal weight—apoint which would demolish the government’s entire case—Judge Baylson refused togive such an instruction. He knew damn well that I was correct on that point,but he also knew what it would do to the verdict were he to tell the jury thetruth: that I had no legal obligation to agree with or comply with any of thoseworthless “notices.”(After Tessa’s subsequent trial, where an equally clueless jury declared her tobe guilty based on an even more pathetic case—if you can imagine that—herattorney filed a Motion for Acquittal, which included the following: “Thegovernment offered [IRS form letters] to support its tenuous argument that Ms.Rose knew that her position was frivolous because the government told her so.These letters, even when viewed most favorably to the government, do not createan inference that Ms. Rose knew her husband’s theory was frivolous. As the Courtinstructed the jury, these letters only contained the IRS’s position, whichdefendant was not required to accept as an authoritative statement of the law.”Yeah, what she said. In denying that motion, Judge Baylson’s ruling included thefollowing schizophrenic, self-contradictory statement: “Defendant argues thatthe IRS is not necessarily authoritative on these matters and although the Courtwould agree with that general statement, the IRS certainly put the Defendant onnotice that the arguments that she and her husband were making, that theirincome was not subject to taxation and that they did not have to file taxreturns, was not accepted.” What on earth does that mean? All in one sentence,the ruling agreed that the opinions of IRS bureaucrats are not binding on us(i.e., are not “authoritative”), and then cited opinions of IRS bureaucrats asproof of willfulness. So I guess we don’t have to agree with the IRS unless theysay something lots of times. It makes no sense whatsoever, but Judge Baylsonsimply refused to admit what he knew to be the truth: that we had no obligationwhatsoever to agree with or abide by the opinions of IRS paper-pushers and theirworthless form letters, no matter how many there were. Had Judge Baylsonadmitted that indisputable fact, however, both cases would have evaporated, sohe fudged the truth and the law to make sure we would both be punished forcrimes we didn’t commit.)Back at my trial, further showing his bias and agenda, at one point JudgeBaylson jumped in to make a point on behalf of the prosecution, stressing thefact that after my claims for refund were denied at the administrative level, Icould have sued the IRS in District Court, but didn’t. In fact, during Ms.Spaulding’s testimony, the judge kept needling her, trying to get her to saythat she had told me that I could sue for a refund (though she didn’t say thatat either meeting). It goes without saying that a supposedly neutral “judge” isnot supposed to be suggesting arguments to either side.“A central tenet of our republic—a characteristic that separates us fromtotalitarian regimes throughout the world—is that the government and privatecitizens resolve disputes on an equal playing field in the courts. When citizensface the government in the federal courts, the job of the judge is to apply thelaw, not to bolster the government’s case.”[Beaty v. United States, 937 F.2d 288 (6th Cir. 1991)]Yeah, right. I then pointed out that, regarding the case of our not filing—theonly thing the trial was supposed to be about—there was nothing we could haveappealed, or filed a suit about, because the IRS had never tried to collect, oreven sent us a bill, which Ms. Spaulding conceded. And as for the claims forrefund, it’s utterly ridiculous to imply that we had any legal or moralobligation to invest the time and money it would have taken to sue the IRS in aneffort to get money back which the government already had. Yet that is exactlywhat Prosecutor Baylson (while pretending to be a judge) repeatedly harped on asif it were proof of “willfulness.” What a crock. And after the judge keptpushing that illogical argument, eventually Mr. Noud picked it up too.THE OTHER PRO-IRS JUDGEThe government’s next witness, this time questioned by Floyd Miller, was CharlesJudge, Ms. Spaulding’s supervisor, who attended the second meeting I had withthe IRS. After describing his job at the IRS, he was asked about the meeting.Mr. Judge said that I “maintained a position under Code Section 861 whereby [I]felt that [my] income was not taxable.” Well, he got that right at least (sortof). Not to sound like a broken record here, but if I “felt” my income wasn’ttaxable, I couldn’t have been guilty of any “willful” tax crime. So why was I ontrial?Then Mr. Judge summed up what the IRS’s position was at that second meeting. Hesaid that at the meeting, the IRS “explained that under Code Section 61 allincome is taxable, from whatever source derived, unless specifically excluded byother sections of the Code.” Is that not a fine description of the falseassumption that is made by the vast majority of tax professionals? His statementdirectly contradicts decades of regulations which say that, in addition to theexemptions in the tax code, some other income is also exempt from the taxbecause of the Constitution itself. What makes Mr. Judge’s blunder moreinteresting is that he made it long after I had given him (in writing) directquotes of regulations proving that his position is absolutely incorrect.I’m not exactly sure why, but immediately after pointing out that Mr. Judge hadworked for the IRS for thirty-two years, Mr. Miller then asked him whether,prior to meeting me, Mr. Judge had “had any dealings with Code Section 861,” towhich Mr. Judge answered, “No, sir.” I think it was very nice of Mr. Miller tohelp illustrate the profound legal ignorance of this veteran IRS supervisor. AsI said, tax professionals, including IRS agents, are not familiar with that partof the law. And there you have it, right from the jackass’s mouth. (Sorry aboutall the “told-ya-so”s, but someone has to point it out.)Oddly, at trial Mr. Judge then gave his “understanding” of 861 and itsregulations (which he just said he had never had any dealings with before),which was that those sections are for taxpayers who “may have income fromsources within and without the United States,” and added that “861 deals withsourcing the income for purposes of determining, for example, foreign taxcredits.” Wow, that sounded almost coherent (albeit totally incorrect). At theactual meeting, however, no one ever mentioned foreign tax credits at all. Infact, Mr. Judge never said one word about the purpose of 861. At that meetingthe only statements by the IRS about the purpose of 861 were the following:1) Cathy Spaulding twice made the asinine assertion that Section 861 is aboutforeign source income. Again, she was claiming that a section called “Incomefrom sources within the United States” is only about income from outside theUnited States. That’s brilliant. (For the record, Section 862 is about incomefrom outside the United States.)2) When I then asked Michael Enz if he agreed that 861 (titled “Income fromsources within the United States”) was about income from outside the UnitedStates, he answered, “The whole section, that 800 series, is meant so people whohave sources from inside and outside the United States can see what’s taxable inthe United States, and what isn’t taxable in the United States.” Of course, hecited nothing supporting that, since nothing in the law does support it. (As itturns out, by sheer coincidence, I actually had about thirty bucks of foreignsource investment income in at least one of the years in question, so he justagreed that I should be looking there to “see what’s taxable in the UnitedStates, and what isn’t taxable in the United States.”)That was their entire explanation at that meeting of what 861 is for, backed byabsolutely nothing. If you want to see what Mr. Judge himself actually said atthe meeting, as opposed to his “creative recollection” of what he said, here isa taste. This was right after I had given him a handout quoting several IRSregulations, which I read out loud, which state, unequivocally andunconditionally, that I should use 861 and its regs to determine my taxabledomestic income.Me: “Do you see what this says?”Mr. Judge: “I do.”Me: “Do you understand what I just read?”Mr. Judge: “Yeah.”Ms. Spaulding: “Yes.”Me: “Do you understand why I think what I think?”Mr. Judge: “Yeah, I—look, I don’t know why there’s, ya know, not more of anobvious—I think we’re missing something somewhere here under 861.”Me: “Well show me it, because right now you have, on the record in front of you,the Treasury regulations.”Mr. Judge: “Well, right. Yeah, but, uh...”Yeah, he really set me straight and showed me the light. That’s what the meetingwas actually like, while at trial he testified as if he was confident,knowledgeable, and persuasive in his rebuttal of my position. I have no doubtthat Floyd Miller, before trial, spoon fed his own twisted, provably flawed“interpretation” of 861 to Mr. Judge, to be spouted back on cue, with Mr. Judgepretending that he had held that position at the meeting, when he absolutely hadnot. In reality, he hadn’t expressed any position at all, but (again) I wasn’tallowed to show the jury the transcripts or play the recordings which provethat. They were allowed to lie about what happened, and I wasn’t allowed tointroduce the evidence I had right in front of me, exposing their lies. Soundsfair, right?A NIGHT OUT WITH THE RATBased upon that first meeting with Mr. Judge (my second meeting with the IRS),he seemed to me to be somewhat reasonable, though ignorant, and lacked the overthostility and malice of many IRS employees I had met. Since he seemed genuinelydisturbed by the IRS’s complete inability to refute or even address what I wasshowing them, I started to wonder what he really thought. Of course, while ontape at an official meeting, he couldn’t afford to treat my position as evenslightly debatable, but what did he really think? (Remember, by that time otherformer IRS folk had already joined the 861 bandwagon, publicly agreeing with myconclusions.)So, as mentioned above, I decided to invite Mr. Judge to an off-the-record,informal meeting, not to discuss my own case (which I knew would be improper),but to see what he really thought about what he had seen at our meeting. I senthim a letter inviting him out to dinner, and included a copy of my Theft byDeception video. I made it clear that the meeting would be off the record and Iwould not repeat anything he said there without his permission. I wanted him tofeel free to speak his mind. As I told him, I just wanted his honest opinion,even if his opinion was just that I was nuts. I said he could bring his wife,and I’d bring mine, if he wanted, thinking that might make it less weird forhim. I was surprised when he left me a phone message accepting my offer, sayinghe would prefer to meet without the wives. We set up a time to meet at a nearbyTGI Fridays.To make a long story short, we had a very pleasant discussion for well over anhour, over a nice dinner. There was no hostility in either direction, and notalk about my own case. Mr. Judge said he had watched most of my video, said hewas “intrigued,” but added (more than once) that he still wasn’t convinced. Isaid that was perfectly reasonable. Afterwards we went our separate ways withfriendly goodbyes.Again, what I didn’t learn until many months later, when I finally got a copy ofthe “affidavit of probable cause” supporting the raid of my home, was that Mr.Judge had taped our meeting without my knowledge (in violation of Pennsylvaniastate law). At trial, the excuse he gave for that slimy stunt was that under IRSrules, he was “compelled” to report anything that seemed like it had “bribeovertures or possible bribe indications.” So, after calling “TIGTA”—the TreasuryInspector General for Tax Administration—that office conspired with him toillegally record the meeting without my knowledge or consent.Without me knowing, or even suspecting, I was being recorded, it was the perfectopportunity to catch me making some kind of confession, hinting that maybe Idon’t really believe all this 861 stuff. But the tape showed the exact opposite.The main thing the government brought up about the meeting is that I told Mr.Judge that prior to looking into the 861 evidence, my wife and I were getting“clobbered” by taxes. That was it. That was my awesome confession (minus all thethings the government didn’t bring up about the meeting, as you’ll soon see). Atleast Mr. Miller was nice enough to bring this up at trial:Mr. Miller: “Now, no bribe was actually offered at this dinner, was it?”Mr. Judge: “No, sir.”Mr. Miller: “No threats were made?”Mr. Judge: “No, sir.”So once again, an IRS employee displayed paranoia and suspicion in response tomy honesty and openness. Mr. Miller’s last question for Mr. Judge was whetherMr. Judge had made it clear to me “what the IRS’s position was regarding [my]story that [my] income was not taxable.” Mr. Judge answered, “Yes.” Once again,let’s compare what actually happened at the meeting to Mr. Judge’s claim that hehad firmly shown me the error of my ways.Ms. Spaulding: “I would think our next step would be to give you more—to mailyou more information supporting our argument before our report is prepared.”Me: “All right, because I don’t want what happened last time to happen again,which is you never answer the questions, you never present your position, andyou close this stage and send it to Appeals. Due process requires more thanthat.Mr. Judge: “Okay, we will talk to—like I said, I’ll talk to Mike [Enz] and we’lltalk to—we will answer—we will present you with information.”Me: “Okay, and I’m always available for questions.” [Here the IRS recorderstopped and they replaced the tape.]Me: “I was just saying, I’m always available if you have questions, and I don’twant this sneakily closed and bypassed without due process here.”Mr. Judge: “No, no. We will—but this is your managerial conference. I want youto be aware of that. Whatever additional discussions we have, like I’m gonnatalk to Cathy and look at what you gave us and all, and I’ll talk to Mike. Idon’t really see a need for us to get together again. I’m either gonna agreewith your position or disagree with your position.”Me: “I am requesting right now that we do get together again if you can actuallysupply legal support for your argument, because I don’t want one of your formletters that says, ‘Oh, we decided you were wrong,’ and send it to Appeals,which is what happened last time. There was never an answer to the questions.She [Ms. Spaulding] admitted she couldn’t answer the questions, and never did.”Mr. Judge: “I have to see what the procedure is, as far as that goes. Butwe’ll—we will not close the case without contacting you in some manner first.”Me: “Okay.”As mentioned before, they never contacted me again about the case, unless youcall the armed raid on my home two and a half years later “contacting” me. So,does it sound to you as if the issue was resolved? Does it sound as if they hadconfidently and persuasively proved me wrong? Or does it sound as if the ballwas in their court and that they still intended to provide me with somethingsupporting their position, or at least something saying what their position was?(Wouldn’t it have been nice if the jury had been allowed to hear the tape ofthat meeting?) So, for future reference, when a federal bureaucrat says “we’llget back to you,” he might mean “we’ll do an armed invasion of your home andprosecute you later.”After Mr. Miller helped Mr. Judge mischaracterize what happened at the meetingat the restaurant, it was time for cross-examination. Right off the bat, hecaught Ms. Spaulding’s selective amnesia, claiming he couldn’t “recall” meshowing him the cross-reference under Section 61 which points to Section 861.Then I asked if he remembered me handing him “a copy of a regulation that statesthat Section 861 and following, and related regulations, determine the sourcesof income for purposes of the income tax.” His answer: “Yeah, I believe I recallthat. Yes, sir.” And did he recall me giving him a handout with “specificcitations of regulations stating that 861 and its regulations are to be used todetermine the taxable income of a taxpayer from sources within the UnitedStates”? His answer: “I believe so, yes.” Got that? He conceded that I had shownhim legally binding citations telling me to use 861 and its regs whendetermining my taxable income.I asked if he had looked up the sections I cited at the meeting, to see if myquotes were accurate. He basically said yes, but then jumped into repeating hisown unsupported “interpretation” of 861—the one he did not actually articulateat the meeting, and which is provably incorrect anyway. Note the contrast: headmits I showed him actual citations supporting my position, and he respondedonly with assertions (which he then mischaracterized while under oath). Toemphasize the point, I asked him if he recalled “quoting to me or telling me ofany statute or regulation which says that a U.S. citizen should not use 861unless he has foreign income.” His answer: “Well, I don’t believe I ever showedyou anything that stated that.” So I showed him the law, and he didn’t show mesquat, and he admitted it. To clarify—and to rub it in—I then asked Mr. Judge ifhe had “expressed [his] interpretation, but didn’t cite a particular regulationstating that.” Instead of answering that inconvenient question, he went on arant about how our request for “technical advice” was denied. That of course hadnothing to do with the question, but he obviously didn’t want to give thetruthful answer, which would have been: “That’s right, I never cited a damnthing supporting my position!”Next, I asked if he recalled when, at our meeting on 9/22/2000, I “broke mylegal conclusions down into specific points, and asked the IRS to agree ordisagree on each point.” Yes, he remembered that (not fondly, I expect). Wellthen, I asked, was the IRS “able to state its position on those specific points?” His answer: “I don’t believe we debated or discussed each point individually,but again we reiterated that under the Internal Revenue Code and regulations,you had a liability to file tax returns and pay tax.” That about sums it up:they weren’t sure of the specifics of their own position, didn’t cite anythingfrom the law supporting their assertions, and couldn’t answer my questions, butthey could say “You owe it!” And that kindergarten-style method of argumentshould have changed my mind?I asked if he recalled the IRS folk (including him) stating at my meeting thatthey “were not familiar with Section 861 and its regulations at the time of themeeting.” Yes, he remembered that. And did he recall them “stating that [they]could not answer my specific questions at that time? ” Yes, he remembered that,too. So, Mr. Charles “Consistent” Judge testified that at the meeting they: 1)told me, in no uncertain terms, their “interpretation” of 861, and 2) told methey weren’t familiar with the section, and couldn’t answer my questions aboutit. That’s a little odd, if you ask me. How exactly does one give a confident“interpretation” of something he admits to being unfamiliar with?I then asked if he remembered when, at the meeting, I gave him a handout,quoting the IRS’s own manual as saying that while statutes and regulations arelegally binding, lower court rulings (anything below Supreme Court) are not. Hesaid he couldn’t recall. For the record, here is the text of the handout I gavethem at the meeting, which Mr. Judge (supposedly) didn’t recall:What Is Binding on the IRS“The Federal Income Tax Regulations (Regs.) are the official Treasury Departmentinterpretation of the Internal Revenue Code... ” [IRM, [4.2] 7.2.3.1 (05/14/99)]“The Service is bound by the regulations. ” [IRM, [4.2] 7.2.3.4 (05/14/99)]“[T] he Secretary shall prescribe all needful rules and regulations for theenforcement of this title. ” [26 USC § 7805(a)]“Interpretative regulations are issued under the general authority of IRCsection 7805(a), which allows regulations to be written when the Secretarydetermines they are needed to clarify a Code section. ” [IRM, [4.2] 7.2.3.2(05/14/99)]“Decisions made at various levels of the court system... may be used by eitherexaminers or taxpayers to support a position... A case decided by the U.S.Supreme Court becomes the law of the land and takes precedence over decisions oflower courts... Decisions made by lower courts, such as Tax Court, DistrictCourts, or Claims Court, are binding on the Service only for the particulartaxpayer and the years litigated. Adverse decisions of lower courts do notrequire the Service to alter its position for other taxpayers. ”[IRM, [4.2] 7.2.9.8 (05/14/99)]“Rulings do not have the force and effect of Treasury Department Regulations,but they may be used as precedents. ” [[4.2]7.2.6.1 (05-14-1999)]“IRS Publications, issued by the National Office, explain the law in plainlanguage for taxpayers and their advisors... While a good source of generalinformation, publications should not be cited to sustain a position. ” [IRM,[4.2]7.2.8 (05-14-1999)]The jury wasn’t allowed to see that.I then got Mr. Judge to admit that, to his knowledge, the IRS never issued me a“30-day” letter or a “Notice of Deficiency” for any of the years we didn’t file.In other words, they never tried to collect, or even sent us a bill, or evenalleged a specific dollar amount owed. Because of that, there was nothing for usto appeal; the ball was still in their court, and they chose not to proceed.RESTAURANT REVISITEDOn cross-examination concerning our supposed-to-be-off-the-record(but-illegally-recorded-by-him) meeting at the restaurant, Mr. Judgeacknowledged that the meeting was “friendly” and “non-confrontational.” I askedhim if he remembered my letter to him inviting him out to dinner, saying that Iwanted to give him “an opportunity, off the record, to say what [he] thought,and that I wouldn’t share with anybody any comments or opinions [he] had.” Yes,he said he remembered that. And had I kept my word? Yep. (In case you’rewondering, since he illegally recorded it, and then while under oathmischaracterized what happened there, I no longer feel obligated to keep quietabout it.)Again, since I didn’t know I was being recorded, it was the perfect set-up tocatch me saying at least that I wasn’t totally sure of my conclusions, if notmaking them up completely. Instead, what they “caught” me saying at the meeting(which the government didn’t mention) was that I would “bet my life on the factthat I’m right” about the 861 evidence. I asked Mr. Judge if he remembered metelling him that at the restaurant, but he would only reply, “That’s apossibility, but I don’t recall.” Of course, the tape and transcript showexactly what I said, but the jury wasn’t allowed to hear or see them. You see,IRS employees lying about what happened is reliable, admissible evidence, whilethe actual recordings are inadmissible “hearsay.”REDIRECT ON JUDGEOn “redirect,” Mr. Miller started to ask Mr. Judge about his legal opinionregarding 861. I objected, since by the rules, as the government strenuouslyargued long before trial, a witness isn’t supposed to instruct the jury on thelaw. (If I wasn’t allowed to do it, I wasn’t about to let them do it withoutobjection.) The first time, Judge Baylson sustained my objection, but a minutelater Charlie Judge started giving a monologue about his “interpretation”(hallucination) of the law, and that time the judge let him continue, ignoringmy second objection and overruling my third, fourth and fifth objections,letting Mr. Miller and Mr. Judge give a prolonged joint lecture about theirprovably bogus legal conclusions, in blatant violation of the rules of federalcourt.On follow-up cross-examination regarding the legal opinion he had just given, Iasked Mr. Judge, “Were those all points that you explained to me” at the 9/22/00meeting? He answered “yes,” which was an absolute, indisputable, unadulteratedbald-faced lie. Again, at the actual meeting he never said one word about hisown “interpretation” of 861, unless you count “I think we’re missing somethingsomewhere here under 861.” But I wasn’t allowed to play the tapes or show thejury the transcripts to prove it.STAN THE TAX MANThe next witness called by the government was Stanley Escher, the neurotic IRSsupervisor whom I had met out in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, when I was a witnessat John Hoffman’s meeting with the IRS (as described before). At trial, Mr.Escher testified that, at the meeting, John and I were “intent on getting [theIRS] to answer those twelve questions that dealt with code section 861.” Howdiabolical of us. Then, once again, in violation of the rules and over myobjections, Judge Baylson let the witness give a long speech about his own legalconclusions regarding 861 (which, again, were fatally flawed). Mr. Escher thentestified that at the meeting he had told us “numerous times” that “861 was notapplicable.” Why? Because, as he put it, Mr. Hoffman “had no foreign involvementat all.” (During this testimony, the ever-slimy Mr. Miller kept referring to the861 issue as a “story.”) Then Mr. Escher said this:“These twelve questions—it was very important for them to get the twelvequestions, and I repeatedly told them that I didn’t want to answer the twelvequestions, because they were not applicable, and they pressed the point andpressed the point, and after a while I did answer the twelve questions,reluctantly. I felt I was being pushed into a corner on something that I had noidea why that—after my explanations to them, they still wanted these questionsanswered.”That’s a lot of weirdness packed into two sentences. Let’s see: 1) Why would henot want to answer questions about how to determine what someone owes? 2) How onearth can questions not be “applicable”? 3) If the answers were clear, why washe “reluctant” to give them? He was happy to give a long-winded monologueexplaining his erroneous conclusions, but he didn’t want to then answer twelvebasic, yes-or-no questions (and then whined about our persistence in askingthem). Why? 4) It’s a big stretch to say he answered the questions; he didn’teven understand half of them.At trial, Mr. Miller then asked Mr. Escher whether he “made it clear” to us atthe meeting that, in Mr. Escher’s opinion, our “story was wrong about income notbeing taxable.” Mr. Escher answered that he “said it over and over again.” Thatabout sums up the standard government bureaucrat mentality: You’re wrong, you’rewrong, you’re wrong! Take my word for it, don’t ask me for citations, and don’task me any more questions!On cross-examination, I mentioned that Mr. Escher had “talked a little aboutforeign tax credits,” and asked him if “that’s what 861 is all about.” Heanswered, “That’s part of what it’s about, yes. Well, it’s not exclusively aboutforeign tax credits.” When I asked if 861 itself ever mentions foreign taxcredits, he said that to his “recollection,” it does, but he didn’t know where.At trial we did a word search which showed that, in Section 861, foreign taxcredits are only mentioned in obscure rules applicable to hardly anyone. Had thejury been awake, they should have been able to see that Mr. Escher was justsaying what he was told to say, and that in reality he knew little or nothingabout the law, and that his position was not based at all on reading the law.Much of Mr. Escher’s subsequent testimony was as muddled as it was at Mr.Hoffman’s meeting. For example, I asked whether the twelve questions were about“how to properly determine someone’s taxable domestic income.” After Mr.Escher’s first rambling, uncertain non-answer, I said, “I’m not asking whetheryou agreed with [Mr. Hoffman’s] conclusions, but were the questions about how todetermine taxable income? ” He gave another odd answer: “The term ‘taxableincome’ was used in the questions, yes.” Do these people go to obfuscationschool, or what? Why couldn’t he just say “Yes, they were about determiningtaxable income”?Not much else coherent happened after that, so Mr. Escher was dismissed as awitness and we took our mid-afternoon break.NEXT WITNESSThe government’s next witness was Evan Davis, an attorney with the Tax Divisionof the DOJ, who had previously been involved in illegally shutting down severalweb sites (owned by others) mentioning 861. The government did this bymisapplying the “abusive tax shelter” laws (as I described earlier), tocircumvent the First Amendment. Mr. Davis had “deposed” (officially questioned)me in 2002, during his efforts to forcibly silence, via court order, ThurstonBell, the author of the “Gross Income” article which first introduced me to the861 issue. On the stand, Mr. Davis quickly lied, saying that Mr. Bell “wasselling an abusive tax scheme,” when he had done nothing of the sort. (Mr. Bellhad expressed his conclusions about the law, and then tried to help people get alittle due process in their dealings with the IRS. That was all.)Mr. Davis then testified that during my deposition, I explained that I hadlooked into “tax protestor theories” (his wording), and that I “had disproventhem” prior to hearing about 861 in late 1997 or early 1998. Always eager todivide and conquer, at my deposition Mr. Davis brought up a minor disagreementbetween Mr. Bell and myself about the significance of older statutes andregulations. Mr. Bell had suggested that courts wouldn’t want to consider“legislative history” (the origin and evolution of certain parts of the law) ina civil case, to which I answered that “I don’t care what the courts willaccept,” because I wasn’t planning to go to court—I was focusing on showing thetruth to the public. In other words, the history of 861 shows a clear pattern ofintent to deceive, whether any court wants to look at it or not. No doubt Mr.Davis was hoping the jury would hear that as “I don’t care what courtsthink”—which, to a certain extent, is actually true, though it’s not what I wassaying.Again from the deposition in 2002, Mr. Davis pointed out that he had asked me ifI knew of any court rulings upholding my position, and I answered, “No, Ihaven’t really seen any court case that addresses the substance at all,” addingthat I had seen “a few Tax Court cases in which they basically assert that it’sfrivolous, and refuse to talk about it, and dismiss it.” Then he asked about anAppeals court case, to which I responded, “From what I recall, they simply said,‘Well, the Tax Court said it’s frivolous, and we’re just agreeing’; I don’tbelieve it actually addressed the substance of it.” Then the prosecutor had Mr.Davis read something I said at the deposition, which was that “the law says whatthe law says,” and if some judge wanted to say that “the law doesn’t mean whatit says, I’m not going to believe it until they show me the law that says it.”FAITH VERSUS JUDGMENTLet’s pause the story for a moment to consider something. Why would thegovernment want the jury to be seeing and hearing this stuff? To me it soundslike the attitude of an objective, skeptical thinker. Isn’t that how peopleshould approach life?Not according to most people. The government was probably quite confident thatmost people would react to such an attitude, not with agreement, but withdisdain and disgust. “Who are you to presume to question what a judge says? Whoare you to use your own judgment to decide what’s true, instead of blindlyaccepting whatever authority tells you (as the rest of us do)?” Apparentlythat’s how a lot of Americans (I can think of twelve in particular) think—orfail to think, to be more precise. The government continued its theme of “howdare you question the government” throughout the trial, and apparently it workedquite well on the anti-thought brigade in the jury box.THEY HAVE SPOKENMr. Davis then explained that Mr. Bell, in his injunction case, submitted myTheft by Deception video as evidence. Then he quoted the judge in that case assaying that he agreed with the government that the 861 evidence is “completelymeritless” and “nonsensical.” (Again, I hope the reader at least skims over my“Taxable Income” report in Appendix A of this book, to see how asinine suchaccusations are.)Then Mr. Davis testified about another injunction case he was involved in, thisone down in Florida, at which I also testified. It was my job at that trial toexplain the 861 issue to the judge. (I didn’t have any other involvement withthe person they were trying to shut up in that case.) The judge in that case,Judge Steven Merryday, struck all of my testimony from the record after I gaveit. (Incidentally, right after my testimony, the judge actually complimented meon the cogency and succinctness of my explanation of the position, before hestruck all of it from the record.) But during my testimony in that case, I againdemonstrated what a horrible heretic I am, by saying this:“Someone who interprets the law, their interpretation is only as valid as howclosely it matches what it is interpreting. In other words, if a judge were tosay that the sky is green, it would not become green.”Then Mr. Davis read from Judge Merryday’s comments about my testimony, sayingthat while “the sky has an inherent and inalterable feature,” “what income is oris not subject to tax” is not constant, “so if the United States Supreme Courtsays in the laws of the United States that item A is taxable, item A istaxable.” What about what the written law actually says? I guess that doesn’tmatter. It seems we now have a “judiciary,” where any assertion by someone in ablack robe matters more than what the written law actually says.Incidentally, the Supreme Court has never addressed the 861 evidence. However,in an interesting coincidence, it did recently mention the regulations under861, though in a different context. In the case of Boeing v. United States (537U.S. 437), the Court said that “In promulgating 26 CFR 1.861-8 (1979), theSecretary of the Treasury exercised his rulemaking authority,” and added thateven the Supreme Court “must still treat the regulation with deference.” Theruling then admitted that even the Supreme Court “must defer to [the IRSCommissioner’s] regulatory interpretations of the Code so long as they arereasonable.” So, essentially the Supreme Court said that, unless there issomething clearly wrong with the regulations—which no one has claimed about theregs under 861—the Court would defer the proper interpretation of the law to theregulations, such as 26 CFR § 1.861-8, which is the main section upon which myconclusions are based (since it is the section for determining one’s “taxableincome from sources within the United States”). So why should I ask judges ifI’m right, when the Supreme Court says that judges are to defer to theregulations, upon which my conclusions are based?(As another interesting coincidence, in a dissenting opinion in that Boeingcase, Justice Clarence Thomas said that “Before placing its hand in thetaxpayer’s pocket, the government must place its finger on the law authorizingits action.” Oh, how I wish that were true.)Finally, the prosecution had Mr. Davis read a footnote from Judge Merryday’sruling in the injunction case, which included this: “Having carefully viewedTheft by Deception , I confidently retain the conviction that the Section 861argument is frivolous and illogical.”PROGRAM-THINK ALERT!Do you find yourself persuaded by the “because we said so” message of thegovernment? Do you find all those letters and “rulings” using terms like“frivolous,” “illogical” and “without merit” to be compelling? Does your brainautomatically assign credibility and weight to the unsupported but vehementassertions of supposed “authorities”? When they say it loudly, repeatedly, andconfidently, do you feel your own ability to doubt “conventional wisdom”weakening? Who are you to even examine an issue which a judge has deemed to benonsense?If such authoritarian brow-beating works on you, you’re certainly not alone. Notby a long shot. When those who are supposed to be “in the know” proclaim what istrue, most people don’t have the intellectual confidence to resist conforming tothe accepted beliefs. Who are we to disagree with the “experts”? Isn’t it a safebet that they know more than we do? Actually, no, it’s not. But whatever theyknow, why should we ever perceive unsupported assertions as being persuasive? Ifthe so-called experts have some evidence we don’t have, isn’t it reasonable toask them to show it to us, instead of just giving us unsupported proclamations?In this case, the silliness of our tendency to believe so-called experts isgreatly compounded by the fact that those same “experts” keep admitting thatthey are not familiar with the evidence. Charles Judge admitted he had neverdealt with 861 prior to my case. Cathy Spaulding admitted she wasn’t familiarwith the sections I showed her. As you’ll soon see, even Judge Baylson displayedan astonishing ignorance of federal tax law. That being the case, what rationaleis there for me to set aside the many hundreds of hours of extensive researchI’ve done, and to ignore my own in-depth familiarity with the relevant evidence,in favor of the out-of-thin-air claims of people who have already demonstratedprofound ignorance of the issue and the evidence? Does someone’s office orcredentials give him or her some magical access to the truth which doesn’trequire actually looking at the evidence? And do the opinions of a lot ofignorant people add up to something more authoritative than the opinion of oneignoramus? Does something baseless and false become true when enough peoplerepeat it? Of course not.“Program-think” tendencies are even stronger when dealing with a subject thelistener is unfamiliar with. In the absence of any first-hand knowledge about asubject, resorting to blind faith in the opinions of the “experts” happensalmost automatically. If, on the other hand, some self-proclaimed “expert” sayssomething about a subject with which the listener is familiar, a healthyskepticism is far more likely to occur. Think of some subject you know a fairamount about. It’s likely that at some point you’ve heard an opinion fromsomeone claiming to be an “expert,” but you had the confidence to respond with“That guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” But when it comes to thingsyou’re not familiar with (tax law, perhaps), it’s all too easy to assume thatanyone presenting himself as an “expert” must have reached his conclusions insome rational, informed manner.Consider Judge Merryday’s comments about my video. If he did watch it, as hesaid, and still declared the issue to be “frivolous” and “illogical,” it’s okayfor you to take his word for it, right? Of course, he gave no explanation orevidence, only his conclusion, but isn’t that enough? He is a judge, after all,while I’m a nasty convict with no credentials. So did his proclamation convinceyou that I’m not only wrong, but that my conclusions are “illogical” and“frivolous”?I know that a lot of people who have actually seen my video will not be swayedin the least by Judge Merryday’s asinine proclamation. As is always the case,those who have seen the evidence are a lot harder to scare away than those whoare just choosing whom to blindly believe. Of course, that’s why the governmentis trying so hard to suppress the evidence, not just at my trial but throughoutthe country.Blind faith is so easy, and doing your own research and investigation is such abother, that most people choose the former. The people on my jury, and probablymany people who read this book, are among those people who instinctively assignmore credibility to the bare assertions of government officials (people whobenefit from the income tax deception) than to the evidence from the law which Idirectly quote. Oh well, the truth always seems to be an uphill battle, but itusually beats out the lie in the long run. Maybe it will happen this time, too.“All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed, second, it isviolently opposed, and third, it is accepted as self-evident.”[Arthur Schopenhauer]At the moment, we’re still at stage two.Getting back to the trial, we see a fine example of assertion versus substance.I asked Mr. Davis about the Tax Court ruling in the “Madge” case, which had comeup as one of those “rulings” supposedly refuting the 861 evidence. Thegovernment had argued that, because I was aware of that “ruling,” I couldn’tpossibly have still believed what I was saying. As I brought out oncross-examination, however, nowhere does the Madge ruling even mention Section861, or any of the related regulations. Not one peep. And I’m supposed to viewthat ruling as a substantive proof that my position is incorrect? (Thegovernment seemed to think so.)AGREEING WITH MYSELFBecause the government often wanted witnesses to read a line here and there outof context, on cross-examination I would go back and have the person read theparts that put the context back in. For example, I had Mr. Davis read thefollowing, which is from a private e-mail I sent to Dr. Clayton:“At least 95 percent of the form letters, press releases, or other attempts torefute the 861 evidence, both by government officials and private sector taxprofessionals, are nothing more than ‘cut and paste’ quotations from whatsomeone else said. Someone makes an assertion, and no matter how provably wrongit is, or how little support in the law there is for it, the intellectually lazystatus quo proponents, government and otherwise, just parrot the same line, asif quoting someone else making a mistake qualifies as an authoritative rebuttal.The history of the government’s attempts to refute the 861 evidence looks lesslike an explanation and more like a rumor. The Tax Court makes some lameaccusation that the issue is ‘frivolous,’ as in the Aiello case. The Tax Courtthen quotes ITSELF making that accusation as if that proves something.”Yeah, what he said.BASELESS ASSERTIONThe term “baseless assertion,” which I’m rather fond of, means a statement whichisn’t backed by any evidence or reasoning, such as: “You’re not supposed to use861 and its regulations to determine your taxable domestic income!” Many IRSpaper-pushers assert that those sections are to be used only by certain peoplein certain situations. (Never mind that they often disagree with each otherabout what those certain situations are.) It’s quite easy for the averagespectator to simply assume that there must be some good reason that IRSbureaucrats make such a claim; there must be something in the law that led themto conclude that. And that’s exactly why people use baseless assertions: becauseif you sound sure of yourself, most listeners will assume you have some reasonfor thinking what you think.Let’s turn things around with a hypothetical example. Suppose you heard thefollowing exchange between an IRS agent and a citizen:IRS Guy: “So Section 1 imposes a tax on every individual’s taxable income.”Other Guy: “No, you’re taking that out of context. That tax applies only to menover the age of 53, and women over the age of 62.”IRS Guy: “What? Where does it say that?”Other Guy: “See, you have to understand what that section is for. It’s fortaxing men and women of certain ages. It doesn’t apply to me.”IRS Guy: “That’s not what it says. It says ‘every individual’.”Other Guy: “Look, I’ve told you twice, your interpretation is flawed. And hereis a letter from my cousin, who also says your argument is frivolous.”If you heard that, who would you believe? Without being personally familiar withthe evidence, you’d probably believe whichever individual more conveyed theimage of being an authority on the subject. In other words, having no evidence,you’d be stuck comparing the apparent credibility of the speakers. (I just madeup the thing about taxing people over certain ages, but how would you know thatif you were not familiar with the law?)If you have no access to actual evidence, you may be forced to guess at whichperson is telling the truth. What’s really unfortunate, however, is how oftenpeople reject evidence they do have access to—such as what I’ve already cited inthis book—in favor of the mere appearance of credibility. For example, moretimes than I can count I’ve witnessed exchanges very much like the one above,except that it was the IRS making the assertion that most people should ignore861, while the other person pointed out all the places where the regulationsthemselves unequivocally and unconditionally say that one should use 861 and itsregulations to determine his “taxable income from sources within the UnitedStates.” Where does the law say most people should ignore those sections? Itdoesn’t. Ever. Anywhere. Yet the government can continually fling out baselessassertions—often conflicting assertions—and a lot of people assume that ifsomeone from the government says it, they must know better than someuncredentialed nobody like me. Not once at my trial did any government witnesseven pretend to cite anything from the law supporting the claim, parroted bymost of their witnesses, that I had no business looking to 861. But they “told”me, over and over, so how could I possibly believe otherwise? Maybe because thelaw “told me” the exact opposite.ONE MORE ASSERTIONAfter Mr. Davis was dismissed as a witness, court pretty much ended for the day,except for one thing that happened after the jury left. The government wantedthe jury to hear about an appellate court ruling which had just come out,upholding the bogus injunction imposed upon Thurston Bell by the lower court. Ofcourse, a ruling that just came out couldn’t possibly be relevant to what Ibelieved years earlier. Nonetheless, Judge Baylson decided to tell the juryabout it anyway: one more baseless assertion by a self-proclaimed “authority” tosway the unthinking jurors. (Incidentally, the appellate court ruling was allabout First Amendment issues, and did not address the substance of the 861issue. But then, neither did most of the other “rulings” the government cites asif they prove something.)After that we headed back to the hotel. Already more than one observer hadvoiced concerns that the jurors seemed to be paying little attention, with oneobserver commenting that he didn’t think anyone on the jury had an IQ over 100.Once again, I didn’t get much sleep, as Mr. Becraft and I (and another nastyconspirator) continued to prepare the defense case.DAY THREEDay three began with the government calling its star witness, Donald Pearlman,the IRS Special Agent in charge of the vilification—I mean, investigation—of me.(Picture Steven Spielberg with less hair, a lot less imagination andoriginality, and the personality of a crayfish; that pretty much sums up AgentPearlman.) After describing his job, Mr. Pearlman explained how he got involvedin my case. Early on in his testimony he said something about my web sites whichwas quite revealing:“I reviewed the contents of those websites, and made a determination that therewere potential violations of the criminal statutes of the Internal Revenue Code,and proceeded forward with my investigation.”That one sentence tells a lot about Agent Pearlman’s view of the world. Neitherof the web sites he was talking about (www.taxableincome.net andwww.theft-by-deception.com) tells anyone to do anything. They give no advice,and encourage people to look at the evidence for themselves instead of takinganyone’s word for it (including mine). The sites explain my conclusions and tellpeople how to order the video, which also doesn’t tell anyone to do anything.What kind of fascist outlook would someone have to have to view having such websites as a crime? This is the same police-state mentality that was foundthroughout Pearlman’s request for permission to raid my home. That document madeit plain that Agent Pearlman really is insane enough to view it as a crime forsomeone to voice an opinion that the government doesn’t like.At trial, Agent Pearlman then said that he asked for a search warrant “Becauseof the potential destruction of key evidence.” Huh? Like what? Remember, theyknew everything I was doing because I told them what I was doing. So, what“evidence” was he looking for that he thought I might try to destroy? The videoI had given them? The report I had given to them? The letters I sent to them?The publicly available web sites? Their own sworn affidavit documents how I wasnot just open but also very vocal about everything I was doing, and it didn’teven suggest that I was doing anything sneaky or deceptive. So what on earth wasthe supposed “evidence” that Agent Pearlman thought I might want to destroy?Oddly, Mr. Miller even asked Agent Pearlman what other “evidence” he was lookingfor, and the only specific thing Agent Pearlman could think of was “items ofincome or expense.” They knew about our income—because we told them about it andour customers told them about it. If they had had some reason to think we werehiding some other income, that could make sense. But they didn’t, nor did theyeven pretend to. So is it okay for the IRS to raid someone’s home just to findout whether that person has any income the IRS doesn’t know about, even ifthere’s no reason to think that he does? Apparently Agent Pearlman thinks so—andso do most IRS agents, federal prosecutors, federal judges, etc. Of course, thereason that the Fourth Amendment says that armed raids are supposed to require“probable cause” is so we don’t have to live in a country where governmentagents can arbitrarily invade someone’s home just to see whether that person isdoing anything naughty or deceptive.Now let’s see what compelling evidence of my despicable criminal behavior theraid uncovered. After all, they took thirty-five boxes of stuff from our house,claiming it to be evidence of criminal activity, so there must be somethingdamning in there somewhere! Agent Pearlman testified to finding the following:1) He found something from our mortgage company showing that once we made apayment of $7,000 at one time. (Oh, the horror.)2) He found a canceled check for about $2,400, made out to the IRS, which said“Abolish the IRS” on the comment line. To state the obvious, that was a checkfrom back when we were still sending the IRS money. So expressing anti-IRSopinions apparently is viewed as a crime by Jackboot Pearlman, even when one isstill filing and paying.3) He found a manila envelope containing our 1996 income tax return and on theenvelope it said “’96 federal extortion pay-off.” That one wasn’t even sentanywhere; it was just how I labeled it in my own files. So even thinking badthings about the IRS, without saying anything to anyone else, and while stillfiling and paying, apparently is (in the eyes of looney's like Pearlman) alsoillegal. Can you say “thought crime”?4) He found various form letters, sent by government folk to other people whohad asked questions about the federal income tax, who then (at my request) sentcopies of the responses to me. (I did this because I wanted to see if thegovernment ever gave anyone a substantive response to the issue. Nope.) One ofthe letters was a non-response from my own congress twit, Joe Hoeffel.5) From the computers they swiped, they found private e-mails (or at least theywere private until the American Gestapo stole them) in which I expressed mydislike of the IRS, saying things like “the IRS pisses me off,” as well as usingother terminology to describe the IRS which I don’t want to repeat here becauseI know my mom will be reading this book. One of those e-mail messages, which Mr.Miller had Agent Pearlman read, included this: “Regardless of the proof, itisn’t easy for most folks to come to grips with the fact that our government isone big extortionist fraud.” Wait a second, aren’t they supposed to be provingthat I don’t believe the government is misapplying the law? So why quotesomething from a private correspondence which agrees with what I say publicly:that the government is defrauding people who don’t actually owe the income tax?They quoted from a few other e-mail messages which bluntly stated my goals. Onesaid that it wasn’t my goal just to save myself from the IRS’s “evil clutches,”but that I wanted “to get the IRS in my evil clutches and end its abominableexistence.” Elsewhere I said that “defending one peasant at a time against the[IRS] dragon just ain’t doin’ it for me. I intend to [bleep] the dragon up whilehe sleeps in his own lair.”THE SIN OF HOSTILITYLet me momentarily interrupt this listing of irrelevant “evidence” uncovered bythe ever-vigilant Agent Pearlman to say a couple of words about my animositytoward the IRS, which the government brought up at trial (and which I suspect ispretty evident in this book as well). Several spectators at the trial said thatthey thought my anti-IRS hostility, as shown in my private emails to friends(not actually voiced to IRS employees) probably counted heavily against me inthe eyes of the jury.How exactly does a dislike for the IRS constitute proof that I think my incomeis taxable? It doesn’t, of course. Obviously, my anger at the federalextortionists is perfectly consistent with believing that the IRS is robbingpeople of money they don’t owe. Of note, the feds even brought up anti-IRScomments I made before and after learning about 861. (I didn’t like theirextortionist tactics even when I assumed they were “legal.”) Their own evidenceshowed that back when we still thought we owed the tax, we continued to file andpay, while at the same time expressing our distaste for how the IRS functions.So our dislike of the IRS—which isn’t exactly unheard-of in this country—wasobviously not the reason we stopped filing.In short, the government did not harp on our disdain for the IRS in order toprove “willfulness,” because it proves nothing of the kind. (Of course wedislike an organization that illegally defrauds, extorts, and robs our fellowAmericans of a trillion dollars a year.) They harped on it knowing that manypeople pride themselves on their own obedience to, and reverence for, authority.(”I’m good, and I do what I’m told!”) The government wanted to convey to thejury the message “He’s not like you! He hates the government!” In retrospect,I’m proud to say: No, I’m not like them, and never will be. They valueconformity and obedience; I value truth and justice. And yes, I do say nastythings about people who commit injustice, and I have no intention of stopping.MORE NON-EVIDENCELet’s pick up where we left off with listing the “evidence” uncovered by theever-vigilant (ever-nosy) Agent Pearlman’s raid on my home.6) He then read from an e-mail in which I criticized the Constitution becauseit’s too pro-government. (I believe history has unmistakably proven that theanti-federalists, including Thomas Jefferson, were right all along, and thatpredictions by people such as James Madison (see Federalist #45) that thefederal government would remain small and limited were way off base.) My e-mailsalso explained my political philosophy, including statements such as this:“Nothing can give anyone the right to rule me, even in the most limited way.Nothing can obligate me to ignore my own judgment in favor of some ‘law’. ”What did that statement have to do with the reason we stopped filing? Not athing. I didn’t stop filing because of political beliefs—beliefs I had held foryears while still sending returns and payments to the IRS. So how are theyrelevant? They aren’t. Should they have been excluded from the trial? Yes. Whenthe tendency of something to prejudice the jury outweighs its relevance to theactual crime charged, the judge is supposed to keep it out of the trial. Infact, in pre-trial hearings Judge Baylson stated quite plainly that my politicalphilosophy should not be brought up in front of the jury. But when Mr. Millerdid exactly that, the judge did nothing to stop it.7) Agent Pearlman then read from an e-mail in which I expressed a desire to seemore and more people resisting the IRS’s illegal demands, until such resistanceagainst IRS lawlessness “crushes their pathetic extortionist asses.” (And yes, Ido still wish to see that, because it’s quite obvious that our pseudo-justicesystem is never going to do the right thing on its own.) In another formerlyprivate e-mail, I stated that “the IRS is an extortion racket which pretendsthat it is backed by law.” In that same e-mail I then explained that “if thecourt system was the final recourse,” I wouldn’t be fighting the fraud, and thatI believed that the end of the fraud will not come from “a court, or a hearing,or a judge, or a ruling,” but would only come when “one million people with guns[tell] the IRS to go [bleep] itself.” In another e-mail, I put it this way: “Thegovernment has made it perfectly clear that they will not admit the truth, orgive up the income tax deception willingly, so we must make them do itunwillingly.”Once again, how does that prove that I don’t believe what I’ve been saying? Notehow I refer to the income tax “deception” and “fraud.” The government’s supposed“evidence” proves that I am innocent, that I believe the IRS is taking moneyfrom people who don’t legally owe it. Hating the IRS is not the “crime” I wascharged with, nor is it a crime at all. (I would gladly plead guilty tointensely disliking the IRS.) Nor is it a crime to want to see massive publicresistance to an illegal extortion racket.Having been railroaded via a mock trial, I believe more strongly than ever thatthe system will never grant justice on its own. A lot of people don’t want tohear that; they like to think that their government will end up doing the rightthing. But the government wanted the jury to see those e-mails, not because theyprove guilt of an actual crime—they prove the exact opposite—but so the jurywould again think, “He’s not one of us.” Damn right I’m not!8) After a friend of mine was terrorized and harassed into paying the IRS a lotof money that he knew he didn’t owe, I made this statement, in an e-mail AgentPearlman read from at trial: “I decided after that that I would not stop untilthe IRS was nothing more than a reference in the history books. I’m glad I’m notthe only one whose blood boils at this injustice.” Do I sound like someone whowas just trying to get out of paying his “fair share”? Does it sound as if Ididn’t really believe in what I was saying and doing?PROOF OF WHAT?Sorry to beat the point to death, but what was the government trying to provewith all this? After their massive fishing expedition, and snooping in everynook and cranny they could find for several years, where was the evidence of my“tax fraud scheme,” as they like to say? Where was the evidence about me lyingabout anything, or hiding anything? At trial they were supposed to be trying toprove that I was intentionally violating the law by not filing income taxreturns. In other words, they were supposed to be proving that I believed myincome was taxable. How do any of the above-mentioned e-mails even hint at sucha thing (much less prove it “beyond a reasonable doubt”)? They don’t. They showthe exact opposite: that I believe that most people, including myself and mywife, do not legally owe federal income taxes, and that the IRS is illegallycollecting money which is not actually owed, and that I’m really damn angryabout it.So when would the government get around to proving that I believe my income tobe taxable—an essential element of the alleged crime? As you’ll see, they neverdid. Then again, apparently they didn’t need to.THE INTERVIEWAgent Pearlman then testified about statements I made when he questioned mewhile the other IRS thugs were busy rummaging through my home, back in May of2003. Most of it was pretty boring: I confirmed I had income, confirmed I hadstopped filing, confirmed I was the author of the web sites, etc. Of course, allof that I had been telling the IRS (and the rest of the country) for years.Agent Pearlman also correctly testified that I told him that I do not considerform letters to be legally binding (nor does the IRS or any court, but he didn’tmention that), and that I found the attempts to refute the 861 evidence to beunconvincing.Agent Pearlman then displayed his unthinking mentality once again, explainingthat I had said that if a judge “informed” me that I was wrong, I wouldn’tagree. You see, to authoritarians it’s about being “told” what to think, ratherthan being about looking at the evidence and explaining or discussing the issue.In Agent Pearlman’s tyrannical view, when an authority figure says “You’rewrong,” no one has the right to still believe otherwise.THE FUN PARTDuring “direct examination” of each of the government’s witnesses, I wasfrantically making notes of things I wanted to bring up on cross-examination.When the time came to cross-examine Agent Pearlman, one of the first things Iasked was what “potential violations” of law he thought he detected when lookingat my web sites. He answered that he thought that “the websites were potentiallyoperating in an effort to interfere with the administration of Internal RevenueLaws.” Incidentally, while there is a law against forcibly or “corruptly”interfering with the administration of the tax laws—which they “investigated” mefor but didn’t charge me with—inconveniencing the IRS by itself is not a crime,though I’m sure Pearlman wishes it were. So what were the supposed “potentialviolations” Pearlman thought he saw on my web sites? Here are his answers whileon the stand:1) On the www.theft-by-deception.com web site, I posted the names and officeaddresses of government officials (mostly IRS and DOJ) who had been sent freecopies of my Theft by Deception video. Pearlman then alleged that I calledeveryone on that list “criminals,” which was a lie. On further questioning, hetalked about the cover letter I sent along with the video (the text of which Iposted on the web site), which told the recipient that he could no longer pleadignorance about the information, and asked him to “do the right thing.” Wow,when did it become illegal to ask government employees to do the right thing? Afutile effort, probably, but a crime?2) On the web sites I published transcripts of IRS meetings in cases wherepeople had filed claims for refund. As it happens, those pages also explicitlytold people not to view the transcripts as instructions on what to dothemselves. So apparently Agent Pearlman thinks that publishing verbatim thestupid comments of IRS employees is also a crime.3) In an attempt to make his list of “potential violations” less pathetic, AgentPearlman added another bald-faced lie, alleging that the web sites were“potentially providing guidance to people not to file their tax returns.” So,being quite familiar with what my own web sites say, I asked him whether, uponreviewing my sites, he had come across a statement of mine saying not only thatI am not a CPA or an attorney, but also that “I do not want people accepting myconclusions at face value.” Yes, he did remember seeing that, he said. (My sitesalso said that people should not take my word for anything, that people mustdetermine their own legal responsibilities, and that if they think they owe thetax, they should “file and pay up.”) So, once again, voicing an opinion—whiletelling people not to take my word for anything—constitutes a crime in the eyesof Agent Pearlman.ANYTHING DISHONEST?I then asked Agent Pearlman whether in all of his extensive investigating heever found any evidence of my wife and I hiding anything or lying aboutanything. After basically admitting that we hadn’t hidden anything, andrealizing how that must look, he was desperate to come up with something. So hebrought up a letter I had sent years before to the Social SecurityAdministration, asking if participation in Social Security was optional, and ifso, asking how to opt out. Of course, there’s nothing remotely dishonest aboutthat, and it had nothing to do with the case or the 861 evidence, but desperatefor anything to make me look bad, Pearlman characterized my open question to theSSA as “trying to disguise at least the Social Security number.” What? Thatwasn’t just spin; it was an outright lie. (How does one “disguise” a SocialSecurity number? With a Groucho Marx nose and glasses?) I wasn’t “disguising”anything; I was openly asking the government a question about whether one couldopt out of the Social Security system—another crime in Pearlman’s eyes,apparently.That was it. That was all the hiding or deception that Pearlman could fabricateout of the tens of thousands of pages of e-mails and letters: we asked theSocial Security Administration whether we could choose not to participate in the“Social Security” Ponzi scheme. (Other than asking the question, we never didanything about it.)I’m guessing that if the feds picked a citizen at random, went through all ofhis correspondence and records, nine times out of ten they could find somethinghe lied about or concealed. Not so with us, which is why Pearlman had to do hiscreative “spin” (lie) about us merely asking a question. I then got AgentPearlman to admit that on multiple occasions, we had written to variousgovernment officials, telling them that we were still receiving income, andexplaining why we had stopped filing—not exactly the behavior of secretive,sneaky “tax cheats.”DENYING THE OBVIOUSWhen I asked about our mortgage being paid off early, which I guess was supposedto be proof of something shady and devious, Agent Pearlman went intosuper-weasel mode (no offense to all those cute little mustelids out there).Earlier in the case the government had tried to make a big deal about this, topaint us as greedy and to stir up in the jury envy against us. I asked whetherPearlman was aware that during the time period when we were making extrapayments on our mortgage, Tessa’s father’s estate was gifting us large checks(adding up to about ten thousand dollars a year), in about the same amounts asthe extra payments we made on our mortgage. Yes, he acknowledged that. Are suchgifts taxable? No, he admitted, they are not. Then I asked if maybe those checkshad something to do with our making the extra payments (duh).“It could,” Mr. Weasel responded, prompting chuckles from the courtroomspectators. It could? But maybe not? Any moron looking at the record could seethat those extra mortgage payments were a direct result of having received thosenon-taxable gifts. Yet Weasel Pearlman wouldn’t admit that, because it wouldhamper the government’s attempts to demonize me. To make sure his slimyevasiveness would be apparent even to the most unobservant juror, I had afollow-up question:Me: “So, in other words, we had a large source of income the IRS agrees was nottaxable, that could have been paying off the mortgage?”Mr. Weasel: “I would not characterize it that way, no.”Again, the trial transcript notes laughter from the courtroom audience. No,Agent Slimeball wouldn’t “characterize” the facts that way, because it wouldundermine their dishonest and irrelevant attempt to make the jury hate us fornot paying our “fair share,” by making them think we paid off our mortgageinstead.Next, I brought up an anti-IRS comment (“Abolish the IRS”) found on a check madeout to the IRS, and asked Agent Pearlman if it would be accurate “tocharacterize this as demonstrating that I did not like the IRS, but I was payingthe tax.” Who could possibly disagree with that? His response: “I’m not going tocharacterize it as anything like that.” That’s probably because he’s adishonest, unscrupulous heap of dung who doesn’t want to admit an undeniabletruth, for fear it might get in the way of them wrongfully imprisoning someonewhom they know had committed no crime. (I refrained from saying that in court.Just barely.)He used similar evasive floundering when I asked about the note on the envelopecontaining the copy of our 1996 tax return, which said “’96 Federal ExtortionPay-Off.” Since the return showed that we had sent the IRS over $10,000 for1996, didn’t that also show that even though we already disliked the IRS backthen (before ever hearing of 861), we nonetheless continued to pay what wethought we owed? Agent Slime wouldn’t answer.Pearlman continued his pattern of refusing to admit obvious facts when I askedhim whether IRS form letters carry any legal weight. The correct answer, asevery IRS employee (especially a “Special Agent”) knows full well, is “No, theycarry no legal authority.” But instead of admitting that, he tap-danced aroundthe question for a while, and then this exchange occurred:Me: “When the IRS sends out a form letter—not a copy of an actual regulation,but a form letter expressing an opinion or interpretation—does the IRS considerthem legally binding?”Mr. Weasel: “You’d have to show me specifically what letter you’re talkingabout. A form letter, I can’t generalize that.”Actually, he could, but he wouldn’t. The Internal Revenue Manual (cited above)makes it clear that the only things the IRS considers universally legallybinding are statutes, regulations, and Supreme Court rulings. That’s all. But ifPearlman had admitted what he knew to be the truth—that those “notices” theprosecution kept talking about carry absolutely no legal weight, and wetherefore had no obligation to agree with them or abide by them—then thegovernment’s lame case would have completely dissolved on the spot. So Pearlmanchose not to admit what he knew to be the truth.His evasiveness continued when I asked whether the “notices” the government hadpresented were simply IRS form letters “cut and pasted” from IRS templateletters. His evasiveness grew even worse when I asked whether those lettersactually answer any of the questions they were supposed to be responding to.(They don’t.) The more specific I got with individual letters—the government’sown exhibits—the more rambling and non-responsive were Pearlman’s answers. Hedidn’t want to admit that:1) I have never said that Section 861 itself exempts my income.2) I have never claimed that only income from outside the U.S. is taxable.(Again, Section 861 is about taxable income from inside the U.S.)3) I have never claimed that only foreigners can be taxed. (Citizens are taxedon income they receive from international trade.)4) I have never argued that wages aren’t income.5) I have never said that the Sixteenth Amendment is unconstitutional.6) The form letters shown didn’t quote anything from the regulations to supporttheir statements.7) One of the form letters seemed to agree that Section 1.861-8 of theregulations is to be used for determining one’s taxable domestic income.Pearlman knew all of the above to be unquestionably true, but he was not aboutto admit any of it in front of the jury. After his prolonged dishonesty,question-dodging, and pretended inability to recall things, we took ourmid-morning break.When things started up again, Pearlman testified that the IRS had seizedsomewhere around ten thousand e-mails from my computers, and that IRS employeeshad directly reviewed about 1,000 individual e-mails. (Computer word searcheswould determine which they would bother to read.) So I asked whether, in all ofthose previously private communications, the IRS had come across any message inwhich I indicated that I actually thought my income was taxable. If I had madesuch a statement, would it have come up at trial? Pearlman admitted that itwould have (obviously). And did I ever say such a thing, in any of those e-mailsthey went through? His answer: “I have to look at the contents of the e-mails.To my knowledge, no.” (As if he might have forgotten it if I had ever said sucha thing. Liar, liar, pants on fire!)Then we went through the contents of various individual e-mails—just the onesthe government chose to present, from among those thousands of e-mails availableto them, which would presumably be the most damning—to see if my statements everhinted that I really believe my income to be taxable. In one after another ofthose government-chosen messages, my comments kept showing quite clearly that Ibelieve that my income is not taxable, and that the IRS is misapplying the law.In other words, out of the thousands of e-mails the government had to choosefrom, even the few they decided to present proved that I was not guilty of thecrime being alleged.Next, I asked Pearlman whether the IRS had found statements of mine regardingpolitical philosophy, which I had written before ever hearing of 861 (i.e., backwhen I was still filing and paying). I wanted to demonstrate that my politicalphilosophy was not the reason I stopped filing, or I would have stopped manyyears earlier. However, though the government had already brought up mypolitical philosophy, despite Judge Baylson saying in pre-trial hearings that itshould not be mentioned at all, the government and the judge now wanted to stopme from cross-examining Pearlman about it. Judge Baylson ruled that politicalphilosophy could not be discussed—which actually meant it could not be discussedby me, while the government was allowed to discuss it repeatedly.I then had Agent Pearlman read some parts of those e-mails which the governmenthad skipped over when presenting them, such as one where I said that I am notadvocating violent resistance, and another in which I said “The feds are theones duping people; we are the ones unduping them.”When I again asked whether we had done anything to hide our income, Mr. Weaselsaid that we hadn’t cooperated with the IRS at the meetings by giving themeverything they asked for. So I asked whether, at those meetings, I had agreedto the amounts of income which were reported to the IRS on 1099 Forms. Yes, headmitted that I had. So the only records I didn’t give them were expenserecords, which would only have reduced the amount they thought I owed. (See howsneaky I am? Only a diabolical scoundrel would deny the IRS access to documentswhich would have lowered that person’s alleged tax liability.)Then I asked about something else the government had “forgotten” to mention inits case: on my web site, I had publicly posted the IRS’s form lettersmentioning 861, and included my detailed rebuttals of each one, showingpoint-by-point why their conclusions were contrary to the law itself. At trial,the government had talked as if I had “ignored” those letters. Here is theexchange about that:Me: “For the form letters I posted on my web site—the IRS form letters—and thenwrote my response to them, would you characterize that as me ignoring thatinformation that I was sent?”Pearlman: “I would characterize it as you ignoring the message that was sent inthose correspondences. Yes, I would.”Me: “Ignoring the message, or disagreeing with the message?”Pearlman: “I don’t know whether or not you disagree with it. I know that youignored it because you didn’t follow the law as it was explained, and as it wasprovided.”Once again, we get a glimpse into the world according to Pearlman. In hiseyes—and apparently in the eyes of the rest of the IRS, DOJ, and federaljudiciary—when an authority figure flings an assertion at you, you eitherblindly accept it as the gospel truth or you’re a criminal. Or, as AgentPearlman himself put it in a follow-up comment: “It’s been my experience byconducting this investigation that time and time again you simply will not takeno for an answer, and that answer, ‘no,’ has been provided to you over and overagain, and you simply do not listen to that answer.”What horrifies me more than that unthinking, Gestapo-like attitude—wherediscussion, evidence and logic are all trumped by any unilateral proclamation ofthe most clueless bureaucrat—is the fact that a lot of Americans (twelve inparticular) agree with that demented view of reality. “You can’t possiblybelieve ‘X,’ because someone in government told you ‘Z’!” It doesn’t matter thatI posted their form letters on my site, thoroughly refuting them with legallybinding citations of law—no, I was “ignoring” their letters because I didn’tblindly believe and blindly obey them.(Another example of this common authority-worshiping viewpoint came from one ofthe government’s pre-trial motions, in which they opined that if Tessa and Itruly believed our “interpretation” of the law was correct, we “would havesought a judicial determination” about it. Why? Apparently some people thinkthat, regardless of what the actual evidence—the law itself—shows, we shouldn’tdare believe it until we get an imagined “authority” to give his blessing to ourconclusions.)Not to sound pompous here, but considering the fact that I know more about thesubstance and history of Section 861 than 99.999999 percent of the population ofthis country, why would I go to someone far less familiar with the evidence,like a federal judge or IRS paper-pusher, to ascertain whether my conclusionsare correct? Sorry, but I don’t need anyone’s permission to believe whatevidence and logic prove. But then, I’ve always been a radical extremist: one ofthose crazy people who believes his own eyes even when people in positions ofpower tell him not to.However, as the saying goes, it’s dangerous to be right when the government iswrong, and that’s especially true when the general public consists mostly ofauthority-worshiping, unthinking sheep. What you see above is the entiresubstance of the testimony from the government’s star witness. And what did heprove? That IRS bureaucrats and form letters (neither of which carry a shred oflegal authority) told me that I was wrong. So that proves I couldn’t havebelieved otherwise, right? Twelve numbskulls seemed to think so.THE LAST WITNESSThe government’s final witness was a “summary witness,” who had never had anycontact with me, but just testified about lots of boring facts and figures(mostly about our income) that had already been stipulated. To make a long,painfully boring story short, sixteen pages of trial transcripts are filled withnothing but talking about individual checks made out to us by our medicaltranscription customers, which we had already acknowledged receiving, and theamounts of which we had already stipulated as accurate.On cross-examination, there were only a couple of things I wanted to ask. Thefirst had to do with the fact that the numbers she was talking about representedour gross receipts before paying the people who worked for us, not our actualprofits. (The IRS liked saying that our business brought in half a milliondollars in the years in question, without mentioning that over half of thatamount went to our typists, making our average yearly income well under $50,000per year—which doesn’t sound nearly as impressive, and isn’t nearly as likely tostir up envy among the jurors.)Then came the point I really wanted to make. Once again, the transcript speaksfor itself.Me: “Now, you stated at the end that you determined that these [payments] were‘gross income.’ When you go to total up these figures and get to the bottom, doyou keep your eyes open for any sorts of income which may be specificallyexempted by a section of the tax code?”Witness: “I normally did, but I did not see that in this case.”Me: “Okay, but it’s normal to keep your eyes open in case there’s some item, andthat would enter into the equation. Is that correct?”Witness: “Sure, sure.”So far, no problem. She knows that some income is exempted by the tax code, butdidn’t see any of that in our case. Here is what happened next:Me: “My last question is, in coming to your total, did you subtract any amountsof income which are exempt from federal taxation because of the Constitutionitself?”Mr. Noud: “Objection.”Judge Baylson: “I’m not sure I understand the question.”Witness: “Yeah, I don’t either.”Judge Baylson (to the witness): “Do you understand the question?”Witness: “No, I do not.”Judge Baylson (to me): “Do you want to rephrase it?”Me: “Did you subtract, to arrive at your bottom number, any amounts of incomewhich are excluded from federal taxation due to the Constitution itself?”Mr. Noud: “Objection.”Me: “Well, she either did or didn’t. It’s a fact.”Judge Baylson (to the witness): “Well, you can answer that ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ if youunderstand it.”Witness: “I’m not sure I understand the question. I mean, if you’re asking if Isubtracted anything from these numbers, I did not.”Since she was the one IRS witness who didn’t lie about anything, I won’t giveher name, though I will point out that she testified that she had worked for theIRS for twenty-four and a half years. I hope the point here is self-evident, butI’ll explain it anyway. As I expected they would, both this veteran IRS agentand this federal judge made it crystal clear that they had no idea that someincome is exempt—is to be excluded from “gross income”—not because of anysection of the tax code, but because such income is, “under the Constitution,not taxable by the Federal government” (as the older regulations put it).The veteran IRS witness and the judge just demonstrated profound ignoranceconcerning the tax laws, yet these are the very people who expected me toaccept, without question, their assertions about what the law means. Thesepeople wouldn’t recognize the law if it hit them over the head—which it prettymuch did at this trial, and they didn’t notice.Thus ended the government’s case, and we took our lunch break.WHERE’S THE BEEF?So that was the government’s entire case against me. Notice anything missing,like proof of guilt, or even the slightest hint of guilt? Remember, for“willful” failure to file, they were required to prove “beyond a reasonabledoubt” that I believed my income to be taxable, and therefore that I believedthat I was required to file. What part of their case even hints at that? That Idislike the IRS? Well duh, I think the IRS is defrauding a hundred million of myneighbors. Am I supposed to sing their praises or something? Or is their “proof”that I had seen legally worthless form letters which—while dodging the questionsasked by thousands—disagreed with me? (And contrary to the lies of the IRS andDOJ, I did not “ignore” those letters; I posted them on my own web site andrefuted them point-by-point.) How does quoting what someone else said prove whatI believe? Obviously, it can’t possibly. So what did they quote from me? Eventhe few e-mails and letters they chose to show clearly demonstrate that Ibelieve I don’t owe the tax, and that I believe the IRS is taking money frommillions of Americans who don’t owe it. Their own exhibits demonstrate myinnocence quite clearly. So where was the proof—or even the suggestion—of“willfulness”? Well, I was repeatedly “told,” by clueless morons who hadrepeatedly confessed to their own ignorance of the law and inability to answerquestions, and by worthless form letters written by unidentified but equallyclueless bureaucrats, that my income was taxable. So how could I possiblybelieve otherwise? That was their entire case.MY TURNWhen the jury returned after lunch, Judge Baylson admitted that the very recentcourt ruling upholding the injunction against Thurston Bell was “not directlyrelevant on the issue of willfulness, whether Mr. Rose acted willfully.” Oddly,he then proceeded to bias the jury by reading the admittedly irrelevant ruling,which used the standard insults such as “frivolous” and “nonsensical” whiledodging the actual substance of the issue.After that, I called myself as the first witness for the defense. In order toavoid looking like a schizophrenic lunatic (“I’m badgering myself, yourhonor!”), I didn’t ask myself questions, but had my standby counsel question me,which Mr. Becraft had a lot more experience at anyway. There’s no need to givean overly detailed account of the defense case, since it was mainly just anabbreviated, less flippant version of the first half of this book.We started with the basics of my background and education, our medicaltranscription business, etc. I then explained that I started filing tax returnsaround 1988, not because I had ever seen the law, but because I had a job and“conventional wisdom” said that people who work need to file such returns. Forall the years up through 1996, I kept filing, though “I had never seen the law.”Then came the question, did I file for 1997, or since? The answer, of course,was “no.” Why not? That, of course, led into the story of how I started lookinginto the law, and what I found. But instead of telling the story all over againhere, I’ll just mention a few of the main points that came up at trial.We had previously paid “self-employment” taxes—a sort of add-on income tax—inaddition to the “normal” income tax. Nothing was withheld from what we werepaid, since we were subcontractors, so we were sending in checks to the IRS forthousands of dollars every few months.I researched various claims about the income tax, which alleged that it wasinvalid, “voluntary,” unconstitutional, etc., but found that those theories“didn’t hold water.” I researched such claims mainly using the internet, wherethe current statutes and regulations are available on the government’s own websites, and where many court cases can be found at www.findlaw.com.I explained that part of my motivation for looking into such issues was that wewere bringing in about $40,000 a year, with my wife and I both working fulltime, and then giving the IRS about $10,000 of that, “and I thought that wasridiculous.” (The parts in quotation marks here are direct quotes from mytestimony at trial.) So when I started looking into various claims about thetax, “back when I assumed I owed the tax,” I wanted to determine “the absoluteminimum cooperation that the law required of me—what are my minimal requirementsunder the law? ” I was not looking for a way to get out of obeying the law, butfor “the minimum amount I had to help [the IRS] under the law,” while stillassuming that I actually owed the tax. I had written “Abolish the IRS” on acheck to the IRS because “I thought the income tax was socially destructive anda bad idea, but I thought I owed it.” So while sending them money, the commentwas “a little way to object, without disobeying the law.”The first time I heard about 861 and was pointed in the direction of ThurstonBell’s “Gross Income” article, I didn’t really look into it seriously. “I hadlooked into so many others, and they didn’t hold water, that I figured, Well,here’s another one.” The second time someone told me to check it out, I dugdeeper. To begin with, I looked up the statutes and regulations quoted in thearticle, to see if those sections really said what the article claimed. And theydid.The next step, I explained, was more involved. “The tax code is renowned forbeing ridiculously lengthy and complicated, so the immediate question was, Whatis he [Thurston Bell] missing? What is he leaving out, or what does he not knowabout? ” I explained how, knowing almost nothing about federal law at the time,I had to learn what statutes and regulations are, what legal weight differentdocuments have, and so on. Then I got into my specific study of all things 861.“I would do internet searches, and then searches through the Code, to see, Whereis this section [861] mentioned? What’s it for? What’s it about? How does itapply? ” I mentioned doing a word search to find every mention of Section 861 inthe entire multi-thousand-page tax code, trying to “find anything I couldreferencing these sections, that might tell me what they mean, what they’reabout, how they apply.”I then talked about how, having used the internet to research the current taxstatutes and regulations, I wanted to find the older law books, because “the taxcode doesn’t just appear brand new every year; it’s the result of a very longevolution of a tax that started in 1913, and has had hundreds and hundreds ofamendments to it after that.” To put it another way, “If I know what the seedlooks like, I’d understand the tree better.” To demonstrate just how extensivelyI had researched the issue, we talked about specific law libraries I hadvisited, and what documents I found at each. For example, I discussed findingthe indexes of the United States Code, which for some reason are not availableon the internet (though the rest of the code is). I discussed how the indexesrepeatedly point to 861 regarding “gross income” from within the U.S., regarding“taxable income” from within the U.S., and regarding “sources of income” fromwithin the U.S.To give some indication of my understanding of the law, Mr. Becraft walked methrough explaining the whole arrangement of the law, including titles,subtitles, chapters, subchapters, parts, sections, subsections, etc., and whatwas found where. Then I talked about finding more and more evidence supportingthe 861 “argument,” which I had not seen anyone else cite before, including thecross-reference right under Section 61 which points the reader right to 861,regarding income from inside the U.S. (Others may very well have found thatbefore, but I had never seen it cited.) I explained why such findings weresignificant, because “if I’m finding evidence [that Thurston Bell] didn’t evenknow about that supports his conclusions, that’s interesting to me.”My first exhibit was a copy out of those old income tax regs, talking about someincome being excluded from taxation because of “fundamental law,” aka theConstitution. I explained that I checked and found such statements in every yearof regulations from 1939 up through 1956. For each exhibit, displayed oncomputer monitors throughout the courtroom, we’d zoom in on the pertinent part,I’d read it, and explain my understanding of what it meant. Remember, even withit sitting right in front of the jury, I wasn’t allowed to say what the law is;I could only talk about my understanding of the law. (Of note, Mr. Millerobjected to every single section of law or regulation that I wanted to show tothe jury, throughout the entire defense case.)Then I read right from the regulation, as it sat staring the jury in the face,where it says that some income is to be “excluded from gross income” becausesuch income is, “under the Constitution, not taxable by the Federal government.”We then put up this visual aid (only in color):[../Images/image27.jpg]I explained again that there are certain types of income which are specificallyexempted by the statutes of the tax code (” life insurance proceeds, gifts, mostinterest on municipal bonds,” etc.), and that “conventional wisdom says thateverything is taxable unless you can find a specific section saying it’s not.”(As you may recall, in his testimony 32-year veteran IRS agent Charles Judge hadalready parroted the incorrect conventional wisdom perfectly. In addition, I hadto bite my tongue to refrain from pointing out that the damn judge, and anotherveteran IRS agent, just that morning had demonstrated complete ignorance of thefact that some income is excluded because of the Constitution itself. As you mayrecall, they didn’t even understand the question. Had I pointed that out, thegovernment and the judge would no doubt have had a tantrum at me for daring tocall into question the judge’s qualifications to tell the jury what the law is.I was hoping the jury would notice it for themselves. Apparently they didn’t.)I then talked about going to Jenkins Law Library in downtown Philadelphia—theoldest law library in the country—to research even older law books than those Ihad seen up to that point. I testified about how the 1924 income taxregulations, for example, said that “gross income excludes the items of incomespecifically exempted by the statute, and also certain other kinds of income bystatute or fundamental law free from tax,” and that those regulations went on tosay that such exempt income “should not be included in the return of income” andneed not even be mentioned on a return. I then explained that “I don’t believeit’s up to me to just guess at what’s constitutionally exempt or not,” and that“the law has to specifically tell me what I have to do.” Then I pointed outwhere those old regulations defining “gross income” then say that “profitsderived from sales in foreign commerce must be included in gross income.”I won’t describe the rest of the defense case in such detail, but it’s importantto show how slowly and carefully we walked through the issue, supporting everystep with actual quotes from the law books, explaining every question I had andevery step in my reasoning. I wanted the jury to see that this was not a case ofsome doofus saying “Golly, cousin Bubba said my income ain’t taxable, so Ididn’t file no more.” On the contrary, I had done far more personal researchthan anyone could reasonably have been expected to do, in order to be absolutelysure about my conclusions.We went through a lot of other concepts, like the principle of “inclusio unius,”which dictates that what the law does not specifically mention, you shouldconclude was intended to be omitted. We looked at the case of Gould v. Gould, inwhich the Supreme Court said that one should not assume that tax laws apply to“matters not specifically pointed out,” and went on to say that, in case ofdoubt, tax laws “are construed most strongly against the government, and infavor of the citizen.”By this point Judge Baylson seemed to be getting a bit agitated. Apparently myposition was making too much sense, so he decided to argue with me about it. Hecomplained that the Gould case wasn’t about the question of domestic incomeversus foreign income. And it’s not. So what? It spells out a basic principle ofhow all tax laws are to be understood, and was obviously relevant to myunderstanding of the law, which was the entire focus of the trial.I explained how the principle expressed in Gould made it significant (in myopinion) that those older regulations said that income from international trademust be included as “gross income,” while income from purely domestic trade was“not mentioned in the regulation.” Judge Baylson interrupted me to ask, “Notmentioned in this regulation? ” He was obviously trying to imply that some othersection might mention it. But for him to try to argue with me while I wasexplaining my beliefs was both legally and logically inappropriate, since anyargument he might come up with at trial would be completely irrelevant to what Ibelieved when I decided not to file, which was the only issue in question.We then looked at the Supreme Court case of McCullough v. Virginia, 172 U.S. 102(1898), which says that every statute, however “broadly worded” it may be, “isto be read in the light of the Constitution,” and that no statute should “beinterpreted as extending beyond those matters which it was within theconstitutional power of the legislature to reach.” I next wanted to look atsomething from the Federalist Papers, written by James Madison (the “Father ofthe Constitution”), which said that under the Constitution, the federalgovernment was to get its revenue mainly by taxing foreign commerce. However,Judge Baylson, looking more and more antsy (I think my case was making too muchsense) refused to let me show that to the jury. After some argument, he said Icould testify about what my “beliefs” about it are, without showing the actualdocument, so I did.AMAZING IGNORANCEApparently desperate to interfere with my explanation of my beliefs, JudgeBaylson suddenly went into an impromptu monologue about the law. Setting asidehow improper that was ( his beliefs about the tax laws have no bearing on mysupposed “willfulness”), his comments demonstrated a level of ignorance thatstunned even me. I sat on the witness stand, right next to him, as he proclaimedthe following:“Well, I just want to say, if my history’s correct, is that the income tax wasnot authorized by the original Constitution. It was only authorized by thepassage of the amendment—and I don’t remember exactly what date it was, but Ijust want to explain one reason for my ruling [not letting me show the juryFederalist #45] is that there’s no provision in the original Constitution for anincome tax. Congress only enacted the income tax after the United StatesConstitution was amended.”Then he explained that all to the jury again, twice saying that the federalincome tax was only enacted “after the United States Constitution was amended.”He even added, “I’m embarrassed that I don’t remember my history enough,” butsaid he thought the amendment—and he couldn’t remember which amendment itwas—occurred “in the early part of the twentieth century” and that “before thatthere was no income tax in the United States.”As it happens, Judge Baylson was not nearly as embarrassed as he should havebeen, because what little he did remember, he got dead wrong. Let’s do a littleassertion-versus-evidence test. (We’ll give him a pass on not knowing that itwas the Sixteenth Amendment, and that it happened in 1913, which I and probably95 percent of the spectators at the trial could have told him.) So let’s pausefor a moment, to consider what I should “believe” about the law.1) Should I believe Judge Baylson’s unsupported assertion that Congress couldnot impose an income tax under the original Constitution, or should I believethe U.S. Supreme Court, which said that the income tax is authorized by thetaxing power “possessed by Congress from the beginning” ( Stanton v. BalticMining, 240 U.S. 103)?2) Should I believe Judge Baylson’s unsupported assertion that the SixteenthAmendment “authorized” federal income taxes, or should I believe the U.S.Supreme Court, which says that the Sixteenth Amendment “conferred no new powerof taxation” upon Congress ( Stanton v. Baltic Mining, 240 U.S. 103), that theamendment did not “extend the taxing power to any new or excepted subjects” (Peck v. Lowe, 247 U.S. 165), that the amendment did not “render[] anythingtaxable as income that was not so taxable before” ( Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S.245), and that the Sixteenth Amendment, in fact, was not intended to have anyeffect “on which incomes were subject to federal taxation” ( South Carolina v.Baker, 485 U.S. 505)?3) Should I believe Judge Baylson’s unsupported assertion that there was nofederal income tax prior to the advent of the Sixteenth Amendment, or should Ibelieve the copies I have of the federal income tax acts from the 1860s and1890s, starting over fifty years before the enactment of the SixteenthAmendment?What made this particularly frustrating is that, sitting five feet from theself-appointed sole declarer-of-the-law in that courtroom, I could have citedall of the above from memory. But by the rules of the kangaroo court, I wasn’tallowed to contradict his string of colossal blunders and misstatements.So tell me, am I really such a diabolical creep, a despicable scofflaw, becauseI would presume to disagree with the pronouncements of the “honorable” UnitedStates District Judge Michael Baylson—or any other clueless, self-aggrandizing,god-complex ignoramus in a black dress—and instead choose to believe what I seewith my own eyes? Perhaps now you can see why I get a little irate when thegovernment and the courts try to paint people as criminals for not blindlyaccepting the baseless assertions of so-called authorities who, like JudgeBaylson, clearly know jack squat about federal tax law.CONTINUING MISINFORMATIONThe judge then tried to justify his continuing attempts to interfere with myexplanation of my beliefs by saying that the McCullough case I had cited before,“and perhaps Gould v. Gould,” occurred prior to the enactment of the SixteenthAmendment, so I shouldn’t be allowed to rely on them. (This reasoning was basedon his false claim that the Sixteenth Amendment authorized income taxes.) First,the Gould case came several years after the Sixteenth Amendment (in 1917), andin fact was about the federal income tax. Second, the McCullough case was makinga statement about “elementary law,” and how “every statute” must be read. Third,who is he to say what I am “allowed” to base my opinion on? If it impacted mylegal conclusions—as it certainly did—how the heck can anyone decide that itwasn’t allowed to impact my beliefs?Next, I brought up the case of Peck v. Lowe, in which the Supreme Courtexplained that because Congress has the general taxing power as well as thespecific power to “regulate commerce with foreign nations,” it could therefore“undoubtedly” impose an income tax upon income which American businesses receivefrom engaging in international trade. Still determined to disrupt my case,however, Judge Baylson cut in and gave another monologue, which included hissaying that the Peck case “had nothing to do with income tax whatsoever, just sothe jury knows that.” Trying to remain calm, I asked if we could scroll up tothe beginning of the ruling, which makes it abundantly clear that the case wasentirely about the federal income tax of 1913. Having been made an ass of onceagain (albeit politely), Judge Baylson didn’t relent in his obstructionisttactics—nor was he willing to admit his obvious blunder—and instead continuedhis clueless lecture:“In the pre-trial hearings I said I was going to allow Mr. Rose to rely on casesor statutes or regulations, but they had to have some relevancy, and it couldn’tbe taken out of context. This is clearly taken out of context.”And based on that utterly bogus accusation, he then wouldn’t let me continue totalk about the Peck case. And of course, as is common among ignoramuses tryingto pass themselves off as “experts,” he failed to show any “context” that wouldchange what I had read, because there is no such “context.” (The ruling in thePeck case is fairly short, and I invite the reader to look it up for himself.)And again, who was he to tell me what I was allowed to have based my conclusionson, and what was allowed to have affected my beliefs?Next, I wanted to bring up another Supreme Court case, in which the courtexplained that Congress cannot control something not otherwise under itsjurisdiction simply by exerting such control via a so-called “tax.” As theSupreme Court put it, “To give such magic to the word ‘tax’ would be to breakdown all constitutional limitation of the powers of Congress and completely wipeout the sovereignty of the states” ( Bailey v. Drexel Furniture, 259 U.S. 20(1922)). But the jury never saw or heard those words, because Judge Baylsonrefused to let me talk about it or put it up on the courtroom monitors. Why?Because, he said, the issue involved in that case was “too remote.” No, it wastoo persuasive, and the “judge” could see that I was making too much sense, andhe wasn’t about to let the government lose a major tax case in his courtroom.(How exactly can a Supreme Court’s ruling concerning the limits on Congress’taxing power be “too remote” from the question of what Congress can tax?)After that suppression-fest, we took our mid-afternoon break.MAKING IT CURRENTUp to that point we had been looking at older income tax regulations, so then Imoved on to the current sections, to show that, while they are a lot morecomplicated and confusing than the older ones, they still show the same thing.We went over 26 CFR § 1.312-6, which still mentions the constitutional limit onCongress’ taxing power, and then went into Section 861 and its regulations. Wewalked through where the regulations say that the “items” of income listed inSection 61 are sometimes exempt, through to the list of non-exempt income foundin 1.861-8T(d)(2)(iii), which is all about international trade and possessionsincome.The explanation was fairly thorough, but since you’ve seen it all above, I won’trepeat it, except where something interesting happened at trial. For example,when explaining why I was looking at Section 861 at all, I mentioned thecross-reference under Section 61, and several entries in the indexes of the taxcode which point to 861 regarding “gross income” and “taxable income” fromsources within the United States. At that point Mr. Miller interrupted, saying,“There’s no evidence that there’s an index that refers to 861.” I’m not surewhether he was claiming that the index entries don’t exist, or whether he wasjust saying they hadn’t been admitted into evidence at the trial (which stillwouldn’t mean I wasn’t allowed to talk about them). Since it sounded as if hewas alleging that I was making those entries up, right after court let out forthe day, Mr. Becraft and I walked down the street to the Jenkins Law Library andmade fresh copies of the indexes referring to 861. (As a matter of fact, I evenfound a new reference to 861 that I hadn’t seen before.)But a few other things happened before court let out for the day. We talkedabout various regulations which tell me to use 861 and its regs to determine mytaxable domestic income, and we looked at the booklet for the 1040 form, and howit says that U.S. citizens must report income they receive from outside theUnited States, while saying nothing about their domestic income.THE REPORT AND THE WEB SITESI then testified about my “Taxable Income” report, including the first versionwhich came out in 1998, which was only a dozen or so pages long, up through thesixty-page version in 2000. I pointed out that I always made that reportavailable for free, and that it was distributed via web sites, e-mail, andsending out free hard copies to those who requested it. I mentioned again thatthe report doesn’t tell anyone what to do; it’s just an academic explanation ofmy conclusions. Then I mentioned how Dr. Clayton and I started our first website (www.taxableincome.net) in mid-2000. But things ended for the day before wegot into the details of that.Before the jury was dismissed for the day, Judge Baylson again told them,“Remember, please don’t read or hear or do anything about this case. You’veheard a lot about the web sites and the internet. Don’t look at the internetabout this case or any of these web sites.” Yeah, heaven forbid they be allowedto see what the defendant has actually been saying for the past eight years, ina case revolving entirely around the beliefs of the defendant.DAY FOURThe next morning, after hardly any sleep, I continued my testimony. First, webacked up a bit and emphasized that when the regulations say that some income isexempt because of the Constitution, that is not at all the same thing asclaiming that the tax is unconstitutional—which would not be a valid defense to“willfulness.” I explained that “it would make no sense for a regulation todeclare a statute unconstitutional. That isn’t how it works. And I want to beclear, this is not saying the tax is at all unconstitutional. This is theregulations explaining that the proper application of the law—a perfectly valid,constitutional law—is limited by the Constitution.”I then testified about how Mr. Becraft and I, the previous afternoon, had goneto the law library to get new copies of the indexes of the tax code, where theypoint to 861. I explained that “in several different places under differentheadings, the indexes were telling me to go to 861, unconditionally. They werenot saying, in the case of certain people—just: income from within, 861, overand over again.” When we asked to enter those indexes into evidence—the indexesthat Mr. Miller complained weren’t in evidence the day before—he objected (as hedid with literally every exhibit we wanted to introduce). But they were allowedin, and we went through them, showing the jury all the places where they pointto 861 regarding domestic income.WEB SITES AND VIDEOThen I testified some more about the web sites, www.taxableincome.net andwww.theft-by-deception.com, as well as the more recently formedwww.861evidence.com, the main purpose of the last site being “to post scans ofall these older documents that, as far as I knew, were not available onlineanywhere else.” We talked about the contents of all of the sites, including my“Taxable Income” report, transcripts of IRS meetings, and other articles anddocuments. And was all that stuff publicly available for free? “Absolutely. Nomembers area, no charge for anything, open to the public, the government, foreveryone to look at.”Then we talked some about the Theft by Deception video, how it was funded andproduced, and how it took a year and a half for me to make it. After manyarguments, in the end I was allowed to show just five minutes of excerpts fromthe 88-minute video, without any sound. Showing a few minutes of assortedexcerpts without any sound was certainly not going to educate the jury about theissue, but I wanted them to at least see the nature of the video, so they wouldhave some idea of the scope of the project.ABOUT RELIANCEPonder this: courts have ruled that in a “willful” tax trial, the defendant mustbe allowed to show the jury materials he relied upon in reaching his conclusionsabout his legal obligations. I, on the other hand, was not allowed to show themthe Theft by Deception video, because I did not “rely” on it—I only made thedamn thing. The end result is that I am the only one on earth who, under the“hearsay” rules (or the misapplication of those rules), would be prohibited fromshowing the video in my defense. Anyone else who could show that the videoaffected their beliefs could show it to the jury. Unless, of course, thegovernment came up with a new excuse for suppressing it.(As an aside, the video was not “hearsay” at all. The term “hearsay,” in commonspeech, refers to someone testifying about what he heard someone else say. Underthat definition, my video obviously wasn’t hearsay; it was “recordplay.” Butsetting aside logic—as one must do when in federal court—the video is not“hearsay” under the legal rules either. Under the rules, a statement can behearsay only if it is being used to prove the “truth of the matter asserted.”Without getting too bogged down in the technical differences, my video was notintroduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted in that video: that mostAmericans don’t owe the tax. We wanted it introduced only to demonstrate my“state of mind.” But no, Judge Baylson was determined to misapply the rules tokeep the jury from seeing it.)I testified a bit about what the video talks about, from the basics of federaltax law to the specifics about 861. Then I explained that “Step Six” of thevideo “is where I accuse some in the federal government of intentionallydeceiving the American public by rewording the sections over the years in such away to make the truth more difficult to discover. Thus the title of the video,‘Theft by Deception’.” I also pointed out that the video does not tell anyone todo anything. I then confessed to selling the video for a whole $20. I alsomentioned that I sent free copies of the video to many government officials,including the Commissioner of the IRS, the Secretary of the Treasury, theAttorney General, and well over one hundred individual IRS agents. “I sent themwith a cover letter saying, basically, I’d like you to look at this because Ibelieve you’re misapplying the law.”MANY QUESTIONS, NO ANSWERSI then explained how, having reached my conclusions about the proper applicationof the law, I didn’t want to “just stick my head in the sand” and hope I wasright. Instead, “I wanted to go out of my way to ask, Is there something thatthe government can show me in the law which might persuade me that myconclusions are incorrect? So I began sending letters to government officials,such as the ones I just listed, asking specific questions about how to determinetaxable income. One of the most basic was, Should I be looking at 861 and itsregulations to determine my taxable domestic income? And a few other questionsrelated to that. So these were not arguments or assertions, or constitutionaltheory.” Instead, the questions were, “according to the law itself, how do Idetermine what I owe? ”I described how I started sending such questions to congress folk, IRS agents,and other officials, starting around early 1998. Mostly my questions were justignored. “They didn’t even acknowledge that I had sent anything.” I explainedhow, when a few did finally respond, it was with form letters that didn’t evenmention 861 at all. (Instead, they did things such as argue that the tax isconstitutional, which I agree with.) “In other words, they were just looking forsome template letter to send back, and whoever sent it didn’t bother to see ifit actually had anything to do with what I had asked.”Then I explained how it had occurred to me that “maybe if they get a hundredletters instead of one, they might take it a little more seriously.” So the nextexhibit we wanted to show the jury was the list of six questions we had sent tovarious federal officials. Nope. No deal. Judge Baylson said they were“hearsay,” and though I was allowed to talk about them, I could not show them tothe jury. Incidentally, Judge Baylson didn’t even have “case law” on his sidethat time: both the Federal Rules of Evidence and a bunch of federal courtrulings show that only a statement can be “hearsay”; a question cannot.Nonetheless, I wasn’t allowed to show the jury the questions, but I did testifyabout them, one by one.I wanted to show the letter I had sent to Senator Santorum asking the questions,but I wasn’t allowed to. But I did point out that the Senator’s response to me,which the government used as an exhibit, nowhere mentioned 861 in any way, orsaid anything even remotely related to the questions I had actually asked.Next we brought up my letter to Pamela Olson, Assistant Secretary of theTreasury (Tax Policy) and “the top government official who actually has hands-ondealings with the regulations themselves.” Again, I wasn’t allowed to show thejury the letter, on the grounds that the letter was “hearsay” and“self-serving.” I started to explain how Ms. Olson had ignored the first volleyof over letters (from different people) asking those same questions about 861,but I was cut off, and wasn’t allowed to go on, because, in Mr. Miller’s words,I had “no basis for [my] personal knowledge as to what the other peoplereceived.” True, but I did have first-hand knowledge of what all thoseletter-senders had told me, which is that they received no responses of anykind. But I couldn’t get that out before Mr. Miller interrupted me, and I wasn’tallowed to talk about it anymore. (Because the case was about my beliefs, havingpeople tell me they received no responses, even if for some strange reason theywere all lying, would still be relevant.)Next I talked about my e-mail update list, where people could sign up (for free)to receive messages from me having to do with 861-related information. By around2000 or 2001, there were a couple thousand subscribers. I talked about how,using that list, we organized “Operation Honest Inquiry,” whereby hundreds of ussent letters to various government folk, asking just three basic questions abouthow to determine what we owe. The questions included (as I paraphrased them attrial), “Should I use 861 and its regulations? ” and “Do they show my income tobe taxable? ”Again, I was prohibited from talking about all the people who told me theyreceived no responses to their letters. I was allowed, however, to explain how abunch of the government’s exhibits were letters that other people had receivedin response to asking the questions (who then forwarded those letters to me). Welooked at one such letter, which I knew to be a “cut and paste” form letter,because I had received “many copies of this exact same letter from differentpeople who had been sent it from the IRS.” I then pointed out that, like most oftheir “responses,” the letter was “responding to something I didn’t ask, andrefuting a position I have never held.” I explained that it “struck me ascurious” (a bit of an understatement) that the government kept sending out formletters “that answer something we didn’t ask, and don’t say anything about whatwe actually asked.” After all, if those in government were going to “go to allthe trouble of making a form letter to send to all these people, it seems to meit would have been just as easy to make one that actually answered thequestions.” Actually, I knew full well why they were utterly incapable ofanswering the questions: because they would have to either directly contradictthe law, or reveal the truth.Then we looked at another non-responsive form letter, and I again pointed outthat it didn’t answer any of the questions we asked. (Remember, these were justthe letters the government chose to introduce.) Of all the responses I had seen,Mr. Becraft asked, did I “detect any that answered the questions that had beenposed? ” My answer: “No, I never saw one that directly answered the questions.”Instead, they all refuted things I never argued, and answered things I neverasked. For example, one of the form letters disagreed with the claim that “onlyforeign source income is taxable,” which at first glance might seem relevant,but as I pointed out, “I have never claimed that only foreign source income istaxable; 861 has to do with when income from within the U.S. is taxable; ifincome from within the U.S. was never taxable, there wouldn’t be an 861.”But what about the “case law” (court rulings) mentioned in the form letters?Well, the letter we were looking at mentioned four (non-binding) Tax Courtrulings, one of which never mentioned 861 at all, and one of which mentioned 861in a completely different context. Then, in talking about the two cases whichdid at least sort of address the 861 evidence, I made the heretical statementthat when it comes to people’s opinions, even those of judges, “I judge thevalidity of their opinions based upon the evidence they can show supportingtheir opinions, not on their credentials or on how many people say it, oranything like that.” Ain’t I a radical?Next I testified about what the Internal Revenue Manual says about how muchlegal weight different rulings and documents carry. At my meetings with the IRS,I had even given them copies of those sections, from their own manual, “so thatif they were to bring up something that their manual says isn’t legally binding,I could show them, You’re citing something that your own manual says doesn’tcarry legal weight, and here’s your manual showing that what I am quoting doescarry legal weight.” And was I allowed to show the jury those sections from theIRS’s own manual, explaining what they consider to be legally binding? Nope. Whynot? Because Judge Baylson said it “invades the province of the court.”Bullpoop, your honor. Translating his excuse into English, he was saying that Icouldn’t show it to the jury because it would constitute instructing the jury onwhat the law is, which only the court may do. There are a couple of reasons whythis made no sense:1) What the manual says is relevant to my beliefs about the law, whether thejudge agrees with what the manual says or not.2) When I later requested that the court give the jury an instruction about thedifferent legal weights of different rulings and documents, Judge Baylsonrefused to do so. Had the “honorable” judge told the jury what does and does notcarry legal weight, the jurors might have noticed that absolutely nothing thegovernment cited was binding on me, while everything I cited was binding on themand me. Since that would have botched up the government’s case pretty badly, the“judge” refused to tell them the truth, while at the same time prohibiting mefrom letting the IRS’s own manual tell them about it.MEETINGS REVISITEDI then testified about my dealings with the IRS, starting with the fact that Idid respond to all of the IRS “notices” asking where my tax return was. “As Ipointed out on cross-examination [of government witnesses] , the notice actuallysays, If you don’t believe you are required to file, let us know and explainwhy. So we did.” And was I allowed to show the jury my responses to thoseso-called “notices”? Nope. “Hearsay and self-serving.” So they could show theirstupid “notices,” but I wasn’t allowed to describe or document how I respondedto every one of them. So I guess when a bureaucrat “tells” you something, anyresponse you might have doesn’t matter; you are required to believe them andagree with them.I wanted to at least describe what I said in my letter to Agent Spaulding inpreparation for our first meeting. Nope. “You can’t reveal the contents of theletter,” proclaimed the judge. I could only talk about my “recollection” of themeeting. I managed to sneak in that, prior to the meeting with Spaulding, “Iwanted to first let her know my position, and then at the meeting I wanted tofind out the specifics that we disagreed on.” In other words, I didn’t just wantto know “whether our conclusions match”—which of course they wouldn’t; I wantedto know “the specifics of how [the IRS thought] I’m supposed to be complyingwith the law.” I explained how, at the meeting, I broke my position down intoseveral basic steps, showing them regulations (of which I gave them copies)supporting my position on each point, and asking them to agree or disagree withme on each point. (On cross-examination during the government’s case, the IRSwitnesses had already recalled all of this.)As an example, I wanted to show the jury one of the handouts I had given to theIRS at the meeting, quoting their own regulations “supporting the point that Ibelieve that I should use 861 and its regulations to determine my taxabledomestic income.” But I wasn’t allowed to show them that. “Hearsay.” Once again,the judge misapplied the hearsay rule to suppress relevant, admissible evidence.A sheet containing only citations from the government’s own regulations cannotpossibly constitute a “statement” by me, and therefore cannot be “hearsay.” ButJudge Former-Prosecutor Baylson was not about to let a little thing like therules get in the way of suppressing exculpatory evidence.After that we took a mid-morning break.Right after the break, we got a whole bunch of statutes and regulations intoevidence, which document the “evolution” (and the obfuscation) of 861 over theyears. In retrospect, the biggest blunder in the defense case was failing toslowly and carefully go through all of those documents, to illustrate the clearintention of the government lawyers who wrote the regulations to cover up thevery limited nature of the tax. I should have gone through all the suspiciouschanges to the wording and arrangement of the law books over the years. But Itry not to lament that lost opportunity too much, because looking back now, I’mconvinced that my boneheaded jurors wouldn’t have followed my explanationanyway. Apparently, “They told him he was wrong” was the most complex conceptthey could hold in their brains.I then talked a bit more about my “Taxable Income” report, copies of which I hadgiven to both Agent Spaulding and Agent Enz, in addition to dozens of othergovernment officials. And, of course, my comprehensive written report—the resultof many hundreds of hours of painstaking personal research—was not allowed to beshown to the jury. Yeah, that makes loads of sense: in a case entirely about mybeliefs concerning the law, the jury was not allowed to see the ultimateexplanation and documentation of my beliefs and the basis for them. Nifty.Going back to the topic of my meetings with the IRS, I told how, at the firstmeeting, Ms. Spaulding “admitted she wasn’t familiar with the regulations under861, and she openly admitted that she could not answer my specific questions.”Nonetheless, when I asked that the issue be sent to the IRS lawyers for aresponse (via “technical advice”), she refused to do so.I also explained how my second meeting with the IRS, occurring more than fivemonths after the first, was basically “a rerun of the first meeting.” At thatsecond meeting I again explained my position, and again gave them a bunch ofspecific, legally binding citations from their own regulations to support myconclusions.“And once again, they indicated that they would not or could not answer thespecific questions. Basically they said, ‘Well, 61: we think your income istaxable under 61.’ I showed them 61. I showed them the cross-reference under 61which says, ‘Income from sources within the United States, see section 861.’They still insisted that I should not look to 861. They never showed me acitation of any statute or regulation even remotely close to indicating I shouldnot. They simply asserted I shouldn’t be looking there, even though the onesection they were citing tells me to look there.”I explained that the second meeting wasn’t as long as the first, and opined thatI didn’t think the IRS agents “were having a whole lot of fun” at the meeting.That comment brought chuckles from the spectators, and an objection from Mr.Miller. So I rephrased it as “They were not eager to discuss the matter.” Talkabout an understatement.I pointed out again that at both meetings they said they couldn’t answer myquestions and would do more “research.” (Apparently the five months betweenmeetings wasn’t enough time for them to research one section of law.) I alsopointed out that they kept changing their minds about who should use 861. “Theydidn’t seem clear on who was supposed to look there; they just didn’t want melooking there.” I also recounted Charles Judge (Spaulding’s supervisor) saying“we must be missing something somewhere here under 861,” after I read him quotesdirectly from the regulations saying I should be using those sections. To againdemonstrate that I really am familiar with IRS regulations, I recited thefollowing section from memory, on the stand:“The taxpayer’s taxable income from sources within or without the United Stateswill be determined under the rules of section 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T, fordetermining taxable income from sources within the United States.” (26 CFR §1.863-1(c))I also explained that when I asked that the meeting be rescheduled so the IRSpaper-pushers would have time to do their “research,” they refused.I then testified about my supposed-to-be-off-the-record meeting with CharlesJudge at the restaurant. “I sent him a letter and said, This is off the record.I’m not going to tell people we met. I’m not going to tell them what you said. Ijust want to get your perspective, you know, when you’re not on tape and beingan IRS agent. Because if you say ‘Hey, you might be right’ when you’re an IRSagent—you’re not an IRS agent anymore.” This again brought chuckles from thegallery, many of whom were familiar with the story of Joseph Banister, a formerIRS Special Agent—like Donald Pearlman, though very un like him, too—who was“asked” to resign after he had the gall to suggest that his superiors shouldanswer a few questions being raised by people who were being mislabeled as “taxprotestors.”I also testified about how, at the restaurant, Mr. Judge said he wasn’tconvinced, but having watched most of my video, found the issue “intriguing.”(Of course, at the time he knew the meeting was being recorded, but I didn’t.) Ialso mentioned some other things we talked about, including “people who hadpublicly come out and agreed with me about my conclusions, including former IRSagents and a former federal prosecutor.” At the restaurant we also discussed howI had given a few public talks about the tax issue, and how I had been onvarious radio shows discussing it.I then wanted to talk about the IRS’s raid on my home. The judge wouldn’t let mesay much about it, but I did manage to get in that when they banged on my frontdoor, yelling “Federal agents, open the door! ,” I was surprised, “because I hadhad no contact about the case since the meeting where they said, ‘We’ll get backto you’. ”After quickly covering a few other things—including my mock audit with a friendof mine, where I played the part of an IRS paper-pusher—I started to talk aboutmy “Please Prosecute Me” flier, which had run in several newspapers. But I wasinterrupted, and then prohibited from showing the flier to the jury, andprohibited from explaining what it said. I was also prohibited from showing thejury other letters I had sent to DOJ officials, including the U.S. AttorneyGeneral, explaining my position and inviting them to prosecute me. I did get ina little bit about why I would do such a thing:“In short, I believed a fraud was being committed, the largest financial fraudin history, and I believed it was being committed by some individuals inside ourgovernment. And the normal channels, the administrative procedure, to me, wasnot getting justice. It was not getting a rational discussion, and I basicallyconcluded that this issue had to be brought to the American people. If the IRSwasn’t going to talk about it, if they weren’t going to answer the questions, Ibelieved it had to be publicized. Because if there are a hundred million victimsof a fraud, I believe it’s my duty to tell the victims of that fraud, and toinvite the government to prosecute me—to have twelve randomly selected Americansdecide—”At that point I was cut off and wasn’t allowed to finish the thought. The onlysignificant question that Mr. Becraft asked me after that was whether I hadintentionally violated the law, which of course I had not, and I said so. Thusended my direct testimony.GOOD FAITHBefore we get to the government’s cross-examination, let’s pause for a moment toconsider the effects of how the “hearsay” rules were applied in this case. Inany tax case involving “willfulness” (including this one), applying the rulesthe way Judge Baylson did effectively makes it impossible to demonstrate “goodfaith”—to show that the defendant did what he believed was legal andproper—because any prior statement of the accused, be it stated or written, canbe kept out of the trial. For an alleged crime that hinges entirely upon mybeliefs, nothing could make a trial more of a joke than prohibiting me fromshowing any of the piles and piles of evidence showing me expressing andexplaining my beliefs to just about every government official, bureaucrat, orjanitor I could think of. Again, there are rational reasons for keeping genuine“hearsay” out of court, but the way the rules were applied in my case wasutterly insane. No one was disputing that I wrote the letters that I wanted toshow, or that I made and narrated the Theft by Deception video I wanted to playfor the jury, or that the recordings of the IRS meetings were genuine, or that Iauthored the “Taxable Income” report, the web sites, etc. So how on earth couldsuch things be in any way unreliable? They couldn’t. They are as reliable andverifiable as evidence can possibly get, with no one questioning theirauthenticity. But they would be rather inconvenient for the government, sinceall those exhibits clearly proved me innocent. So they were suppressed.So, to summarize, I was supposed to prove that I believed I was not required tofile, but I was supposed to do so without showing the jury anything I had eversaid or written before trial. How on earth can one show one’s state of mindwithout using any prior statements? The very idea is insane. In short, despitemy complete openness and honesty about what I was doing and why, there wasabsolutely nothing I could have done to establish that I was acting in “goodfaith,” because none of what I did to make my beliefs known to the government,none of my years of effort to get rational discussion out of anyone in thegovernment, or to get answers to reasonable questions, or even to get thegovernment to state the specifics of its own position—none of it was admissibleat trial. If ever there was a “mock trial,” where the system merely pretendedthat the goal was to have an informed jury decide the truth, this was it.The icing on this absurd “hearsay” cake was that the prosecution was allowed touse any prior statement of mine that it wished; the government was free torummage through 10,000 e-mails, picking out whichever one here and there theythought they could spin into something incriminating (and even the ones theypicked proved me to be innocent). And I was allowed to show exactly none of theother 10,000 in my defense. So much for telling the whole truth. The term“double standard” just doesn’t fully express the absurdity of it.INQUISITION TIMEHaving finished my direct testimony, I was then cross-examined by Floyd Miller.After mentioning the cases I had talked about while explaining my beliefs, Mr.Miller said he wanted to talk about a few cases touching on 861, “becausethey’re much more recent than these old cases that you’ve talked about.”What Mr. Honesty did not mention, for obvious reasons, is that every case Ireferenced was from the Supreme Court—whose rulings are binding forever, unlessand until a subsequent Supreme Court ruling amends or overturns them. On theother hand, every case Miller wanted to talk about was a lower-court ruling, andeven the IRS agrees that such rulings are not legally binding. Mr. Miller’slittle dig about his cases being “much more recent” was obviously supposed tomake the jury think that his cases were more legally relevant, when the exactopposite was true, and he knew it. (Keep in mind, I asked Judge Baylson toexplain to the jury the legal authority of different levels of court rulings anddifferent documents, and he refused to do so.)Mr. Miller then asked me whether one judge had called the 861 issue“nonsensical.” I said that one had. (If, at this point, anyone reading thisthinks that the entire issue can be dismissed out of hand by calling it“nonsensical,” please close this book and give it to someone capable ofthought.) Apparently, federal prosecutors aren’t accustomed to people stickingup for their beliefs and principles, because Mr. Miller then asked, in his mostaccusatory tone, “You’ve described the IRS as the largest extortion racket inhistory, isn’t that right? ” In response, I leaned in close to the microphone sono one could misunderstand what I said, and with my best enunciation, firmlypronounced, “Absolutely.” I was a little surprised myself at how loudly thesound boomed out of the speakers and through the room, which brought loud cheersfrom the audience (which the transcript characterized as “yelling”), promptingJudge Baylson to say, “Any more outbursts, I’m going to clear the courtroom! ”(More than one person later commented that whatever the outcome of the trial,there was something very refreshing about hearing that accusation made, withouthesitation or apology, in a United States federal courtroom.)Much of what Mr. Miller did under the guise of cross-examination was to readexcerpts from various e-mails I had written and ask me if I had said thosethings. Had such statements contradicted my prior testimony, this would haveconstituted valid cross-examination. But since they did no such thing, they werereally a sneaky way to bring up things that shouldn’t have been allowed in atall. For example, from one private e-mail he quoted me saying that “I don’tactually like the Constitution” because although it was “infinitely better thanany other attempt to form a government,” it still “gave way too much power topoliticians.” In that same e-mail, I went on to say, “To put it bluntly, I’m ananarchist.” I later said that “politician scribbles, a.k.a. laws, ” cannot“obligate me to disregard my own judgment,” and that “what the law says has nobearing on what I think is right and wrong.”Wait, aren’t those statements about political philosophy? Yep. What does thathave to do with the issue in this case? Nothing. (None of those statement weremade in the context of discussing tax law.) Didn’t both the judge and thegovernment say that political philosophy was not to be brought up? Yep. So, didthe judge then do anything to stop it? Nope.(I’m tempted to briefly elaborate on what my political beliefs are, as opposedto what Mr. Miller wanted the jury to think they are. But since they aren’t atall relevant, I’ll just quickly point out that the term “anarchist” oftencarries a connotation of some violent, bomb-chucking punk—which is exactly whyMr. Miller wanted the jury to hear that word—even though that’s not at all whatthe term literally means, nor is that at all what I believe in. A lesscontroversial term for what I advocate is “voluntaryism”: a society in whichpeople do not use the excuse of “government” to initiate force against otherpeople. Or, as that other radical extremist Thomas Jefferson put it: “Rightfulliberty is unobstructed action according to our own will, within the boundariesdrawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not say within the limits ofthe law, because law is often but the tyrant’s will, and always so when itviolates the rights of the individual.” And that’s the foundation of my nasty,extremist “anarchist” philosophy: leave people alone, and let them do what theywant, as long as they aren’t hurting anyone else. Ain’t I just the scum of theearth?)In another old e-mail which Mr. Miller brought up, I said I was convinced thatthe feds couldn’t come after me criminally for not filing because of the hugepaper trail thoroughly documenting my beliefs and the reasons for my actions.Well, the joke was on me. I obviously greatly underestimated both thegovernment’s ability to suppress all relevant evidence (i.e., the entire “papertrail”), and the ability of jurors to be colossal numbskulls.Next, Mr. Miller used the guilt-by-association routine by bringing up a letter Ionce sent to the Militia of Montana. As with most of his “cross-examination,”his method here was to take bits and pieces of comments out of context, and thenquickly move on, to string together a series of misleading snippets—carefullychosen from the thousands of e-mails they had—in order to paint a completelyinaccurate picture of who I am and what I believe. And that’s what he did withmy letter to the M.O.M. (Hi, M.O.M.)My letter to the M.O.M was in response to an article I saw in a publication oftheirs, which alleged that the income tax is unconstitutional. I wrote to themexplaining that the tax is constitutional, though it is widely misunderstood andmisapplied, and explaining that I thought there was a way to “throw the federalgovernment back into the constitutional role intended by the Founders,” and todo so without the help of Congress, without the support of the general populace,“and without bloodshed.” Instead of asking me a question, Mr. Miller thanopined, “That sounds like a coup to me.”I responded: “Without bloodshed.”Miller: “Without bloodshed.”Me: “It sounds like a coup?”Miller: “A coup; an overthrow of government.”Me again, quoting from the e-mail: “Without bloodshed?”Miller: “Yeah, without—well, there are bloodless coups. What—what—”Me: “What I mean by that is when a government is acting outside of the law, anda populace refuses to comply with unlawful demands of the government, thoseunlawful demands become unenforceable. And thereby, without bloodshed andwithout violence, the people have the power to correct the wrongdoing of thegovernment.”How the heck does one “overthrow” a superpower without bloodshed? (It would beentertaining to watch someone try.) And a “coup” means taking over thegovernment. How would anyone sane interpret my statements to be advocating that?I’m still not sure if Mr. Miller is stupid enough to believe what he was saying,or was intentionally lying in order to vilify me in the eyes of the jury. Hethen asked how what I described could be done without the support of the generalpublic. My answer: “Even a relatively small percentage of the victims of thisfraud resisting it would make it unenforceable—would make it impossible for thegovernment to continue defrauding Americans who don’t owe this tax.”Reverting to his guilt-by-association ploy, Mr. Miller then asked whether Iwatched the national news, and didn’t I know the Militia of Montana had beenlinked to violence? Only later did I have a chance to look it up, and found thatsuch allegations against the M.O.M. came out after I sent the letter. Butwhether or not Mr. Miller knew that, consider his slimy spin technique: I mustbe nasty and evil because I wrote a letter to an organization which was (later)accused of advocating violence. Well, what did my letter to them say? Itdisagreed with their article saying the tax was unconstitutional, and then urgeda nonviolent means of combatting government wrongdoing. Yet Miller was trying touse my letter to make the jury think I was a terrorist or something.Next, Mr. Miller read from an e-mail I wrote to Dr. Tom Clayton, in which I said“I wanted the whole puzzle ripped apart, ground into dust,” and “flushed downthe toilet.” Then, disguising another lie as a question, Mr. Miller asked, “Whatwere you talking about? The Internal Revenue Code? ” No, I answered, “I wastalking about the IRS misapplying the law.” Then this followed:Miller: “But this is your statement.”Me: “Yes, it is. You asked me what I referred to, and then you suggested ananswer. I would like to tell you what I was referring to, if I may.”Miller: “No, that—thank you, sir, you’ve answered my question. It’s yourstatement.”Me: “May I answer?”Miller: “Let’s go to...”This happened over and over again, where he’d take a little piece out ofcontext, mischaracterize it, not let me put the context back in, interrupt myanswer and cut me off, and move on to something else. Fortunately, Mr. Becraftdid a good job of keeping track of where I had been cut off, so on “redirect” hecould give me a chance to fill in the parts that Miller didn’t want the jury tohear. Here is yet another example, from another e-mail I wrote:Miller: “Mr. Rose, when you say, ‘This war has to be waged using fairly nastytechniques and propaganda. Basically, we have to use terrorist techniques.”Me: “And then I go on to say, ‘not with bombs and physical violence.’ May I—”Miller: “Well, what does that have to do with a good faith misunderstanding ofthe law, or a belief that you don’t have a duty to file federal income taxreturns?”Me: “I believe that the federal government is misrepresenting and misapplyingthe law, and I have sat through meetings with other individuals where the IRSagent would not look at the law, would not answer questions, would say, If youdo not file this return, we will take your house. And when he was shown the law,he did not respond. That tells me that unless they have something personal tolose, such as with filing a complaint—which showed up in one of the othere-mails the government raised—filing complaints against them, publicizing theirfailure to answer the questions, their threats, their thuggery, their failure tofollow procedures—”At that point Mr. Miller cut me off again, saying “Thank you for your answer,sir,” which brought chuckles from many in the audience, who could see rightthrough his dishonest tactics. (Apparently the jury could not.) Remember, thesewere from private e-mails, sent to people who knew me, and would know what Imeant. (Imagine what someone could put together out of a few thousand of yourprivate e-mails, if they wanted to make someone not like you.) Mr. Miller knewfull well that in “post-9/11” America, having the word “terrorist” show up, evenwith the qualifier of nonviolent, would make the average citizen wet his pants.They wouldn’t stop to wonder how tactics could be both “terroristic” and“nonviolent,” nor would they care. The “T” word showed up, so I was evil. A finesummary of what I mean by nonviolent terrorism, putting pressure on individualgovernment paper-pushers, making it so they personally have something to lose,is summed up well by none other than the Supreme Court, which explained that theFirst Amendment is important because of “its diffusion of liberal sentiments onthe administration of Government, its ready communication of thoughts betweensubjects, and its consequential promotion of union among them whereby oppressiveofficers are shamed or intimidated into more honourable and just modes ofconducting affairs” ( Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697 (1931)).Later Mr. Miller read from an e-mail in which I said that “While I hope thiswill be a bloodless war, it must be fought as a war,” not by petitioning thosein power to grant justice, but by having people openly refusing “to comply withthe fraud.” (For fun, look up what the Declaration of Independence says aboutpetitions to government asking for justice being met with further insult andinjury.) Mr. Miller asked me what I meant by “war,” and the following exchangeoccurred:Me: “Notice the word ‘bloodless’ war. I mean, when a government does not obeyits own laws, and the multiple levels of both procedural and judicial levels ofappeal will not obey the law, or will not do the right thing, will not tell thetruth, then as I said before, it is the responsibility of the people—”Miller (interrupting): “Thank you.”Me: “—the citizenry of the country—”Miller (interrupting again): “Thank you for your answer.”Me: “—to put the government back inside the law.”Miller (still interrupting): “Thank you for your answer.”Perhaps the best way to illustrate Mr. Miller’s method is to look at a fewemails one by one, seeing what Miller brought up, and then seeing what he leftout. Unfortunately, this is not how the jury heard it. They heard all of Mr.Miller’s distortions first, and probably forgot the specifics by the time Icould correct any of it on “redirect” testimony. Here are a few examples:1) As mentioned before, Mr. Miller read where I said “I’m an anarchist,” butdidn’t read the next sentence: “And no, that doesn’t mean I blow things up orthink that whatever I can get away with is good.”2) He also didn’t want me explaining that the “puzzle” I wanted ripped apart wasthe deception, not the tax. As I explained on the stand, “I have no objectionwhatsoever with what the law itself actually says. My objection is with what Ibelieve is the manipulation of the wording of the laws in such a way as todeceive the American public about what their legal obligations are. I wanted totake that deception—not the law; the deception—tear it apart, and expose it forall of the American public to see.”3) Mr. Miller wanted me to say that good budgeting and “not being robbed” by theIRS was why my wife and I were able to pay off our mortgage early. What hedidn’t want me saying, and what Agent Pearlman left out of his notes, was thatthe main thing allowing us to do that were gifts from Tessa’s father, which theIRS admits weren’t taxable. (Obviously Mr. Miller wanted the jury to be enviousof us for not paying our “fair share,” as if that proves whether or not webelieve we owe the tax.)4) Using Pearlman’s inaccurate notes again, Mr. Miller tried to make it sound asif I wouldn’t care what any judge or jury said. Only later could I explain whatI actually believe:“The way [Pearlman] worded it makes it sound like I don’t care what anybody elsehas to say. And I’m sure what I said to him is what I always say: whoever it is,whatever their credentials, if they can show me evidence in the law, then I willtake that into account. If they cannot, if they can only show me assertionswhich the law contradicts, then I will not accept their word for it. It is not amatter of I don’t listen to anybody else. It is I listen to people withevidence.”5) Another thing from Pearlman’s notes which Mr. Miller didn’t bring up at trialwas where Pearlman acknowledged that I said that I wanted the IRS out ofbusiness, not to stop them from administering the law, but to stop them frommisapplying the law.6) Mr. Miller wanted me to agree that I had said I “would be willing to admitthat [I was] wrong about [my] position when hell freezes over.” But that’s notwhat I said. My statement was in response to Stormtrooper Pearlman suggestingthat I’d be in less trouble if I chose to plead guilty (to the crimes I hadn’tcommitted), and that is what I said would happen when hell freezes over.7) Mr. Miller also wanted to make something of the fact that we also stoppedpaying state income taxes at the same time (for very similar reasons: thePennsylvania income tax pretty much copies the federal fraud, taxingnonresidents on their Pennsylvania income). He wanted the jury to think we wererefusing to pay any taxes. That’s why Mr. Miller didn’t want me to talk abouthow we continued to collect and pay state sales taxes for our medicaltranscription business. As I explained on redirect, we sent letters asking thePennsylvania Department of Revenue questions about the law requiring us tocollect sales tax for the state. In response, they did show us the law requiringthat, and as a result, we collected and paid it ever since. See what happenswhen someone can show us the law requiring us to do something, instead of justflinging assertions around?In another e-mail, I talked about practicing what I would say to the jury were Ito be put on trial. Mr. Spindoctor Miller read this and then asked me, “Aren’tyou really saying, sir, that what you intended to do was hoodwink the jury? ” Ianswered Mr. Slimeball’s false accusation with “No, not at all. May I explainwhat I was saying? ” Mr. Slimeball followed it up with “Well, what do you meanwhen you rehearsed the practice speech? ” However, the judge then interruptedand wouldn’t let me answer, allowing Mr. Miller’s utterly fabricated accusationto remain unchallenged. Of course, every lawyer and defendant plans what he willsay at any trial. Did they think that if I was innocent, I would have presentedmy entire defense ad lib or off the cuff? But Mr. Miller—who no doubt practicedwhat he would say in court—wanted my practicing to mean that I must have beenplanning to lie to the jury. How on earth does that logically follow? Itdoesn’t, of course, but Mr. Slimeball wanted to get the idea in the jury’sheads, whether there was any reason to believe it or not.BURN THE WITCH!Keep in mind here, the only relevant issue at trial was whether I believed myincome to be taxable. That’s all. Anything else, whether it be about myphilosophical beliefs, my attitude, my actions, etc., was irrelevant to thealleged crime. But the prosecutors were so determined to vilify me that theydidn’t even notice when their own exhibits proved me not guilty. For example,Mr. Miller read this from another private e-mail I had written:“Most of the country knows that the IRS lies, cheats and steals, but only asmall minority knows to what extent this is true. Even those still laboringunder the misapprehension that the income of most Americans is taxable know thatthe IRS is often unreasonable, unfair, vindictive, sadistic and terroristic, butthey continue to file and pay, thinking that they owe the tax, and hope the IRSdoesn’t pick them to be their next punching bag.”Now, does that demonstrate that I believe I owe the tax, or that I believe Idon’t owe the tax? The latter, obviously. So why did Mr. Miller choose thise-mail as an exhibit? Because his agenda was not to prove guilt, which he knewhe couldn’t do; his agenda was to make the jury disapprove of me, which heapparently accomplished.As another example, he also read from another e-mail in which I said that “thefederal income tax, while entirely Constitutional and valid, does not apply tothe income of most Americans.” Again, these were the e-mails the governmentchose to show. Why quote something that proves that I’m not guilty of any“willful” tax crime? It was so Miller could then ask if any government official“has ever agreed with [my] position.” Wait a second; by acknowledging that it’smy “position” (i.e., belief) that most Americans, including my wife and I, don’towe the tax, he just acknowledged that I committed no crime.Incidentally, without hesitation I answered that yes, a government official didagree with me: the Secretary of the Treasury. The Code of Federal Regulations,the official Executive Branch interpretation of the law, including the incometax regulations published under the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury,agree with me. Miller, obviously caught off guard by that answer, then said,“Well, let’s see if I can be more specific,” and then proceeded to ask aboutcertain lower court judges, whose rulings (unlike the regulations) are notbinding on me. So by his goofy logic, I was evil because I only had the supportof the official Executive Branch interpretation of the law, instead of theapproval of low-level ignoramuses whose rulings mean exactly jack squat.(If you think I’m horrible for calling federal judges “ignoramuses,” I’d like toremind you that at this very trial, when Judge Baylson—doing his best tointerfere with my explanation of my legal conclusions—decided to share hisopinions about federal tax law with the jury, he spewed forth an impressiveseries of indisputable blunders. To wit, he was wrong when he said that theoriginal Constitution did not authorize an income tax; he was wrong when he saidthat the Sixteenth Amendment gave Congress a new taxing power; he was wrong whenhe said that there was no federal income tax prior to the Sixteenth Amendment;he was wrong when he said that the Peck case was not about the income tax, andhe lied when he said that what I had quoted from Peck was taken out of context.So please don’t think me despicable for daring to doubt the unsupported—andunsupportable—decrees of “judges.”)Again, the U.S. Supreme Court says that if someone believes his actions arelegal, no “willful” crime has been committed, “no matter how unreasonable acourt might deem such a belief.” So where was there evidence showing that Idon’t believe what I’m saying? They had none, because there is none. They didn’teven bother trying to prove that essential element of the alleged crime, becausethey knew they couldn’t. Instead, they focused their rhetoric on asserting thatI shouldn’t have believed what I believed. But what I “should” have believed isabsolutely irrelevant to the crime charged. Apparently the jury was too dense tograsp the distinction.So Mr. Miller kept harping on the fact that some people (including lower courtjudges) had “told” me that I was wrong, and I kept committing heresy by sayingthings such as “I have the proof in the law that their conclusions wereabsolutely incorrect.” So he pointed out that I wasn’t a lawyer, and that Idon’t even have a bachelor’s degree (” I mean no disrespect,” he addeduntruthfully).How dare I think that I know something that politicians and judges don’t know?Mr. Miller and Mr. Baylson are lawyers (and I do mean that with disrespect), andthey had already repeatedly shown themselves to be utterly clueless about taxlaw. But they didn’t want to talk about evidence, since they had none on theirside; they wanted to talk about credentials.THE WORLD WILL END!Out of nowhere, Mr. Miller brought up another irrelevant point, asking whether,if my “position” was correct, and if a hundred million Americans stopped filingreturns, wouldn’t the United States, as we know it today, “cease to exist? ”Frankly, I’m not very fond of the United States government as we know it today,but I simply pointed out that the fact that the President had recently beentalking about scrapping the tax code entirely “is a pretty good indication thatthe world would not come to an end” if people agreed with me. But again, whatwas the relevance? What did Miller’s fear-mongering have to do with whether Ibelieve my income is taxable? Not a thing. (Notice that once again heaccidentally admitted I was innocent, by talking about my “position” being thatmost of us don’t owe the tax.) Mr. Miller’s implied message to the jury was “Ifyou let him go, the world will come to an end!” Lacking any evidence of guilt,the prosecution kept resorting to that kind of irrelevant emotionalism. And itseems to have worked.Mr. Miller also read from an e-mail in which I cautioned against wishfulthinking, noting that when someone acquires a “psychological investment” in acertain theory, he is often then unable to analyze it “objectively andrationally.” So Mr. Miller accused me of doing just that. (Incidentally, he’ssupposed to ask questions of a witness, not give his own opinions or flingbaseless accusations around.) I began explaining how my reasoning methods led meto dismiss as flawed numerous theories that sounded nice, before I ever heard of861, which the e-mail he was reading from even talked about, but he interruptedand cut me off again. (What a lovely attitude for a “public servant” prosecutorto have: “I get to throw false accusations at you, but you don’t get to defendyourself.”)Next, he vilified me for having asked the government questions back in 1998having to do with the Fifth Amendment as it relates to the requirement to fileincome tax returns. As I pointed out, that had nothing to do with why I wasn’tfiling, but Mr. Miller tried to spin asking the government questions as evidenceof villainy. (While this has nothing to do with the 861 evidence, brieflyconsider this: How can someone be required to provide lots of info on a taxreturn, which can be used as evidence against him in a criminal trial, when theFifth Amendment specifically prohibits the government from forcing people totestify against themselves? Don’t ask the government that. If you do, they’llcite it as proof that you’re a criminal.)After that, Miller brought up my testimony at another trial (that of RichardSimkanin), where I said that the government, by misrepresenting and misapplyingthe tax code, was committing the largest financial fraud in history. Mr. Millereven read aloud the exchange that occurred at that other trial, which went likethis:Prosecutor: “[Y]ou believe that there is a deliberate perpetration of a fraud inconnection with the tax laws. Isn’t that correct, sir?”Me: “I believe that many of the changes over the years in the tax laws, in thearrangement and the wording and the changing of the wording, does indicate to methat somebody—whichever individual is responsible for making those changes inthe wording, were intentionally doing it in such a way to make it more difficultto find the limited nature of the tax, yes.”Prosecutor: “And, Mr. Rose, have you ever made the statement that there has beenperpetrated a fraud of such magnitude that it is without rival in history?”Me: “Absolutely.”Prosecutor: “Are those your words?”Me: “Yes.”Prosecutor: “In connection with the income tax system?”Me: “Yes.”Prosecutor: “All right. Is this also your statement? That the truth is that someindividuals inside the United States government orchestrated and successfullyexecuted the most massive fraud and extortion racket in the history of mankind.”Me: “Absolutely.”Prosecutor: “Those are your words, right?”Me: “Those are my words.”Prosecutor: “So would you tell us the names of the individuals in the governmentwho are responsible for this massive fraud and extortion?”Me: “The IRS is currently illegally in default of a Freedom Of Information Actrequest that would get the names of the people who made those changes, and havebeen for nine months.”Prosecutor: “So these are unidentified individuals.”Me: “They are unidentified because the IRS does not obey the law and comply withthe Freedom Of Information Act. We know the Treasury decisions, and they willnot supply those to us.”(Mr. Simkanin, after having his first trial end in a hung jury, with the voteending at 11-to-1 to acquit, was then coerced into a plea bargain which laterfell apart. In January of 2004 he was again tried, and was finally convicted offailure to withhold from his employees and failure to file tax returns. Thisoccurred only with a lot of help from an absolute sleazeball lunatic “judge,”John McBryde, who makes Judge Baylson look like Lady Justice herself. Mr.Simkanin was then sentenced to 84 months (seven years) in prison—about doublethe sentence normally given for the supposed “crimes” he was wrongfullyconvicted of.)I’m not sure why Mr. Miller wanted to go through the above testimony again, buthe did. Then Mr. Inquisitor, in his most condescending, obnoxious, smarmy toneof voice, asked, “And as you sit here today, sir, is it still your position thatthe truth is that some individuals—and we don’t know who they are—inside theUnited States government, they orchestrated and they have successfullyexecuted—without anybody else finding out about it but you—the most massivefraud and extortion racket in the history of mankind. Is that your position? ”I responded, “If you think I’m the only one who has found out about this, youmight want to turn around.” I was, of course, referring to the ninety-plusspectators packing the courtroom, just about all of whom knew the truth. In casethere was any doubt, I added, “Yes, it is still my position that this was anintentionally orchestrated fraud, and we still have not received the documentsrequested through our Freedom Of Information Act request.” Mr. Miller, as usual,interrupted before I finished the sentence.The sliminess of these people knows no bounds. First of all, I had alreadytestified that I am not the one who originally found the 861 evidence. Second,Slimeball Miller knows damn well that a lot of people know about it, including alot of people with impressive credentials, and he was the one who prevented thejury from hearing about that because he wanted the jury to think that I was theonly one who believed this. Third, for him to talk about the impossibility ofsuch a fraud happening “without anybody else finding out about it,” when he hadbeen directly involved in the government’s effort to forcibly silence the issue,earns him a place in the Slimy Prosecutor Hall of Fame.HEARSAY OR HERESY?Rather than trying to prove that I believe I owe the tax (which they knew theycouldn’t), the prosecutors emphasized the messages “How dare you allege such athing?” and “Who are you to judge what’s true when you have no credentials?” Inshort, I wasn’t put on trial for breaking the law; I was put on trial forheresy: saying something the “authorities” consider blasphemous. After harpingon how people had “told” me I was wrong, Mr. Miller followed up by asking (withfeigned incredulity) how I could still believe what I was saying, after someonetold me I was wrong?Miller: “As you sit here today and testify, it’s your position that you have agood faith belief that your income is not taxable, despite what a court toldyou?”Me: “I can quote the law from memory demonstrating that that judge’s ruling wasincorrect, yes.”Miller: “So the judge’s ruling means nothing to you?”Me: “I didn’t say it means nothing to me; I said it is incorrect according tothe law.”Note Mr. Miller’s underlying attitude shining through: it is unthinkable that amere peasant would dare claim that a “judge” is wrong. Blasphemy! Next, he askedif the Supreme Court is “the only court whose decisions [I am] willing toaccept.” “Willing to accept”? Are we talking about some blind faith in somegospel delivered by high priests, or are we talking about the written, knowablelaw? The possibility of examining actual evidence would never occur to Miller;the only question for him is which self-proclaimed authority’s assertions I willblindly “accept.” As I pointed out in my answer, the IRS’s own manual shows thatit doesn’t “accept” lower court rulings either.(After my stay at “club fed,” I happened to come across Galileo’s sentence andrecantation. A few short centuries ago, he was imprisoned for the crime ofhaving suggested that the earth goes around the sun, and not vice versa, and forhaving the gall to believe “that an opinion may be held and defended as probableafter having been declared and defined as contrary to Holy Scripture” by theauthorities. In other words, “We told you that you were wrong, and so it was acrime for you to continue to believe otherwise.” Sounds familiar. So Galileo wasimprisoned, his writings were banned, and eventually he was coerced into sayinghe was wrong after all. In his recantation he described his own sin as havingexpressed his theories about the earth and the sun, even “after having receiveda notification that the said doctrine is contrary to Holy Writ.” Wow, they gavehim “notice,” and he had the gall to not change his mind, because that peskylittle thing called “evidence” was still on his side. Not much has changed sincethen.)After that, Mr. Miller once again tried to make hay of the fact that I didn’tsue the IRS for a refund after the IRS denied our claims. Of course, I had nolegal obligation to sue the government. Then Mr. Miller opined, “You neverwanted a court to rule on your 861 story, did you? ” A few seconds later, hesaid that if I thought I didn’t owe the tax, “Wouldn’t you want a court of law,rather than just rely on your own interpretation, to tell you whether or not youwere right or wrong? ” Translation: it’s a sin to believe something unless anduntil an “authority” says you should believe it. I responded in my usualunrepentant, heretical manner:“No, because the statutes and regulations are binding on all courts of law.They outrank the courts of law. If a regulation says something, and a statutesays the same thing, I do not particularly need a less authoritative opinion toconfirm it.”After that, the judge again then made a big deal out of me not suing the IRS.(Perhaps he didn’t like me committing the sin of suggesting that “the courts”are fallible.) In doing so, he was acting far more like a prosecutor, which heused to be, rather than an unbiased referee. So Prosecutor Baylson told me toexplain to the jury why I didn’t “file the return, and then pay the tax, andthen file a suit for refund.” I answered, “For the same reason I don’t filewhiskey-distilling tax returns and ask for it back: because I don’t believe Iowed it in the first place.” He didn’t seem pleased with my answer, but didn’tseem to know what to say, so he passed the case back to his fellow prosecutor,Mr. Miller. Considering the profound ignorance he himself had just demonstratedin this case, I found it hilarious for him to suggest that I should ask a“judge” whether my conclusions are correct.It should also be noted that in the past, those who did try to take the issue tocourt, rather than getting any ruling on the substance of the issue—even aflawed ruling—just got hit with hefty fines of thousands of dollars for evenmentioning a supposedly “frivolous” argument. So that’s their little Catch-22:if you sue them, they declare your position to be “frivolous” and fine you lotsof money; if you don’t sue them, they cite that as proof that you’re a criminal.Either way, the substance of the issue is ignored and the heretic gets burned.Then Mr. Miller again demonstrated his inability to comprehend that anyone couldchoose anything other than blind obedience to authority, by asking whether,after the IRS had sent me it's stupid form letters, I had “basically ignoredthose notices.” I answered, “No, I did not; I responded to everyone.” He knewthat already, having seen my responses (and having kept the jury from seeingthem), but in his fascist worldview, a citizen has only two options: blindlybelieve whatever anyone in government may assert, or be an evil criminal. I, ofcourse, belong in the second category.He then asked me, “What organs of government do you believe can issue ordersthat are legally binding on you? ” (Spleen and left kidney?) In answer, I listedCongress by way of the statutes, the Secretary of the Treasury by way of theregulations, and the Supreme Court by way of its official rulings. But noticehow Mr. “Divine-Right-of-Kings” Miller wasn’t asking which documents constitutethe law, but rather which offices can “issue orders” that I would blindlybelieve. I guess he had never heard that this is a nation of rule by laws, notrule by men.Continuing in his condescending, authoritarian manner, he then asked (withunconcealed disdain), “And the three Tax Court opinions that your attorney askedyou about, which had flatly rejected the so-called 861 source argument, the TaxCourt judges got it wrong too, didn’t they? ” I replied, “Yes, they did,” andagain pointed out that even the IRS does not consider Tax Court rulings binding.Miller: “And Cathy Spaulding, and Charles Judge, and Stan Escher, and DonPearlman, and Gerald Loke, all these IRS employees who told you that yourposition was wrong, even though they work for the Internal Revenue Service,they’ve got it wrong too. Is that right?”Again, Mr. Automaton cannot fathom someone having the gall to disagree with anygovernment official, no matter how uninformed or idiotic those officials may be.The five bureaucrats he listed aren’t exactly what I consider a stellar line-upof geniuses, but he wanted the jury to think that it was outrageous of me to notblindly accept the unsupported assertions of these paper-pushers, even thoughthey had admitted to being unfamiliar with 861 and to being unable to answerquestions about it. Once again, evidence and understanding are foreign conceptsto Floyd Miller; only unthinking subservience, in body and mind, is acceptableto such drones. I couldn’t resist making the statement, concerning his list ofboneheaded bureaucrats, “I believe that my opinion is more valid than theirs.”Oh, the horror! Thinking that a mere peasant like me might know something thatour glorious “public servants” don’t? Unforgivable! (Oh yeah, and when peoplewho used to be IRS or DOJ agree with me, their opinions no longer deserve anyrespect. When those people tell me that they think I’m right, that doesn’t countfor anything.)And that’s how Pinko Floyd’s cross-examination of me ended, having firmlyestablished that I believe something contrary to what several IRS bureaucratsand lower-court “judges” believe. But doesn’t such a belief make me not guiltyof “willful failure to file”? Yes, as a matter of fact it does. But it makes meguilty of something worse: heresy. And that is what I was put on trial for, andconvicted of, though it’s not actually a crime in this country. Yet.OTHER WITNESSESI intended to briefly call two other witnesses for the defense: Professor PeterMcCandless and Dr. Tom Clayton. I questioned Peter for a bit, but it soon becameclear that I wasn’t going to be allowed to ask him about anything actuallyrelevant. He was not allowed to talk about any of the following:1) Anything he and I discussed on the phone, or in person.2) What he thought (and said to me) about my “Taxable Income” report; 3) What wediscussed on his radio show (which we had on tape, ready to play for the jury,which we weren’t allowed to do);4) The letter-writing campaign we jointly organized, targeting over six hundreddifferent H&R Block offices;5) What a former IRS agent and a former federal prosecutor said while on hisradio show, agreeing with me.So, for example, the jury was not allowed to hear the following statement from aformer federal prosecutor (Terry Croghan) on Peter’s radio show:“I guess it was about a year and a half or so ago, I came across Larken’swebsite as a result of being told by a friend of mine, who is an accountant bythe way, and downloaded the report and read it and, at the end of reading it, Irealized nothing that was said in there seemed wrong to me. And I had checkedout some other so-called tax protestor arguments before that. So I’m alwayslooking for things that kind of don’t feel right to me. And I have to say thatwhen I finished reading Larken’s report, it seemed to make a lot of sense. Andfrom that point on, I started to look up some of the cases that were cited in itand also had an ongoing friendly correspondence with the IRS and started to lookup some of the cases that they were citing to see what they said about this, andcame to the conclusion, as Larken has pointed out many times in the past, thatno one really was refuting the point made in the Taxable Income report. And Ihave yet to hear anyone refute that. So more and more, I guess day by day, I’mcoming to the conclusion that there is no refutation of it because it iscorrect.”Nope, we weren’t allowed to play the recording of that, and Professor McCandlesswasn’t even allowed to talk about what I, or anyone else, said on his radioshow. About all he was allowed to say was that I was a guest on his radio show,that I gave a talk about the issue in Kansas City, and that we had a publicshowing of my Theft by Deception video near where he lives, and that I didn’tget paid for any of that.In pre-trial proceedings, Judge Baylson indicated that he would not allow peoplewho agree with my conclusions to testify about their own beliefs, because “whatother people believe is not relevant as to the defendant’s willfulness.” Ofcourse, everything the government presented about the 861 issue—the formletters, the lower-court rulings, the bureaucratic assertions—were allstatements of what other people believe about the issue. So why was that allallowed at trial? Simple: What Baylson meant is that when people agree with me,their beliefs are completely irrelevant, but when they disagree with me, theirbeliefs are relevant and admissible. Apparently Baylson thinks that, when someIRS employees said “You’re wrong,” I should have accepted it as indisputable,but when some other IRS employees said “Holy smokes, you’re right!,” I shouldhave ignored them. Yeah, that makes loads of sense.I called Dr. Clayton to the stand, but after a “sidebar” discussion made itclear that none of Dr. Clayton’s extensive first-hand knowledge of relevantinformation was going to be allowed, he was dismissed as a witness, and I restedmy case.(During my prison stay, Dr. Clayton was tried, before an exceedingly obnoxious,fascist judge and a completely boneheaded jury, and found guilty of “willfulfailure to file” as well as for supposedly filing “false claims” against thegovernment. That last charge was based on his filing claims for refund—preciselywhat Judge Baylson said I should have done to avoid prosecution. Dr.Clayton wassentenced to 60 months, both because there was more money involved and becausethe “false claim” charges were felonies.)PROOF OF WILLFULNESSAt my trial, the government didn’t introduce one speck of evidence showing thatI believe I owe federal income taxes. In fact, the prosecution proved the exactopposite. As a matter of law (as if that matters in a federal courtroom), thegovernment must prove each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt in orderto justify a “guilty” verdict. Two out of three ain’t good enough. In my case,that means that they were required to produce evidence proving that I believe myincome is taxable. Their own prosecutors’ manual laments how difficult a task itis to prove such a belief, even when someone does try to break the law.Yes, it can be a tough job trying to convict someone who hasn’t committed acrime (though at the moment I’m somewhat lacking in sympathy for them). So whatis a dishonest prosecutor to do? Why, of course, take some “evidence” thatproves absolutely nothing, and persuade a jury of morons that they should inferguilt from it. (It also helps a lot to have a judge who encourages the jury tomake absurd, irrational leaps of logic.) Now that we’ve seen the government’sentire case, let’s consider the five categories of “evidence”introduced, and see how they were passed off (with the help of the judge) asproof of “willfulness.”1) Our finances improved after we stopped filing and paying.I hesitate to expound on this one, for fear of insulting the reader’sintelligence—unless, of course, one of my jurors happens to read this. Upthrough 1996, my wife and I had been sending about $10,000 to the IRS everyyear, out of business profits of around $40,000. When we stopped sending the IRS$10,000 a year, our finances improved to some degree. The government, with thehelp of the judge, tried to spin that as proof that we believed we owed the tax.The utterly insane implication of the government’s spin was that, had we trulybelieved we didn’t owe the tax, our finances would not have improved when westopped giving the IRS $10,000 a year. If that sounds idiotic to you, join theclub. Obviously, that “evidence” had nothing to do with proving guilt andeverything to do with stirring up resentment among the sheep in the jury box.And it worked.2) I expressed disdain for the IRS.The government presented various things I had written in which I expresseddisdain, resentment, and animosity toward the IRS. (Had this book existed then,they could have included it as well.) And that proved what? Let’s review: I amconvinced that the IRS is illegally defrauding over 100 million Americans out ofover a trillion dollars ($1,000,000,000,000) every year. And the governmentfinds it suspicious, and treats it as evidence of criminal guilt, that I don’tlike the IRS?But my thought crime didn’t stop there. In a few private e-mails, I spoke ofwanting to see the IRS out of business. I even specified that I wanted them outof the business of unlawfully demanding money from people who don’t owe it. Yetthe government, with the help of the judge, tried to spin that as proof of“willfulness,” which is just plain stupid (even worse than “frivolous”).3) I didn’t sue the IRS.One of the main points stressed by all three prosecutors—the two at the table tomy left, and the one up on the bench pretending to be a judge—was that I chosenot to sue the IRS. When someone files a claim for refund and the IRS denies itat the administrative level, that person can file suit in district court to tryto get the money back. Of course, no one is ever required to sue the government(duh). In fact, the IRS and the courts conspire to discourage people from suingbased upon the 861 evidence by imposing hefty fines for even mentioning thesupposedly “frivolous” issue in court.As it happened, at the time the IRS denied our claims, I knew next to nothingabout court procedures, and I wasn’t eager to hire a lawyer to sue the feds,which most likely would have cost more than the refund I was trying to get.(“Yay! I got my $20,000 refund, and it only cost me $37,000 in attorney's fees!”No, thanks.) Furthermore, based upon what I had seen before (including a verythorough, well-documented filing by an experienced attorney—which earned him abig fat fine and no substantive response from the Kangaroo Tax Court), I wasn’texactly expecting that any court would address the matter objectively andfairly. And going through my own trial didn’t exactly improve my faith in ourjudicial system.“Ah ha! You knew a court would probably disagree with you!” Yeah, no kidding.And Judge Baylson and the (other) prosecutors harped on that as if it were proofthat I knew my income was taxable. (“Mr. Galileo, you obviously knew that thesun goes around the earth, because you failed to ask the church’s high prieststo rule on your claim to the contrary.”) Once again, the loony implication isthat it is impossible for me to think a court can be wrong. By their logic, if Iexpected some guy wearing a black dress to say I’m wrong, I can’t possibly stillthink I’m right. That would be heresy! (What’s really sad is that the juryapparently accepted that boneheaded argument.)4) I sold my Theft by Deception video.At trial and again at my sentencing, I was demonized, by the government and thejudge, for having the gall to sell my perfectly legal video (for a whole $20each). Never mind that the actual charge had nothing to do with the video; nevermind that for four years everything I wrote about the issue was publiclyavailable for free; never mind that it took me a year and a half to make thatvideo; never mind that I offered to donate every penny I made from that video tothe U.S. Treasury if they would let me ask their lawyers some questions aboutthe law. No, I profited, and therefore, they implied, I couldn’t have actuallybelieved what I was saying. How does that logically follow? It doesn’t, ofcourse. (Lots of authors will be surprised to learn that by selling their books,they have proven that they don’t really believe what they write.)5) A collection of clueless bureaucrats, legally worthless form letters andnonbinding decrees of lower court judges said that my conclusions were wrong.That may prove what those people believed, but how on earth could their wordsprove what I believe?That was it. They “proved” willfulness using several examples of absolutelyridiculous, completely backward reasoning. And that was enough to persuade theabsolutely ridiculous, completely backward-thinking jury. Keep in mind, thethreshold of proof in a criminal case is “beyond a reasonable doubt” to justifya “guilty” verdict. If the jury even thought that maybe I believed what I wassaying, they were required to acquit. They were required to say “not guilty”unless they had no real doubt that I believed my income to be taxable. The judgeeven told them that if they weren’t sure, they had to find me “not guilty.” Butdespite the fact that there was nothing in the government’s evidence which evenhinted that I believe I owe the tax, much less proved it beyond a reasonabledoubt, the jury declared me guilty anyway.THE GOVERNMENT’S CLOSINGAfter the mid-afternoon break on the fourth day, all that was left of the trialwas closing arguments. The government would do its closing first, then I woulddo mine, then the government would get the last word, in the form of a“rebuttal.”Mr. Miller began the government’s closing by saying that this was a case about“a man who would not take ‘no’ for an answer.” That about sums it up. I’m evilbecause when some brain-dead government bureaucrats said “no,” I didn’t justblindly agree with them. They “told” me I was wrong—though they couldn’t sayexactly why, and couldn’t answer my questions, and couldn’t state the specificsof their own position—and I was so diabolical that I didn’t just take their wordfor it. No, I insisted on citations, answers, explanations, and all sorts ofother frivolous stuff, instead of accepting their pronouncements on blind faith,like any good sheep—I mean, citizen—would do.Mr. Miller then said that I had claimed “to have made a startling discovery,”which was another bald-faced lie. I testified that I am not the one who firstunearthed the 861 evidence. He then said I “defied the law” by not filing, even“after being told time and time again” that I was wrong. Wow, Galileo’s sentenceall over again: I believed it even after an authoritarian told me I was wrong!Then Mr. Miller, in his most sarcastic tone, accused me of thinking myself to be“the supreme interpreter” of the law, above the courts, above the IRS,etc.—another bald-faced lie. (I had just explained how I consider statutes,regulations, and Supreme Court rulings to be binding on me, whether I like themor not.) But that brings up a pet peeve of mine: the misuse of the term“interpretation.”INTERPRETATIONTime for a sidebar. Lots of people like to avoid talking about evidence andlogic by blurting out, “That’s just your interpretation.” It makes for a niceintellectual cop-out and helps people avoid talking about things they knownothing about. In this case, however, very few of my conclusions have anythingto do with “interpretation.”Consider what it means to “interpret” something. Suppose one day a friend ofyours said to you, “I ate a big salad with my pet rabbit today.” The sentencecould literally mean at least two things: 1) “My pet rabbit and I ate a bigsalad today,” or 2) “Today I ate a big salad and my pet rabbit.” The statementcan be interpreted either way, because the words themselves could literally meaneither one. However, the statement could not be interpreted to mean “I likepurple fish.” Why not? Because the words don’t say that, no matter how you readthem.Likewise, what I cite from the law rarely has more than one possible meaning.For example, remember all those decades of regulations saying that some incomeis to be “excluded from gross income” because it is, “under the Constitution,not taxable by the Federal government”? How many ways can that be “interpreted”?One. (Actually, it’s not an interpretation at all if there’s only one meaning itcould have.) When judges or IRS employees assert that all income is taxableunless a statute specifically says it isn’t, they are not “interpreting” theregulations—they are ignoring them. There’s a big difference.You may have noticed how often I tried to get the bureaucrats to state thespecifics of their own position, rather than just throwing mine at them. Whywould an alleged “supreme interpreter” of the tax laws, who didn’t care aboutanyone else’s opinion, make such a big effort to try to elicit the opinions ofgovernment officials? And isn’t it a bit odd how they consistently refused toexplain their own position? I just about begged for their “interpretation,” andthey couldn’t (or wouldn’t) give it. For example, the following are statements Imade on two different radio broadcasts with Peter McCandless (which, of course,the jury was not allowed to hear):“Over and over again I’ve told the IRS, if you want to send me a rebuttal I willpost it on the front page of my web site for free right now.” (Me, 11/16/01)“I have repeatedly offered to the IRS chief counsel and said, ‘If you want togive a rebuttal, I will post it on the front of my web site’.” (Me, 4/4/02)Does it sound as if I don’t care what anyone else has to say? Does it sound asif I don’t want the issue discussed, or that I’m ignoring opposing views? (Ofcourse, the jury wasn’t allowed to hear or read those statements.) My confidencein my conclusions is not because I consider myself the “supreme interpreter” ofanything; it’s because my conclusions match what the law says, and theirs don’t.Neither of us is “interpreting” anything: I’m following what the law says;they’re ignoring it.For example, when I cite half a dozen different regulations saying that I shoulduse Section 861 and its regulations to determine my “taxable income from sourceswithin the United States,” that’s not “interpreting” the law; that’s reading andunderstanding it. The words can mean only one thing. And when IRS paper-pusherssay “Don’t look there,” they also are not interpreting anything; they areignoring the law and making false assertions. When someone declares that the lawmeans something other than what the words in the law actually say, that isdenial and hallucination, not interpretation—which, unfortunately, seems to bewhat drives most federal judges and bureaucrats. And then they insult andcomplain about those of us who choose to believe our own eyes instead of theirbaseless assertions.MY SINSo, what it boils down to is that I’m an evil sinner for choosing evidence overassertions. Mr. Miller even made the point that, while I talked about readingthe statutes, regulations, and Supreme Court rulings—in other words, the lawitself—the jury never heard me say “that I went to an accountant, or a taxlawyer, or H&R Block for that matter, here in the Eastern District ofPennsylvania, to test the validity of my beliefs. Not once.”First of all, the reason they did not hear me say that is because Mr. Miller,with the help of the court, prohibited me from talking about it. He knew damnwell that I had contacted all sorts of tax professionals (including in easternPennsylvania), some of whom ended up agreeing with me. He also knew that PeterMcCandless and I had organized a letter-writing campaign asking six hundred H&RBlock offices about Section 861. In other words, Mr. Miller lied his butt off tothe jury, and he did it twice during his closing. (How slimy do you have to beto forcibly prevent someone from saying something, and then claim that his notsaying it proves that he’s a criminal?)But aside from his bald-faced lie, notice his attitude: it was wrong for me tolook at the law for myself instead of blindly relying upon the opinions (howeveruninformed) of people with credentials. How dare I rely on my own research, whenI have “no formal legal training” (and he kept adding, “and I mean nodisrespect,” which was also a lie), instead of relying on politically appointedhacks who not only had already demonstrated profound ignorance of the law, butall of whom also benefit from the “income tax” fraud? (Isn’t that kind of likeasking Mafia thugs whether they break the law, and taking their word for it whenthey say “no”?)In summing up the nature of the charge, Mr. Miller correctly identified“willfulness” as the only thing the jury needed to decide. He then made theasinine claim that the evidence the jury had seen “overwhelmingly proves beyondall doubt” that I had set out to violate the law. Then he described two mainthemes which he intended to focus on to prove guilt: “notice” and “attitude.”NOTICEMr. Miller: “Time and time again, various notices [were] sent to the defendant,telling him, Your story doesn’t hold water; you’ve got to pay; you’ve got to payyour fair share like everybody else.”I’m not sure which is more disgusting: the prosecutor who thinks that’s a decentargument, or the jury that falls for it. What about the law? How about citationsand evidence? How about statutes and regulations? How about a discussion of theissue? How about answering questions? How about the damn government at leastdeciding what its own position is? Nope. For eight years the IRS had shownitself to be utterly incapable of that. Instead, in between admitting that theyweren’t familiar with the law, admitting that they could not and did not answermy questions, and admitting that they couldn’t state the specifics of their ownposition, they throw in an occasional “Um, but we think it’s taxable,” and I’m acriminal for not taking their word for it.(The “fair share” rhetoric sickens me. I guess they think that people shouldignore what the law says, and pay based on some ethereal and vague bunk about“fairness.” I’ve never seen a tax return with a space for entering one’s “fairshare”; the number they ask for is “taxable income,” which is determined by thelaw alone, whether anyone thinks it’s “fair” or not. But again, Mr. Miller’sgoal was not to prove guilt, but to elicit envy and resentment from the jurorswith the implied message “You pay and he doesn’t; you’re good and he’s bad.”)ATTITUDEYes, Mr. Miller really did harp on my “attitude” as if it’s proof that I’m acriminal. (Can you say “thought crime”?) Then his demonization approach wentinto high gear, pointing out that I’m an “anarchist”! And I don’t like the IRS!And I wrote a letter to a militia! (Never mind that the purpose of my letter wasto disagree with them.) While on a dishonest and irrelevant roll, Mr. Millersaid that I “essentially invited” the militia to help me “engage in what [I]referred to as a bloodless coup. Those types of things you hear about in thirdworld countries. Coups. An overthrow of the government, although no blood isshed. I’m not making this up. Those are his own words.”Actually, Pinko Floyd absolutely was making it up, and those were not my words.I talked of public pressure being used to force the government to obey its ownlaws; I was not talking about any “overthrow” of the government, and I neverused the word “coup.” A “coup” is an attempt to forcibly seize power, to takeover the government. Pardon the obscure reference (again), but Mr. Miller seemsto be taking a page out of the playbook of the Wickersham Brothers, from HortonHears a Who (by Dr. Seuss). Here is an excerpt of the “Wickersham” method ofprosecution:“You’re a dastardly, ghastardly, shnasterdly schnook,Trying to brainwash our brains with this gobbledy gook.We know what you’re up to, pal.You’re trying to shatter our morale.You’re trying to stir up discontent.And seize the reins of government.”Wow, I’ve been Wickershammed! Come to think of it, it’s a little creepy how muchmy tale resembles Horton’s experiences: A guy comes across evidence of somethingseemingly unbelievable, most people instinctively ridicule him without lookinginto it, he gets put in a cage in an effort to make him shut up. But I digress.After again whining about my having the gall to read the law for myself, Mr.Miller then said the following: “Just think about it for a moment. If the incomeof most Americans is not taxable, why are they making you do this, payingfederal income taxes? I mean, that’s been the law since we’ve had a country.”No, Mr. Dumbass (and I mean no disrespect), the country existed for over eightyyears before the first income tax was imposed, and existed for another 18 yearswithout one prior to the Sixteenth Amendment. (And Mr. Miller, a Tax Divisionattorney, doesn’t know this?) I wonder if Mr. Miller even noticed that hisstatement contradicted Judge Baylson’s previous, equally incorrect assertionthat there was no federal income tax prior to the Sixteenth Amendment. And thesepeople wonder why I don’t accept their uninformed assertions as the gospeltruth?As to why “they” (those in government) are making the jurors pay up, it’sbecause people in government like money and power, no matter how much lying,cheating, extorting, defrauding, and terrorizing it takes to get it. I guess thejurors were upset that, unlike them, I wasn’t content to be an obedient victim.Then Mr. Miller continued his string of lies, claiming that I think I’m the“only person in the continental [huh?] United States who has ever made anaccurate determination of what is in the Internal Revenue Code.” Remember, hesaid this after making sure I was prohibited from talking about the dozens ofcredentialed people—and thousands of “normal” folk—who have agreed with myfindings. Apparently the preferred method of our wonderful “Justice Department”is to suppress all exculpatory evidence, and then pretend it doesn’t exist. Ihope you’re proud of yourself, Mr. Miller. (Actually, I hope you get run over bya bus, you Nazi piece of crap. And I mean no disrespect.)Then he did his verbal tap-dance regarding “willfulness.” And what did theesteemed Mr. Miller say the jury should rely on in deciding whether or not mybelief in this “argument” was sincere? Why, of course: 1) the fact that I usedto file (before hearing about 861); 2) the “total amount of income that wasinvolved”; 3) the “notices” asserting that my “position was incorrect”; 4) my“attitude towards the Internal Revenue Service”; and 5) my “business background”and my “sophistication in general.”Notice anything missing? Like, perhaps, the legal conclusions I had beenpublicly explaining for eight years? Heck, no, they certainly shouldn’t takethat into consideration! How dense (or evil) does one have to be to consider hislist of irrelevancies to be proof of “willfulness”? Only the third is evenvaguely relevant to the law at all, and it demonstrates only what other peoplebelieve, not what I believe. So his entire list of what he thought the juryshould consider was 100 percent irrelevant bunk. None of it relates to what Ibelieve the law requires of me. Meanwhile, the government did a great job (withthe judge’s help) of excluding from the trial piles and piles of evidence thatdoes indicate what I believe. Mr. Miller might as well have said: “You canconsider his hairdo, his choice of neckties, his dislike of popcorn, and howmany fish he owns, in determining willfulness; but please don’t consider all thetimes he has explained his conclusions, all the letters he has written, all thequestions he has asked, all the lawyers and accountants who have agreed withhim, or all of the sections of law he keeps citing which support hisconclusions!”Just in case he wasn’t cliché enough up to this point, he then whined again thatI don’t want to pay my “fair share,” and that I don’t “want to have to pay forthe clean water, the clean air, the highways—all these things that are paid forby tax dollars.” First of all, since when does the government make the air andwater? Second, notice how he conveniently glosses over all the other taxes whichwe do pay, implying that all government services, state and federal, are fundedby income taxes alone. I’ll resist the temptation to point out all the otherthings wrong with Mr. Miller’s government-worshiping rant, but I will point outthat it has absolutely nothing to do with whether I believe my income to betaxable, i.e., it has nothing to do with whether or not I committed a crime. Itwas just more emotion-eliciting garbage to sway an imbecilic jury.Sure, I read the law, but (Miller asked) did I then “take any steps to try totest [my] belief? ” Wait, did he just call it my “belief” again? Yep. And indoing so, didn’t he just acknowledge that I did what I believed the law torequire? Yep. Doesn’t that make me not guilty of the crime alleged? Yep. Butsetting aside the little detail of the prosecutor admitting that I was innocent,how did Mr. Miller think I should have “tested” my beliefs? The meetings withthe IRS apparently didn’t count, nor did my letters to every government officialI could think of, from the President, to the IRS Commissioner, to the AttorneyGeneral, to dozens and dozens of other government offices. No, the only properway for me to have “tested” my beliefs, according to Miller, was to go to acourt, or a CPA, or an attorney, or H&R Block, “to have them say, No, Mr. Rose,your position is incorrect.” That’s exactly how he put it.So apparently the way a good citizen “tests” whether he is reading the lawcorrectly would go something like this: “Um, hey Mr. CPA guy, can you pleasetell me I’m wrong? No, I don’t need any answers, or discussion, or citations, orexplanation; I just need you to tell me I’m wrong. Thanks.” Yeah, that soundsreasonable. (Once again, Mr. Miller was also lying by implying that I hadn’ttaken the issue to tax professionals to get their responses, when he knows Irepeatedly did exactly that, though he made sure I wasn’t allowed to tell thejury about it.)And when two lower-court judges said my position was “frivolous,” I “just blewit off,” claimed Mr. Miller. That’s because I had piles of citations of lawdirectly contradicting the self-serving proclamations of those power-happyjudges. Whenever I saw someone trying to address the substance of the issue,however lame his attempts might be, I would post his opinions on my web site,along with my step-by-step, thoroughly supported response. (You’d never catchthe government doing that.) But of course, none of that matters. Tototalitarians like Floyd Miller, anything but unquestioning obedience to thedecrees of anyone in government is a sin.So Mr. Miller claimed that I really knew I was required to file—becauseunthinking automatons like himself had told me so—but that I “set out to try todevise a way to make someone think that [I] was confused.” What? Sorry, noconfusion here. I know exactly what I believe, and I know why, and I had beenpublicly explaining it for eight years. It is the status quo drones like Mr.Miller, Mr. Baylson, Mr. Noud, Ms. Spaulding, Mr. Judge, Mr. Escher, Mr.Pearlman, Mr. Enz, and a few thousand others who display confusion.So that was their entire case. “Lame” doesn’t begin to describe it.HOW DID I DO IT?In a criminal trial, a good prosecutor will paint for the jury a completepicture of the alleged crime: exactly what the defendant did, how he did it, whyhe did it, and so on, giving pertinent evidence for each point. In my case, onthe other hand, the prosecution’s portrayal of me consisted of many unrelated,out-of-context, often contradictory fragments, a few completely baselessassertions and accusations, and a random collection of irrelevancies. Had thejury bothered to think about the case, they might have wondered a few thingsabout how I pulled off my diabolical “scheme.” For example:1) If I don’t really believe in my stated conclusions about the law, why is itthat nowhere in all of the articles I’ve written, radio shows I’ve been on, orthe thousands of pieces of private correspondence the IRS confiscated, writtenover a span of eight years, was there any indication of that? If I’m really thatgood at pretending to believe something, I must be the best actor in the world!2) If I don’t really believe what I say I believe, but just pretended to forpersonal gain, why did I spend many hundreds of unpaid hours researching theissue, online and at various law libraries, only to turn around and give awayall my findings for free? Why did I spend so much time organizing letter-writingcampaigns, being on radio shows, and printing and distributing free copies of my“Taxable Income” report? Four years into my research, I released the only861-related thing I ever made a dime off of: my Theft by Deception video. Then Iturned around and offered to donate all of the profits from sales of that videoto the U.S. Treasury if I would be allowed to ask IRS lawyers some questions oncamera. Later, I was also involved in the production of the 861 Evidencemini-CD, which was a non-profit endeavor from the beginning. In fact, Tessa andI loaned the project $17,000 of our own money, most of which we have yet to getback. Does that sound as if I only pretended to believe in it for my ownfinancial gain?3) If I don’t really believe in what I’m saying, why can I cite decades ofincome tax regulations directly contradicting conventional wisdom? Had I simplymisquoted those regs, that would have been easy for the government to prove. Sohow did it come about that their law books directly contradict their assertions,while supporting my conclusions—the conclusions I (supposedly) only pretended tobelieve? It makes no sense. How is it, for example, that I can quote their lawbooks talking about some income being exempt because of the Constitution, eventhough I supposedly only pretended to believe that? “Nope,” thinks the braindeadjury, “he can’t possibly believe that, even though he just showed us thegovernment’s own law books saying it.”4) If I don’t really believe in the issue, how did I manage to construct alogical, well-supported position which is so persuasive that it has won overdozens of converts among CPAs and attorneys, while baffling judges, congressmen,and IRS lawyers too, to the point where they openly refuse to talk about it?Even Agent Pearlman, more than once, warned people that I am “very persuasive”in my arguments. How did I make up an argument that is so good that even afterseveral years the IRS is still unable to answer simple questions about how todetermine someone's taxable income? What thought-control abilities must I havein order to make it so that no one in the entire government—including veteranIRS and DOJ lawyers—can explain why their law books say what they say? \" I don'tknow why there's not more of an obvious, ya know— we must be missing somethingsomewhere here under 861.\" So said Charles Judge on September 22, 2000. Andapparently they still haven't found whatever they were “missing.” Did Ibrainwash these people? Did I make them 307 unfamiliar with the law? What Jedimind trick did I use to render everyone in government incapable of substantivelyresponding to my stated position—a position I supposedly don’t really believein?Trouble is, unless you can answer all of those questions, the government’s caseagainst me makes no sense. And yet in spite of all of that, in the end the juryproclaimed, based on not a shred of evidence, that they were sure beyond anyreasonable doubt that I don’t really believe in the position I have beenconsistently expressing and explaining for eight years. Good grief!INTO THE HOME STRETCHDespite having spent months, if not years, contemplating what I would say ifever put on trial, in the end a lot of the specific planning and preparationcame at the last minute. This was the result of many factors, including:1) The last-minute splitting of my trial from my wife’s trial, after planningfor a joint trial.2) Not knowing what the court would and wouldn’t allow at trial, even after thepre-trial motions, which are supposed to settle such matters. It’s hard to plana summary of information when you don’t know what the information will be.3) The last-minute involvement of my “assistance of counsel,” which resulted ina major change in how the defense case was presented. Though this was stressful,I think it was for the better, despite the ultimate outcome.4) The government dragging its feet and changing its mind on what evidence itwould present.As a result, when we weren’t in the courtroom, we were usually somewhere tryingto plan for what would happen next, while not even knowing how long the trialwould last, and therefore not knowing how much time we had to plan for differentstages. To put it mildly, I was more than a little relieved when I learned thatI wouldn’t have to give my closing arguments on day four, because I reallywasn’t ready, since so much had changed since I had put together a possibleclosing.As a result, the dozen or so hours following the court adjourning on the fourthday were some of the most nerve-wracking, intense, creative, and stressful hoursof my life. Basically, we scrapped all my prior plans and started over fromscratch. It didn’t exactly help matters that suddenly Tessa was scheduled to goto trial in a few days—which Judge Baylson made sound absolutely unchangeable(though it wasn’t)—and had no one representing her, since we found out that Mr.Becraft wasn’t available for that time period. So with the stress of that, whiletrying to remake my closing argument from scratch, I got almost no sleep.Normally that wouldn’t have mattered, except that I hadn’t slept much theprevious several nights either. When this goes on too long, I get a really nastysleep-deprivation syndrome, with symptoms a lot like a severe flu. I was hopingI had one more day before that would kick in. No such luck.CLOSING TIMEWhen morning came, and it was almost time for my grand finale—probably the mostimportant part of the trial—I felt as if I was on the brink of death. The goodnews was that I really liked what we had come up with for the closing, as didthe people I ran it by the night before. The bad news was that I felt as if Iwas going to barf on the jury if I even stood up. (I wonder if vomiting on thejury is grounds for a mistrial. In retrospect, I think they deserved it.)With the help of my team, I barely managed to make it to the table in thecourtroom and sit down. Although I wasn’t entirely sure I would live through theclosing, as soon as I got up and started talking, I felt a lot better.Nonetheless, it’s hard to be chipper and enthusiastic, to exude confidence andconviction (no pun intended), when you feel half dead. My delivery definitelysuffered, though I’m not sure how much difference it would have made anyway.Coincidentally (maybe), the courtroom’s electronic display system—supplied bythe prosecution—didn’t work during my closing. We had prepared a few displaystills the night before, but these technical problems—which the government’stech guy did damn near nothing to fix—made it so I had to do my closing withoutany monitors to show anything on. Needless to say, the guy who had put ourvisual aids together was not pleased by this turn of events, and neither was I.But the show must go on.I started my closing by saying that rather than nitpicking over a lot ofindividual exhibits, I wanted to talk mainly about “some basic issues, somebasic terms, concepts.” The first term was:“THE TRUTH”How (I pondered aloud) do we know what the truth is—not just about tax laws, butin general? “We see things and we hear things, and we use logic to try to figureout what we can about the world around us.” (In retrospect, the jurors probablyhad a different answer to my rhetorical question: “We blindly believe whateverauthority tells us.”) Then I asked the members of the jury to imagine someonecoming up to them and asking, “How much is two plus two?” I then asked them toimagine that, after answering the question—which in retrospect I’m not sure myjurors were qualified to do—the guy asking the question pulled out a baseballbat and smacked them in the head with it, which I acted out, complete with avery loud “Wham! ” designed to get their attention and/or wake them up. Afterthe hypothetical clobbering, I asked the jury to imagine the bat-wielderinsisting that the correct answer is five. Then he asks the question again: howmuch is two plus two? “Four.” “Wham!” “The answer is five,” says ourhypothetical clobberer.I then advised the jury, if they ever found themselves in that position, toanswer “five,” in order to avoid a baseball bat to the head. But, I inquired,what if you knew that answering the question untruthfully, in order to avoid thebaseball bat, would hurt someone else? Then it becomes “a moral matter; a matterof principle.” For example, what if the guy with the baseball bat was tellingthem to write down a million dollars on a 1040 form, where it says taxableincome, when they didn’t make that much? Then it’s not just about saying wordsto avoid being hit in the head; then it’s about “allowing injustice to occur toavoid getting hit in the head.” Then that pesky little thing called “principle”shows up: “At what point do we buckle under threats? ””In my own case, I have been experiencing that for several years. I have everyreason to believe that my income is not subject to the federal income tax, thatI do not owe the tax. And I understand that’s contrary to conventional wisdom,but based on what I see in the law, that is what I believe. Now the government,in various ways, has threatened the proverbial baseball bat. Not literally,obviously. ‘We will do this to you if you do not write the amount of your incomeon the bottom of that return and sign it.’ Well, I don’t believe my income istaxable. It wouldn’t be correct to put that number on the bottom of that return.... Right on where you sign it, it says I swear under penalty of perjury thateverything on this return is correct. Not only would I be lying and allowingmyself to be victimized by what I believe to be a fraud, I would be committing acrime by signing that, because I believe the amount of my taxable income forfederal income tax purposes is zero.”Then I summed up my situation with a statement which the government (courtsincluded) has been confirming ever since:Me: “There are only two ways that anyone can get me to ever sign a federalincome tax return again. One is to persuade me by showing me in the law that myincome is taxable. If they can do that, I will write down the number. I willsign the return. I will send in the check. The only other way is if you hurt meor someone I love, and I decide it’s worth lying—to commit perjury and allowmyself to be defrauded—to avoid the suffering they’ll inflict on me.”Then I explained that this wasn’t just about whether I was willing to allowmyself to be defrauded, in order to avoid trouble.Me: “If I were to sign the return, I would be financially harming myself. Butthere is something else the government wants me to do, and it is holding up theproverbial baseball bat: they want me to shut up. Because I’ve been saying inpublic, to people like you and many others—many, many, many people like you—thatI believe we are being defrauded by our own government. Again, there are twoways to make me stop saying that. One, use the law, the evidence, to demonstratethat I was mistaken and my conclusions are incorrect. Then I will say I amsorry, I was incorrect. The other way is to inflict enough pain and suffering onme or on someone I love that I will stop telling the truth. I’m telling youright now, it will take a lot of pain and suffering to make me stop telling thetruth.”Next, I talked about the government’s “notices” (form letters), and pointed outthat the letters tell people “you may be fined or prosecuted if you don’t dothings the way we think you’re supposed to do them,” and that amounts to abaseball bat.“And you know what? The IRS’s manual says notices carry no legal weight. So youare not getting any evidence of the law; you’re getting a baseball bat. Youcannot change my beliefs with a baseball bat. If you hit me hard enough, youmight convince me to lie, but you cannot change my beliefs with a baseball bat.You can only change my beliefs with evidence and logic. They’re in a toughposition. They’re saying, ‘We keep swinging the bat and you won’t shut up!’ Mr.Miller says I repeatedly defied the law. That is not true. I obeyed the law; Idefied the baseball bat. They can keep swinging. I’m not going to sign a returnI believe to be incorrect.”(Actually, I did end up doing exactly that, in order to minimize the harm to myfamily. I hope the judge and prosecutors are proud of themselves for havingterrorized someone into signing returns he knows to be incorrect.)Me: “This system has become a throwback to medieval times. They’ll let us offeasy if only we’ll confess, inquisition style, that our income is taxable.‘Recant your heresy and we’ll stop hurting you!’ ‘Frivolous’ is the modernequivalent of heresy: a belief which the powers that be cannot refute, but willnot tolerate.”I then explained that my parents had raised me to stand up for the truth, evenwhen the truth is unpopular and even when standing up for it is dangerous. (HereI paused for a quick, “Hi, Mom” to my mother in the audience.) And this wasindeed dangerous; they were using the big “baseball bat” of prosecution, tryingto put me in prison. Why would they do that?, I asked aloud. Was it because ofthe $50,000 they had lost from my not filing (for all five years combined)?Nope. As I told the jury, the federal government spends that much money in lessthan one second. So no, it wasn’t about the money we didn’t give them. “The bigbaseball bat, prosecution, was because I wouldn’t shut up”—because I wouldn’tstop telling every American I could reach that I believed their government wasdefrauding them. “And the way I was raised, I believe that if my neighbors arebeing robbed, I have a duty to tell them so, even if they think I sound wackywhen I tell them.”I then pointed out that while the government harped on what I could have done(such as suing the IRS to try to get refunds), there was plenty they could havedone, too, if they thought I owed the tax. They could have sent me a “30-dayletter,” telling me how much they thought I owed. But they didn’t. They couldhave then sent a “Notice of Deficiency,” demanding payment. But they didn’t.They never even tried to collect money from me at all. They skipped right toprosecution.Me: “Now, I agree that law enforcement—in law enforcement, sometimes musclepower is appropriate. When somebody is intentionally disobeying the law, you’vegot to use your muscle power. It’s not appropriate here. I told them what I wasdoing. I explained my position. I asked to sit down with them; I asked them toshow me anything in the law which would demonstrate that my conclusions wereincorrect. Are those the actions of a tax cheater? Are those the actions thatjustify what they have been trying to do against me? Wouldn’t a 50-cent formletter be a little more cost effective than tens of thousands of dollars spenttrying to prosecute me?”Then I turned to Floyd Miller, and asked him to his face, “Why didn’t you answermy questions? ” I then asked the jury if threats and insults should have made medoubt my conclusions.Me: “They seem to have the attitude that they don’t have to answer questions.They don’t have to discuss the law. They don’t have to figure out what their ownposition is, because they have the power to hurt people. They have the baseballbat. Who needs words when you’ve got a big baseball bat?”I said that Mr. Miller was correct that I’m not a CPA—I’m not supposed to be atax expert any more than those on the jury are. So what, I asked, is anon-lawyer to do when faced with such evidence?Me: “Now, Mr. Miller talks as if I ignored the interpretations of those in thegovernment. I asked for their interpretations, and their interpretation was,‘We’re not familiar with that; we can’t answer your questions right now; we’llget back to you’.”Since they couldn’t answer my questions at the meeting, I asked them to referthe issue to the IRS lawyers via “technical advice.” They refused to send it. “Ididn’t ignore their interpretations; I did everything I could to try to get themto give me their interpretations”—not just assertions, “but specific answershaving to do with specific questions on how to comply with the law.”Me: “I mentioned in opening that I tend to believe my own eyes, and I tend tonot give all that much weight to credentials in and of themselves. Presumably,somebody with credentials is more likely to be an expert in a certain field ofthought. All right, but that’s not always the case, and sometimes they don’thave all the evidence; they don’t know everything, or they make a mistake. AndI’ve seen many examples where a credentialed CPA or attorney has made somestatement where I have seen evidence that directly contradicts the statement.Now, if I’m faced with a choice between an assertion, and evidence which clearlyshows the assertion to be wrong, which one should a rational individual believe?For example, a judge down in Tampa asserted that all income is taxable unlessit’s specifically exempted by the tax code. Only, I have photocopies in mybasement of 26 CFR 39.22(b)-1 that showed me the judge was wrong. Do I believehim because he was a judge? Or do I disbelieve him because the evidence proveshe’s wrong?”(The night before, I had seriously considered using Judge Baylson’s own displayof profound ignorance of federal tax law as the example regarding assertionversus evidence. In retrospect, I wish I had: “What should I believe: this guyin a black dress who says Congress couldn’t impose income taxes prior to theSixteenth Amendment, or the copies I have of pre-1913 federal income tax acts?”Ah, what might have been. But I decided to pick on a different clueless federaljudge instead—one who wasn’t presiding over my case.) I then talked a bit about“attitude”—one of Mr. Miller’s main themes.“I found it sort of interesting that in a criminal trial in the United States,one of his main points was attitude. I was sort of under the impression that wecan believe whatever the heck we want in this country.”I then asked the jury to imagine that someone hid tape-recorders in theirhouses, and over a year’s time collected every occasion where they saidsomething nasty or said a bad word, and put them all together to play for theirfriends. Wouldn’t they sound nasty and hostile? So when the IRS goes throughthousands of e-mails, it’s pretty easy to come up with some “that show angerfrom me, dislike of the IRS, even contempt.”“And based on those snippets of the one thousand e-mails, I could very easilyunderstand how you’d think, ‘Wow, he seems inappropriately hostile.’ You didn’tread the other thousand e-mails, and you didn’t hear the parts of my life thathappened before I acquired that attitude. If you’d seen some of the things I’veseen, you might have the same attitude.”I also pointed out that “it’s not a crime to dislike the IRS; it’s not even acrime to call them nasty names—curse words, even. We’re allowed to do that inthis country.” But, I asked, “was there any indication in any of that evidencethat I didn’t file because of my attitude? Did I write to the IRS and say, ‘I amstopping filing because I think you’re a bunch of buttheads?’ No. ” Instead, theevidence showed “constant correspondence saying, This is what I found in the lawitself.” Whether I like the IRS has nothing to do with why I didn’t file. “Sowhy did the government make such a big deal of it? Because they didn’t have anyevidence of any crime.” Instead, they found a few tidbits that they hoped wouldmake the jury dislike me.I then gave a few examples of the IRS treating me like a devious villain, whilethe facts showed the opposite: 1) When Ms. Spaulding went to the police becauseI was “coming on strong” (not blindly accepting her idiotic assertions), did Iever threaten her? Nope. 2) When Mr. Judge secretly (and illegally) taped ourmeeting at the restaurant because he thought I might try to bribe him, did I?Nope. 3) When the IRS, under the direction of Agent Pearlman, raided my homebecause they thought I might be hiding something, was I? Nope.Then I pointed out that they couldn’t even be honest about the dollar amounts ofour income, trying to make it sound as if we were making twice what we actuallymade. Why? Because, if you don’t mind being dishonest (and obviously theydon’t), “it might help to sway a jury against the defendant.”“They need you to think that I’m a nasty criminal, but they can’t find anyevidence of that. So they mischaracterize me, which brings me to the word‘anarchist.’ That’s a pretty scary word. Most people don’t really know what itmeans, but we’re pretty sure it’s something scary. Where was there any evidencethat my political beliefs had anything to do with my stopping filing? Therewasn’t any. In fact, there was concrete evidence demonstrating that I was stillfiling and paying when I had these same beliefs. You don’t have to like mybeliefs. You don’t have to like me. But the evidence shows they have nothing todo with why I stopped filing. I already didn’t like the IRS.”I commented that different people have different political beliefs, and that’sfine, “but I think we should all agree on this: our government should not robus.” I then pointed out that the founders of this country were pretty extreme,“talking about forcible, unlawful resistance to tyranny” in the Declaration ofIndependence. “I, on the other hand, am fairly moderate, because I’m talkingabout non-violent, legal resistance—not to the law, but to a fraud.” And Mr.Miller wanted to portray that as a “third world coup.”“What did they prove? That I don’t like the IRS. I plead guilty to not likingthe IRS. What didn’t they prove? They didn’t prove that I was trying to breakthe law, because I wasn’t. And that’s what this case is about.”I then explained how, on the scale between unquestionably guilty andunquestionably innocent, “guilty beyond a reasonable doubt” is pretty darn closeto unquestionably guilty. That’s why (I explained) in many criminal trials allthe defense tries to do is raise a reasonable doubt. But I wanted more. I wantedthe jury to “know darn well that I’ve done exactly what I believe the lawrequires of me.” And since, to justify a guilty verdict, they would have toconclude that I believe my income is taxable, they would also have to concludethat I’ve only been pretending to believe what I had been consistently sayingfor eight years. So where was there any evidence that I was only pretending tobelieve it?When I started to talk about the IRS’s “massive search of my house” and “massiveconfiscation of documents,” Mr. Miller objected. I’m not sure why he wasobjecting, but he was overruled anyway. I pointed out that Agent Pearlman“testified to the confiscation, the amount of e-mails, all the financialdocuments he went through,” and yet there was no evidence that I don’t believewhat I’ve been saying. So, having no evidence of a crime, “they tried a littlesleight of hand” by saying I was “disagreeing” with the law. So I talked about“disagreement” a bit. Just who was really disagreeing with the law here?I touched on the basic points which led me to my legal conclusions:“One is, I believe that some income not exempt by any statute is excluded by theConstitution itself. Why do I believe that? Because 26 CFR 39.22(b)-1 from 1956says that there is some income that is to be excluded because it is, ‘under theConstitution, not taxable by the Federal government.’ Because Article 71,Treasury Decision 3146, which is in evidence, states that ‘neither incomeexempted by statute or fundamental law enter into the computation of netincome.’ Because 26 CFR 1.312-6 of the current regulations, which is inevidence, states that there are three categories of income: the income exempt bystatute, income which is not taxable by the federal government under theConstitution, and finally, income to be included as gross income under Section61.”After doing that from memory, I pointed out the obvious: that’s not whatdisagreeing with the law looks like—that’s what citing the law looks like. ThenI gave an example of what disagreeing with the law really looks like:“When Ms. Spaulding was testifying, I had her read the citation of regulationswhich states as follows: [and this was also recited from memory] ‘Sections861(b) and 863(a) state in general terms how to determine the taxable income ofa taxpayer from sources within the United States after gross income from sourceswithin the United States has been determined.’ 26 CFR 1.861-8. I had her readthat. Then I asked her, ‘Did you use 861(b) and 863(a) to determine my taxableincome from sources within the United States. She said, ‘No, I did not.’ That isdisagreeing with the law.”Then I moved on to the concept of “interpretation”:“In closing, Mr. Miller made some comment about [me thinking I was the] ‘supremeinterpreter’ of the laws of this country. I find that a little funny because youheard about the letter campaigns we did to all these officials asking for theirposition on the specifics—asking them to tell us: Should we use these sections?Did they show our income to be taxable? Why is there this list of non-exemptincome, and I’m not on it? What is exempt under the Constitution? Asking them,and they wouldn’t answer. So don’t tell me I won’t listen to anyone else’sinterpretation. I’ve spent several years trying to get them to give me theirinterpretation.”I also pointed out that making an assertion about the law without giving anysupporting citations (as the government constantly does) is not “interpreting”;it’s “fabricating.”I then explained how the IRS’s own manual, which I cited at my meetings with theIRS, “explains that different kinds of legal documents carry different legalweight. I have noticed that the government has been trying to muddy this issuethroughout the trial.” (I didn’t point out that the judge had helped them to dothat, by refusing my request to give the jury an instruction about this issue.)“Their manual, the IRS’s manual, says that statutes are binding, regulations arebinding, Supreme Court rulings are binding, and lower court rulings are onlybinding on the individual that was in the actual case. And publications are notbinding. The forms are not binding.”So, I explained, what they had sent me, what they called a “notice,” carries nolegal weight. Then they sent another which carried no legal weight.“Now, my father is known for being a rather accomplished mathematician. And I’mnot on par with him, but I can tell you this: it doesn’t matter how many zerosyou add together; you never get any bigger. So if you send me a notice thatcarries zero legal weight, and then another notice that carries zero legalweight, still you’ve got zero legal weight. And if I cite one regulation that isbinding on the IRS, that’s all I need. That is complete legal authority—bindingon them, binding on me, binding on you.”Then I again expressed my heretical beliefs concerning evidence versuscredentials.“What am I supposed to believe, my own eyes or someone with credentials? As youmay recall, they had a summary witness running down the numbers of income andjust the basic financial facts. And at the end, I asked, ‘Do you watch for anykinds of income that might be exempt by statute?’ I don’t remember her exactwords, but basically it was, ‘Well, we usually do, but we didn’t see any of thatinvolved.’ And then I said, ‘Well, do you then subtract the kinds of incomewhich are excluded by the Constitution?’ And you may not remember it—I hope someof you remember the expression on her face, because anybody who was watchingher, that expression would have told them she did not have the foggiest ideathat anything is excluded because of the Constitution. Now, whose opinion shouldI go by: a veteran IRS agent who is provably ignorant of the regulations, or theregulations themselves? I chose to follow the law—not the assertion, not theclaim, not the baseball bat—the law. If a credentialed individual doesn’t haveall the evidence, obviously their conclusions will be, at least, incomplete.”To top off the blasphemy, I added, “If I have the evidence and they don’t, whywould I believe their opinion over mine? ”I then reminded the jury how Ms. Spaulding had harped on Section 61, hadremembered me showing her the cross-reference at the bottom of 61 which pointsto 861 regarding “Income from sources within the United States,” and how sheopenly admitted that they were not using 861 in my case. “That was not aninterpretation; that is called willfully disregarding the law. And I didn’t doit; the IRS agent did it.” I then responded to Miller’s “common sense” tripe:“Now, Mr. Miller mentioned common sense. I mean, common sense says we owe thistax. I’ve looked at a lot of income tax statutes and regulations, and I’ve neverseen one that says common sense determines a taxpayer’s taxable income. The lawis not a guessing game. We have a system of written law, and it is written sothat we can understand what is required of us. Common sense does not imposelegal requirements on us.”Then I called Miller on one of his bald-faced lies:“Now, Mr. Miller made the claim along the lines—and I wrote this down verbatimwhen he was making it—that I was apparently claiming that I was ‘the only personwho ever made the correct interpretation.’ He knows that isn’t true. You heardme testify that I didn’t even discover this thing. Someone else pointed it outto me. I just looked into it and found more and more evidence confirming that itwas, in fact, the case. I’m the only one who thinks this? That’s a bald-facedlie. The courtroom is pretty full today, don’t you think? [The implication,which I was hoping the jury would catch, was that the courtroom was full ofsupporters who believe as I do, showing what a crock it was for Miller to allegethat I was claiming to be the only one who understands the law.] Why would theylie about that? Why would they say he’s the only one who believes it? Because ifI’m the only one, it’s really easy to believe I’m wrong. Well, I’m not the onlyone. It gets a little harder, doesn’t it?”After acknowledging that I am not a lawyer, I asked how the government shouldrespond to questions about the law from us non-lawyer types. “Wouldn’t we allhope they’d respond by going out of their way to help explain it to you? ” Ireminded them of how I had once sent the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue aletter asking about the Pennsylvania sales tax, and whether it applied to ourmedical transcription business. “They sent me back the law showing that I had todo it, and I collected it and paid it every year.”I then described how, if you ask the government a question about the law, a rudepublic servant might say that your question is stupid, but one hopes that hewould also answer it. “But I believe it’s intolerable when the governmentresponds with ‘You’re an idiot’—which is really what it means when they say‘frivolous’: illogical, ridiculous.” Then I pointed out that the governmentactually goes one step further than that. “Their responses amount to ‘You’re anidiot, and you might be fined or prosecuted; we won’t respond to futurecorrespondence’.”Then I revisited the issue of “interpretation”: “They don’t like myinterpretation. They really wish I didn’t have my interpretation.” But regardingthe meetings, the jury “heard Ms. Spaulding and Mr. Judge admit that theycouldn’t answer point-by-point my specific questions. They don’t want me to havemy position. What is their position? Their interpretation was ‘We’re notfamiliar with these sections; we can’t answer your questions; we’ll get back toyou.’ They want me to abandon my interpretation in favor of ‘I don’t know’.” Onthe specifics, they couldn’t even say what they wanted me to believe. “They sureas heck want me to believe my income is taxable, but they don’t know how to getto that conclusion. Well, I’m not going to abandon the results of my researchinto this—thought-out, very thorough analysis—in favor of ‘Oh, I don’t know;just guess.’ That’s not good enough. ”Lastly, I talked about the concept of “obligation,” not just in a legal sense,but in a general sense. What is an obligation?“It’s something you have to do, and it might hurt. It might be unpleasant, butyou have to do it. I am standing here on trial because of an obligation to tellthe truth. And I felt pressure to cave in when the baseball bat was over me.‘Say your income is taxable!’ Why? I read the law. ‘Just shut up and say it’staxable!’ Was there pressure to cave in? Yeah. It’s not really fun being where Iam: on trial, with the United States government trying to put me in jail. Sortof scary. It’s not fun being insulted by the federal government in their pressreleases, being called a criminal, a tax cheater. It’s not fun being called atax cheater by the New York Times, either. It’s not fun being prosecuted. It’snot fun having the federal government trying to put my wife in jail to shut meup.”“I’ve never been fond of bullies. The IRS is a bully, and most of America knowsit. I used to think they were a bully enforcing the law. I didn’t like them backthen. Then I discovered they were a bully enforcing a fraud. I’ve watched themharass a lot of people, and after doing my research, I found myself in aposition—with the position I was in, with the knowledge I had acquired, I feltit was my obligation, my duty to be the little kid who stands up to the bully. Iwas not willing to stand by and watch the bully beat up the other kids when Imight be able to do something about it. And I’ll tell you this: I will not leavea schoolyard for my daughter to grow up in that has a bully in it.”Then I pointed out that the only real question was whether I believe my incometo be taxable. If not, no crime was committed. So, what should the jury concludeabout my beliefs?“Consider this: Could you spend hours upon hours every week—not being paid, mindyou—over a span of several years, researching an issue, only to turn around andshare all the information for free on your web site, if it wasn’t something youbelieved in? Could you spend a year and a half—a year and a half!—making a videoabout something you didn’t believe in, something you’re just pretending tobelieve? I couldn’t do that.”“Ask yourself, would you put your reputation on the line by publicly sayingsomething that you knew would sound absurd to most people, for something youdidn’t believe in? Would you put yourself in harm’s way—would you do things youknew would bring down the wrath of the United States government on your head forsomething you didn’t believe in? Would you subject yourself to what I’m goingthrough for something you didn’t believe in? Would you put everything you haveat risk—would you put your possessions, your reputation, your future in jeopardyfor something you didn’t believe in? Would you put your very freedom in thehands of twelve strangers—would you risk being taken away from your family andfriends and put in a cage for something you didn’t believe in?!”“Neither would I. I put myself through this—I invited this—because I feltmorally obligated to tell the truth and obey the law, knowing that some peoplein positions of power would try to destroy my life if I did so. And they wantyou to believe that I don’t really believe in what I’m saying.”At this point the court’s recording device died, but from my notes I canrecreate, pretty darn close to verbatim, the rest of my closing argument:- - - - - - - beginning of reconstruction of closing argument - - - - - - -The government gets the last word here, and perhaps in his rebuttal, Mr. Millercan explain to you why I would put all this at risk for something I didn’tbelieve in.A week ago, you knew nothing about me. But I’m standing at the end of a paththat did not start last week, or last year. It started eight years ago. Nothaving watched my entire journey, you may find it hard to answer the question:Why am I here? What led me to ask for this? Without knowing the whole story, itwould be hard to understand. You heard a bit about the research I did. What Iintended to show you from the law represents only a fraction of my research.What I was allowed to show you was even less than that.You heard the IRS agents testify about the meetings I had with them. I wanted toplay the actual recordings of those meetings, but you weren’t allowed to hearthem. I wanted to show you the letters I sent to the IRS, and what the IRS sentback, but you weren’t allowed to see them. I wanted to show you those sixquestions which I, and thousands of others, had sent to all sorts of governmentofficials, but you weren’t allowed to see them.(At some point Miller objected to me pointing out all the things that they keptthe jury from seeing, but Judge Baylson let me keep going. For a while.)I wrote a sixty-page report [which I waved in the air in front of them] givingan in-depth explanation of my findings and conclusions, but you weren’t allowedto see it. I spent a year and a half making an 88-minute video [which I alsowaved in the air], and after much debate, I was only allowed to show you fiveminutes of excerpts from it, without the narration. [I put the video down on theprosecution’s table.](At this point the judge chimed in, interrupting me, and tried to justify thefact that he had stopped the jury from seeing all those things.)Who has something to hide here, and why? In my opening statement, I said that Iwas confident that if any twelve Americans were allowed to see all of theevidence, they would never vote to convict. But you weren’t allowed to see allof the evidence. I find it ironic that the people in this room who are to decidemy guilt or innocence are the ones who have seen the least amount of evidence.These people [indicating the audience] have seen all of the evidence, and thesepeople [indicating the prosecutors] stopped you from seeing all of the evidence.Why? Please don’t let them get away with this.All these things I have done over the last eight years have been leading me tothis moment. My path led me to this point, but right here is as far as I can goby myself.The government suggests that I should have gone to one of their own, someone ingovernment, to rule on whether the government has committed fraud. That’s a bitof a conflict of interests, don’t you think? But I invited this, so this couldbe decided—not by any public servant—but by the masters of the government—ahigher authority: the people. And that’s you.I asked the government to prosecute me. They did, and my life is now in yourhands. And I hope you understand the magnitude of the decision you’ll be makinghere. This is not just about whether I’m guilty or not. This is about whether weshould settle for a government which responds to open, honest discussions andinquiries with threats, insults, and intimidation.I asked the government to prosecute me. Now I ask you to acquit me, and let thegovernment know that we the people will not tolerate this abuse any longer.Thank you.- - - - - - - end of reconstruction of closing argument - - - - - - -FINAL LIESAfter my closing, the government was allowed to do a short “rebuttal” closing,during which the court’s recording system came back to life. Floyd Miller tookthe opportunity to throw in several new lies (some of which were lost due to theproblems in the recording equipment) to make sure the innocent wouldn’t gounpunished. One such comment was his stupid claim that we can’t each interpretthe law for ourselves, because that would be the definition of anarchy. Nevermind that our entire system of written, public law was intended to be accessibleand understandable to the common folk. Like some medieval, authoritarian highpriest, he was condemning me for thinking that the peasantry ought to be able toread the law for themselves.Miller: “The best evidence that you can have is a person’s own words, his ownstatements. And here’s what he says: ‘What the law says has no bearing on what Ithink. To put it bluntly, I’m an anarchist.”One irrelevant slander; one lie. Way to go, Floyd-baby. What I actually said—andhe knew it, because he was holding the quote in front of him—was that “what thelaw says has no bearing on what I think is right and wrong.” The statement wasabout morality and political philosophy, and had nothing to do with the 861issue. And what happened to my political philosophy being irrelevant andoff-limits, as Judge Baylson had said before? The government had too much tolose to be bothered with the rules, the law, or the truth.Miller then covered the elements of the alleged crime, admitting that the firsttwo were not in question: we had received income, and we hadn’t filed. The otherelement—the only one in question—was the issue of “willfulness.” Once again, helisted the things he wanted the jury to consider in deciding whether I committeda “willful” tax crime: the fact that I used to file (before hearing about 861);“the amount of income that’s involved”; my “sophistication,” whatever thatmeans; and the legally worthless “notices” they had sent me.Miller: “Actual notice that was given to the defendant that his story—and I willnot dignify it by calling it a claim—his story that his income wasconstitutionally exempt from taxation—he received innumerable notices from theInternal Revenue Service that his position was wrong.”He went through some of the IRS boneheads who had asserted that I owed the tax,and he mentioned that two lower court judges “told Mr. Rose that the positionwas nonsensical—that’s right, it was nonsensical; it didn’t make sense.”(Actually, only one judge used that word.) Then he pointed out that anotherperson was convicted, in a trial at which I testified, and he wanted the jury totake that into account in determining whether I was guilty. And last but notleast, he wanted the jury to consider my anti-IRS “attitude.”Miller: “So again, this is a case about a man who wouldn’t take ‘no’ for ananswer. He wouldn’t take ‘no’ for an answer because, not just paying his fairshare, he didn’t want to pay any taxes, not at all, federal or state.”Chalk up another bald-faced lie for Floyd-baby. I had already testified aboutpaying property taxes, paying sales taxes, and even collecting and paying salestaxes from our transcription business, after being shown the law requiring it.He mentioned that I had stopped filing Pennsylvania income taxes for similarreasons, because it shows Pennsylvania income to be taxable only fornon-residents, about which he commented, “How nonsensical can he be? ”Then he said that my “Taxable Income” report—which the jury wasn’t allowed tosee—was just like “the old traveling salesman in the Western movies who wasselling a tonic that was designed to cure anything.” Then he explained how therewas a link from one web site to another, “so if a person looked at one web siteand they became intrigued by the tonic, they maybe use their computer and clickonto the next web site, and of course, buy the videotape.” He didn’t mentionthat all of the info in the video is in the report, which the web sites plainlystate, nor did he mention that the report was free online for four years beforethe video even existed. And since he said these things in the “rebuttal,” aftermy closing, he knew I would have no opportunity to rebut his lies.Then he added, about the video, in his most condescending tone of voice, “it’s aslick production—oh yes, it is—but it’s nonsensical, just like the judge inHarrisburg and in Tampa and the jury in Texas decided.” So, just as he had donewith the report, he kept the jury from seeing it, and then bashed it andmischaracterized it. By the way, the judge in Tampa did not use the word“nonsensical,” and the jury in Texas never saw the video or the report. Butlet’s not let facts get in the way of prosecuting the innocent.Then Miller again said how, if the jury considered the evidence, he wasconfident that the jury would vote to convict. And so the trial ended.JURY INSTRUCTIONSAfter a twenty-minute break, Judge Baylson gave a dull, mumbled, barely audibleset of jury instructions, much of which was just template stuff included in anytrial, about evidence, burden of proof, direct and circumstantial evidence,credibility of witnesses, and so on. When it came to instructing the jury onfederal tax law, his instructions included the following: “Federal income taxesare levied upon income derived for services of every kind in whatever form paid... The term ‘gross income’ refers to all income from whatever source, unless itis specifically excluded by law.” Then he explained that one gets from “grossincome” to “taxable income” by subtracting allowable expenses and otherdeductions.There are two options: Judge Baylson intentionally lied about the law, or he isguilty of gross negligence. My motions concerning jury instructions quoteddirectly from income tax regulations, past and present, saying that in additionto statutory exemptions, some other income is also not taxable—it does notlegally constitute “gross income”—because of the constitutional limits uponCongress’ taxing power. But he refused to tell the jury that, and instead echoedthe popular lie that all income is taxable unless the tax code specificallyexempts it.He then got into the three elements of the crime, the last ofwhich—”willfulness”—was really the only one in question. And on that issue, theinstructions were, for the most part, accurate and thorough, and included thefollowing:“Willfulness is an essential element of the crime of failure to file an incometax return. The term ‘willfully,’ used in connection with these offenses, meansdoing a voluntary, deliberate and intentional act, knowing the conduct wasunlawful and intending to do something that the law forbade. That is, to findthat Larken Rose acted willfully, you must find that the evidence proved beyonda reasonable doubt that Larken Rose acted or failed to act with a purpose todisobey or disregard the law.”He went on to explain that there was no willfulness, and no crime, if I “actedthrough negligence, even gross negligence, inadvertence, accident or mistake, ordue to a good faith misunderstanding of the requirements of the law.” But thenhe added this, which, though true, was probably misunderstood by the jury:“However, mere disagreement with the law, in and of itself, does not constitutea good faith misunderstanding of the requirements of the law, because it is theduty of all persons to obey the law whether or not they agree with it.” Rememberthe two kinds of “disagreement”: thinking the law is invalid, unconstitutional,or unfair is not a valid defense; having an honestly held legal position whichdoesn’t actually “agree” with the law itself is a valid defense. (In this case,I had neither: my “belief” is exactly what the law says, not a“misunderstanding” of it, but since I wasn’t allowed to argue that myconclusions are actually correct, I had to focus on the “willfulness” issue.)But any confusion among the jurors should have been cleared up by this:“If the defendant had a subjective good faith belief, no matter howunreasonable, that the law did not require him to file a tax return, he did notact willfully. A good faith misunderstanding of the requirements of the law canbe based upon information a person received from other individuals, a person’sinterpretation of case law—meaning court cases—as well as statutes andregulations, no matter how unreasonable a person’s interpretation seems to you.”(Unfortunately, for all of the above instructions regarding “willfulness,” JudgeBaylson was sitting back from the microphone and mumbling, making it almostimpossible to hear. Some theorize that this was on purpose, though I’m willingto chalk it up to good old-fashioned laziness and negligence. I really shouldhave objected at the time, but I was stupid enough to think that, since the jurywould have printouts of all these instructions with them during theirdeliberations, there wouldn’t be a problem.)Then, in explaining how the jury was supposed to determine what I believe—my“state of mind”—Judge Baylson said they could consider things I said, things Idid, how I acted, and so on. When it came to specifically listing what thingsthey could consider, however, the judge gave what was basically a list of thegovernment’s exhibits, such as court rulings “rejecting [my] interpretation ofthe tax law,” as well as “authoritative rulings of the Internal Revenue Serviceor of any contents of the personal income tax return forms and accompanyinginstructions that stated that his income was required to be reported to theInternal Revenue Service.”Once again, the judge was lying to the jury about the law. None of what thegovernment presented via form letters, publications, or letters frompaper-pushers carried any legal weight whatsoever. Again, I had asked the courtto instruct the jury on the legal weight of different documents, which Baylsonrefused to do (because it would demolish the government’s case). Instead, heimplied that those form letters and other garbage constitute “authoritativerulings,” when he knows damn well that they don’t.When it came to the actual legal issue, Judge Baylson did just what other lowercourt judges and IRS bureaucrats do: he asserted that my conclusions wereincorrect, without giving a shred of legal support for that claim. Then he againharped on how I could have sued the IRS, but didn’t, telling the jurors thatthey could consider that when deciding the issue of “willfulness.”At least he made it clear that the government had the burden of proof, and thatit had to be beyond a reasonable doubt: “You may not find a defendant guiltybased on mere speculation, suspicion or probability of guilt; it must be proofbeyond a reasonable doubt.” Near the end of his instructions, he also said this:“This is a quest for truth as to the facts. That’s what a trial is. It’s not abattle of wits, it’s not a contest of salesmanship, it’s not a contest ofpersonality. The only triumph in any case is whether or not the truth hastriumphed. If it has, then justice has been done. If not, justice would not havebeen done.”And it wasn’t, thanks to the government and the judge suppressing the truth atevery turn.HURRY AND WAITAfter the instructions, the jury went off to deliberate. There was a briefhearing about Tessa’s case, which was being delayed so she could retain counsel.Then my wife and I, and a bunch of supporters, wandered downstairs and hungaround in the lobby. My assistance of counsel, Larry Becraft, actually had tocatch a flight out before the verdict came back.The jury “deliberated” for about 90 minutes, including lunch. (I suspect theyspent more time deliberating what to have for lunch than they did deliberatingthe case.) Then we got the call saying the jury had reached a verdict, andtelling us to come back upstairs for the reading of the verdict.THE VERDICTMonths and months of preparing for this battle, years of fighting this fight,and it all came down to one second. I will always remember that one second ofwaiting, after the jury foreman was asked to pronounce the verdict. I must havebeen standing at the time, but I don’t remember that. I had my eyes closed,waiting for the ax to fall. When it did, a flood of thoughts and emotions hitme.“Guilty.”It didn’t feel real. It was like watching a TV show. Then I felt the hit, likebeing punched in the stomach. Later, at least half a dozen people described tome their reactions, when they heard the verdict, in exactly the same way: “Itfelt like being punched in the stomach.”Guilty.Who the hell were these damn sheep to judge me? Where were they while I wasdriving to law libraries, rummaging through countless law books, and digging outthe truth? The jury foreman looked like the quintessential dumbass conformistcouch potato. Who were these apathetic sheep to tell me that I’m the bad guy?!Guilty.These were the very people I was trying to defend from the government fraud andextortion, and the bastards had stabbed me in the back for it. My wife and I hadput our necks on the line for these people, and this is how the damn Americanpeople repaid us.Guilty.By any sane measure we had won, hands down. It was like scoring a dozentouchdowns in a football game, only to have the referee declare that the otherteam, which hadn’t scored a single point, was the winner. The problem wasn’tthat we lost; it was that the jury was too stupid to realize that we won.Guilty.How on earth could they have concluded—especially “beyond a reasonabledoubt”—that I don’t believe what I have been saying for eight years? Did theypay any attention to the evidence? Did they even try to understand what crimewas being alleged? Or did their supposed deliberations consist of “Him not pay,him bad”?Guilty.I failed. All of the effort, wasted. All of the stress and trouble for nothing.All I had accomplished was to give the federal tyrants another trophy head tohang on their wall. Eight years of my life, and this was the result: a giantfailure.Guilty.A combination of fate and effort had given me a unique opportunity to accomplishsomething good, to actually make a dent in injustice, and in a split second itall evaporated. Five minutes of actual thought out of those twelve damn sheep,followed by a sane verdict, and the “income tax” fraud would have been dealt astunning blow, from which it might never have recovered. What could have been!But wasn’t.Guilty.What have I done? What will this do to my family? I would almost certainly go toprison. For how long? My wife wouldn’t have her husband, my little girl wouldn’thave her daddy. All I had accomplished was to hurt the people I love the most. Ihad brought pain and suffering on my family. Nothing hurt more than knowingthat. No punishment could be worse.Guilty.I could have chosen a conformist’s life. I could have spent all those yearsmaking money. We could have had an easy life, coasting through with the rest ofthe herd. Instead, we put it all on the line, as a matter of principle. And welost.Guilty.Doing the right thing is pointless. Standing up to injustice is futile. Tellingthe truth does no good. The righteous cause accomplishes nothing. All theeffort, wasted. The bad guys win, with the help of their victims. The Americanpeople don’t want freedom, and they don’t want the truth. All they want is theirpredictable, familiar, comfortable cage. They cheer for nonconformist heroes inthe movies, but when it comes to real life, they race to see who can be first tocondemn and attack anyone who isn’t like them.Guilty.To hell with this country. The sorry-ass American public deserves whateveroppression their government can dish out. If being idiotic slaves is good enoughfor them, then they deserve whatever oppression and suffering is imposed uponthem. I’m sorry I ever tried to defend the public from the fraud.It wasn’t worth it.Guilty.So now I’m to be a convict—a nasty criminal who needs to pay his “debt tosociety.” I get to spend some of my life in prison, as the price for trying toprotect a society of dumb-asses from their own lying, thieving government. ThenI get to bear the stigma of having done jail time, along with the gossip andwhispered disapproval from holier-than-thou conformists, who are justself-righteous and delusional enough to feel disdain and reproach towards thefew people who try to achieve freedom and justice. To hell with this country.I’d like to say that those emotions wore off in a few hours, but they didn’t.I’d like to say they’ve worn off in the year since my conviction. They haven’t.I despise what this country has become, and I despise most of the people in it.They were born to be slaves, they are determined to be slaves, and it’s a pitythat the freedom won a couple hundred years ago has been wasted on suchapathetic sheep. For all I care, they can be sheered, slaughtered, and forgottenforever, for accepting their own enslavement without ever lifting a pinky toresist. Or, as Benjamin Franklin put it, those who would choose security overfreedom deserve neither. Amen, Brother Ben.Incidentally, I don’t want to think and feel these things. I don’t enjoy being abitter, resentful doomsayer. I want to believe that the American people still,somewhere in the recesses of their minds, care about freedom. I just see noevidence of that. Oh, there certainly are some people who still believe in allof that “land of the free and home of the brave” stuff, and it’s those people—apathetically small minority of the country—who I sympathize with, and wantfreedom for. But as for the rest, they can go wallow in their own cluelessnessuntil their pointless lives of enslavement slip away.“It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere.” [Voltaire]No kidding.I was later told that immediately after the verdict, Agent Pearlman turned tothe courtroom gallery and said, “Let that be a lesson to all of you.”(Thankfully, I didn’t hear it at the time.)Yes, indeed. Let that be a lesson to you: IRS agents will commit perjury,federal prosecutors will lie, cheat and steal to convict innocent people,federal judges will give their rubber-stamp approval to the whole charade, andthe American people will be too damned stupid to do anything about it. Quite alesson. Quite a lesson, indeed.While I missed Pearlman’s smug and condescending little dig, I did note, veryshortly after the verdict, David Cay “Goebbels” Johnston—the IRS mouthpiece whopretends to be a reporter for the New York Times—coming over to me with a biggrin on his face, obviously delighting in my suffering. (What a swell guy.) Heasked for a comment. The only comment which came to mind, I kept to myself. Mywife then chased him away.THE AFTERMATHThe minutes, and then hours, and then days, and then weeks that followed werelargely a surreal blur. And since reporting all of the details would be bothanti-climactic and pointless, I’ll cover just a few noteworthy things:After a brief threat that he could order me to be taken into custodyimmediately, saying he found my anti-authoritarian attitudes displayed in theexhibits “very, very troublesome,” Judge Baylson ordered me put on homeconfinement until sentencing, which he set for mid-November. He also said thathe believed I had been given a fair trial. Yeah, right. He then took theopportunity to lecture me some more:“Now, I want to say one other thing to you, and I urge you not to respond. Justlisten carefully. You’ve been found guilty by a jury of your peers. I know howstrongly you have opinions about this, and you’re entitled to have your opinionsuntil the day you die, and I don’t want to take that away from you one iota.”Bullpoop, Mr. Baylson. Showing how much he cares about my opinions, he latermade it clear that if I didn’t take down my web sites, he would make thesentence worse. (And once again, he basically acknowledged that I believed inwhat I was doing, which means I committed no crime.)“If you will reconsider your position, and you will file the tax returns for theyears you have not done so, and enter into an agreement with the InternalRevenue Service for payment of back taxes due, penalties and interest, I willtake that very much in your favor at the time of sentencing. If you refuse to doso, that will also be a factor at the time of sentencing.”Since signing a return you believe to be inaccurate is a felony, under 26 USC §7206, the judge was coercing me into committing several felonies, by signingreturns swearing that I thought I owed the tax, in order to limit the degree ofpunishment I would receive for the misdemeanor I hadn’t committed. What a greatjudicial system.So the “pre-trial services” guy put an ankle bracelet on me, drove me home, andset up the monitoring gadget. On the way he said he had never before seen one oftheir courtrooms that full of spectators. I commented on how standing up for thetruth in this country isn’t worth it.That night I had to try not to cry while telling my eight-year-old daughter whathad happened: that I told the truth, that I tried to stop the IRS from robbingpeople, but that the jury decided that I was the bad guy. So I’d be going tojail. Seeing me trying not to cry (without much success), her tears startedflowing, and she asked, in all sincerity, “Will I ever see you again? ” I willnever forget those words as long as I live. Of course, I immediately assured herthat it wasn’t forever, that I wasn’t going away right away, and that she couldcome visit me when I was inside. But the injustice of the whole thing never hitme as hard or hurt as much as it did at that moment.I immediately hired an attorney, and a very good one, Peter Goldberger, tohandle sentencing (and eventually to handle my appeal). For a couple of months,I was imprisoned in my house all the time. Then Mr. Goldberger persuaded Baylsonto change the conditions so I could come out of my cage during the day, but Istill had to be home at night. (What am I, a werewolf?)THE SPIN GOES ONThe government, of course, loves to publicly display the proverbial corpses ofits victims, to instill terror in the hearts of other would-be nonconformists.In the DOJ’s “press release” about my conviction, Patrick Meehan, the U.S.Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, was quoted as saying this:“The conduct of Larken Rose is an affront to all taxpayers who voluntarily paythe taxes required by law.” That from the same jackass who completely ignored mywritten offer to put myself out of business and voluntarily donate tens ofthousands of dollars to the U.S. Treasury, if they would just let me ask theirlawyers some questions about how to comply with the law.But that wasn’t the only letter I had sent to Mr. Meehan. This might be a goodtime for a quick flashback, to include another letter I sent, to show what anasty, low-down, sneaky tax cheater I really am. That letter, which I sent toMr. Meehan’s office long before I was ever indicted, read as follows. (Though itis a bit redundant to do so, and though it’s a bit long, I am leaving in theexplanation of my legal conclusions, both to accurately show what my letters tothose in government were like, and to give the reader a final “refresher course”overview of the issue.)October 28, 2003Patrick L. Meehan (U.S. Attorney)615 Chestnut Street, Suite 1250Philadelphia, PA 19106Dear Mr. Meehan,I just learned, via the Freedom Of Information Act, that on 2/24/03 the TaxDivision of the DOJ sent you a letter instructing you to initiate a grand juryinvestigation of me. I am assuming that is now well underway, though I havenever received a “target letter.”Helping Your InvestigationAs you know (because you authorized it), the IRS executed an armed invasion ofmy home on May 6th of this year, under the guise of a “search warrant,” which Ipresume is part of your joint“investigation” of me. I find myself wondering, what exactly does the governmentfeel the need to “investigate” in this case? What do you find secretive or hardto discover about my situation or my actions? For six years now I have beenmaking it abundantly clear exactly what I am doing, and why. Not only have Isent several letters to the DOJ and the IRS telling them what I am doing, andwhy, but I have also run several newspaper ads explaining my situation. Now Iwill make my situation known, yet again, to help your “investigation”:My wife and I have not filed a federal income tax return for 1997 or anysubsequent year, nor have we made any payments to the IRS for those years. Wereceive enough income that, if such income had been subject to the tax, bothreturns and payments would have been required by law.(We also filed claims for refund for 1994, 1995 and 1996, to recover paymentspreviously made based on the false assumption that our income in those years wastaxable.)Does any part of that seem so secretive or mysterious to you that it requires“investigating”? (Notice below that I have made this letter into a swornaffidavit.) The reason we stopped filing and paying is not because we are“protesting” any law, or because we refuse to pay what we owe. On the contrary,it is because we have concluded, based on what the law itself says, that ourincome is not subject to the federal income tax (as explained below), and thatwhat we legally owe is therefore zero. The income we receive continues to bereported to the IRS (on 1099 forms), and we have not tried to stop that fromhappening. I have been pointing out to the government for several years now thatI have income and that I do not file. What other facts could you possibly need?Why the armed invasion of my home? Why the secret “investigation”? Does mybehavior give you the impression that I have something to hide?The issue here is not one of facts, but one of law: whether my income is subjectto the U.S. federal income tax or not. Despite “conventional wisdom” to thecontrary, I know it is not, and have made my conclusions known to the governmentfor years, going out of my way to help the government “investigate” myconclusions. I have sent a couple hundred free copies of my Theft by Deceptionvideo to various government officials, and I am enclosing a copy with thisletter as well. I have sent letters to about every relevant government officialI can think of, spelling out my conclusions and the citations supporting them,over and over again.If you were hoping that the IRS’ little fishing expedition (a.k.a. unreasonablesearch and seizure) would dig up some secret assets, or some attempt by myselfto hide something, by now you should know that it did not. I have the mostboring, traceable, predictable, and straight-forward financial situation youcould hope for. I apologize if I do not do anything that you can use to portrayme as some nasty, sneaky criminal. The government, on the other hand, isconstantly sneaking around, lying, cheating and terrorizing the American public.You are the one doing everything in secret and behind closed doors. Frankly,your behavior makes you look like a bunch of criminals. I really wonder if youcan look at yourself in the mirror and say, with a straight face, that you areon the side of “justice.”The federal government has also shown Gestapo-like behavior in dealing with mybusiness partner, Tom Clayton, M.D., down in Texas, whose “sin” was toselflessly donate tens of thousands of dollars of his own money, without anyagreement to even be paid back, so that the Theft by Deception video could bemade, to educate the public about this colossal fraud committed by the federalgovernment. One Department of Justice official admitted (off the record, ofcourse) that the DOJ is trying to prevent distribution of that perfectly legalvideo, and another admitted that Dr. Clayton’s home was raided because he fundedthe video. That, together with the wholesale theft of videos from both of ourhomes, shows that the IRS and the DOJ are the law-breakers in this situation.(The Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear that confiscating FirstAmendment materials under the guise of a “search warrant” is illegal. See FortWayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46 (1989).)My situation, my actions, and the reasons for those actions are all an openbook, which many thousands of Americans are now watching with interest. I, mywife, and my six-year-old daughter had to endure an armed invasion of our home,done at your request. For what? What more could you possibly want to know? Whatelse could I have done to be any more open and public about my actions and mybeliefs? From where I stand, you in government do not seem interested inenforcing the law, or conducting any legitimate investigation; you instead seemintent on vilifying, harassing, intimidating, and otherwise punishing anyone whodisagrees with you. (Ironically, you therefore fit well within the definition ofa “terrorist” organization.)My PositionOnce again, I will state, for the record, the legal basis for my conclusions andmy actions:1) I believe that I should use the rules of 26 USC § 861(b) and 26 CFR § 1.861-8to determine my taxable domestic income.I believe this, because the government’s own law books say so. For example, theregulations at 26 CFR § 1.861-8, entitled “Computation of taxable income fromsources within the United States and from other sources and activities,” beginby stating quite clearly that Sections 861(b) and 863(a) describe in generalterms “how to determine taxable income of a taxpayer from sources within theUnited States” after domestic “gross income” has been determined. (It thenstates that 862(b) and 863(a) tell how to determine taxable foreign income.)This is explained in more detail at 26 CFR § 1.861-1, which says that 26 USC §861(b) and 26 CFR § 1.861-8 (and sometimes 863 and its regulations) are to beused to determine one’s “taxable income from sources within the United States.”In addition, 26 CFR § 1.863-1(c) states that one’s taxable income “from sourceswithin or without the United States” is to be determined under the rules of 26CFR § 1.861-8 and following. (See also Treasury Decision 6258.) 333Those citations are legally binding on me and the IRS. I am not at liberty todisregard them, even if I wanted to (and I do not want to). The IRS’ own lawbooks require me to use those sections to determine my “taxable income fromsources within the United States,” so I do.2) I believe that my income, as a U.S. citizen living and working exclusively inthe 50 states, is not taxable under 26 USC § 861(b) and 26 CFR § 1.861-8.Again, I believe this because the government’s own law books prove it. While thegeneral language of 26 USC § 861 merely describes what types of income areconsidered domestic income (“income from sources within the United States”),including domestic wages (which I receive), both the current regulations andover 80 years of predecessor statutes and regulations make it clear that suchdomestic income is taxable only when it derives from the specific types ofcommerce enumerated in what is now Subchapter N of the Internal Revenue Code.For example, Section 217 of the Revenue Act of 1921 (statutory predecessor ofSection 861) obviously meant that those types of domestic income (includingdomestic wages) were taxable for nonresident aliens, and for certain Americanswho received most of their income from federal possessions (such as Guam orPuerto Rico). Section 217 was obviously not saying that such income was taxablefor all U.S. citizens. After 1928, when Section 217 became Section 119, and nolonger mentioned those specific types of commerce, the related regulationscontinued to show that domestic income (including domestic wages) was still onlytaxable when received by those engaged in certain types of commerce (e.g.,foreigners doing business in the U.S., or Americans doing business in federalpossessions). See sections 29.119-1, 29.119-2, 29.119-9, 29.119-10 from“Regulations 111” (1945).The current regulations, while unnecessarily complex and convoluted (by design),still show that one can only have “taxable income from sources within the UnitedStates” if he has a “statutory grouping” of gross income, meaning income fromone of the specific types of commerce described in the “operative sections”throughout Subchapter N. (See 26 CFR §§ 1.861-8(a)(1), 1.861-8(a)(4),1.861-8(f)(1).) Those “specific sources or activities” which generate taxable“statutory groupings” of gross income include certain foreign income of U.S.citizens (1.861-8(f)(1)(i)), U.S.-source income of nonresident aliens andforeign corporations (1.861-8(f)(1)(iv)), income related to federal possessions(1.861-8(f)(1)(vi)), and several other international or foreign matters.However, in keeping with 80 years of predecessor statutes and regulations, thelist does not include the income that the average U.S. citizen receives fromworking within the 50 states (e.g., the income my wife and I receive).If there is a particular portion of the law that describes when domestic incomeis taxable, and that portion of the law does not show my domestic income to betaxable, is it not reasonable for me to conclude that my income is not taxable?According to Black’s Law Dictionary (6th Edition), the doctrine of “inclusiounius est exclusio alterius” dictates that “where law expressly describes aparticular situation to which it shall apply, an irrefutable inference must bedrawn that what is omitted or excluded was intended to be omitted or excluded.”The Supreme Court also says that when reading tax laws, we are not to assume thetax applies to matters “not specifically pointed out” (Gould v. Gould, 245 U.S.151 (1917)). So, as instructed, I assume that the law specifies what it appliesto, and applies to nothing other than what is specified. I therefore mustconclude that my income is not subject to the federal income tax. (As you know,“conventional wisdom” does not impose legal requirements; only the law itselfdoes. If the law itself does not tax my income, “conventional wisdom” isirrelevant.)In addition to the explanation above, there is yet another, independent way,using the government’s own law books, of proving that my income is not subjectto the tax:3) It is my belief that the “items” of income listed in the general statutorydefinition of “gross income” are not always taxable, but are sometimes excludedfrom tax.The income tax statutes have always included a very broad general definition of“gross income” (e.g., 26 USC § 61) which lists the more common “items” of incomewhich may be taxable, such as compensation, business income, interest, rents,royalties, etc. However, in addition to some income being specifically exemptedby statute, the older regulations defining “gross income” made it plain thatother types of income were also excluded from tax (notwithstanding the broadgeneral definitions) because those types of income were, “under theConstitution, not taxable by the federal government” (26 CFR § 39.22(b)-1(1956)). The older regulations defining “net income” (now “taxable income”) alsosaid that income exempted by statute or by “fundamental law” (the Constitution)was exempt from tax, and “should not be included in the return of income”(Treasury Decision 3640).Current law proves the same thing. Again, 26 USC § 61 gives a very broad generaldefinition of “gross income,” and lists some common “items” of income(compensation, interest, dividends, etc.). The regulations state that those“items” make up “classes of gross income” (26 CFR § 1.861-8(a)(3)), and thatsuch “classes of gross income” are not always taxable, but are in some casesexcluded for federal income tax purposes (26 CFR § 1.861-8(b)(1)).(Many other citations show that it is a mistake to rely only on the generaldefinitions of “gross income” and “taxable income” (26 USC §§ 61, 63) todetermine what is taxable. For example, under “gross income,” “deductions,” and“taxable income,” the indexes of the United States Code contain entriesdirecting the reader to Section 861 regarding income from sources within theUnited States. Similarly, in the USCS printing of the Code, and in the USC andUSCA printings up until 2001, cross-references under Section 61 refer to Section861 regarding “Income from sources within the United States.” This is probablybased on Section 22(g) of the 1939 Code, where, under the section generallydefining “gross income,” the reader was referred to Section 119 (predecessor ofthe current 861 and following) regarding “Computation of gross income fromsources within and without the United States.”)4) It is my belief that the income tax laws, past and present, describe thetypes of commerce from which the “items” of income must derive in order to betaxable, and that the taxable types of commerce all relate in some way tointernational trade.In addition to saying that some income was exempt from tax due to theConstitution itself, the older regulations defining “gross income” clearly saidthat income which U.S. citizens receive from foreign commerce “must be includedin their gross income” (e.g., 26 CFR § 39.22(a)-1 (1956)). (This is in keepingwith Peck v. Lowe (247 U.S. 165 (1918)), which stated that Congress could“undoubtedly” impose an income tax on the foreign income of Americans.) Thoseregulations also mentioned income which certain foreigners receive from doingbusiness in the U.S., and the income of people doing business in federalpossessions, but they did not mention the domestic income of the average U.S.citizen.The current regulations agree. After saying that the “items” of income listed inSection 61 are not always taxable, they direct the reader to 26 CFR §1.861-8T(d)(2), which gives a list of those types of commerce, income from whichis not exempt (i.e., which is taxable). Again, that list includes certainforeign income of U.S. citizens, the domestic income of certain foreigners, andcertain income of international sales corporations and possessions corporations.Again, conspicuously absent from the list is the domestic income of the averageAmerican. (Interestingly, even the instruction booklet for the Form 1040 saysthat if you are a U.S. citizen, you must report income you receive from outsideof the United States, but does not say the same about a citizen’s domesticincome.)Again, under the principles mentioned above, if the regulations state that the“items” of income are sometimes excluded, and then give a list of the types ofcommerce, income from which is not excluded (i.e., income from which istaxable), one should not assume that the tax covers matters “not specificallypointed out.” On the contrary, an “irrefutable inference must be drawn” thatwhat is not listed is exempt. Because the regulations (past and present)specifically state that income from certain international and foreign commercemust be included as taxable “gross income,” but do not say the same of purelydomestic income, it follows that when income derives from purely domesticcommerce, it is not subject to the tax.(Again, points 3 and 4 independently prove the same thing that points 1 and 2prove.)Numerous additional citations support my conclusions, some of which areaddressed in the enclosed video. For brevity I did not include all suchcitations here, but they can be found in my “Taxable Income” report, which canbe downloaded at http://www.taxableincome.net.Government ResponseMany in government, probably including yourself, would like me to change mymind, and decide that my income is taxable after all. So what has the governmentpresented that would give me (or anyone else) any reason at all to doubt theabove conclusions?1) In between insults and veiled threats, several government form letters, whichthe IRS admits carry no legal weight, briefly touch on Section 861, mainlymischaracterizing the issue, often making accurate but misleading statements(such as saying that the “source rules” in 861 and 862 do not exclude thedomestic income of Americans), while carefully avoiding addressing the specifics(such as the enclosed questions). Should a legally worthless form letter thatevades the issue have convinced me that my conclusions are incorrect?2) Various IRS and DOJ “press releases” (which also carry no legal authority)have slandered, insulted, and accused anyone who brings up the issue as being a“tax cheater,” a “scam artist,” or a “tax protestor,” and warned of possiblecivil or criminal penalties (all while avoiding the substance of the issue, ofcourse). Should someone calling me names and threatening me have convinced methat my conclusions are incorrect?3) The IRS and DOJ have celebrated the fact that they have (by grosslymisapplying 26 USC § 6700) silenced several groups and individuals via courtinjunctions from talking about this issue. Again, the substance of the issue wasusually evaded, and often in their haste to silence those individuals, both theDOJ and the presiding judges made provably false claims about the law. Shouldblatant censorship have convinced me that my conclusions are incorrect?4) The “Tax Court” (a glorified administrative board, whose “rulings” are notbinding on the public, the IRS, or any real court) has repeatedly insulted andfined anyone who brings up the issue there. Such “rulings” always evade thespecifics of the issue, and make numerous provably false assertions. Shouldnon-binding assertions, or efforts to fine someone for mentioning a certainsection of law, have convinced me that my conclusions are incorrect?5) When over one hundred letters were sent to Barbara Felker, an IRS attorneyspecializing in Section 861 and its regulations; when over one hundred letterswere sent to Jim South, one of the IRS employees orchestrating the IRS’snationwide response to those who mention 861; when over one hundred letters weresent to Congressmen across the country, with copies to Charles Rossotti, formerIRS Commissioner; when over six hundred letters were sent to Pam Olson,Assistant Secretary of the Treasury (Tax Policy); when well over one thousandletters were sent to Mark Everson, IRS Commissioner, and well over one thousandletters were sent to John Snow, Secretary of the Treasury, all asking a fewspecific questions (much like those enclosed) about how to properly determineone’s taxable income, none of those people answered any of the questions. Isthat why I should doubt my conclusions?Or maybe it was because the local IRS employees admitted to being unfamiliarwith the citations I showed them, and admitted that they were not sure of theirown position on the specifics. Or maybe I should have changed my mind afterwatching (in person) half a dozen other employees at different offices fumblingaround, unable to decide what their own position was. The entire IRS, top tobottom, for over five years, has adamantly refused to even decide whether Ishould be referring to Section 861 and its regulations or not.Has it never occurred to anyone in government that maybe they should justprovide me with legally-binding citations of law which disprove my conclusions?The problem is that they cannot do it, because my conclusions are correct, andthe law agrees with me. That is why, instead of behaving like law administratorsand enforcers, they behave like extortionists, constantly resorting toharassment, insults, threats, censorship, persecution, and terrorism of anyonewho mentions this issue. If you really wish to change my mind, you will need touse evidence and logic. Terrorism is not going to do it.Regarding the Grand JuryIn keeping with the government’s shady tactics, I suspect that your pitch to anygrand jury will omit a lot of “inconvenient” evidence about what I have beendoing and saying. You can probably “spin” your way into getting a grand juryindictment, especially if they never hear from me. (I hear it is quite easy tohave just about anyone indicted for just about anything.)I hereby request that the enclosed copy of this letter, and one of the twoenclosed copies of my Theft by Deception video, be given to the grand jury (ifany) currently investigating this matter. If there is a pending grand juryinvestigation, I also hereby request an opportunity to testify in person beforethat grand jury as soon as possible.When someone does exactly what the government’s own law books require him to do,and is completely open and public about his actions and the reasons for thoseactions, do you really think the proper response is to send armed agents toinvade his home, and to secretly “investigate” him, as a first step towardspossibly trying to put him in prison? You think the way to prove me wrong is notby honestly addressing the issue (which the entire government seems scared todeath of doing), but by trying to have me thrown in jail for believing what Isee with my own eyes? I simply cannot comprehend a sane person, particularly anAmerican, thinking that way. But if being put on trial is what I have to gothrough to publicly expose this monumental fraud, then that is what I will do.To choose any other path would be to betray my family, my country, and thetruth, and that is something I will not do.As for what other people think, I know several thousand people who would like toknow the truth, but who do not want federal storm-troopers terrorizing them. So,just to make sure that they are obeying the law, and doing what Patrick Meehan,U.S. Attorney thinks they should be doing (lest they incur your wrath), I amsuggesting to them that they all ask you the questions about how they shoulddetermine what they owe. If you are qualified to “investigate” and prosecutepeople for breaking the law, then surely you must be able to tell people how toobey the law (i.e., how to determine their taxable income).So, Mr. Meehan, are you someone who enforces the law, or are you just a hiredthug? Your response (or lack of response) will soon answer that. If you do notunderstand how the tax laws work, you have no business trying to enforce them.With that in mind, I hereby request that you provide me with direct, writtenanswers to the enclosed six questions concerning the proper way to determine mytaxable domestic income.Sincerely,Larken Rose[home address redacted]By signing above, I hereby swear, under penalties of perjury, that everythingcontained herein is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.cc:Eileen O’ConnorD.O.J. Tax Division, Room 5824600 E Street, NWWashington, DC 20530cc:Special Agent Donald PearlmanIRS / Criminal Investigation Division600 Arch Street, Room 6224Philadelphia, PA 19106Enc: Questions Regarding Determining Taxable IncomeTwo copies of video, Theft by Deception (Deciphering the Federal Income Tax)Copy of this letter, to be given to the grand jury (if any) looking into thisissueYes, the letter was a bit long-winded, and I tend to get carried away withitalics and underlining, but it shows just how open I was about my beliefs andmy actions. In contrast, Mr. Meehan never responded in any way to the letter,and of course never answered the questions about how I should have figured mytaxes (or how anyone else should), but went ahead with prosecuting me forsupposedly doing it incorrectly.Also in the DOJ’s “press release” about my conviction, Eileen O’Connor, head ofthe Tax Division of the DOJ, was quoted as saying this: “People whointentionally fail to file returns or pay taxes as required by law can expect toface criminal prosecution and conviction.” Again, hundreds of people had sentMs. O’Connor those same six questions about how to properly determine what weowe, and she had completely ignored them all. Below are a few snippets fromletters various people sent to Ms. O’Connor, along with the questions:1) “It appears that the entire purpose of going after Mr. Rose is to silencehonest inquiry. Well, the way to accomplish this end is to answer honest inquirywith honest answers. I don’t know how these six straightforward, well-reasonedquestions can be so offensive, unless the answers would expose truths that youor others gain from keeping hidden. ... If you have pressure from others tosuppress the truth, please consider that the most valuable property a person hasis his/her personal integrity and honor, regardless of consequences. ”2) “I am forced to conclude that if the DOJ/IRS answers these questions honestlythe present actions and the history of these executive agencies must be subjectto massive public condemnation and a severe loss of credibility with aconcomitant loss of extorted revenue. ... On the other hand, continualstonewalling and criminal acts under color of law, in attempts to quash theseissues will lead to the same conclusion, only with more rage and a desire forretribution, which I fear will be very dangerous for the future of the nationunder the rule of law. ”3) “Speaking as one with a PhD in physics and a paralegal certificate, Iconsider it totally inappropriate to dismiss this matter as being ‘frivolous.’The issues raised are serious ones and on their face appear to have a soundlegal basis. Dismissing them out of hand and refusing to point out fallacies orlegal inconsistencies or other errors in law or logic gives a clear andconvincing picture of simply trying to sweep an embarrassing and potentiallydifficult matter under the rug. ... The use of illegal tactics by our owngovernment employees in efforts to suppress perfectly legal and properdiscussion and questioning is heinous misbehavior. ”4) “Isn’t it your duty as a public servant to provide legitimate answers tolegitimate questions posed to you by the American people, without stooping tothe lowest standard of behavior and terrorizing good Americans like the Roses byraiding their home and threatening indictments? ... You, Ms. O’Connor, have theopportunity and position to correct a very egregious wrong here and do the rightthing—tell the American people the truth. Now is your chance to be a hero—orwill you simply march in lockstep, like so many of your fellow public servants,and continue to perpetuate their jack-booted thuggery and ignorance of the law?”Over the years I sent several letters of my own to Ms. O’Connor. I sent one inlate October of 2004—almost exactly a year after sending the above-quoted letterto Mr. Meehan—with copies to Mr. Meehan, the Attorney General, and thePresident. The letter talked about Mr. Miller’s impending request for anindictment against me, for which he needed Tax Division approval. In my letter,I again spelled out my position, pointed out that it’s only a crime if I didsomething other than what I believed the law to require, and then listed over adozen things I “believe” about the tax laws, each one followed by a direct quotefrom either the Supreme Court, or the income tax statutes and regulations, whichunquestionably support each “belief.” For example, I stated that I “believe”that every statute, even if broadly worded, must be interpreted in light of theConstitution, and then I quoted the Supreme Court saying exactly that; I statedthat I “believe” that some types of income not exempted by any statute aretax-free because of the Constitution itself, and then quoted income taxregulations saying exactly that; I stated that I “believe” I should use Section861 and its regulations to determine my taxable domestic income, and then quotedofficial income tax regulations saying exactly that; and so on. After severalpages of that, my letter to Ms. O’Connor concluded as follows:“You can probably see why I consider it odd to say that I ‘believe’ thosethings, instead of saying that I know them. And that brings me to my question, aquestion which will be answered by your response to Mr. Miller’s proposedindictment in my case:Should someone be taken away from his family and friends and put in a cage forseveral years for ‘believing’ and talking about the things listed above?Please read that question carefully, and read it twice. To be blunt, only atruly despicable tyrant would answer ‘yes’ to that question. Any honestprosecutor reviewing my case, even if he assumed that my conclusions areincorrect, would see that I have been completely open about my actions and thereasons for them, would see that I am doing exactly what I ‘believe’ (i.e., whatI know) the law requires of me, would therefore conclude that no ‘willful’ taxcrime has occurred, and would not prosecute. While I cannot make people do theright thing, I can publicize it when they do the wrong thing. That is what Ihave done, and that is what I will continue to do, so that the actions of thosewho now hold power will forever be on the record so that the public can see thetrue nature of our ‘public servants.’ As Stanley Milgram’s psychologyexperiments demonstrated to a horrifying degree, most people do not have theprinciples or courage to do the right thing when a perceived ‘authority’ istelling them to do the wrong thing. Thousands of Americans are waiting to see ifyou are an exception to that unfortunate trait of human nature.”Well, in the end they saw that Ms. O’Connor—like Mr. Meehan, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr.Miller, Mr. Pearlman, and the rest—is nothing more than an unthinking fascistthug masquerading as a “law enforcer.” My letter to her ended with a “P.S.,”which said this: “As those at the IRS and DOJ should know by now, intimidationand demonization tactics will never stop me from telling the truth; nor wouldimprisonment.” I meant it, as I hope this book demonstrates.(Also in their “press release” about my conviction, the head of the CriminalInvestigation Division of the IRS, Nancy Jardini, also chimed in with this:“Today’s conviction reminds us that fulfilling individual tax obligations is alegal requirement and those who willfully evade that responsibility will beprosecuted.” Yes, she was sent the six questions too. No, she didn’t answer themeither.)SENTENCINGAt the risk of being anti-climactic, I’ll mention a few things about mysentencing. The worst part of the whole ordeal occurred a few days beforesentencing, when my attorney, Peter Goldberger, called to inform me that Baylsonintended to grant an “upward departure” from the usual sentencing level, andintended to have me taken into custody immediately after sentencing, instead ofallowing the usual “self-surrender” routine. (As far as I can tell, Baylson hadgotten the impression that I wasn’t going to file returns for back years, eventhough all the returns were ready to go by then, and we had already given theIRS lots of money.) So I suddenly thought that I had a couple of days until Iwould be hauled away for five years. Peter McCandless was at our house when Igot the call, so he was the sole witness to just how not fun that day was for meand Tessa, and how well I took it (really badly).Less than 24 really stressful hours later, however, Mr. Goldberger called meagain to report that he had magically gotten things back to how they werebefore: no upward departure, and I’d be allowed to do the self-surrenderroutine. So a day or two later, we were back in Judge Baylson’s courtroom,waiting to see what was to be done with me.In case you still think the case was about me not filing, rather than beingabout me speaking my mind, know that much of the discussion at sentencing had todo with my web sites. Baylson wanted to know if they were still active, and theyweren’t. He had previously made it quite clear that he would punish me worse ifI did not take down the web sites, so I took them down. Persecutor Noud whinedthat some pages could still be accessed via internet search engines, and added,“It’s my understanding that it would be very simple to completely dismantle allthe web sites.” I actually had no direct control over the sites, but per myrequest they had been disabled. (Mr. Goldberger also pointed out that because ofinternet archiving sites, it’s impossible to erase history.)By the time of sentencing, I had filed returns for 1997 through 2003,incorrectly reporting my income as taxable. I had also given the IRS around$38,000, which was most of the total principal they were alleging we owed. That,too, I was coerced into doing, which Judge Baylson was pretty open about. Theseare from his own words at sentencing:“And then I said to him that he should rethink his position in view of his beingconvicted by a jury of his peers, and if he went ahead and filed his back taxreturns and worked out a payment schedule with the IRS, I would consider that asweighing heavily in his favor at the time of sentencing, but if he did not, Iwould take that against him. Now, as far as I’m concerned from all that I haveheard today, including what has actually happened to the web site, I’m satisfiedthat Mr. Rose has moved towards rehabilitation and is no longer maintaining theposition that got him indicted and convicted here.”Rehabilitation?! Do you think they could possibly get any more Orwellian? I hadbeen terrorized into shutting up and pretending that I owed the tax—and theycalled it “rehabilitation.” (And incidentally, about the worst insult I canimagine is the allegation that those twelve jackasses on my jury are my“peers.”) Outrageously, Judge Baylson then said this:“The second thing is that I don’t intend to impose any sentence that willinterfere with Mr. Rose’s First Amendment rights.” Well, it’s a little late now.He admitted that the sentence he was going to impose would have been worse if Ihadn’t shut down my perfectly legal web sites. “I’m not going to get intowhether his prior web sites were First Amendment privileges or not. I don’tthink that’s relevant.” Yeah, that darn Constitution certainly isn’t relevant toour court system.Showing that his censorship-via-intimidation would be ongoing, he then said, “Imay have some conditions to impose when we get to supervised release, but I’mnot there quite yet.” Then he added: “But I think that I’m not going to orderanything specific, but I would say by the same token that if these web siteswere to mysteriously reactivate themselves, whether it be tomorrow or next weekor next year, I would once again begin to question Mr. Rose’s rehabilitation.”I fully expect that eventually the information will be back up, and publiclyavailable. And no, I am not “rehabilitated,” if by “rehabilitated” you meanintimidated into keeping silent about the tyrannical lawlessness of the federalgovernment and the biggest financial fraud in history. Yes, I will file and pay,even though I know I don’t legally owe the stupid tax, because the fascists inour system have shown that they are perfectly willing and able to inflict painand suffering upon any who don’t pay the “protection fee” of the federalextortion racket. But I will not stop telling the truth.Oddly, Judge Baylson then explained that he didn’t intend to give me “any ordersas to what happens to [my] web site,” and said that if the government wants acourt to issue an order about that, they should file a civil suit asking for aninjunction. Wow, this guy is good at talking out of both sides of his mouth. “Iwon’t order you to shut up, but, shut up!” Prior to sentencing, he made itperfectly clear that if I didn’t take down my web sites, my sentence would havebeen a lot worse. I guess if I was trying to see Judge Baylson in the bestpossible light, I could attribute this to an inner conflict: he feels the needto defend the power machine at all costs, but he doesn’t want to be a completefascist while doing so. (That may not be much of a compliment, but that’s thebest I can say for someone who threw me in prison for a crime he knew I didn’tcommit.)The government then asked for an upward departure for “obstruction,” because ifI was guilty (as the jury decided), then I must have lied under oath. Howconvenient for the feds: pleading innocent is now a separate crime—you getpunished for being (supposedly) guilty, and you get punished even more forsaying you weren’t guilty. To his credit, Judge Baylson tossed out such lunacy,saying, “It’s never been my practice to penalize a defendant for taking thestand unless the perjury was just wanton and obvious, and I can’t say that inthis case because Mr. Rose admitted all the operative facts. ... I think it’s anunfair penalty on a defendant’s assertion of his or her right to testify.”Then the government brought up my e-mail list (still think this was about me notfiling?) and Baylson asked whether things I had recently sent to the list were“inconsistent with what [he] described as [my] rehabilitation.” Shawn Noud saidhe thought they were, because I had not admitted that I was “wrong about any ofthe 861, his 861 position.” Wow, forced confession, anyone? Fortunately, Baylsonresponded that he had never required me to say my legal conclusions were wrong.Noud then complained that I might end up saying that I “was forced to file taxreturns.” Damn right I am, and damn right I was, you Nazi bastard! Amazing. Theydidn’t just want me to be coerced into filing returns; they also wanted me to becoerced into saying I wasn’t coerced. A false conviction wasn’t enough for them;they wanted a false confession, too! (How do these people sleep at night?)Then Baylson came out with this: “You and I can’t control the defendant’sbeliefs, okay? He’s entitled to believe whatever he wants, all right? We live ina free country. He has unbridled rights to believe whatever he likes.” First ofall, what a strange thing to say about someone he just coerced into shutting up(taking down web sites). Second, if they are my “beliefs,” as the judge openlyconceded that they are, I didn’t commit a crime!The government then whined that, at the time of sentencing, I might still havebeen selling my Theft by Deception video and/or the mini-CDs, to which the judgegave the hilarious response, “He may be, but you know, there’s such a thingcalled evidence; I’d like some evidence if— you can’t say he may be doingsomething.” (By then the web sites were stone dead, and there was no way foranyone to order anything anyway.) The prosecutors then whined that I might have“associates” who would continue to sell the video. Wow, they sure were tryinghard to suppress that thing, don’t you think? They wanted me to be punished forwhat other people might do in the future. I guess they ought to burn me at thestake to set an example.In the government’s arguments, Mr. Noud complained that I haven’t “really fullyaccepted responsibility” for my actions, because I hadn’t denounced my legalconclusions. He then came right out and said, “We need to send a message to thepublic that the government is serious about this and that we’re going to enforcethe law against people who are shirking their responsibilities.” Don’t worry,Mr. Noud, your terroristic fear-mongering is being watched by plenty of people,but stop pretending it has anything to do with “enforcing the law.”He went on to chastise me for being someone who “does not file tax returns forseven years, who waits for the IRS to investigate him, waits for the governmentto prosecute him, and then waits for a jury to convict,” and then only filesreturns after being “advised” to do so by a judge. Waits? Waits?! I went out ofmy way to tell them what I was doing from the beginning. I was the one whobrought my case to their attention. I was the one who asked to meet with them. Iwas the one who asked for their lawyers to make a ruling. I was the one whoasked them to explain their position, to answer my questions, to show me anyerror I might be making. And they said they would get back to me. And thissniveling little twit characterized that as “seven years of thumbing [my] noseat not only the IRS but the government in general.” (If that is the case, Iwould now like to substitute a different digit for the thumb.) And I was not“advised” to file by Judge Baylson; I was threatened and coerced into filing: Ihad to pretend my income was taxable or spend a few more years in prison. That’snot “advice.” That’s extortion.Mr. Weasel Noud continued, saying that “the government is not trying to punishanybody for their beliefs” (bullpoop), but that “citizens should obey the law orthey should suffer the consequences, regardless of their beliefs.” He added: “Toact on the belief is different than holding the belief.” Never mind that it’s acrime to not act on your own beliefs about your tax obligations (see, forexample, 26 USC § 7206). Again, he kept talking about my “beliefs,” basicallyconceding that I believed I didn’t owe the tax, which makes me not guilty ofwhat I was being sentenced for. Gack! Nonetheless, Noud asked that the sentencebe the most severe within the federal sentencing guidelines: five years.FOR THE DEFENSEWhen it was time for my attorney, Peter Goldberger, to give his argument, hetold the story of a case he had been involved in, in which several lower courtshad made a ruling about a certain legal issue (involving money laundering) which“didn’t seem right to [Mr. Goldberger] under the law.” To make a long storyshort, he filed a motion about it, and the trial court denied it. By the timethe case was appealed, eight different circuit courts had ruled in favor of thegovernment’s position on the issue. The court he appealed to also ruled in favorof the government and against Mr. Goldberger. His legal team then asked theSupreme Court to hear the case, even though at that point, “every federal courtthat had ruled on this issue had said we were wrong.”But then the Supreme Court agreed with Mr. Goldberger and ruled in his favor,overturning all of the lower court rulings in one fell swoop. The point of thestory? “It’s not immoral to disagree with all the courts. It’s not wrong tothink that the IRS could be wrong about—.” At that point, leaping into the roleof spare prosecutor again, Judge Baylson cut him off, asking why I couldn’t havepaid the taxes (that I didn’t believe I owed) and then sued to get the moneyback.Something I missed in Noud’s comments at the time (I was a little distracted),but Mr. Goldberger noticed, was that the government complained that if I wasn’tproperly crushed, in the future I might do more nasty things, like file claimsfor refund. As Mr. Goldberger pointed out, Noud was worried that I might do thevery thing the judge and the DOJ said I should have done. Amazingly, Baylsonchimed in with, “He can do it tomorrow morning; I don’t consider that in any wayinconsistent with anything I’m going to do here today.” How much do you want tobet that if I did what the judge said I should do, they’d prosecute me for it?Remember, they had already investigated my claims for refund, as if filing themwas a crime in itself, and they later prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned Dr.Clayton for filing claims for refund of his own.Mr. Goldberger then asked, when you leave off all the perfectly legal FirstAmendment stuff I do (which the government doesn’t like), what do you have left?“You have a low-level nonfiling misdemeanor case, that’s what you have: a guywith a big mouth.” (I plead guilty to that last part, and for that I have noremorse.) Then he pointed out that in such cases, more than half of thoseconvicted get straight probation—not a day of prison time—and many others getsix or fewer months of prison.Then I gave my own statement. Apparently some papers reported that I“apologized.” If they meant I apologized to my family, you could say that. Ifthey meant I apologized to the government, like hell I did! Giving my statementwas one of the least fun things I’ve ever been through. On one hand I hadgenuine remorse, about having put my family at risk in order to try to stop theAmerican public from being defrauded. In retrospect, I shouldn’t have. I shouldhave let the American public be defrauded. Most of them deserve it, but myfamily did not deserve what they got. Here is part of what I said:“As a father and a husband it is hard, it is my first duty to protect my family.And as a result of my own recklessness and arrogance I did the exact opposite.My actions brought stress and embarrassment and trouble and pain on the onesthat I love the most, and I won’t ever forgive myself for that, and I can’t askanyone else to, neither my family or the court.”I meant it, and if any people who were there wonder, I was as choked up as Ilooked and sounded. What made it a lot more stressful—what added anger to myalready overwhelming grief and anguish—was that I had to address my comments to,and put myself at the mercy of, a power-happy tyrant, while a collection of IRSCriminal Investigation Nazis sat in the audience. Try voicing your deepestregrets, your shortcomings and failures, in front of your worst enemies. It’snot fun. Somehow I managed to get the words out, from a prepared statement, andthen I shut up. Then all I could do was wait and see.Earlier at the hearing, Baylson opined that I was nastier than your averagenonfiler because I was not merely someone “who stood by and asserted hisbeliefs,” but someone who “attempted to profit by them by developing this website and selling the videos.” And again, just before passing sentence, hecomplained that I didn’t just refuse to file returns, but also “attempted toprofit from it by going into the business of making these videotapes and tryingto sell them.” Uh, what happened to him not punishing me for speaking my mind?And in case this isn’t self-evident, here is a snippet from the Supreme Court:“That the production, distribution and exhibition of motion pictures is alarge-scale business conducted for private profit does not prevent motionpictures from being a form of expression whose liberty is safeguarded by theFirst Amendment.” [Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495 (1952)]Yet there the judge was, openly admitting that he intended to punish me extrafor “profiting” from my conclusions and beliefs. (That coming from someone whomakes over $150,000 a year for proclaiming his legal conclusions and opinions.Hypocrite.) Of course, the government didn’t mention that I had offered todonate to them every penny I made from the videos if they would let me ask theirlawyers some questions about the law. (I’m not entirely sure whether JudgeBaylson knew about that at the time of sentencing.) Anyway, to cut to the punchline, Judge Baylson eventually announced his decision:“The sentence of the Court is the defendant shall serve imprisonment in thecustody of the Bureau of Prisons for a term of fifteen months, scheduled tothree months on each of counts one through five, with each count consecutivewith each other.”He also sentenced me to a year of “supervised release” to follow myimprisonment, imposed a $10,000 fine, and ordered me to arrange with the IRS topay the rest of the back taxes that I never legally owed in the first place.(Some have suggested that I should be more appreciative that Judge Baylson didnot impose an even worse sentence, which he could have done. Well, he also couldhave granted my “Rule 29” motion and thrown out the “guilty” verdict altogether,since he knew damn well that the government hadn’t proven me guilty of anycrime. If you ask me, the fact that he could have imposed a worse punishmentthan he did, for the crime he knew I hadn’t committed, doesn’t make himdeserving of much praise.)To be extra nasty, he also said that I was to surrender myself into custody justsix days later, by 9:00 a.m. the following Monday, which is very unusual.(Almost everyone who qualifies for “self-surrender” is given a month or two toprepare.) When Mr. Goldberger began to ask if the judge might consider a longertime to surrender, Baylson interrupted him and said, “No, I will not.” Mr.Goldberger pointed out that it’s impossible to even get a designation, assigningwhere I’d be imprisoned, that quickly, but Baylson cut him off again, andrefused to give me any more time to prepare.Various motions for “bail pending appeal,” which would have allowed me to remainfree (relatively speaking) while the appeal was litigated, delayed myself-surrender a bit, but not much. The first time, I was actually within sightof the Federal Detention Center in downtown Philadelphia when Mr. Goldbergercalled to tell me to go home. We had a few more days. Somehow in no time flat mylawyers managed to get me a designation at the Canaan federal prison camp inWaymart, Pennsylvania, where I am as I write this. (Some “promised land” thisis.) Oddly, those few short days with my family prior to self-surrendering wereexceedingly enjoyable, and they also seemed to crawl by, contrary to the usual“time flies when you’re having fun” rule.When the day finally came, my wife and I, and a friend of hers, drove up toWaymart and they dropped me off at the front door of the federal penitentiary.And for the next year, this is my home.So that about sums up the story: dragon terrorizes village; common peasantenters dragon’s lair and kicks dragon; other peasants stab first peasant in theback with their pitchforks. Well, now I know that when a little nobody decidesto stand up against government wrongdoing, the American public can be counted onto take the side of the ones oppressing them. Gack.TESSA’S CONVICTIONMy wife’s trial makes for an equally ludicrous tale, which Tessa will be tellingin her own words. I was there to witness it because it occurred in the severalmonths between my conviction and my sentencing. Prior to her trial the DOJ dideverything it could to bully her into pleading guilty, to save them the time andexpense of prosecuting her for the crime they knew she hadn’t committed. For awhile she considered entering an “Alford” plea, where she would essentiallyplead no contest, without actually admitting guilt, in exchange for a lightersentence. In the end, however, she couldn’t in good conscience do even that fora crime she hadn’t committed.The sliminess of the DOJ shone through again when Floyd Miller said that ifTessa did a plea-bargain, he couldn’t see her doing any prison time, andwouldn’t ask the court to impose any prison time. When she refused, however, hisresponse was “This is war.” So, based on the government’s own statements, shedidn’t go to prison for committing a crime; she went to prison for saying shewas innocent. (And people wonder why I use words like “inquisition.”The feds sent my wife to prison because she wouldn’t give a false confession.)In the end, after being found guilty of the same bogus charges that I wasconvicted of, in an even more ridiculous trial, with an equally bogus verdictdelivered by an equally idiotic jury, Tessa was sentenced to a month in prison,followed by five months on home detention. Because we had a young daughter, hersentence was scheduled to begin after my release from prison."},{"pageContent":"PART VII:LESSONS LEARNEDA LEARNING EXPERIENCEI feel as if I’ve learned a lot in the past decade, most of it bad, and littleor none of it the “lesson” the prosecution and judge hoped I would learn. I’llconclude this gruesome tale by summarizing the various lessons I’ve learned,concerning: 1) our wonderful government; 2) our wonderful court system; 3) ourwonderful American media; 4) the “tax honesty movement”; and 5) the Americanpeople in general. None of it is what I was hoping to learn, and it’s probablynot what you were hoping to hear (it’s not good news), but maybe in some way itwill help others—if nothing else, by providing them with some amusement as theysnicker at the doofus (namely, me) who got himself flung into prison.LESSONS ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENTThe main things I’ve learned about “our” system over the past eight years isthat it isn’t our system, by any stretch of the imagination. It is a governmentof the control freaks, by the control freaks, and for the control freaks. Thetruth, justice, and the law don’t matter a hill of beans to the vast majority ofthose in government. I don’t just mean that sometimes they break the law; I meanthat they never care what the law says when it gets in the way of their ownpower, as long as they can get away with breaking it. There is one reason—andonly one reason—they even bother with laws, and courts, and procedures: to givethe illusion of legitimacy; to put on an act, pretending to be something otherthan power-happy, god-complex tyrants.Most (if not all) government lawyers are nothing more than well-trainedexcuse-makers. Following the law, or doing the right thing, is never their goal,nor is complying with the Constitution. Their job is to come up with some legalexcuse after the fact for why it was okay for them to trample individual rights.(In late 1998, the Associated Press ran an exposé on DOJ misconduct, saying that“Federal agents and prosecutors around the country have repeatedly broken thelaw over the past decade in pursuit of convictions,” and that prosecutors werecaught “lying, hiding evidence, distorting the facts, engaging in cover-ups,paying for perjury and setting up innocent people to win indictments, guiltypleas and convictions.” The article even quoted a former federal prosecutor assaying, “It’s a result-oriented process today, fairness be damned.” So I’velearned.)And the IRS is considerably worse than the DOJ when it comes to ignoringprocedure, law, and truth. Let’s consider one example of how the actions of thefeds compare with what the law says they are supposed to do:The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution says that the government may not depriveyou of your property without first providing you with “due process.” That meansyou have a right to challenge the claims and actions of the government, to makeyour case and present evidence and argument, and to have an unbiased referee(judge) issue a fair and reasonable ruling. That constitutional requirementapplies to all disputes with any government department or agency, including theIRS.The IRS’s own publications spell out one’s due process rights in great detail.If you disagree with the IRS about what you owe, you have the right to sit downwith one of their hired idiots—I mean, highly qualified examiners—to discuss thematter. If you cannot resolve the matter at that level, you can demand to speakwith the examiner’s supervisor. If you still can’t reach an agreement, you canhave your case referred to the Appeals division of the IRS. If you disagree withthe conclusion of the Appeals officer assigned to your case, you can talk to hissuperior. If after all that administrative due process, the IRS still thinks youowe them something, they issue a “Notice of Deficiency,” and you have the rightto have your case heard by the U.S. Tax Court. Even if the Tax Court sides withthe IRS, a 1998 law entitles you to yet another meeting, at which they arerequired to prove that they followed all their rules and did everything by thebook before they can collect from you.Wow, that’s a lot of due process, checks and balances! What a great system!Well, it would be a nice system if they actually did anything remotelyresembling what I just described. But there’s a catch: if you commit the sin ofheresy by mentioning “861” to the IRS, in person or in writing, all of that dueprocess evaporates into thin air. If you so much as ask a question about 861,here is the “due process” you will receive: 1) the examiner will refuse to meetwith you, insult you, threaten to impose a penalty upon you, and try to swipeyour money as fast as possible; 2) if you ask IRS Appeals to hear the case, theywill refuse, based on a bogus claim that you are just refusing to obey the law;3) After all administrative due process is skipped, you can go to the KangarooTax Court, which will fine you thousands of dollars if you even mention 861,will say “frivolous” a lot, and will refuse to discuss the matter further; 4) ifyou then ask for a “Collections Due Process Hearing,” the IRS will refuse togive you one; 5) If you seek “judicial review” from the Tax Court, concerningthe IRS’s refusal to meet with you, the Kangaroo Tax Court will give itsjudicial blessing to the whole ridiculous process; 6) If you complain to theoffice of the “Taxpayer Advocate,” you will get insulted and threatened somemore.All of the foregoing is illegal. The IRS regulations and publications show whatIRS folk are required to do. If you mention 861, they skip all of it. Oh, and ifyou complain to your so-called “representatives” in congress, they will doabsolutely nothing about it. After all, they’re the primary beneficiaries of thefraud carried out by the IRS, so why should they want to help you resist it?(In early 2003, in an effort to assist the thuggery of the IRS, the supposedlylimited-government advocate U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (PA) introduced a bill inCongress which would have raised the “frivolous return” penalty from $500 to$5,000, while allowing the IRS to deem anything it pleases as being “frivolous,”and would have extended the penalty beyond just tax returns to also include“frivolous” requests for administrative hearings and “frivolously” asking forhelp from the Taxpayer Advocate’s office. In other words, under that law, askingfor due process would have won you a $5,000 fine.)I’ve seen all of the above happen over and over again, to people who werecompletely open and honest about their actions, and whose main sin was to askthe government questions about how to properly comply with the law. These peopleget coded a special way (which is also illegal under a 1998 law), and all oftheir due process rights get flushed down the toilet. Despite all the rhetoricabout due process and the rule of law, the reality is this: if you commit thesin of mentioning 861, you get to discuss it with no one, you get to meet withno one, you get to argue nothing, you get no answers, you get insulted,threatened, and fined, and then you get robbed. (If you think I’m exaggerating,try it.) And here is the best part: the IRS trains its employees to do that toanyone who mentions 861. They even have special “teams” at the IRS whose job isto make sure that those pesky 861 folk are denied all due process, and arerobbed as quickly and thoroughly as possible. They make up numbers, ignorecorrespondence, clean out bank accounts, file liens, and generally act likeMafia kneecap-smashers.How do I know this? Not only have I watched it happen to a lot of people indifferent cases across the country, but I’ve seen the IRS’s own internal memosabout it, instructing IRS employees to do this. Those memos were kindly suppliedto me by a couple of moles inside the IRS. (Not everyone in the IRS is anextortionist scumbag; it’s just the corrupt and malicious 99 percent who givethe rest a bad name.)Last-Minute Addition: Though the IRS had already been doing it illegally foryears, in December of 2006, just before my release from prison, Congress finallygave the IRS legislative permission to completely deny due process to anyone whomentions 861, or any other issue the IRS unilaterally declares to be“frivolous.” In the ridiculously named “Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006,”Congress authorized the IRS to, among other things, fine people $5,000 forrequesting a “Collections Due Process” hearing, or for filing a claim forrefund, based on the 861 evidence.In my own case, I eventually obtained the IRS memos about my 1994 and 1995claims for refund, on which Agent Michael Enz had handwritten “Assess 6702[frivolous return] penalty only. Do not process the return.” The IRS has nolegal authority to just bypass all due process and choose not to process a claimfor refund, but that’s exactly what they do. They don’t seem to care what islegal. On a copy of my 1996 claim for refund, the IRS had written “Timely,” andstamped “AUG 24 2000,” showing it was filed on time. But they never processedit. Why not? At my second meeting with the IRS, Agent Enz openly stated thatwhen the IRS folk receive a claim mentioning 861, they’re “taught not to processit.” Again, the regulations governing the processing of returns (26 CFR §601.105) give no authority whatsoever for a blanket refusal to process a returnat all—to act as if it was never received. (In fact, their manual even says thatif an actually “frivolous” return can be processed, it should be.) And just incase ignoring the law in one way wasn’t enough, the IRS wrote “tax protestor” onmy 1996 claim for refund, and used that term repeatedly in their internal memosabout my case, which happens to be a violation of Section 3707 of the IRSRestructuring and Reform Act of 1998, which states that IRS personnel “shall notdesignate taxpayers as illegal tax protesters (or any similar designation).” Thelabel was banned because of concerns that the people so labeled would bestigmatized, and treated badly by the IRS. No kidding. Yet even as late as 2006,“TIGTA”—the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration—found 287 cases inwhich the IRS was still using the outlawed labels. And TIGTA’s recommendationregarding the IRS ignoring the law? They suggested that IRS management tell themto stop doing it. Again.Okay, I’d better stop there, because if I start listing every law, regulation,and procedure the IRS violates, this book will end up being longer than War andPeace. Suffice it to say, those who have dealt with the IRS after saying “861”know firsthand just how much “due process” is available to them: none.CONGRESSIONAL BONEHEADEDNESSOn at least a couple of occasions, congressional “hearings” were held on whatthe IRS and the politicians portrayed as “abusive tax schemes.” (Hmm, does thatmean schemes having to do with abusive taxes?) Of course, the “hearings” werenot held in order for Congress to hear anything; they were held so that pompouspoliticians could huff and puff, posture and pontificate, and publicly demonizeand threaten people who say things Congress doesn’t like.On April 5, 2001, Charles Grassley, congress-crook from Iowa, ran one hearingwhich I and various other individuals with unorthodox conclusions about the taxlaws attended. When Bob Schulz, head of an organization called “We The People,”asked if some of us might be given a brief opportunity to be heard (at the“hearing”), he was told no. Why not? Because it wouldn’t fit with thepoliticians’ “agenda”—that’s the way their security guards put it. Yeah, nokidding. Having someone tell the truth in those hallowed halls of horse-hooeywould definitely mess up their agenda.So a few boring speakers, including IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti, gavetheir canned speeches to the congressional windbags, lamenting the evils of usnasty nonconformists (without mentioning that we were in the room at the time,having come from all over the country to see our government in action). We wereinvited to listen quietly as we were demonized, mischaracterized, and thenthreatened. And that was that. Of note, at the “hearing” I was at, the 861 issuemanaged to get no mention at all. (I believe CNN was covering the thing, somaybe they didn’t want to draw any more attention to 861; it was already a hugethorn in their side.) Somehow the agenda morphed into a bashing of various “taxshelters” and questionable trusts, with some mention—but not much—of thefull-page newspaper ad We The People had sponsored, suggesting that thegovernment should be able and willing to answer reasonable questions about thetax laws. The average observer at the hearing would no doubt have been left withthe impression that “We The People” was pushing some sneaky tax evasion scheme,when they were doing nothing of the sort.There was one moment during the hearing when I only barely managed to keep fromlaughing out loud. Had I done so, I probably would have been charged with“contempt of Congress”—a “crime” to which I would proudly plead guilty. Afterjoining in the nonconformist-bashing for a while, one of the speakers—J.J.MacNab, the same delusional bozo who reported my non-existent “threats” toPamela Olson—presumably departing from her script, had the audacity to ask (outloud, mind you) why the government didn’t just answer the questions of the(falsely labeled) “tax protestor” crowd. After an awkward, very quiet pause,followed by a non-responsive response, the agenda was quickly directedelsewhere.There was a follow-up “hearing” a year later, at which the IRS put on ahuff-and-puff show, boasting about its ongoing efforts to crush all dissent anddifference of opinion. Oops, I meant to say, “to punish those who violate thetax laws.” Yeah, right. The hearing itself was the usual terror campaignpropaganda, and not worth describing in detail. What was amusing, however, wasthat the hearing—no doubt at the suggestion of some PR whiz at the IRS—wastitled “The IRS Strikes Back.”Had they been slightly less clueless, it might have occurred to Rossotti and histhugs that in the Star Wars movie The Empire Strikes Back, after which theirhearings were obviously named, the empire doing the striking back was the EvilEmpire. Maybe Charles “Darth” Rossotti was making one of those accidentaladmissions that psychologists like to talk about. For a brief moment, ChuckVader and his stormtroopers were honest about who they are, though I doubt itwas done on purpose.FASCISTS WITH NOTHING TO LOSEIn any dispute between government and us common folk, the government is allowedto use force, and we’re not. They take people’s money (by force), steal FirstAmendment materials (by force), silence web sites (by force), and lock people up(by force). And what happens if anyone resists by force? Well, of course, thatperson is considered a dangerous villain, who will either be put in a cage for along time or be killed. It makes the game a bit lop-sided, don’t you think? AllI have is words; all I can do is speak my mind. I can’t do armed raids of IRSoffices when they say something I don’t like. I can’t put them in cages forhaving an opinion that differs from mine. Of course, not being an evil bastardmyself—unlike Floyd Miller, Shawn Noud, Donald Pearlman, etc.—I wouldn’t want todo such things. The system is about as fair as a boxing match in which only onecontender is allowed to hit—the other has to try to verbally persuade hisopponent to fall down.What makes it more ridiculous is that the enormous federal extortion machine isfunded by money they take from us. They spend our money harassing, robbing, andimprisoning us, and we have to spend even more of our money to defend ourselvesfrom them. What happens if liars like Floyd Miller lose a case? He still getshis paycheck. He has nothing to lose, except maybe advancement to a higherposition in the Evil Empire. Not a penny comes out of Floyd Miller’s pocket, orDonald Pearlman’s pocket, or any pocket of any of the other fascists who gotpaid to prosecute me—indeed, lots of pennies go into their pockets for doing it,regardless of the outcome. Meanwhile, the victims of their persecution—and I amonly one among many—have to pay to defend themselves, and pay even more if theylose. To make matters worse, the feds also spend our money to spread theirpropaganda; all of their terrorizing of the public and demonizing of taxheretics is done at “taxpayer” expense.In short, there is no deterrent to being a lying, cheating federal fascist.Nothing happens to them for prosecuting innocent people. Heck, they get paid todo it. There is no reason for an IRS drone not to harass and rob people. The“deterrent” of having morals and a conscience obviously doesn’t do it. There arenever any adverse consequences for them, even when they blatantly violate theirown rules. When everyone above them tolerates and even condones their thuggery,it’s no wonder they keep doing it. If you don’t believe me, here it is (again)from the mouth of an IRS whistle-blower, as she testified to Congress:“Sadly, some [IRS] employees repeatedly do not follow proper collection policiesand procedures and thereby repeatedly abuse taxpayers. There are several reasonswhy this occurs: … When management condones the abuse, the Revenue Officerbelieves the mistake is acceptable and is free to repeat the error again. …Revenue Officers capitalize on the taxpayer’s inherent fear of the IRS and theintimidation that they can inflict on taxpayers without any consequences fortheir improper enforcement.”What happens to Donald Pearlman when he lies under oath? Nothing. What happensto Floyd Miller when he intentionally lies to the jury? Nothing. What happens toIRS agents who steal perfectly legal videos to take them out of circulation?Nothing. What happens to all the IRS agents across the country who break therules to take money from people? Nothing. (Well, I say “nothing,” but the moreaccurate answer is, they are commended and rewarded.) What happens to a judgewho lies about the law to the jury? Nothing. What happens to a judge who putssomeone in a cage who did not commit a crime? Nothing. Even in the unusual casewhere a higher court decides that a conviction is bogus, what happens to thepeople who obtained that bogus conviction? Not a thing. In the contest betweengovernment and citizen, the citizen puts everything on the line, while thegovernment thugs risk nothing. They get paid either way, and they don’t getlocked up if they lose. So what is there to deter them from being lawless,terrorist Nazis? Not a damn thing, and you can see the results.(Speaking of Nazis, while here in prison I came across an interesting passage inSchindler’s List, about what happened when the Nazis went door to door swipingjewels, furs, and other valuables: “Some of those whose goods were taken—unawarethat the SS were operating outside legal restraint—would tomorrow complain atpolice stations. Somewhere, history told them, was a senior officer with alittle integrity who would be embarrassed and might even discipline some ofthese unruly fellows.” Well, they soon learned the truth: there was no recoursewithin the system; the entire monstrosity, top to bottom, approved of andcondoned the lawless thuggery. A lot of Americans are now coming to realize thatabout the IRS, too: there is no one in public office, in any of the threebranches of the federal government, who has any interest whatsoever in makingthe IRS obey the law. They occasionally feign concern, to get public support,but they let it keep happening. And why should they mind IRS thuggery? Who doyou think benefits from the federal extortion racket? They know better than tobite the hand that feeds them.)People who have never been at odds with the IRS, or any so-called “lawenforcement” folk, often tend to assume that the cops are the good guys, andanyone they go after must be bad, and deserving of whatever they get. Those whohave come face to face with authoritarian oppression, however, know better. AsJohn Hay put it, “The evils of tyranny are rarely seen but by him who resistsit.” Very true. Until you are the one having to deal with the thieving, lying,cheating, threatening, insulting, terroristic tactics of our wonderful federalgovernment, there’s really no way to fully appreciate the gravity of thesituation. Sitting here in prison, I’m starting to grasp it.LESSONS ABOUT OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEMThe main thing I learned about our court system is that, at least in some cases,it is driven by the exact same principles and attitudes as the oppressivereligious empires of olden days. Such principles and attitudes include thefollowing:1) “To hell with evidence and logic; the truth is whatever we say it is!”2) “It is a sin to disagree with us, and heretics must be punished!”3) “Once punished, we expect these darn nonconformists to see the error of theirways, so that they may be enlightened and rehabilitated!”Having witnessed a large dose of the utter insanity of our court system, I amstruck by the many ways in which it is not merely analogous to historicaltheocracies, but is identical to them. The high priests of the judicial cultwear robes and sit high above everyone else. You must call them “honorable,” andit is a crime (“contempt of court”) to show them disrespect while in theircathedral—I mean courtroom. When speaking from their elevated and glorifiedpositions, their assertions are portrayed as opinions, not of mere mortalindividuals, but of “the court.” This is very similar to how the high priests ofold would characterize their own assertions as the unquestionable decrees of“the church.”In keeping with the comparison, the current equivalents of high priestsroutinely demonstrate profound ignorance and a complete absence of reason andlogic. The ultimate manifestation of the cult-like nature of our judicial systemis the fact that at any trial, the high priest—I mean “judge”—will unabashedlydeclare that he, and he alone, can say what the law is. (They tell this to alljuries, not just mine.) The peasants may have a brief moment to beg his royalhighness to agree with them, but once he declares “I have ruled on this,” nomatter how patently incorrect or idiotic such a ruling might be, further debateis not permitted.Once upon a time, churches wouldn’t let the peasants read the doctrines forthemselves. Only the high priests were qualified or authorized to interpret thetrue meaning of the words in those books. Indeed, without the inspired insightof such learned wise men, we might never have known that when Jesus said “turnthe other cheek,” he really meant “torture and kill any who don’t pledgeunquestioning faith to the church.” (Wow, what a creative “interpretation.”) Thewisdom of the current proclaimers-of-law isn’t much better.The lunacy of it hit me full force as I sat on the witness stand and listened toone of the anointed mouthpieces of “the court” make a stunning string ofcolossal blunders while giving a lecture on federal tax law. I’m referring tothe time Judge Baylson explained that Congress could not originally tax income(wrong), and that they had not done so until an amendment was passed(wrong)—though he couldn’t remember which amendment it was or when it happened,and that that amendment was the source of Congress’ ability to tax income(wrong). There I sat, ready and able to quote from memory half a dozen SupremeCourt rulings, not to mention acts of Congress and regulations, proving that thejudge was dead wrong about everything he had just said. But I was not allowed todo so. I was, after all, merely a peasant.I want to clarify that I am not criticizing Judge Baylson for not knowing suchthings off the top of his head. Most judges don’t. What I find absurd, however,is that I had to sit there silently and let him mislead the jury—inadvertently,I hope. I try not to bash people for mere ignorance (not knowing things), butwhen someone declares himself to be the ultimate, final, and sole authority onsome subject (such as federal tax law), such a display of cluelessness deservesbashing.As it happens, I suspect that the judge and the entire prosecution team were inthe bottom 20 percent of the people in the courtroom when measuring knowledge oftax law. Most of the dozens of people there to support me knew darn well thatthe Sixteenth Amendment did not create or expand any power to tax. (They alsoprobably knew which amendment it was, and when it was enacted, unlike JudgeBaylson.) Nonetheless, because of the way our wonderful cult-like system works,someone who happened to be woefully ignorant of the most fundamental principlesof federal taxation was also the one declaring himself to be the only one in theroom allowed to tell the jury “what the law is.” “To hell with sky charts,orbits, facts and figures—the sun goes around the earth because we say it does!”Not much has changed in the last few centuries.Demonstrating the level of insanity, while proclaiming my conclusions about thelaw to be incorrect, neither “the court” nor “the government” (code terms forthe guy in the black dress and the other guy in the suit) cited one word fromany statute or regulation disagreeing with my conclusions, but instead focusedentirely on the fact that other guys in black dresses had previously assertedthat conclusions like mine are flawed—or, even better, are “frivolous.”Once someone in a black robe has made an official proclamation about what thelaw is, other people in black robes will usually give it credence, no matter howobviously contrary it is to the law, the Constitution, or common sense. (One ofmy favorite examples comes from the Supreme Court’s ruling in Wikard v. Filburn,wherein the court concluded that a farmer who grows grain on his own land, andconsumes it on his own land, can be regulated under the interstate commerceclause.) Not only will “the system” then treat such asinine opinions as gospelfrom on high—unless and until a higher high priest overrules it—but often thegeneral public will as well. “But if the courts have ruled that you’re wrong,then you must be wrong!” So why bother writing down the law, if it meanswhatever some judge asserts that it means instead of meaning what it says? Whyhave a legislature and an executive branch, if the statutes and regulations theyspend so much time and effort creating can be single-handedly renderedirrelevant by the “ruling” of a guy in a black dress? Just drop the charade,declare judges to be infallible supreme beings, and be done with it. Forget thetax code, forget the regulations; whether you owe something, and how much, isnow determined solely by what the guy with the wooden hammer says. And woe tothose heretics who dare to suggest that guys with wooden hammers can be wrongabout something.LESSONS ABOUT THE MEDIAThe main thing I learned about the mainstream media in this country is that itis utterly worthless if you want a reliable, accurate source of information. Ibase that conclusion upon my own experience with the media misreporting andmischaracterizing my own case, and similar cases with which I am familiar.Whether the media’s complete failure to accurately report the facts is due tosome big conspiracy, or just laziness, I won’t bother to guess. But I wouldcategorize the media irresponsibility I’ve seen into three groups: spinning,parroting, and lying, each of which deserves a few words.1) SpinningThere is a big difference between reporting and editorializing. Each is a worthyendeavor, but the media has a nasty habit of disguising opinion pieces asreporting. If you want to publish something that says “I think anyone whodisagrees with the conventional wisdom about the income tax is a dumby-facepoopoohead,” be my guest. Unlike the government and the courts, I fully supportfreedom of speech. But don’t pretend that your personal opinions constitute aneutral recitation of facts, which is what “reporting” is supposed to be. Forexample, you won’t catch me claiming that this book contains only an objective,unbiased account of the facts of my case. But in the press, opiners areconstantly pretending to be reporters.Sometimes editorial spin is blatant, and sometimes it is subtle. I’m not talkingabout lying (yet); I’m talking about people sneaking their own bias into whatthey pretend is objective reporting. I’m not against personal opinions(obviously), but if your job is to report the news, then present the facts andthen shut up. I’m not sure I could do that myself, but then, I don’t call myselfa reporter. Compare the following:a) “A group of people protested the new school curriculum, because they wanttheir children to be taught that the earth is flat.”b) “A group of clueless nut-jobs with no grip on reality protested the newcurriculum...”The first is reporting; the second is giving an opinion. It happens to expressan opinion I might agree with, and might voice myself, but it still isn’treporting; it’s giving commentary. The effective media spin is usually a lotmore subtle, however, and is sometimes hardly even perceptible—the reader feelsas if he was just told the facts, but by the end his opinion is leaning in thesame direction as that of the author.David Cay Johnston, spin doctor of tax-related issues for the New York Times, isa prime example. In various private e-mails to me and others, Mr. Johnstondidn’t bother to hide the disdain, contempt, and animosity he feels towardanyone who dares doubt the wisdom of the “tax experts”—especially those ingovernment, who seem to have a pretty cozy relationship with Mr. Johnston. Butin his published articles, Mr. Johnston encodes his arrogance and hostility intosubtle spin. (In contrast, as you may have noticed, when I think someone is abutt-head, I don’t bother trying to hide my opinions.)The art of persuasive spin lies in constantly using little verbal “nudges”which, taken one at a time, don’t seem very significant, but taken altogetherpush an agenda or opinion quite effectively. Rather than nitpick over a millionlittle examples, I’ll mention the most popular spin found in almost everyarticle in the mainstream media having to do with the 861 evidence: the misuseof the term “tax protestor.”A tax protestor is someone who protests a tax (obviously). A lot of people havecomplaints about a lot of taxes, often with good reason. Some think taxes areunconstitutional, or immoral, or economically destructive, or they object totaxes being used to fund wars, or the welfare state, or anything else they don’tlike. Those are tax protestors, some of whom go as far as refusing to pay basedupon their political, religious, or moral beliefs.While I respect such people, “protesting” the federal income tax is not at allwhat I am doing. Yet almost without exception, every mainstream articlementioning me, or anyone else who believes that the law is just fine but isbeing misapplied, uses the term “tax protestor.” If it only happened a fewtimes, it could be explained by mere reporter incompetence. But when it happensconstantly, even after it is carefully explained to pseudo-reporters (like Mr.Johnston) that we are not protesting any tax, then it is no accident.So why do they call us “tax protestors” when they know that it is inaccurate todo so? Because, in the eyes of most people, the term carries a negativeconnotation. (This is similar to the way government officials and reporters useterms such as “extremist,” “compound,” and “arsenal” to describe the beliefs,homes, and guns of anyone they don’t like.) In the mind of the average reader,the term “tax protestor” evokes an image of some law-breaking malcontent whorefuses to pay his “fair share” to support this great country of ours. Why don’treporters talk about “someone with an unusual conclusion about the correctapplication of the law”? Because it doesn’t invoke enough pro-government,anti-us bias in the mind of the reader. And that is the aim of spinners likeDavid Cay Johnston.(I know of one mainstream reporter who actually objectively reported the factsof my case, in March of 2005. I would thank him by name, but he would probablyget fired if I did. The article quoted Floyd Miller as saying that “a jury wouldultimately decide the merits of the Roses’ position,” which was a silly thing tosay, since juries aren’t even allowed to decide what the law is. But moreamazingly, the article quoted Mr. Miller as saying this: “Based on the law as Iunderstand it, I think the overwhelming authority is that he’s wrong.” What kindof uncertain, floundering prevarication was that? As he understands it, hethinks that most courts say I’m wrong? He doesn’t sound very sure of himself,but that didn’t stop him from prosecuting me for it.)As another fine example of Mr. Johnston’s spin technique, when Joseph Banister,former IRS Special Agent, was acquitted of the bogus charges the governmentthrew at him, David Cay Johnston’s reporting of it started by saying this: “Thefederal government’s campaign against income tax protesters suffered a majorsetback yesterday... ” Aside from his usual misuse of the “tax protestor” label,consider the implied viewpoint of the sentence. The theme was not “man found notguilty.” No, that’s too pro-Joe. The theme was a “setback” for the United Statesgovernment, with the term “setback” clearly implying that Joe was guilty of acrime, but “got away with it.” An innocent person being acquitted would never becharacterized as a “setback”; it’s called justice. The article also said: “Theverdict stirred concerns that it would encourage more Americans to refuse to paytaxes... ” Note the vague reference: stirred concerns among whom? The articlewas written from the perspective of the government. Hell will freeze over beforethe New York Times will ever speak of the federal government’s terror campaignagainst anyone with an honest disagreement “stirring concerns” among the people.Why? Because Mr. Johnston has no connection to the real American people, only tothose in government. Like a good psy-ops (psychological operations) fear-monger,in his article Johnston also harped on other people being convicted, to makesure his readers remain scared to death of the IRS, despite Mr. Banister beingacquitted.In e-mail exchanges with me, Mr. Johnston also demonstrated the classicoutcome-based belief system, where the conclusion is everything (”Pay your fairshare!”), and how you reach that conclusion doesn’t matter. In an e-mail onJanuary 12, 2003, he claimed that “Section 861 itself makes all wages earned inthe US subject to tax whether paid by a domestic company or a foreign company.”In other words, he fell for all the cover-ups that have occurred to that part ofthe law over the years. So I showed him where 861 came from (Section 217 fromthe 1920s), and its subsequent evolution, and then asked two questions: 1) “DidSection 217 of the Revenue Act of 1921 show the domestic income of the averageAmerican to be taxable? ” (The answer to that is obviously “no.”) 2) “Has thescope of that section significantly changed between 1921 and the current Section861 and following? ” (Again, the evidence clearly shows the answer to be “no.”)After that, on February 1st, 2003, Mr. Johnston claimed that “Section 861 onlyapplies to 1) Those living in the United States who have income from outside ofthe United States. 2) Nonresident aliens who have taxable income from inside theUnited States. For everyone else, notably individuals who work in the UnitedStates for any employer, Section 861 is irrelevant.”So he basically went from “Section 861 means your income is taxable” to “Section861 isn’t about you at all.” Hilariously, after I publicly pointed out hisobvious flip-flop, he said “I have never done any about face.” He cut offfurther discussion by saying that when a judge agrees with me, he’ll payattention.Nice attitude in an investigative reporter: when the beneficiaries of a hugefraud admit that a fraud was committed, then he’ll pay attention. Not before.(”When a high priest endorses your wacky theory about the earth going around thesun, then I’ll pay attention. Until then, I hope they lock all of you astronomyprotestors up.”)2) ParrotingUnlike the first, this second type of media irresponsibility can often beattributed to good old-fashioned laziness, rather than some devious agenda. Whengiven the choice between having to go find out some actual facts, or using afive-minute phone call to get some juicy quote from a government official, mostreporters will do the latter: “‘These evil tax protestors should be burnedalive,’ said IRS Commissioner Ima Thugg.” This common method of lazy parrotingconverts the media into a mouthpiece for the government, rendering the FirstAmendment pointless. It’s not always easy to tell whether the reporter was justtrying to get out of doing the work of actually investigating the story orintentionally assisting the agenda of the extortion machine. Either way, theresult is the same.On more than one occasion I’ve personally seen most or all of an IRS or DOJ“press release” (read “demonize-and-threaten piece”) converted, with minimalchanges, into something that is then passed off as a “news” story. It’s hard toget any more biased than that: letting the government write the “news.” (Sincemy trial, the Bush administration has found itself with egg on its face, havingbeen caught doing just that: having government propaganda presented as newsitems.) I’m still waiting for the day when the non-reporters drop all pretenseand just print every article in this format:Associated Press - Washington, D.C.“[Complete 400-word government propaganda piece],” said officials yesterday. —by Laze E. PerrutOften the “news” stories about us “tax protestors” (which we aren’t)summarize—and mischaracterize—what we think, but then directly quote the oftencondescending, threatening statements of IRS Commissioners (e.g., CharlesRossotti, Mark Everson), or my own favorite character assassin, Eileen O’Connor,head of the “Tax Division” of the DOJ, and spewer of some of the most caustic,insulting, and inaccurate anti-861 drivel to come out of government (which isreally saying something). Hey Eileen, how about answering them darn questionswhen ya get a chance?In late November of 2004, the U.S. Attorney prosecuting Joseph Banister (formerIRS Special Agent) and a man named Al Thompson was quoted as saying this: “Theblatant and far-reaching defrauding of honest taxpayers by these two individualswarrants an aggressive federal prosecution. This case should serve as a starkreminder to our citizens that caution should be heeded when approached by thoseadvocating wild theories as to why one does not have to obey federal tax laws.”Mark Everson, IRS Commissioner and master question-evader, piled on, saying “JoeBanister, a former IRS agent, knew exactly what he was doing. Tax professionalsand employers who break the law will be held accountable.” Insult,mischaracterize, slander, demonize, and then attack, with the express purpose ofteaching the general public a lesson about what happens to dissenters. And themedia gives these terror tactics free publicity all the way, by passing off theparroting of government propaganda as “reporting.” (In Joseph Banister’s case,however, since the brave and noble Mr. Banister ultimately kicked thegovernment’s collective butt, they stopped talking about it.)3) LyingDavid Cay Johnston is a liar. I find it hilarious that he won the Pulitzer Prizefor his tax-related distorting—I mean reporting—in the New York Times. I guessthe Times is determined to uphold its reputation as a worthless rag written bychronic liars. Lots of reporters make mistakes, which is bad enough, but that’snot the same as lying. When, for example, Mr. Johnston “reported” that I believethat the federal tax laws are “invalid,” he was lying. When he “reported” that Ithink the income tax is unconstitutional, he was lying. In another “story,” inApril of 2004, Mr. Johnston said that Section 861 “explicitly states that withminor exceptions, all wages paid in the United States are taxable, a fact thateven Larken Rose, the leading promoter of the 861 position, acknowledges.”Another lie: I have never “acknowledged” any such thing, since it’s not true.But, as with all his other lies and mischaracterizations, he knew that only thetiniest percentage of his readers would ever think to research the issue forthemselves, so his lies would be accepted as fact.Having personally conversed with him at great length on the phone and by e-mail,I can attest to the fact that Mr. Johnston knows exactly what I believe, butover and over again has chosen to intentionally mischaracterize my conclusions,because telling the truth just didn’t fit his agenda. And what a coincidencethat in the seven or eight New York Times stories in which he has mentioned meby name, he has never seen fit to mention the web addresses of any of my websites. I guess enabling people to research issues for themselves also doesn’tinterest those at the Times. Oh, but wait: he did reference the “Quatloos”website—the one I mentioned before, which calls me a “human cockroach”—as anauthoritative site refuting “tax protestor” claims. Nice objective, balancedreporting, Mr. Johnston.I have concluded that the law shows that my income is not taxable. How hard canit possibly be to report that fact? Whatever they want to say afterward, andwhatever spin they choose to pile on, is it really so difficult for reporters toat least get the basic idea right? No. So why don’t they? Because if this issueever finds its way into a rational public debate, the fraud is over, and lots ofgovernment bureaucrats, officials, lawyers and judges are in deep doo-doo. Thegovernment is utterly incapable of refuting the evidence, so it has to dowhatever it can to avoid having people ever look at it. So our noble “publicservants” vilify anyone who raises the issue, call it “frivolous,”mischaracterize it, tell people that horrible things await them if they bring upthe issue, and so on. Luckily, we have the courageous media to expose the truth!Unluckily, the mainstream media, being as courageous as a neurotic rabbit, sayspretty much whatever those in government want it to say.In an e-mail to someone else (in early May of 2004), David Cay Johnston showedthat objectively reporting facts is not what he does; he is an advocate for thegovernment extortion machine. First, he said this: “As someone who is exhortingpeople to commit felonies, Mr. Rose’s conduct is a matter of significant publicinterest.” How is encouraging people to ask the government questions about howto obey the law the same as encouraging them to commit felonies? But his realagenda was revealed in another comment he made: “Exposing those who commitcrimes and providing the public with information about false claims is a publicservice.” His goal is not to report both sides: it is to convince people thatI’m a nasty criminal, and that my conclusions are incorrect.SLANDER THE MESSENGER!The ultimate lesson I learned regarding the degree to which the media serves asa propaganda arm for the government occurred in June of 2004, when someparticularly slimy feds decided to throw a particularly slimy accusation at me,totally unrelated to the tax issue. I will not assist their slander by detailingthe nature of it here, but the first I heard of it was when someone informed meof an article in a local newspaper eagerly spreading the defamation. When thegovernment eventually withdrew the bogus accusation, “because in the opinion ofthe attorneys for the United States such dismissal is in the interests ofjustice,” the paper—surprise, surprise—did not mention it. (As a result, somebusybodies, even in my home town, still gossip and theorize about theaccusation.) I’m not sure which is worse: a government that would try such atransparent and sleazy stunt in an attempt to publicly smear and discreditsomeone who says things the government doesn’t like, or a lazy media that wouldso eagerly help the government to do so. We’re lucky enough to have both.Coincidentally (maybe), three months before that stunt, in a message to mye-mail list, I talked about “what I would do if I was a slimy criminal bent onpreserving a trillion-dollar fraud (i.e. the federal income tax),” and the firstthing I suggested was to demonize anyone who was pointing out the truth by“publicly accus[ing] him of something heinous enough that most people wouldcower from wanting to be in any way associated with him.” I guess the feds readmy message and took my advice. It worked to a certain degree, though just aboutall of those who really know us could see right through the feds’ transparentstunt, and just got more angry at them.I am almost certain that the smear campaign was the idea of Floyd Miller, who“leaked” the accusation to the local newspaper before I had heard a word aboutit—a stunt that shocked even some feds I talked to. I must also note, however,that as far as I can tell, it was someone else at the DOJ—someone with somehonesty and integrity (if you can believe it)—who eventually put an end to thebogus accusation, but not before I had coughed up some serious bucks to retain adefense lawyer, not knowing what “evidence” the feds might try to fabricate.Isn’t it convenient for them how even accusations that they never follow throughon—in that case there was a public accusation, but no trial and noindictment—can still seriously damage the reputations and finances of anyonethey don’t like? In our lovely system, they don’t need someone to actually beguilty of anything in order to destroy him, thanks in large part to the lazymainstream media and the gullible public.THE “TAX HONESTY MOVEMENT”The main thing I learned about the people in “the movement”—which has gone frombeing called the “tax protestor movement” to the “tax honesty movement”—is thatthey think pretty much the way everyone else does, which is a good thing and abad thing. (I’ll explain further below.)The government likes to lump various people into the category of “taxprotestors,” even though often that is an inaccurate description. In addition tothe genuine tax protestors, the government works hard to stick that label onpeople to whom it doesn’t apply—people who are not “protesting” the law at all(including me). I have great respect for those who put themselves in harm’s wayby defying immoral laws through civil disobedience. As such, I consider thelabel of “tax protestor” to be a badge of honor. However, the label simplydoesn’t apply to me. I was not objecting to or refusing to comply with animmoral law; I was pointing out what the law actually says, and complying withit. So, by trying to remove the “tax protestor” label from myself, I’m notdisparaging those to whom the label accurately applies.In addition to the true “tax protestors”—those who simply object to the law onmoral, political or religious grounds—there are also a lot of people whobelieve, for various different and sometimes conflicting reasons, that mostAmericans don’t actually owe federal income taxes. Because they havesimilar-sounding “punchlines” (i.e., “We don’t have to pay!”), it’s all too easyfor the average spectator to become confused about who is saying what, so inmany people’s minds they all get lumped together into the category of “taxprotestors,” and the government goes to great lengths to encourage suchstereotyping. Just to give a taste of the theories that are out there—and todistinguish them from what I am saying—here are a few of the more populartheories about the federal income tax:1) Some claim that the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution was neverproperly ratified by enough of the states to make it valid. As a result, theyreason, the income tax itself is invalid, because what (supposedly) authorizedit is invalid. Personally, I don’t know or care at all whether the SixteenthAmendment was properly ratified. Why? Because, contrary to what many ingovernment and those who harp on the Sixteenth Amendment believe, thatamendment—whether ratified or not—did not give Congress any new taxing power,and is not the source of Congress’ power to impose an income tax. The SixteenthAmendment merely confirmed that federal income taxes are always “indirect”taxes, which need to be uniform but need not be apportioned. It did not createthe power to tax incomes—a power “possessed by Congress from the beginning” (Stanton v. Baltic Mining, 240 U.S. 103 (1916))—nor did it have any effect “onwhich incomes were subject to federal taxation” ( South Carolina v. Baker, 485U.S. 505 (1988)). So you can probably see why I don’t care whether it wasratified or not, and why I don’t bother arguing about it.2) Some claim that the federal income tax is “voluntary,” meaning that paymentis not legally required. This claim is based mainly upon the propaganda andrhetoric found in the IRS’s own publications and statements. But thegovernment’s frequent references to “voluntary compliance” with the tax laws isnothing more than Orwellian bullpoop. (Because most people file and pay beforebeing specifically threatened with punishment, the feds talk as if that makes it“voluntary.”) But the important thing to note here is that the law itself doesnot say that the tax is “voluntary.” One could say that someone who has no“taxable income” can nonetheless “volunteer” to pay a tax on what is legallyexempt income—which perhaps is why the IRS uses the rhetoric it does—but when itcomes to people who actually have taxable income, there is nothing “voluntary”about the tax.3) There are many variations on another claim, which says that the federal taxlaws apply only on federal land, such as Washington, D.C. and the federalterritories or possessions. Along the same lines, some argue that the term“United States,” as used in the federal tax laws, does not include the 50states. While I believe such a conclusion is a result of misunderstanding boththe statutes and the related court rulings—which I’ve explained in detail on myweb sites—those people are just arguing themselves into a corner anyway, sinceincome from outside the “United States” (whatever the meaning of the term) istaxable for U.S. citizens. (Some then try to escape that corner by arguing thatAmericans are really “nonresident aliens” and not citizens.)4) A lot of people over-generalize the issue into a statement like this: “Thereis no law that makes me liable to pay federal income taxes.” I agree, but for adifferent reason. Despite the IRS’s astonishing inability or unwillingness toanswer even answerable questions, a fairly simple answer they could give isthis: Section 6012 requires anyone who receives significant “gross income” tofile a tax return, and Section 6151 requires the one who files the return to paythe tax. Of course, if all of your income is exempt, i.e., if you have no “grossincome”—which is what the 861 evidence is all about—then that answer doesn’tanswer anything.5) Some argue that the Fifth Amendment makes it illegal for the feds to forcepeople to sign tax returns, since those returns can be used against them incourt, making such returns “forced confessions.” To be fair, they have a point.Unfortunately, the black-robed tyranny-justifiers have done all manner oflogical tap-dancing to get around that claim, often contradicting each other inthe process. In this case, it’s not so much that I disagree with the claim, butthat I think it is a lot less important than whether we owe the tax to beginwith. As a matter of PR, if a person believes that he owes the tax, but refusesto file a return based on Fifth Amendment issues, most people would view him asbeing a greedy sneak who is trying to get out of paying his fair share. I wouldmuch rather be able to demonstrate that I don’t actually owe the tax, ratherthan showing that I found some sneaky way to get out of paying what I owe.6) One of the most common claims out there is that wages—getting paid for doingwork—do not constitute “income.” There are several variations on that argument,but they usually end by concluding that only corporate profits or paymentsreceived from the government constitute “income,” while the wages of the averageAmerican do not. Note, arguing that one received no “income” is not the same asarguing that one’s wages are not taxable income. Again, I won’t bother with thethorough rebuttal to the “wages aren’t income” claim here, as I’ve done on myweb sites, but I will mention that over the years, the tax statutes andregulations have used about every term I can think of—including “compensation,”“wages,” “remuneration,” and “salaries”—to describe getting paid for doing work,listing it as a type of “income” that can be taxed ( if it derives from ataxable “source” or activity). The Supreme Court has repeatedly said that“income” means the gain derived from labor, from capital, or from both.Those are just a few of the myriad of unorthodox claims out there having to dowith federal taxes. Based on my experience, I believe that most of the time (notalways), such claims are advanced by well-intentioned people who honestlybelieve what they are saying. I happen to think they are dead wrong. However, Iwould never in a million years try to force them to shut up, nor would Iprosecute them for doing what they believe the law requires (which is not acrime). You see, unlike our wonderful “public servants,” I don’t believe thatsomeone having a different opinion from mine gives me the right to try to robhim, harass him, prosecute him, and put him in a cage.To wit, I believe that what the DOJ has done to Mr. Irwin Schiff, whose legalconclusions I very much disagree with, amounts to murder. I sincerely hope thatMr. Schiff lives to see freedom after his third prison sentence, at which pointhe would be almost ninety years old. Regardless of any academic disagreements Ihave with him, I have never seen a shred of evidence indicating that Mr. Schiffdoes not believe what he is saying, and therefore I have no reason to think hehas committed a crime. The treatment he has received at the hands of the“Federal Mafia”—Mr. Schiff’s own very accurate term for the federalgovernment—is a despicable abomination in a country which still pretends to careabout freedom and justice.So let me be perfectly clear. I don’t want anything I write here to be construedas condoning, even in the slightest degree, the abuses and oppressions imposedby the government upon those with views contrary to mine. If someone is mistakenor confused, correct him with answers and evidence, not with the heel of ajackboot.UNDERSTANDERS VERSUS BELIEVERSNow for the depressing news. In my experience, the majority of people in “themovement” do what almost everyone else does: they base their beliefs upon whatsounds nice, what looks snazzy, and what they want to believe. Many of them areno more objective, and put no more effort into understanding the law, than JohnQ. Public does. As a result, “fad” theories constantly appear, disappear, andreappear within the movement, gaining support one month and losing it the next(often after someone is silenced or convicted). There seem to be a lot of“fair-weather friends” available to anyone who wants to fling a theory outthere, whether or not it is backed by any evidence.I have long believed that a split in the “movement” is both inevitable andnecessary. The “believers” (the ones who take things on faith because they soundnice) and the “understanders” (the ones who objectively research things forthemselves) just do not function the same way, and despite apparently havingcommon goals, they are fundamentally at odds with each other.As I have said before, much to the chagrin of many in the “movement,” one of thethings that has done the most to keep the income tax deception alive is the “taxhonesty movement.” By constantly putting out incorrect, sometimes downrightgoofy theories about the tax laws, it has only reinforced the impression in theminds of the general public that “tax protestors” are all clueless wackos. Infact, if I were a really slimy politician, I would want to support people whomake provably incorrect arguments, in order to discredit all of those whodisagree with conventional wisdom, using guilt-by-association tactics. “Oh, he’sjust another one of those silly tax protestors who doesn’t want to pay his fairshare.” Even when the nonconformists have the best of intentions, their effortsoften end up doing more harm than good, simply because they inadvertently addmore confusion and error to the discussion, instead of more truth.Even in prison, I’ve received letters from people who mean well, but who insiston praising and promoting the new “silver bullet” theory du jour—which isneither new nor correct—in hopes of slaying the IRS beast. In short, most peoplejust want to save themselves from the federal extortion machine.Though that’s a noble goal in itself, one result is that hardly anyone wants togo to the trouble of finding out what is actually true, before latching on tosome supposed cure for the problem. People just want something to believe in,someone to follow. The results are rarely pleasant.The government has, on occasion, spoken of my “followers” or my “adherents.”Though I suppose I may actually have some of them, that is not at all what Iwant. I want only fellow understanders, who insist on seeing and understandingthe evidence for themselves. Thankfully, there are quite a few of them outthere. And those people cannot be swayed by the outcome of a trial, or aninsulting form letter, or a threat from some IRS goon. Yes, they might be scaredinto obedience, but the truth cannot be wrenched from their minds by any amountof vilification, obfuscation, or terrorization. They know the truth, they passit on to others like themselves, and so the truth will live on.Unfortunately, there are also a lot of fad-followers, who flit from one“argument” to the next, never really understanding any of them, and neverknowing what is true and what isn’t. (Apparently some still believe that if Ihad relied on their pet theory, or said certain magic words in court, I wouldhave been acquitted. They don’t want to hear about those who said just what theysuggest and ended up in prison anyway.) Of course, I’m not saying people shouldignore everything except the 861 evidence. On the contrary, all sorts oftheories and claims should be looked into, as I looked into them long before Iever heard of 861. But all claims should be investigated with an open mind: opento the possibility that they are true and open to the possibility that they arefalse. Not many people seem to want to do that, and the truth suffers for it. Iadmit, it’s a lot of trouble having to find the truth for yourself, especiallywhen highly paid lawyers have spent almost a century trying to make itimpossible to find or understand, and when an avalanche of incorrect theories isalmost burying it. On the other hand, it’s really easy to blindly believewhatever someone asserts to be true, whether it’s your CPA saying “Of course youowe it,” or some crazy dude like me saying “We don’t owe this tax.”History is replete with prolonged, unnecessary injustices and hardships whichwere the direct result of people not wanting to think. I wish I thought thefuture looked better. From where I stand right now, it doesn’t.LESSONS ABOUT THE AMERICAN PUBLICThe main thing that I learned over the past few years about the American publicis that it consists mostly of unthinking, authority-worshiping imbeciles. If Iseem a tad bitter, it’s because I am. (Maybe even more than a tad, whatever a“tad” is.) After twelve randomly selected village idiots, representing theAmerican people, had a front-row seat to the trial described above, they decidedto declare me guilty of a crime I didn’t commit. So if I can’t resist using afew less-than-complimentary terms to describe the jurors in my case—such asmorons, twits, dolts, birdbrains, imbeciles, buffoons, numskulls, jackasses,blockheads, idiots, dimbulbs, lamebrains, boneheads, bozos, fools, and soon—please keep in mind that I am currently in prison, instead of at home with myfriends and family, due to their profound stupidity and utterly asinine verdict,resulting from their intellectual and legal irresponsibility and negligence.While pondering the thought process the jurors must have employed in reachingtheir verdict, I was forced to conclude that actual thought played no part intheir decision. Had they actually understood the nature of the crime I wasaccused of, they would have known that they were required to give a verdict of“not guilty” if they even had a doubt about whether I believed I owed the tax.Conversely, to justify a guilty verdict, every single one of the jurors wouldhave had to conclude that the government had proven, beyond any reasonabledoubt, that I believe my income to be taxable. The prosecution introducedexactly no evidence of that, because none exists. In fact, the prosecution neveractually got around to accusing me of believing my income was taxable. Instead,the prosecution’s message to the jury was that I should have decided that myconclusions were wrong. And why was that? Because I was aware of several legallyworthless, non-binding, unsupported assertions from IRS paper-pushers and lowercourt judges saying I was wrong. Even if you accept the silly notion that thosethings should have made me just discard my many-years-long, intense academicstudy of the issue, what I “should” have believed is entirely irrelevant to theactual crime alleged. And despite the fact that the feds never got around toalleging one of the essential elements of the crime—kind of like chargingsomeone with murder without alleging that someone had been killed—theirdemonization routine was enough to get a dozen boneheads to proclaim me to be acriminal.And persuading the twits wasn’t very hard. Throughout the trial, some of thejurors were hardly paying attention at all, doing their nails, occasionallydozing off. Several people noticed that one female juror, who was inexplicablyfriendly and familiar with the court clerk, would pay rapt attention wheneverthe prosecutors were speaking, but would never even look at me when I wasspeaking. I’ve given a lot of talks to a lot of people, and I’ve never seen aless attentive audience in my life. Granted, they were there against their will,but when you have someone’s freedom in your hands, you ought to pay attention!The fact that twelve out of twelve jurors had to all reach the same wrongconclusion shows that unthinking boneheadedness is common. And the fact thatequally boneheaded verdicts were given in other cases, by other juries—in mywife’s case, in Dr. Tom Clayton’s trial, in Richard Simkanin’s trial, and othersin which there was no evidence of “willfulness”—again demonstrates that theinability to think is pretty darn widespread in this country.Sometime after the trial, a person claiming to be one of the jurors in my caseposted something online whining about the “jury-bashing” and “unfair criticismand insults” coming from my supporters, saying he didn’t appreciate the “viciousslander” against the jurors. (Oh, boohoo. Try sitting in prison for a year for acrime you didn’t commit, jackass. Then you can whine to me about unfairness.) Asfar as I can tell, the messages did come from one of the jurors: a young collegetwerp whose name I won’t divulge. After acknowledging that they were out foronly 90 minutes, including lunch, Mr. Juror stated that that was because they“simply felt that there was not much to deliberate.” The evidence, he said,“spoke very loudly and clearly” that I was guilty on all counts. Then he saidthis: “As press releases have stated, we found very quickly that Mr. Rose didnot possess a ‘good-faith’ understanding of the law, as was one of the elementsrequired to be proven for a not-guilty verdict.” One of the elements the defensehad to prove to get an acquittal?! Of course, as the judge repeatedly instructed(e.g., “Larken Rose does not have the burden of proving good faith”)—and as mostAmericans ought to know anyway—the defense doesn’t have to prove anything; thedefendant is to be assumed innocent unless and until the government proves everyelement beyond a reasonable doubt. And how had I not demonstrated that Ihonestly believed my income to be tax-exempt? Did they all sleep through myexplanation of the issue? Maybe they were too stupid to grasp my position, sothey decided to just ignore it.Mr. Juror then responded to various messages of disgust concerning how cheerfuland carefree the jurors appeared when leaving (two of them arranging a date forlater): “Why shouldn’t we be upbeat after the trial? We did what we felt was ourcivic duty, and we had every intent to continue on with our lives—I think itbears no indication on our deliberation that we were jovial after the trial.”Actually, it bears on the fact that they took no responsibility upon themselves;they rubber-stamped the government’s inquisition, and went on their way.When someone I know started asking Mr. Juror questions about the 861 evidence—inan infinitely more polite and patient manner than I would have—Mr. Jurorresponded that “our charge was not to actually look at the substance of the lawand decide whether Mr. Rose’s arguments or the instructed law were correct,” andthat instead their verdict was about “the concept of a ‘good-faithmisunderstanding’ of vs. a disagreement with the law.” That would be fine, ifthey knew what they were supposed to be deciding, and if they had bothered totake the evidence into account. The jury, Mr. Juror said, decided that I “didnot in fact possess a good-natured misunderstanding of the law, which wasdescribed in the charge as being absent of ill will.” “Good-natured”? Where theheck did that come from? So I was supposed to be more cheerful in mydisagreement with the IRS paper-pushers?!Actually, the jury instructions properly defined “willfulness” to mean “doing avoluntary, deliberate and intentional act, knowing the conduct was unlawful andintending to do something that the law forbid.” (I don’t see anything in thereabout being cheerful or good-natured, do you?) Funny how the jury saw only thoseparts of the instructions that the government wanted them to see (and wantedthem to misunderstand). The instructions did mention an absence of “ill will,”in trying to define what “good faith” means, which was completely inapplicablein this context. Whether I like the IRS, and whether I’m nice to them, hasnothing to do with whether I believe I owe the tax.Twice Mr. Juror stated that I didn’t take the “proper steps” to test my“argument,” which (of course) would be asking a “judge”—a beneficiary of thefraud—to tell me whether I was right. Golly, I wonder where they got the ideathat that would be the only “proper step” for me to take. He then said thatinstead of taking the proper steps of asking a “judge” whether I was right, I“opted to taunt the IRS for a prosecution, and racked up an impressive historyof threatening statements regarded [sic] them.” Threatening statements?! Wow,these people’s brains are like Silly Putty: squish on the government-approvedmessage, and it sticks. I never threatened anyone, but the federal liars, withtheir harping on the paranoia of IRS doofi (plural of “doofus”), managed to makethese mush-headed sheep hallucinate actual threats being made.So the jury fell—hook, line and sinker—for the garbage spewed by the government:that they should decide what I believed based upon my attitude toward the IRS(including non-existent threats), and my failure to sue the IRS. Um, what aboutmy legal analysis of the law itself? What about the reason I believe I don’t owethe tax? Nope, that doesn’t matter. Gack.WE DO WHAT WE’RE TOLDWhile my current locale (a federal “prison camp”) is much preferable to a “real”prison, it’s not preferable to being at home with my wife and kid. My daughter,who just turned nine, doesn’t get to have her daddy at home for a year. My wifehas to hold our world together by herself until I get out. Yes, compared withwhat a lot of other people have been through, this may not seem like much. Butto me it’s pretty damn serious. So why did it happen? You might say—and now Iwould agree—that it was my own dang fault for having any hope that a jury,presumably of my peers (yeah, right), might have done anything differently. Butwhy did they decide the way they did? It certainly was not because I was provenguilty of any crime. And though I bash the intelligence (or lack thereof) of thejurors in my case, mere stupidity can’t explain it either. After all, stupidjuries can say “not guilty,” too. So why did they unanimously declare me guiltyof a crime which I not only did not commit, but which the government camenowhere near even suggesting that I committed?Let me answer that question with a little seemingly irrelevant historicalperspective. How many people have considered the atrocities of Hitler’s ThirdReich and wondered aloud, “How could that have happened?” Were Germansespecially evil? No. Were they stupid? No. So how did it happen? The mostthorough and most disturbing answer I can think of comes from Dr. StanleyMilgram, who conducted very interesting (and controversial) studies having to dowith human psychology and behavior, the results of which are to be found in hisbook, Obedience to Authority (which I highly recommend). Here is thesuper-condensed, slightly oversimplified overview:The experiment Dr. Milgram and his cohorts were pretending to conduct workedlike this: Volunteers would help study whether human memory could be improved byzapping people with electricity when they gave the wrong answers to memoryquestions. However, the volunteers doing the zapping were the real subjects ofthe experiment, while the “zappees” were only actors (who weren’t really beingzapped). In short, the question Dr. Milgram was actually exploring was “To whatextent will average people inflict pain and suffering on others, simply becausea perceived ‘authority’ tells them to? ” (I bet you can guess where this isgoing.)The answer to that question, as illustrated all too gruesomely in the results ofthe experiments, shocked even Dr. Milgram. To skip the gory details, most of theaverage folk studied were willing to inflict what they believed wereexcruciatingly painful, possibly lethal jolts of electricity upon innocentstrangers, simply because a perceived “authority” told them to do so. Thezappers would often sweat, tremble, object, or even cry, but when “authority”told them to press that button, they would do it, even if the “zappee” loudlyobjected, screamed in pain, complained of heart problems, or feignedunconsciousness.And that is how I was found “guilty” of my supposed crime. It had nothing to dowith evidence or law. “Authority” told twelve people to “zap” me, and they did.Like good little Nazis, they did their civic duty and inflicted harm uponwhomever government told them to harm. It’s no more complicated than that.And remember, in Milgram’s experiments the “zappees” were pretending to be justnormal folk. As you can imagine, even a little dose of demonization of thetarget will make the common man even more likely to hurt someone when“authority” tells him to. In my case, after the government had finished chanting“A witch! A witch!” the jurors probably had very little go through their(alleged) minds other than “We file, he not file. We obey, he not obey. We good,he bad. Burn witch! Ooga.” The same holds true for whichever beanheads on thegrand jury voted to indict. Had I been in an electric chair at the time of theverdict, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if Floyd Miller could have gotten thosetwelve jackasses to pull the switch and fry me on the spot.Forget the law, evidence, proof, logic, reason, or any of that other irrelevantstuff. The “Milgram factor,” along with a little vilification and ostracization(“He’s not one of us!”) was all it took. Guilty of nonconformity! Burn him!Thanks loads for considering things objectively, you bunch of dumbasses.This also brings to mind the experiments regarding human psychology conducted bySolomon Asch. To summarize, the test subjects were to look at a series of linesand indicate which lines were of equal length. In reality, all but one of the“subjects” were in on the scheme, and would all give the same wrong answer, tosee how that would affect the answer of the one real test subject (who wouldgive his answer last). Quite commonly, the test subject would give the samewrong answer as the others, even though the truth was staring him in the face,thus demonstrating that people will often believe and/or say whatever they thinkeveryone else believes and/or says, whether or not there is any rational basisfor it.Likewise, my jurors, knowing nothing about the law themselves, must haveconcluded that I couldn’t have believed what I was saying, because everyone else(as far as they knew) was saying something else. I am convinced that they were“projecting” onto me their own inability to think independently: they couldn’timagine believing something contrary to what “everyone” thinks, not to mentioncontrary to what self-proclaimed “authorities” had stated, so they couldn’timagine me believing it either. Basically, I was convicted because my jurorsdidn’t have the mental capacity to hold an unorthodox belief.I’ve observed this same phenomenon many times. I can’t count how many people Iknow who have confidently and firmly declared, without a doubt, that myconclusions are incorrect, despite those people knowing absolutely nothing aboutthe issue, or about the law. They exhibit an attitude of “I don’t know whatexactly you’re claiming, but you’re wrong.” Not exactly the sign of open-minded,objective analysis. And some of them are people I’ve known for years, and whootherwise consider me to be both honest and intelligent. The loyalty to “whateveryone knows” is so profound in most people that mere evidence and logiccannot shake it. I am evil, in the eyes of many, because I believe somethingthey don’t believe. Never mind why I believe it; that doesn’t matter. Whatmatters is that I said “B” when everyone else was saying “A,” and that is notallowed. Others I know who did take the time to examine the issue, and as aresult came to agree with me, have also become targets of animosity and disdainfrom the conformist ignoramus brigade.I should add that I am very grateful that the punishment I received from ourstupid system for the crime I didn’t commit is about as bad as a stubbed toecompared to the punishments tens of millions of other nonconformists havereceived under the stupid systems of Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Pol Pot, etc. I am notat all trying to compare the severity of the injustice in my case to whathappened under those other regimes. There is no comparison. But the basicproblems of authority-worship, blind obedience, pack mentality, and a generalinability to actually think are the same the world over and throughout history.Yes, even here, in the good old U.S. of A., where twelve people will put you inprison for trying to save them from being defrauded by their own government.Based upon comments I’ve heard, first- and second-hand, from lots of otherpeople, I don’t think my twelve jurors were an anomaly. Most people seem to fitquite well into the mold of unthinking sheep, eager to condemn anyone who is notlike them, judgmental about things they know nothing about, and reluctant tolift a finger to find out for themselves what is true and what is not. Afterspending many years speaking out about this fraud, and after Tessa and I put ourfreedom on the line to resist it, even most of the people we know personallystill have never invested half an hour to find out what it is we’re saying (muchless bothered to find out if it’s true). With friends like these...IN CONCLUSIONIf you were hoping for a happy ending to this book, sorry to disappoint you. Themain lesson I have learned, and want to share, is this: the American peopledon’t care if they are being oppressed, controlled, robbed, and generallystomped upon by their government, as long as the tyrants promise to protect andtake care of them. And not only is that a far more serious problem than anyparticular abuse of power, it is what allows abuses of power in the first place.Just like those oppressed by the Soviet empire, or the Third Reich, or the firstcaveman to declare himself chief, each American is so afraid of “making waves”that he never moves a muscle, and we all sink together into the sea of tyranny.And if one does try to swim, the others can be counted on to immediately try todrown him. In short, the American people are getting exactly what they askedfor, and what most of them deserve: tyranny. And I apologize for trying todeprive them of that.The ultimate illustration of just how much trouble we’re in is the amazinglyhigh percentage of people who, when confronted with the allegation that theirown government has been lying to them, robbing them, extorting them, andcommitting the biggest financial fraud in history, instinctively respond, firstand foremost, not with righteous indignation or even curiosity, but withconcerns about what might happen if the government had less money. “But ifyou’re right, how will the government function?” In a country where the peopledon’t seem to mind being illegally defrauded of a trillion dollars a year—whichaverages out to about $4,000 per man, woman and child in the country, everyyear—by their own government no less, it’s a safe bet that the government willhave a long, prosperous life. And freedom will die.“Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, noconstitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it.” [Supreme CourtJustice Learned Hand]If anyone knows a way to prevent that, please let me know. I gave it a shot, butso far it hasn’t worked out so well.ATTEMPTING TO END ON A HIGH NOTEPeople often ask me if I regret what I did. Obviously I regret the inconvenienceand suffering my family has had to go through because of my efforts, and Iregret having failed to win what would have been a huge victory for the truthand a huge blow to tyranny. But even if I wish I had done some thingsdifferently, I do not regret telling the truth, and resisting the fraud,regardless of the outcome.Since at the moment I’m finding it difficult to come up with something upliftingto say myself, and since I’d like to at least try to end this book on somethingvaguely resembling an upbeat note, I will end by quoting two brilliant,courageous people: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas—a man who knowsfirst-hand what it’s like to be maligned and persecuted by power-happycrooks—and my wife, who also knows what that’s like. First, here are someexcerpts from a speech given by Clarence Thomas:You had better not engage in serious debate or discussion unless you are willingto endure attacks that range from mere hostile bluster to libel. ... Today, noone can honestly claim surprise at the venomous attacks against those who takepositions that are contrary to the canon laid down by those who claim to shapeopinions. Such attacks have been standard fare for some time. ... In my humbleopinion, those who come to engage in debates of consequence, and who challengeaccepted wisdom, should expect to be treated badly. Nonetheless, they must standundaunted. That is required. And, that should be expected. For, it is braverythat is required to secure freedom. ... Even if one has a valid position, and isintellectually honest, he has to anticipate nasty responses aimed at themessenger rather than the argument. The objective is to limit the range of thedebate, the number of messengers, and the size of the audience. The aim is topressure dissenters to sanitize their message, so as to avoid being subjected tohurtful ad hominem criticism. Who wants to be calumniated? It’s not worth thetrouble.But is it worth it? Just what is worth it, and what is not? If one wants to bepopular, it is counterproductive to disagree with the majority. If one justwants to tread water until the next vacation, it isn’t worth the agony. If onejust wants to muddle through, it is not worth it. In my office, a little signreads: “To avoid criticism, say nothing, do nothing, be nothing.” ... We allshare a reasonable and, in many ways, admirable, reluctance to leave the safetyand peacefulness of private life to take up the larger burdens and challenges ofactive citizenship. ...When one of my friends began feeling the urge to getinvolved, his spouse glared at him and said, “Don’t even think about it. We loveour life the way it is.” And that is not an unreasonable perspective, not atall. But is reasonableness always our standard of review on this question? Ihope not. ... I do believe that we are required to wade into those things thatmatter to our country and our culture, no matter what the disincentives are, andno matter the personal cost. There is not one among us who wants to be set upon,or obligated to do and say difficult things. Yet, there is not one of us whocould in good conscience stand by and watch a loved one or a defenselessperson—or a vital national principle—perish alone, undefended, when ourintervention could make all the difference.... If we think that something is dreadfully wrong, then someone has to dosomething.And finally, I leave you with these words from my wife, which I forwarded to mye-mail list in early March of 2005, several months before we were put on trial.(Yes, I know how lucky I am to have such a person on my side and by my side.)It’s the most positive message I could find with which to end the telling ofthis tale.Ten years ago, the prospect of being indicted would have been frightening andstressful to me. But I was a different person ten years ago. The experiences ofthe last few years have thickened my skin and strengthened my resolve. One ofthe hardest things about the last few years has been waiting and waiting forthings to happen. So this indictment is a relief. Things are finally movingtoward our long-held goal of bringing this issue to court.I would so love to be past all this, living a peaceful life again. But the onlyway out of this is right through it. From the beginning, there has never beenanother way out. I have tried, at times, to imagine a way to back up and somehowstop doing this, but I cannot. Once you understand the law, you can’tun-understand it. Once you understand that your income isn’t taxable, you’recommitting felonious perjury if you sign a return saying that it is. Once youunderstand that millions of people are being defrauded, you’re killing your ownsoul if you keep quiet about it.Every year, people in government grow more lawless, more arrogant, and morenumerous. And their victims quietly submit, enjoying their lives in the hopethat the thing they enjoy most won’t be outlawed next. They see water runningthrough a hole in the dyke, and they get out of the way so they won’t get wet.At some point, don’t we have to ask ourselves what we want for our children andgrandchildren? If we think the government is too big to fight now, how much morepowerful will it be in 20 or 40 years? Especially if no one resists it? Do wewant our children to drown because we were afraid to plug the hole in the dyke?Does anyone really think they are creating a better life for their kids byallowing civil rights and the rule of law to perish? Rights don’t survivebecause they’re written on a piece of paper somewhere; they survive becausepeople fight for them, as we’re fighting for them right now. The governmentwants Larken to shut up—if their tactics succeed, what does it matter thatAmericans have freedom of speech on paper? What good are elected representativesand written laws if, in practice, bureaucrats can just tell you what to doregardless of the law?I’ve heard people say that you only destroy your own life by taking on a battlelike this. The implication is that if you fight and lose, then you were wrong tofight. I guess they’re right if a relatively peaceful, oppressed lifetime istheir highest value. It’s not mine. I value a free society, in which generationafter generation can experience peace and prosperity, in which all of ourchildren and grandchildren and great-grandchildren can make their dreams cometrue. Every action, large and small, must be judged in light of that value. Am Ifurthering what I value, or am I contributing to its demise? Whatever I choose,I will have to live with having made that choice. We are all on trial in thegreat court of history, and our great-grandchildren will judge our generationwith clear eyes.Some people think I’m brave. Well, no, not really. I’ll never go sky diving orrock climbing. But I have only one life to live, one life with which to make adifference in the world, or not. If I’m afraid of anything, I guess I’m afraidof being a person whose life didn’t matter, just one more ordinary person whocowered in safety and let things get worse.If we go to trial and lose, that will really suck. But it won’t negate the truthwe’ve brought to light, or the resistance we’ve made to the growth of rampanttyranny. Every act of resistance makes tyranny weaker. Many, many acts ofresistance, even small ones, can topple it. I don’t wish suffering on myself oranyone else, but I am proud of people who have stood up for truth and justicewhen it was dangerous to do so. And I’ll be proud to BE one of those people, nomatter what happens to me.Tessa David Rose"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX ATAXABLE INCOMETHE EVOLUTION OF A DECEPTION(Revised 3/8/2008)by Larken RoseINTRODUCTIONFor centuries the phrase “paying your taxes” has been used to express acitizen’s duty to his country. But while most feel an obligation to pay theirtaxes, very few feel personally qualified to figure out just what their taxesare. Instead, they hire tax professionals, whose determinations seem to be onepart accounting and two parts witchcraft. An astounding amount of money is spentevery year, not just on the taxes themselves, but on paying tax experts to delveinto the treacherous jungle of the federal tax code and come out with a solidnumber representing the client’s tax liability.It’s no secret, however, that different tax-law witch doctors will end up withdifferent bottom lines, based upon the same set of financial facts—strengtheningeven more the impression that deciphering the tax laws is more like astrologythan mathematics. In fact, it is all but universally conceded now, including bytop government officials, that the tax code is indecipherable, and that no onetruly understands it all, or has even read it all. None other than AlbertEinstein is quoted as saying, “The hardest thing in the world to understand isthe income tax.” Nonetheless, tens of millions of Americans are expected tocomply with it every year, even though no one knows for sure what all itrequires.As it turns out, however, the United States federal tax code contains somethingfar more sinister than its outrageous complexity. And though this “something” isadmittedly complex, with a little effort it can be known and understood, even bythose unaccustomed to dealing with the legalese voodoo of the tax code.(Ironically, it is those who are arrogant enough to believe that they alreadyunderstand everything about the tax laws who seem to be the least able tounderstand and accept the incriminating evidence found in the labyrinth of lawbooks.)The evidence to be found by those who dare to look does not reveal merecomplexity, contradiction, and unfairness in the tax code—none of which would belikely to surprise anyone—but instead shows something far more disturbing andmore devious: not a mistake or a loophole, but a premeditated, prolonged,concerted effort to deceive and defraud the American public, to the tune of wellover one trillion dollars ($1,000,000,000,000) every year.Some dismiss out of hand anything they view as a “conspiracy theory,” and thelarger the alleged conspiracy, the less likely they are to believe it. Amultitrillion-dollar deception will, therefore, be rejected out of hand asridiculous by many people, regardless of the evidence. Albert Einstein also saidthat the highest form of arrogance is “condemnation before investigation.” Forthose who dare to follow the evidence wherever it leads, the facts can speak forthemselves. What follows is evidence of the largest financial fraud in history,perpetrated by agents of the United States government.A NEW KIND OF COUNTRYAfter the American Revolution, in which the American colonies won theirindependence from England, there was vigorous debate over the form of governmentthat should be installed. The “federalists” won out, and the result was theConstitution for the United States of America. The essence of the plan was quitesimple: the governments of the individual states (formerly colonies) wouldretain their power, and each would, for the most part, continue as a sovereignentity. At the same time, there would be a union among the states, and a“federal” government which would handle certain specific matters concerning theseveral states. Issues such as postal routes, military-related matters,regulating commerce crossing state and country borders, and a few others, werethought to be better handled centrally, rather than different states handlingsuch things in different ways. However, it was also agreed that the powersdelegated to the federal government were to be strictly limited to specifictasks, and that all other powers would still belong to the people and the stategovernments. James Madison, often called the “Father of the Constitution,”summed this up quite well:“The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government arefew and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerousand indefinite.” [James Madison, Federalist #45]In fact, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution (part of the Bill ofRights) were written specifically to make it clear that the federal governmentwas not to do anything other than what the Constitution specifically empoweredit to do.“The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, norprohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or tothe people.” [Tenth Amendment, U.S. Constitution]THE POWER TO TAXArticle I, Section 8 of the Constitution lists the powers that the federalgovernment is authorized to exercise within the states. The list begins bysaying that Congress was to have the power “to lay and collect taxes,” which ofcourse was needed to provide the funding necessary for the federal government tocarry out its other duties. It was not long, however, before disputes aroseabout the extent of the taxing powers of the state and federal governments. Someargued that “the power to tax is the power to destroy,” thereby concluding thatif a government was not at liberty to regulate or forbid something, it alsoshould not be allowed to tax it.“[No] state has the right to lay a tax on interstate commerce in any form[because] such taxation is a burden on that commerce, and amounts to aregulation of it, which belongs solely to congress. This is the result of somany recent cases that citation is hardly necessary.” [Leloup v. Port of Mobile,127 U.S. 640 (1888)]This raises the question: If Congress can regulate only certain matters insidethe states, might it be able to tax only these matters as well? The U.S.Constitution does not spell out exactly what Congress can tax, but provides twosets of rules for two basic types of taxes, into which all federal taxes can becategorized: “direct” taxes and “indirect” taxes.Direct Taxes: So-called “direct” taxes include per capita taxes (“head taxes”)and property taxes, and under the Constitution all such “direct” taxes arerequired to be divided up (”apportioned”) among the various states in proportionto the population of each state. (So, for example, if Pennsylvania had twice thepopulation of North Carolina, it would pay twice as big a portion of the overallnational tax.) Such “direct” taxes have been used only a very few times by thefederal government.Indirect Taxes: The other category of taxes, called “indirect” taxes, includesimport/export taxes as well as “excise” taxes. The Supreme Court sums up whatbelongs in this category: “customs and excise duties imposed on importation,consumption, manufacture, and sale of certain commodities, privileges,particular business transactions, vocations, occupations, and the like.”1[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote1] Instead of being apportioned, “indirect” taxesneed only be geographically uniform, meaning they are applied the samethroughout the entire country. Numerous “excise” taxes have been imposed by thefederal government over the years, on everything from oleomargarine to wagering,and from distilling whiskey to manufacturing machine guns. In fact, all currentfederal taxes are “indirect” taxes.WHERE DOES AN INCOME TAX FIT?At this point an astute observer might notice that a general, all-inclusiveincome tax does not fit well within either category: it is not a tax on propertyownership per se, nor is it a tax on particular commodities or activities. Sowhere would a general federal income tax fit in the Constitutional design?The first federal income taxes were imposed in the 1860s, and it was not longbefore the “direct” versus “indirect” question made it to the Supreme Court.This eventually led to the ruling in Pollock v. Farmers Loan & Trust, (157 U.S.429 (1895)), in which the Supreme Court threw out the federal income tax asbeing unconstitutional. The court concluded that a tax on income which comesfrom owning property (e.g., interest and dividends) is in essence a tax on theproperty itself, which would belong in the category of “direct” taxes. Andbecause the income tax was not apportioned, as all direct taxes must be, it wasdeemed invalid. (Of note, the Court explained that its reasoning would not applyto income from things other than property ownership, such as wages, but it stillthrew out the entire tax, saying it was not at liberty to divide a law intopieces and then throw out only some of them.) Unfortunately, the conclusive answer to the “direct” versus “indirect” debate,which came in the form of the 16th Amendment (in 1913), caused more confusionthan clarity. That amendment reads as follows:“The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, fromwhatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, andwithout regard to any census or enumeration.” [16th Amendment, U.S.Constitution]The wording of that amendment quickly convinced a lot of people of two things:1) Though the income tax is a “direct” tax, it does not need to be apportioned.2) Congress had acquired the power to tax any income it wanted to.While both of those conclusions are somewhat understandable based upon thewording of the amendment, both also happen to be dead wrong: the amendment didnot authorize an unapportioned “direct” tax, and it did not allow Congress totax all income from anywhere.The Supreme Court, on more than one occasion, has made it abundantly clear thatthe 16th Amendment, rather than authorizing an unapportioned “direct” tax,merely confirmed once and for all that the federal income tax “inherentlybelongs” in the category of “indirect” taxes, which must apply uniformlythroughout the country, but which do not need to be apportioned 2[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote2]. In reality, therefore, the 16th was more of aclarification than an amendment, as it did not actually alter Congress’ taxingpowers.LIMITS ON THE TAXING POWERFar more significant than the misunderstanding about academic issues related to“direct” and “indirect” taxes is the false impression which the 16th Amendmentcreated that, after the amendment was enacted, there were no longer any limitsupon what Congress could tax, and that Congress could then tax all income,coming from anywhere and received by anyone, as the phrase “from whatever sourcederived” implies.Once again, the Supreme Court made it clear that this is not the case. The Courthas clearly ruled that the 16th Amendment “conferred no new power of taxation”upon Congress (which the Secretary of the Treasury officially agreed with inTreasury Decision 2303), in addition to ruling that the amendment “does notextend the taxing power to new or excepted subjects” 3[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote3], that it did not “render anything taxable asincome that was not so taxable before”4 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote4], and infact that the words “from whatever source derived” used in the amendment werenot intended to have any effect “on which incomes were subject to federaltaxation”5 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote5].(Interestingly, in a dissenting opinion regarding another issue entirely, oneSupreme Court justice explained the point that “a literal reading of a provisionof the Constitution which defeats a purpose evident when the instrument is readas a whole, is not to be favored,” and he gave several examples, including this:“‘From whatever source derived,’ as it is written in the Sixteenth Amendment,does not mean from whatever source derived”6 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote6].Clearly he was acknowledging that the very broad, apparently all-encompassingterminology of the 16th Amendment is, when taken by itself, misleading.)Despite all of those clear and unequivocal statements by the Supreme Court,numerous lower court judges and other supposed legal experts, including some whowork for the IRS, continue to parrot the popular myth that the 16th Amendmentdid increase or expand Congress’ taxing power, when it did no such thing.TAX IMPOSEDSince the federal income tax was brought back in 1913, shortly after the 16thAmendment was enacted, the federal tax statutes have imposed a tax upon the“taxable income” of every individual (though the older laws used the term “netincome” instead), which is determined by subtracting allowable deductions fromone’s “gross income.” The term “gross income” (in the last 80+ years ofstatutes) is defined in turn to mean just about every type of income imaginable.For example, Section 61 of the current tax code defines “gross income” to mean“all income from whatever source derived,” including items such as compensationfor services, interest, rents, business income, and so on. While the exactwording of the definition has varied over the years, the apparentlyall-encompassing scope of the term has not. In fact, the Supreme Court hasstated that the very broad wording of the definition of “gross income” used inthe statutes was intended by Congress to exert “the full measure of its taxingpower”7 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote7]. Put another way, the legislature usedsuch sweeping language in order to tax everything it had the power to tax.But what exactly is the “full extent” of Congress’ taxing power? Are there anylimits to what the federal government can tax? If so, how can that be reconciledwith the apparently unlimited, all-inclusive definition of the term “grossincome” (which, after subtracting deductions, becomes “taxable income”)?“It is elementary law that every statute is to be read in the light of theConstitution. However broad and general its language it cannot be interpreted asextending beyond those matters which it was within the constitutional power ofthe legislature to reach. ”[McCullough v. Virginia, 172 U.S. 102 (1898)]Under the above-stated principle (which the Supreme Court called “elementarylaw”), Congress can enact very broadly worded statutes, but they still must beread and understood with the Constitutional limits in mind. In the above-citedcase, the Court went on to say that the general language of a particular taxingstatute was “not to be read as reaching to matters in respect to which thelegislature had no constitutional power,” but instead, if the broad wordingwould seem to cover matters beyond the control of the legislature, “the statuteis to be read as though it in terms excluded them from its operation.” Put intomore modern vernacular, that simply means that every law must be read as thoughit specifically exempts any matters which are beyond the constitutional power ofwhichever government enacted the law.This is a crucial point to understand: CPAs, attorneys and IRS agents—evenfederal judges— do not know that such a principle of law even exists, and so donot take it into account when determining the correct application of the incometax. Instead, they accept the broadly worded definitions at face value, unawarethat Constitutional limits might apply to that law.But the question remains: Are there any limits on what Congress can tax, and ifso, what are they? If, as the Supreme Court says, every statute must beinterpreted in light of the Constitution, how is the average citizen to knowwhether or not there are any such limits on an otherwise broadly worded law, andhow is he to determine what those limits are? Every citizen cannot be expectedto be a Constitutional scholar, nor should individuals have to guess at whatConstitutional limits might apply to any given law. So whose “interpretation” ofthe law is a citizen to rely upon?The laws passed by Congress are coded into the “statutes” of the United StatesCode, but it is the “Executive” branch of the government—not the Legislative(Congress)—which administers and enforces federal laws. To do this, federalagencies write “regulations” which set down their official interpretation ofCongress’ laws. (The statutes themselves authorize this process, such as Section7805 of the tax code, which gives the Secretary of the Treasury the authority towrite regulations for the interpretation and administration of the federal taxcode.) Not only are Executive Branch agency regulations legally binding on allfederal agents and employees, but when published in the Federal Register, thosesame regulations also constitute the official notice to members of the generalpublic regarding what is legally required of them.Occasionally a regulation is challenged in court as being an improperinterpretation or implementation of Congress’ statutes. But unless a regulationis ruled to be a clearly unreasonable interpretation of a statute, even theSupreme Court must defer to what the regulations say.“[W]e do not sit as a committee of revision to perfect the administration of thetax laws. Congress has delegated to the Commissioner [of the IRS], not to thecourts, the task of prescribing ‘all needful rules and regulations for theenforcement’ of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 USC § 7805(a).” [United States v.Correll, 389 U.S. 299 (1967)]So, with the legal significance of regulations in mind, let’s look at some ofthe things the income tax regulations have said over the years. From 1913 until1954, the income tax statutes imposed a tax on the “net income” of everyindividual, determined by subtracting certain deductions from his “grossincome.” And the statutory definition of “gross income” (as mentioned before)was so broadly worded that it seemed to cover just about every type of incomeimaginable. The regulations interpreting those statutes, however, made some veryinteresting admissions. In defining “net income,” the older regulations statedthat “neither income exempted by statute or fundamental law” are to be includedin the calculation of one’s “net income”8 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote8]. (Theterm “fundamental law” refers to the Constitution itself.)That regulation was simply doing what the Supreme Court (in the McCullough case,above) said should be done: interpreting a broadly worded statute in light ofthe Constitution. And that regulation showed that there are indeedConstitutional limits on Congress’ taxing power, even if that flies in the faceof many decades of so-called conventional wisdom about the tax.That same section of regulations went on to give a very broad definition of“income” (any gain derived from labor or property, or from both), and thenexplained that “gross income” means all income, except for income “which is bystatutory provision or otherwise exempt from the tax.” Then the regulations goteven more specific, explaining that some types of income are specificallyexempted by the tax code, and adding that “no other items are exempt from grossincome” except for those types of income which are, “ under the Constitution,not taxable by the Federal Government”9 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote9].The point could hardly be made more clearly than that, nor could it more clearlycontradict what the vast majority of tax professionals now believe: that allincome is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute. While at this pointwe have not yet considered the question of what the Constitutional limits mightbe, we have clearly been told that there are Constitutional limits on whichincome is subject to the income tax—a fact to which current tax professionalsare completely oblivious. (Note that the regulations quoted above were writtenwell after the 16th Amendment was in place, proving again that that amendmentdid not render all income taxable.) Because the above are quotes from olderregulations, however, it is important to determine whether those Constitutionallimits still apply today.COVER-UP #1: HIDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITSFor forty years (1916 through 1956) the federal income tax regulations generallydefining “gross income” and “net income” made specific reference to the factthat the Constitution itself limits what types of income are subject to the tax.(The 1922 regulations explicitly added that “Such tax-free income should not beincluded in the return of income and need not be mentioned in the return”10[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote10].) However, the current regulations generallydefining “gross income” and “taxable income” make no reference at all to theConstitution. What happened?No Constitutional amendments affecting the taxing power have occurred since1913, nor has there been any significant change in the overall scope of theincome tax. Therefore, whatever Constitutional limits existed prior to 1956 alsomust have existed after 1956 as well. So why did the wording of the regulationschange at that time, removing any mention of such limits? The answer to thatquestion provides the first example of intentional deception committed by theregulation-writers. Rather than removing the literal truth from the law booksentirely, the evidence of the Constitutional limits on the taxing power wassimply relocated and complicated.Consider the following:1) The pre-1956 regulations generally defined “gross income” to mean all kindsof income, “derived from any source whatever, unless exempt from tax by law”11[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote11]. Similarly, the current regs define the sameterm to mean “all income from whatever source derived, unless excluded by law”12[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote12]. However, while the pre-1956 regulations wenton to say that income could be “exempt from tax” by statute or by theConstitution itself (aka “fundamental law”), the current regs defining “grossincome” make no such admission—they do not specify exactly which “law” canexclude income from taxation. Would not an honest regulation-writer want thereader to know, right up front, to what income the tax does and does not apply?And would he not want the reader to know whether some of his income might beexempt—whether it might be a mistake to report it as taxable?2) In a separate, fairly obscure section of the current regulations— not thosegenerally defining “gross income”—it is admitted that income can be exemptedfrom taxation, either by “any provision of Subtitle A” (the income tax code), orby “the provisions of any other law”13 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote13]. Butwhile that statement shows that some “law” other than the tax code itselfexempts some income, it still does not specify which “other law” (i.e., theConstitution) makes some income tax-exempt.3) However, in yet another, even more obscure current regulation (having to dowith corporate activity), it is still admitted that income can fall into threedistinct categories: “all income exempted by statute,” income which is “ nottaxable by the Federal Government under the Constitution,” and income which is“includible in gross income under section 61” (the statute which generallydefines “gross income”)14 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote14].4) Note that the above examples of the regs mentioning limits upon whatconstitutes “gross income” come, not from the regulations under Section 61 ofthe tax code (which generally defines “gross income”), but from far lessfrequently referenced sections—even though the second example specificallymentions Section 61. The same thing occurs again elsewhere.An incredibly lengthy and convoluted section of regulations located manyhundreds of pages away from the general definition of “gross income” says thatthe “items” of income listed in Section 61 of the statutes (i.e., compensation,interest, rents, business income, etc.) make up what are called “classes ofgross income,” which in some cases “may include excluded income”15[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote15]. Again, would not an honest regulation-writermake such a statement right in the regulations under Section 61 itself, insteadof hundreds of pages away? Furthermore, if his goal were to explain the lawclearly, would he not want to use less twisted, confusing language to expressthe point? (To say that the “classes of gross income,” consisting of the itemslisted in Section 61, “may include excluded income” simply means that thoseitems are not always subject to the tax, but are in some cases exempt or“excluded.”)The evidence shows that the Constitutional limits still apply to the federalincome tax, unbeknownst to modern tax preparers—whose ignorance is hardlysurprising considering the devious changes made to the wording and arrangementof the regulations after 1956. It is also important to emphasize here thattoday’s so-called tax experts do not have an alternative explanation for theevidence shown above. On the contrary, they are completely unaware that any suchConstitutional limits on the taxability of income even exist, or ever existed,and so have no explanation at all. What the law books actually show and whatmodern tax professionals assume simply do not match, as illustrated in thefollowing chart.[../Images/image1.jpg]Of course, without knowing what income is exempt from tax, one cannot know whatincome is taxable. But before delving any deeper into the issue, we should startmaking note of the more significant clues we find along the way, so we can keeptrack of what we’ve discovered and keep the big picture in mind while navigatingthrough all the legalese. The foregoing is definitely a noteworthy finding:that, unbeknownst to the tax professionals, some income is tax-exempt because ofthe Constitution itself.[../Images/image2.jpg]CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY AND WRITTEN LAWThe obvious question at this point is, What income is tax-free (exempt) becauseof the Constitution itself? That question, however, can be approached from twodifferent angles: by considering what an income tax could be applied to withoutviolating the Constitution, and by determining what the law itself shows issubject to the tax. The former is more theoretical, the latter more practical.Though in this case both approaches lead to the same answer, it should beemphasized that ultimately what matters (in a practical sense) is what the lawshows to be taxable. The academic exercise of understanding why the law sayswhat it says is secondary. It is addressed now only to give a completeunderstanding of the issue. Put another way, a citizen does not need to know whyhis income is or is not taxable, only whether it is taxable or not. The formeris a matter of Constitutional theorizing, while the latter is determinedexclusively by what the written law actually says. In this case, however,starting with a little theorizing will go a long way toward explaining why thelaw says what it says.VIRTUAL LIMITATIONSAs mentioned before, the Constitution prescribes rules for how “direct” and“indirect” taxes must be applied (using either the rule of apportionment or therule of uniformity). However, the only specific statement in the Constitutionlimiting what Congress can tax is the prohibition on taxing state exports16[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote16]. Because of this, there is a popular 3, evenamong attorneys, that aside from state exports, Congress can tax anything itpleases, in any way it pleases. But that is not the case.The Supreme Court has stated that there are “certain virtual limitations” onCongress’ taxing power, arising from the principles of the Constitution itself.The reason this is the case is because “resort[ing] to the taxing power toeffectuate an end which is not legitimate, not within the scope of theConstitution, is obviously inadmissible”17 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote17]. Onseveral occasions the Supreme Court has thrown out federal tax laws asunconstitutional on the grounds that those laws were nothing more than attemptsto use “tax” laws to control matters which are not under federal jurisdiction.For example, when Congress tried to combat “child labor” in the states (which isnot a federal issue under the Constitution) by trying to tax child labor out ofexistence, the Supreme Court threw out the tax, and gave the following reason:“Grant the validity of this law, and all that Congress would need to dohereafter, in seeking to take over to its control any one of the great number ofsubjects of public interest, jurisdiction of which the states have never partedwith, and which are reserved to them by the 10th Amendment, would be to enact adetailed measure of complete regulation of the subject and enforce it by aso-called tax upon departures from it. To give such magic to the word ‘tax’would be to break down all constitutional limitation of the powers of Congressand completely wipe out the sovereignty of the states.” [Child Labor Tax Cases,259 U.S. 20 (1922)]In other words, the Constitution does not authorize Congress to control anythingvia “tax” laws that it could not control via direct legislation. In throwing outsuch attempts at extra-Constitutional regulation (disguised as “taxes”), theSupreme Court has said that such legislation “cannot be sustained as an exerciseof the taxing power of Congress conferred by Section 8, article 1” of theConstitution18 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote18].But how might this principle apply, if at all, to a federal income tax? In oneof the first rulings pertaining to the 1913 income tax, the Supreme Court gave ahint about this. After explaining that an income tax need not be apportioned,regardless of the “source” of the income (because all income taxes are“indirect” taxes), the court added this:“Mark, of course, in saying this we are not here considering a tax not withinthe provisions of the 16th Amendment, that is, one in which the regulation ofapportionment or the rule of uniformity is wholly negligible because the tax isone entirely beyond the scope of the taxing power of Congress, and whereconsequently no authority to impose a burden, either direct or indirect,exists.” [Stanton v. Baltic Mining, 240 U.S. 103 (1916)]So, notwithstanding the 16th Amendment, there are still some things thatCongress cannot put a “burden” upon at all, via “direct” or “indirect” taxation,because such matters are outside of federal jurisdiction. (That particularruling did not go on to spell out exactly what the jurisdictional boundariesare.)FEDERAL JURISDICTIONThe term “jurisdiction” means places or activities over which a government (orgovernment agency) has authority. Not only are there the obvious geographicallimits on jurisdiction (for example, a Pennsylvania state trooper does not havejurisdiction over someone speeding in Ohio), but there is also the issue of“subject matter jurisdiction.” For example, someone who collects taxes for thestate of New York does not automatically have the authority to ticket someonefor double-parking. That is just not something under a tax collector’sjurisdiction.A crucial concept to understand at this point is that, contrary to what mostAmericans assume, the United States government does not have “subject matterjurisdiction” over everything that happens within the 50 states. On thecontrary, the federal government’s powers within the states are (in the words ofJames Madison) “few and defined,” whereas each state government has generaljurisdiction over most of what happens within that state’s borders.Most importantly—and again, this is not something most Americans hear veryoften—the federal government does not generally have jurisdiction over someonedoing business in one of the fifty states. In one case, after explaining thatCongress does have the power to regulate commerce which crosses state andcountry borders, the Supreme Court added this:“But very different considerations apply to the internal commerce or domestictrade of the states. Over this commerce and trade Congress has no power ofregulation nor any direct control. This power belongs exclusively to the states.No interference by Congress with the business of citizens transacted within astate is warranted by the Constitution, except such as is strictly incidental tothe exercise of powers clearly granted to the legislature.” [License Tax Cases,72 U.S. 462 (1866)]On the other hand, the federal government does, for example, have jurisdictionover business which involves foreign countries—or, as the Constitution puts it,Congress has the power “to regulate commerce with foreign nations”19[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote19]. Might this fact have some bearing onCongress’ taxing power?In Federalist #45, after saying that under the new Constitution the federalgovernment would have only a few, limited powers (as quoted above), JamesMadison went on to explain that the federal power “will be exercised principallyon external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; withwhich last [foreign commerce] the power of taxation will, for the most part, beconnected.” It is certainly noteworthy that the “Father of the Constitution”said that the federal government will get its funding primarily through taxingforeign commerce, but does that have any relevance to an income tax?THE PECK CASEIn the first few years after the 1913 income tax was imposed, several relatedcases reached the Supreme Court. One of those cases had to do with an Americancompany “engaged in buying goods in the several states, shipping them to foreigncountries, and there selling them.” The company argued that applying an incometax to such a business would amount to a tax on state exports, which isforbidden by the Constitution (as mentioned before).The Supreme Court rejected the company’s argument (an argument unrelated to thetopic addressed here), but made some very interesting comments in passing. Aftersaying that the income tax act “obviously could not impose a tax forbidden bythe Constitution,” and that the income tax “cannot be applied to any incomewhich Congress has no power to tax,” the Court added that because theConstitution grants Congress the general power to tax, as well as givingCongress specific jurisdiction over “commerce with foreign nations,” the federalgovernment could therefore “undoubtedly” apply an income tax to an Americanbusiness engaged in international trade20 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote20]. Inother words, the court said that the taxing clause and the commerce clausecombined undoubtedly authorize Congress to tax income from doing business whichcrosses country borders.It is particularly noteworthy that the Supreme Court brought up the “commerceclause”—which gives Congress jurisdiction over international trade but not overtrade occurring inside one of the states—when discussing what could be subjectto a federal income tax. What might that imply about Congress’ ability to taxthe income of the average American? Unfortunately, in the Peck case the companydid not question the taxability of any purely domestic income it might receive,so the Court did not address that issue at all. The Court explained why foreigncommerce could “undoubtedly” be subject to a federal income tax, but left thequestion of purely domestic income hanging. Curiously, ever since then theSupreme Court has continued the pattern of not specifically saying one way orthe other whether income earned by a U.S. citizen within one of the states isactually subject to the federal income tax.PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHERWhen someone argues that the federal income tax is unconstitutional (a claim notmade here), the government often cites the Supreme Court’s ruling from Brushaberv. Union Pacific (240 U.S. 1 (1916)), another case occurring shortly followingthe advent of the 1913 income tax. In that case, the court did indeed hold thatthe federal income tax is Constitutional. However, what the government lawyersdo not mention when citing that case (probably because they are unaware of itthemselves), and what the actual court opinion in the case does not make clear,is that the case was about a nonresident alien (a foreigner) receiving incomefrom within the United States. In other words, the case was again about“commerce with foreign nations.”“Under the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case ofBrushaber v. Union Pacific Railway Co., decided January 24, 1916, it is herebyheld that income accruing to nonresident aliens in the form of interest from thebonds and dividends on the stock of domestic corporations is subject to theincome tax imposed by the act of October 3, 1913.” [Treasury Decision 2313]The above official ruling, published by the Secretary of the Treasury, makes itabundantly clear what the case involved, while the Supreme Court’s ruling saysnothing about nonresident aliens, instead giving the impression that the caseinvolved only a citizen of New York.So, shortly after the 1913 income tax was enacted, it was twice upheld as validand Constitutional by the Supreme Court, as applied to two types of “commercewith foreign nations” : income from outside the country being received byAmericans (as in the Peck case), and income from inside the country going tononresident foreigners (as in the Brushaber case).Now read carefully what the income tax regulations said in the years followingthose Supreme Court decisions. As shown above, the regs showed that income couldbe exempt from tax due to the tax code or because of the Constitution itself.But where do the regulations tell the reader just what is taxable and what isexempt?“39.22(a)-1 What included in gross income (a) Gross income includes in general[numerous items of income listed] derived from any source whatever, unlessexempt from tax by law [i.e., by statute or by the Constitution] ... Profits ofcitizens, residents, or domestic corporations derived from sales in foreigncommerce must be included in their gross income; but special provisions are madefor nonresident aliens and foreign corporations by sections 211 to 238,inclusive, and, in certain cases, by section 251, for citizens and domesticcorporations deriving income from sources within possessions of the UnitedStates.” [26 CFR § 39.22(a)-1 (1956)]Note that that regulation does not mention the domestic income of Americanindividuals and companies; only their foreign income. Could the listing of thosespecific types of international commerce (underlined above) constitute theregulation-writers’ answer to the question of what is Constitutionally taxable?Would that not match what James Madison said about the federal government beingfunded mainly via taxes on foreign commerce? Is it only coincidence that onlycertain types of “commerce with foreign nations” are listed as being taxable?(The term U.S. “possessions” refers to places such as Guam and Puerto Rico,which Congress does have general jurisdiction over, much the way that stategovernments have jurisdiction over state land21[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote21].):This gives us our second major “clue” worth noting.[../Images/image3.jpg]In light of the wording of the regulation shown above (see Exhibit A for thecomplete section), several points must be stressed here.1) The regulation does not mention purely domestic income at all. Would it nothave been easy for the regs to say that income Americans receive from foreign ordomestic commerce must be included as “gross income,” if that were in fact thecase? Yet the domestic income of the average American is very conspicuously notmentioned at all, in several decades of equivalent regulations.2) The statute which the above regulation “interprets” says nothing at all aboutforeign commerce, nonresident aliens, or federal possessions. So, why are thosethings mentioned in the regulation, unless for the purpose of spelling out theproper, limited Constitutional application of that very broadly worded statute?3) The regulations themselves raise the point of some income being tax-exemptbecause of the Constitution itself. If the underlined portions of the regulationabove are not the answer to the question of what is Constitutionally taxable,where is that answer to be found? (It would obviously be improper, both legallyand logically, for the law books to say that something is exempt, without eversaying what that something is.)4) There is an old principle of law, expressed in Latin as “inclusio unius estexclusio alterius,” which dictates that where the law specifically lists mattersto which it applies, an “irrefutable inference” must be drawn that what was notlisted was intended to be omitted22 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote22]. Thismakes it even more significant that the official tax regulations specificallylist certain types of international trade as being subject to the tax, withoutsaying the same about the U.S. income of U.S. citizens. Certainly it would havebeen a simple matter to include that type of income on the list as well, if itwere truly taxable. So why was it omitted?So what the law does not say can be as significant as what it does say, and thatshould be included on our list of important points to remember.[../Images/image4.jpg]It is important to note that the question here is not what Congress wanted totax, but rather what Congress is Constitutionally allowed to tax. In answeringthat question, the regulations referenced above are, in effect, saying thatCongress has no power to tax the income of most Americans (income derived frompurely domestic trade). So this is not about some mistake or “loophole” whichCongress could simply “fix” with a new law; it is about the fact that it did nottax most Americans because it could not.COVER-UP #2: HIDING THE LIST OF NON-EXEMPT INCOMEFor many years, one needed to look no further than the regulations generallydefining “gross income” in order to learn that: 1) income is not subject to thetax if it is exempted by statute, or if it is excluded because of theConstitution itself, and; 2) income derived from commerce with foreign nationsmust be included in one’s “gross income.” If one was also aware of the principleof “inclusio unius,” he might very well start to wonder whether the domesticincome of most Americans is actually taxable.As shown above, the admission that the Constitution itself exempts some incomefrom tax has been obfuscated and relocated. The second example of intentionaldeception by the regulation-writers lies in the fact that after 1956 all mentionof international trade and foreign commerce was also removed from the generalregulatory definition of “gross income.”If, as the older regulations imply, income is taxable only when derived fromcertain types of international trade, should that not be one of the first andmost obvious things for the regulations to say? So, what happened? Why thechange? Once again, the truth was not removed entirely; it was instead movedmany hundreds of pages away, and reworded into a far more complicated, confusingarrangement. Here is the form in which the truth is still told in the currentregulations (with the first two steps having been mentioned above):1) An obscure regulation, located hundreds of pages away from the generaldefinition of “gross income,” says that the “items” of income listed in Section61 of the tax code make up “classes of gross income” (26 CFR § 1. 861-8(a)(3)).2) Several paragraphs later, the regulations tell the reader to go to yetanother section, “which provides that a class of gross income may includeexcluded income” (26 CFR § 1.861-8(b)(1)).(In other words, those common “items” of income are sometimes tax-exempt.) 3)However, where the reader is directed (26 CFR § 1.861-8(d)(2)) there is noregulation, but only a pointer directing the reader to yet another section (26CFR § 1.861-8T(d)(2)).4) After giving rules about how deductions can or cannot be applied to taxableincome or exempt income, that section defines “exempt income” to mean “anyincome that is, in whole or in part, exempt, excluded, or eliminated for federalincome tax purposes” (26 CFR § 1.861-8T(d)(2)(ii)).5) Several sentences later, the regulation says this:“(iii) Income that is not considered tax exempt. The following items are notconsidered to be exempt, eliminated, or excluded income and, thus, may haveexpenses, losses, or other deductions allocated and apportioned to them:(A) In the case of a foreign taxpayer...(B) In computing the combined taxable income of a DISC [Domestic InternationalSales Corporation] or FSC [Foreign Sales Corporation]...(C) …the gross income of a possessions corporation...(D) Foreign earned income...” (26 CFR § 1.861-8T(d)(2)(iii))That is the end of the list. (See Exhibit B for the complete regulation.)So, if you happen to be an American who receives wages, or business income, orinterest, or any of the other items listed in Section 61, and if you happen toknow where to look in the regulations, you are told that your type of income mayinclude exempt income, and then you are directed to a list of types of commercewhich are taxable (i. e., which are not exempt), and they all have to do withtrade which crosses country borders or involves federal possessions.Though far more spread out and confusing in these current regulations, this isthe same general arrangement found in the older regulations: the regs say thatsome income is tax-exempt, and then list various types of international trade asbeing taxable. Note that both lists, past and present, include the U.S. incomeof foreigners, certain foreign income of Americans, and income related tofederal possessions (e.g., Guam and Puerto Rico). Conspicuously absent from bothlists is the domestic income of the average American.As with the older regulations, if the above-cited section is not a complete listof the types of commerce which are taxable under the Constitution, similarinescapable questions arise:1) If purely domestic income were taxable, why is such income not mentioned onthe list? In light of the principle of “inclusio unius,” which dictates that oneshould assume that what the law does not specifically mention was intended to beomitted, would it not have been a simple and obvious thing to include domesticincome on the list, if it were indeed taxable?2) On what basis do the regulations say that all of those “items” of income inSection 61 are in some cases exempt (which the statute does not say), if not toaccount for the Constitutional limits on what is taxable?3) The regulations specifically direct the reader to one small part of onesection (26 CFR § 1.861-8T(d)(2)), which provides that the common items ofincome “may include excluded income.” If the above list of non-exempt types ofcommerce, which is located right where the regs lead the reader, is not theanswer to the question of when the items are or are not taxable, where in thatsmall section is such an answer to be found? (It does not take long to see thatnothing else in that section comes close to answering the question, as can beseen in Exhibit B.)4) What is the purpose of that list of non-exempt international trade, if not toanswer the question about which commerce is Constitutionally taxable? Theregulation-writers obviously must have had something in mind when including thatlist. What was it, if not that?(Consider also how much clearer it would be if the regulation began with “Thefollowing items are taxable,” instead of “The following items are not consideredto be exempt.” Though the literal meaning of the two is identical, using thedouble negative obfuscates the point.)It’s time to add another clue to our book.[../Images/image5.jpg]Whether one looks at the regulations from 1926 or those from 2006, he is toldthat the common “items” of income are subject to tax unless they are exempt(which is really just a truism), and then is told that income from certain tradecrossing country borders is not exempt.For the regulations to fail to say specifically whether income from purelydomestic commerce is also taxable—which the regs have consistently failed to sayfor nearly a century—is either the result of the largest typo and/or oversightin history, or the result of dishonest lawmakers not wanting to come right outand plainly admit the truth, which is that the income of most Americans is notsubject to the federal income tax. Of course, an almost unimaginable amount ofwealth and power now depends upon such an admission not being made and the truthbeing covered up. And the evidence demonstrates that that is exactly what hasbeen done, and what continues to be done, by some people inside the federalgovernment.TAXABLE ACTIVITIESIs the federal “income tax” a tax upon income? If that question seems strange,the answer will no doubt seem even stranger.“The income tax is, therefore, not a tax on income as such. It is an excise taxwith respect to certain activities and privileges which is measured by referenceto the income which they produce. The income is not the subject of the tax: itis the basis for determining the amount of the tax.” [U.S. Congressional Record,March 27, 1943]Those are the words of F. Morse Hubbard, a former legislative draftsman for theU.S. Treasury Department (one of those whose job it is to write tax statutes andregulations). Unfortunately, and somewhat suspiciously, Mr. Hubbard did not goon to describe just what those “certain activities and privileges” are. Notethat Mr. Hubbard’s comments coincide perfectly with the fact that the SupremeCourt describes “indirect” taxes—the category in which income taxes inherentlybelong—as being taxes upon “certain commodities, privileges, particular businesstransactions, vocations, occupations, and the like.”23[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote23].The general statutory definition of “gross income” talks about different kindsof income, but says nothing about any particular activities or privileges. So,if the tax is actually a tax on certain activities, rather than a tax on incomeper se, does some other part of the law spell out what those activities are?Again, even the most basic principles of both law and logic dictate that the lawmust say what it applies to. If the law were to specify a certain activity asbeing taxable, might it look something like this?:“A nonresident alien individual engaged in trade or business within the UnitedStates... shall be taxable as provided in section 1.” [26 USC § 871(b)]Or like this?:“A foreign corporation engaged in trade or business within the United States...shall be taxable as provided in section 11.” [26 USC § 882(a)](Note: Section 1 of the tax code imposes a tax upon the “taxable income” ofevery individual, whereas Section 11 imposes the tax on the “taxable income” ofevery corporation.)INCOME VERSUS COMMERCEThe single most important distinction to understand here is the differencebetween types of income and types of commerce. The two concepts are distinct(although at first easily confused), and each is an essential ingredient inunderstanding the law. In short, the federal income tax applies only when ataxable item of income derives from a taxable type of commerce. If either theincome or the commerce is not taxable, the tax does not apply.A simple example demonstrates the importance of this point. Suppose there aretwo Canadians, one of whom lives and works exclusively in Canada, while theother has some investments and business dealings in the U.S. Each personreceives various potentially-taxable “items” of income (e.g., wages, interest,business income, dividends), but only the second one actually owes any taxes tothe U.S. government, because only his income derives from a type of commerceover which the U.S. government has any jurisdiction. As a nonresident alien(under U.S. law), the second person is benefiting from the privilege of doingbusiness in the U.S., and is engaged in a particular activity (or type ofcommerce) which is specifically shown by the tax code to be taxable, as shownabove in the quotation from 26 USC § 871(b).Were the receipt of income, all by itself, enough to create a tax liability,then over a billion foreigners who have no economic dealings with the U.S. wouldowe U.S. income taxes—which is not and cannot be the case. While that may beobvious, most people make the mistake of assuming that the federal governmentdoes have general jurisdiction over all business happening inside the 50 states,when in reality it does not, any more than it has general jurisdiction over allbusiness occurring in Canada.While federal courts have fluctuated somewhat over the years in their opinionsabout which federal excise taxes are valid and which constitute anunconstitutional attempt to control matters beyond Congress’ jurisdiction,consider the following: The income tax code includes extensive behavioralcontrols in the form of rewards and punishments. For example, while the Codeeconomically penalizes people for being married, or for being self-employed, italso rewards those who give to charity (Section 170 of the tax code), adoptchildren (Section 23), have a mortgage (Section 25), pay a college tuition(Section 25A), produce alternative fuels (Section 29), use an electric car(Section 30), employ American Indians (Section 45A), and so on. The controlsover insurance, savings and investments are also extensive.When such matters involve someone living and working in one of the states, thefederal government has no Constitutional authority to control, reward, or punishsuch behaviors and economic decisions, whether that control is exerted by directregulation or tax policy. As the Supreme Court put it, “If, in lieu ofcompulsory regulation of subjects within the states’ reserved jurisdiction,which is prohibited, the Congress could invoke the taxing and spending power asa means to accomplish the same end, clause 1, Section 8 of Article I [of theU.S. Constitution] would become the instrument for total subversion of thegovernmental powers reserved to the individual states.” Congress is, on theother hand, allowed to use tax laws to control matters that are otherwise underfederal jurisdiction, but it may not overstep the limits of its authority bydisguising a regulation as a tax. “The power of taxation, which is expresslygranted, may, of course, be adopted as a means to carry into operation anotherpower also expressly granted, but resort to the taxing power to effectuate anend which is not legitimate, not within the scope of the Constitution, isobviously inadmissible.” As a result, if only those who are engaged ininternational trade have taxable income—as the law shows—then only those engagedin international trade are subject to all of the rewards and punishments of thetax code. Therefore, Congress is, via the tax code, merely regulating what theConstitution specifically allows it to regulate: “commerce with foreignnations.” (As an aside, Congress may not control purely intrastate decisions andbehaviors by way of “tax breaks” any more than it may do so via penalties. “TheCongress cannot invade state jurisdiction to compel individual action; no morecan it purchase such action.” )24 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote24]SUBCHAPTER NIn one way, the limits of Congress’ power to tax, and the limits on which incomeis therefore subject to the federal income tax, are “hidden in plain sight” inthe current tax code. The income tax, which is found in “Chapter 1” of thefederal tax code, is divided into numerous “subchapters.” Subchapter N is titled“Tax based on income from sources within or without the United States.” As thename implies, this is the part of the law that describes the situations in whichdomestic income and foreign income are taxable. In other words, this is wherethe law deals with the issue of commerce, while other parts of the law deal onlywith items of income.Subchapter N is divided into five “parts,” the titles of which are as follows:SUBCHAPTER NTax Based on Income From Sources Within or Without the United StatePart I - Determination of Sources of IncomePart II - Nonresident Aliens and Foreign CorporationsPart III - Income from sources without the United StatesPart IV - Domestic International Sales CorporationsPart V - International Boycott DeterminationsEven a cursory examination of Parts II through V shows that while certaindomestic income of foreigners, certain foreign income of Americans, and otherinternational matters are discussed, there is no mention at all of the domesticincome of the average U.S. citizen. In addition to the sections aboutnonresident aliens and foreign corporations doing business in the U.S. (Sections871 and 882, shown above), these parts of the law also include sections aboutforeign tax credits (Section 901 and following), foreign earned income (Section911 and following), those living and/or doing business in federal possessions(Section 931 and following), and so on. This matches precisely what theregulations, past and present, list as the taxable types of commerce.In keeping with the principle of “inclusio unius,” the U.S. Supreme Court hasstated, “In the interpretation of statutes levying taxes it is the establishedrule not to extend their provisions, by implication, beyond the clear import ofthe language used, or to enlarge their operations so as to embrace matters notspecifically pointed out”25 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote25]. The same rulingwent on to say that, in case of doubt, taxing statutes are to be “construed moststrongly against the government, and in favor of the citizen.” So for the taxcode to specifically point out that certain types of international trade aretaxable, while failing to say one word about purely domestic commerce, is verysignificant. (Again, if the average American’s income were taxable, it wouldcertainly be a simple thing to add a section to the law specifically statingthat. But for over ninety years it has never been done.) But it is in Part I ofSubchapter N (” Determination of Sources of Income”) where all the pieces reallycome together to form a complete picture, not only of the very limited nature ofthe tax, but also of the efforts to cover up the limited nature of the tax.SECTION 861While one can quote what a certain section of law says, one cannot cite a lackof a statement in the law. In other words, it is easy to support a claim thatthe law says “X,” but it is far more difficult to support a claim that nowheredoes the law say “Y.” And it is primarily that fact which has kept the public inthe dark about the proper application of the federal income tax: the ease withwhich one can assume that somewhere in the thousands upon thousands of pages ofstatutes and regulations, it must say that the income of the average American istaxable. One section (as demonstrated above) might only list certaininternational trade as being taxable, but who knows what some other sectionssomewhere else in the law might show?If the average American approaches the tax code starting with the assumptionthat he owes the tax (though that is the opposite of the way the Supreme Courtsays one should read the law), no single statement in the law will directlycontradict that assumption. Nor, however, will any statement in the law confirmit. That is proper legally, as the law is required only to specify what istaxable—it need not specify what is exempt. Technically speaking, therefore, ifyou assume that your income is taxable when the law does not actually say so,that is your mistake, not a defect in the law. Morally and ethically, however,it amounts to fraud when government lawyers go so far out of their way to avoidspecifically telling tens of millions of Americans whether they owe the tax. Itis a lie by omission, which in a case such as this is no less despicable than aconventional lie.But how does one expose such a lie, when the false assumption is so universallyaccepted as the gospel truth, and when the law is so ridiculously complicatedand voluminous? It is practically impossible to go through the thousands ofpages of statutes and regulations, one by one, to see if any of them mention thedomestic income of the average American. However, it is possible to dramaticallynarrow down the possible places in the law where such a statement would befound, if it existed.For example, the question here is, For whom is U.S.-source (domestic) incometaxable? In trying to first determine where in the law such a question would beanswered, one can immediately rule out many portions of the tax code. The answerto our question obviously will not be found in Subchapter D of the tax code,which is all about deferred compensation, or Subchapter H, which deals only withbanking institutions, or Subchapter L, which is all about insurance companies.But where in the law will it tell us whether a U.S. citizen can have taxableincome from inside the U.S.?“Sections 861(b) and 863(a) state in general terms how to determine taxableincome of a taxpayer from sources within the United States after gross incomefrom sources within the United States has been determined. Sections 862(b) and863(a) state in general terms how to determine taxable income of a taxpayer fromsources without the United States after gross income from sources without theUnited States has been determined.” [26 CFR § 1.861-8]The above regulation is plainly telling us where in the law to look to determinesomeone’s taxable domestic income. The chart below shows where in the tax codethe above-referenced sections (861 through 863) are located.SUBCHAPTER NTax based on income from sources within or without the United StatesPART I - Determination of Sources of IncomeSection 861 - Income from sources within the United States861(a) - Gross income from sources within United States861(b) - Taxable income from sources within United StatesSection 862 - Income from sources without the United States862(a) - Gross income from sources without U.S.862(b) - Taxable income from sources without U.S.Section 863 - Special rules for determining sourceSection 864 - Definitions and special rulesSection 865 - Source rules for personal property salesPART II - Nonresident Aliens and Foreign CorporationsPART III - Income from Sources Without the United StatesPART IV - Domestic International Sales CorporationsPART V - International Boycott DeterminationsWhile earlier portions of the law give numerous rules concerning which items ofincome can be taxable, it is immediately apparent that Subchapter N is the partof the law which addresses the issue of commerce: determining when income frominside the U.S. is taxable, and when income from outside the U.S. is taxable.The regulations make the distinction well, saying that “Section 61 lists themore common items of gross income,” and later saying that “section 861 andfollowing... and the regulations thereunder determine the sources of income forpurposes of the income tax”[26]. In fact, from 1954 to 2001, several majorprintings of the tax code (USC, USCA and USCS), under Section 61 itself—whichgenerally defines “gross income” and lists various items of income—all containcross-references such as the following:26 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote26]“Income from sources –Within the United States, see section 861 of this titleWithout the United States, see section 862 of this title”Such a cross-reference is still found in the United States Code Service (USCS)printing of the tax code, while all such cross-references in the USC and USCAprintings were removed after 2001. Prior to 1954, that cross-reference was partof the actual text of the statute. The section generally defining “gross income”back then (Section 22) said that “For computation of gross income from sourceswithin and without the United States,” one should refer to the predecessor ofthe current Section 861 and following (which back then was Section 119). Thepurpose of Section 861 (and following sections) is also summed up nicely in theTreasury Department’s “Cumulative Bulletin,” as follows:“Rules are prescribed for determination of gross income and taxable incomederived from sources within and without the United States, and for theallocation of income derived partly from sources within the United States andpartly without the United States or within United States possessions. §§ 1.861-1through 1.864. (Secs 861-864; ‘54 Code.)” [Treasury Decision 6258]While the earlier sections of the tax code deal with specific items of income,they say nothing about who is receiving the income or where it is coming from;they do not at all address the commerce from which the income derives. Thecitations above, however, make it quite clear that commerce is what Subchapter N(starting with Section 861) is all about. There is no need to guess about whatevery other section of the tax code might say, since this is identified, in nouncertain terms, as the place to go to determine taxable domestic income andtaxable foreign income. The following chart shows which sections deal with thedifferent types of commerce.[../Images/image6.jpg]Section 863 gives rules for dividing up income which includes both foreign anddomestic income into “within” and “without” income. While this may come intoplay when determining the taxable domestic income of international corporations(for example), it is not relevant to whether the income of the average Americanwho lives and works only in the 50 states is taxable. For that person, Section861 and its regs are the pertinent sections.In case any doubt remains about the purpose and function of these sections,consider what the very first section of regulations under Section 861 says—andhas said for over fifty years:“§1.861-1 Income from sources within the United States(a) Categories of income. Part I (section 861 and following), subchapter N,chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder determine the sources ofincome for purposes of the income tax. ... The statute provides for thefollowing three categories of income:(1) Within the United States The gross income from sources within the UnitedStates, consisting of the items of gross income specified in section 861(a) plusthe items of gross income allocated or apportioned to such sources in accordancewith section 863(a). See §§ 1.861-2 to 1.861-7, inclusive, and § 1.863-1. Thetaxable income from sources within the United States, in the case of suchincome, shall be determined by deducting therefrom, in accordance with sections861(b) and 863(a), the [allowable deductions] . See §§ 1.861-8 and 1.863-1.(2) Without the United States ...(3) Partly within and partly without the United States ...(b) Taxable income from sources within the United States.The taxable income from sources within the United States shall consist of thetaxable income described in paragraph (a)(l) of this section plus the taxableincome allocated or apportioned to such sources, as indicated in paragraph(a)(3) of this section. ” [26 CFR § 1.861-1 (see Exhibit C for completesection)]THE EXPERT BLUNDERBased on the above, it may seem patently obvious at this point, even to thosenot well versed in the law and not accustomed to reading tax laws, that Section861 and the related regulations are the place to look to determine one’s taxabledomestic income. Over and over again the law books state, unequivocally andunconditionally, that those are the sections to use to determine one’s taxableincome from sources within the United States.Here is the surprising part: today’s tax professionals do not use Section 861and its regulations to determine the taxable domestic income of their clients.In fact, they do not consider the issue of “commerce” at all (in the vastmajority of cases); they simply assume that domestic income is taxable for allAmericans, and never stop to see whether the law actually says that. Afterfalsely assuming that income from domestic commerce must be taxable, they thenapply the various deductions, statutory exemptions, and other specialrules—which they are familiar with—to come up with a bottom-line figure. Butthey skip altogether the first and most fundamental step: determining whether,based upon the type of commerce it derives from, the income is subject to thetax to begin with. They simply assume that it is, and go from there.This is another instance in which the “conventional wisdom” about the incometax, as believed and repeated by the vast majority of CPAs, attorneys, and othertax professionals (including those who work for the IRS), dramatically clasheswith what the law books actually state. Unfortunately, when forced to choosebetween the assertions of a herd of self-proclaimed tax “experts” and obviouslycontradictory evidence from the law itself, many people still side with thosewho profess to being knowledgeable on the subject.There could hardly be a more dramatic difference between what the law says oneshould do and what tax preparers actually do. When it comes to the government’sown law books, all roads lead to 861 regarding income from sources within theUnited States. Yet very rarely (such as when a case does involve internationaltrade) will a tax professional reference those sections at all. Many do not evenknow those sections exist. With that in mind, below is a list of just some ofthe things from the actual law books which direct the reader to Section 861 andits regulations regarding domestic “gross income” and domestic “taxable income.”(The first five items on the list are quoted from above.)1) The title of Section 861, and the titles of its subsections.2) The first section of related regulations (1.861-1).3) The first sentence of the regs under 861(b) (namely, 1.861-8).4) The cross-references under Section 61.5) Treasury Decision 6258.6) The regulations related to Section 863, which say that “The taxpayer’staxable income from sources within or without the United States will bedetermined under the rules of Secs.1.861-8 through 1.861-14T.”27[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote27]7) The regulations related to Section 862, which say that one’s taxable foreignincome “shall be determined on the same basis as that used in Sec. 1.861-8 fordetermining taxable income from sources within the United States.”28[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote28]8) Other regulations under Section 863, which identify 1.861-1 through 1.863-5of the regs as giving the rules “for determining the gross and the taxableincome from sources within and without the United States.”29[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote29]9) Numerous other sections of the tax code (such as Sections 79, 105, 410, 414and 505) which identify Section 861 as the section which determines whatconstitutes “income from sources within the United States.”10) The index of the Code of Federal Regulations, which, under “Income Taxes,”refers the reader to the regs under 861 and following regarding both“Determination of sources of income” and “Income from sources inside or outsideU.S. ”11) The indexes of the tax code (including the USC, USCA and USCS printings),which contain entries such as the following:- Under “Sources of income, Within the U.S. ,” one is referred to Section 861.- Under “Gross income, Sources within U.S. ,” one is referred to Section 861.- Under “Deductions, Taxable income from within U.S. ,” one is directed toSection 861.- Under “Taxable income, Sources within U.S. ,” one is directed to Section 861.(As a reminder, Section 63 of the tax code explains that, in general, taxableincome equals gross income minus deductions; and under all three of thoseconcepts, the indexes of the Code point to Section 861 regarding income frominside the U.S. Also of note, there are no regulations under Section 63explaining how to determine taxable income.)So let us add this point to our clue book.[../Images/image7.jpg]PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE SECTION BEHIND THE CURTAIN!Since the mid-1990s, when the issue addressed in this report first began to beexposed to a significant number of people, the status quo tax professionals,both inside and outside the government, have responded the way entrenched,highly esteemed and well-paid so-called experts usually respond whenconventional wisdom is challenged: with a heavy dose of condescending ridicule(e. g., “That’s nonsense!”), a helping of thinly-veiled and not-so-thinly-veiledthreats (e.g., “You’ll get in trouble if you believe that!”), and very littleactual substance.By far the most popular response from the self-proclaimed tax pros—when theresponse has consisted of saying anything more than “frivolous!”—can be summedup as “You aren’t supposed to use Section 861!” The attempted justifications forthat assertion have varied widely, often contradicting each other, but the truerationale behind the claim does not amount to anything more scholarly than this:“We’ve never used those sections, so you shouldn’t either!”Oddly, their claims about who should use 861 fluctuate wildly. Variousgovernment officials have (at different times) asserted that: 1) only foreignersshould use those sections; 2) only Americans with foreign income should usethose sections; 3) only Americans with foreign and domestic income should usethose sections; 4) only those who need to “apportion” income and/or deductionsbetween foreign and domestic sources should use those sections, and lessfrequently; 5) all Americans should use those sections. If there is a commontheme among such claims (excluding the last one), it boils down to this: “Lookthere only if those sections show your income to be taxable; otherwise, don’tlook there, and just assume your income is taxable anyway.” (Oddly, those whoclaim that 861 and related sections should be used by U.S. citizens only if theyhave both foreign and domestic income fail to explain why, if such people do usethose sections, their foreign income shows up as taxable, while their domesticincome does not, as will be shown below.)As for the law itself, nowhere does it say that 861 and its regs should be usedonly by certain people, or only in certain unusual circumstances. On thecontrary, numerous citations (such as those shown above) state quite plainly,without any qualifiers or exceptions, that those sections give the rules fordetermining one’s “taxable income from sources within the United States.” Atthis point it is probably not difficult for the reader to guess why both privatetax professionals and government employees (especially those working for theIRS) do not want people to use 861 and its regulations to determine theirtaxable income: because, as will be thoroughly proven below, those sections donot show the income of the average American to be taxable.GETTING TO THE ROOTNow that it has been firmly established that Section 861 of the tax code, andthe regulations related to that section, are the place to look to determine whocan have taxable domestic income, it is time to delve into what those sectionsactually say. However, the current sections alone in many ways resemble a “crimescene” after the perpetrator has had time to conceal or remove most of theevidence. While in the current law books there are still enough bits and piecesto reconstruct the truth, the whole picture becomes a lot more clear—and a lotmore sinister—when considered in chronological order, starting from the verybeginning. With that in mind, the following examines how a particular portion ofthe law—which today is Section 861—has “evolved” over the years.It is important here for the reader to understand that the tax code is notdiscarded and rebuilt from scratch every year (or even every decade), likethrowing away an old car and getting a new one. On the contrary, the current taxcode is really just the original 1913 income tax, but with many, many amendmentshaving been made over the years, much like a very old car that has had a lot oflittle pieces replaced, various parts tinkered with, and several paint jobs—butis still the same car underneath. Whether with a car or a law, the best way totruly understand the essence of the thing is to see what it looked like beforeall of the adjustments and tinkerings occurred.With that in mind, the following is what Section 861 looked like, eighty yearsand several “paint jobs” ago:“Sec. 217. (a) In the case of a nonresident alien or of a citizen entitled tothe benefits of section 262, the following items of gross income shall betreated as income from sources within the United States:(1) Interest on bonds, notes, or other interest-bearing obligations ofresidents, corporate or otherwise;(2) The amount received as dividends from a domestic corporation…;(3) Compensation for labor or personal services performed in the United States;(4) Rentals or royalties from property located in the United States…;(5) Gains, profits, and income from the sale of real property located in theUnited States;(b) From the items of gross income specified in subdivision (a) there shall bededucted [the allowable deductions]. The remainder, if any, shall be included infull as net income from sources within the United States.” [Revenue Act of 1925,§ 217]While that section mentioned only two types of individuals, Section 232 of thesame Act added the equivalent corporations, saying that “in the case of aforeign corporation or of a corporation entitled to the benefits of section 262the computation shall also be made in the manner provided in section 217.” Sothe section was about: 1) foreigners (individuals and companies), and 2)Americans (individuals and companies) “entitled to the benefits of section 262,”which meant that they received the majority of their income from inside federalpossessions, such as Guam and Puerto Rico. The “benefit” was that only theirincome from within the U.S. (and not their income from within the possessions)would be subject to the tax. For the moment, the reader need only understandthat only those doing business in federal possessions could be “entitled to thebenefits of section 262.” (See Exhibit E.)With those things in mind, it becomes easy to distill the section down andconcisely express its meaning. The section lists various common types ofdomestic income, including (among other things) payment for labor performedinside the United States and interest on U.S. investments, and says that in thecase of foreigners, and in the case of Americans with possessions income, suchincome constitutes domestic income and, after subtracting the allowabledeductions, constitutes taxable domestic income.Consider that carefully and let its legal significance sink in. Why would thelaw say that those types of U.S.-source income are taxable for foreigners andfor certain Americans (those with possessions income), instead of saying thatsuch income is taxable for all Americans (as “conventional wisdom” says it is)?Why, for example, would the law specifically point out that compensation forservices performed in the U.S. is to be included as taxable domestic income inthe case of only some Americans in unusual circumstances? Are not domestic wagestaxable for all Americans? Section 217 back then obviously did not say so. Whynot?Now recall that that section is what eventually became the current Section861—the primary section to use (along with its regulations) to determine one’staxable income from sources within the United States. But what would the averageAmerican find there, if he attempted to use the old Section 217 to do that? Hewould find a statute which specifically points out that U.S. wages are taxablefor Americans who also have possessions income, as well as for foreigners, butwhich says nothing at all about the wages of the average American worker. So,what is the reader to make of all that?“Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius. The inclusion of one is the exclusion ofanother. The certain designation of one person is an absolute exclusion of allothers. ... This doctrine decrees that where law expressly describes [a]particular situation to which it shall apply, an irrefutable inference must bedrawn that what is omitted or excluded was intended to be omitted or excluded.”[Black’s Law Dictionary, 6th Edition]“In the interpretation of statutes levying taxes it is the established rule notto... enlarge their operations so as to embrace matters not specifically pointedout.” [Gould v. Gould, 245 U.S. 151 (1917)]With those principles in mind, if the law points to one section as the place tolook to determine when domestic income is taxable, and that section specificallysays that domestic income is taxable for certain people other than you, there isonly one logical conclusion to be drawn: in your case, domestic income is nottaxable.COVER-UP #3: OBFUSCATING TAXABLE DOMESTIC INCOMENo one could possibly mistake the old Section 217 (from 1925) to mean thatdomestic income is taxable for all Americans. (See Exhibit D.) At the time, thatsection was only four section numbers away from the general definition of “grossincome” (back then Section 213), instead of eight hundred numbers away, as it isnow (61 versus 861).Note also how well all the pieces fit together back in the 1920’s. Back then,the regulations generally defining “gross income” mentioned the foreign incomeof Americans, as well as the domestic income of: 1) nonresident aliens andforeign corporations, and 2) Americans (individuals and corporations) withpossessions income—precisely the same things mentioned in Section 217, dealingwith who could have taxable income from inside the U.S. Less than a decadelater, however, a rather conspicuous change occurred to the wording of thatsection of law (what would eventually become Section 861). Compare thefollowing: Section 217 (1925)[../Images/image8.jpg]Though most of the section remained essentially the same, in 1932 the phraseabout nonresident aliens and citizens with possessions income (those “entitledto the benefits of section 262”) mysteriously vanished from the section. First,let us establish that these really are corresponding sections: the one on theleft (above) is what became the one on the right. The chart below shows the“genealogy,” if you will, of what is now Section 861:[../Images/image9.jpg]So, concerning taxable domestic income, for example, section 217(b) from 1921became section 119(b) of the 1932 code, and later became section 861(b), whichis what it still is today. (The Supreme Court case of Commissioner v. Wodehouse,337 U.S. 369 (1949), together with the notes under the tax acts of differentyears, and the relatively recent Treasury Decision 8687, all confirm the path of“evolution” of these sections shown above.)Why, then, when Section 217 became Section 119, was there such a significantchange in the wording of the beginning of the section? Why did it stopmentioning foreigners and those with possessions income? Was Congress “fixing”the section, to make it say that domestic income was taxable for everyone? Orhad Congress expanded the law, to make the average American’s income taxable,when it had not been before?Neither. The correct application of the law did not change at all. Theregulations under both statutes (217 and 119) were nearly identical, with eachtalking about foreigners and about citizens with possessions income. So, forexample, while Section 119 of the 1939 statutes listed various types of domesticincome, the related regulations stated quite plainly for whom those types ofincome were taxable.Statute: “Net income from sources in United States.—From the items of grossincome specified in subsection (a) of this section there shall be deducted the[allowable deductions] . The remainder, if any, shall be included in full as netincome from sources within the United States.” [Section 119(b) (1939 code)]Regulation: “From the items specified in section 119(a) as being derivedspecifically from sources within the United States there shall, in the case ofnon-resident alien individuals and foreign corporations engaged in trade orbusiness within the United States, be deducted the [allowable deductions]. Theremainder shall be included in full as net income from sources within the UnitedStates.” [26 CFR § 39.119-10 (1945)]Several other sections of related regulations (e.g., sections 29.119-1 and29.119-9) also mentioned foreigners and those with possessions income, and noone else. As another example, while subsection 119(a)(1) of the statutes talkedabout “interest” on U.S. investments, without specifying for whom such incomewas taxable, the related regulations said this:“29.119-2. Interest.There shall be included in the gross income from sources within the UnitedStates, of nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations, and citizens ofthe United States, or domestic corporations which are entitled to the benefitsof section 251, all interest received or accrued, as the case may be, from theUnited States, any Territory, any political subdivision of a Territory, or theDistrict of Columbia, and interest on bonds, notes, or other interest-bearingobligations of residents of the United States, whether corporate or otherwise[with limited exceptions].”If domestic “interest” were taxable for anyone who receives it, which is what“conventional wisdom” says, there is no reason whatsoever for these regulationsto have said what they said. To specifically point out that such income istaxable for certain people, engaged in certain types of international commerce,without making any mention of the returns on investments of the averageAmerican, is very significant. (As an aside, Congress must approve federalagency regulations before they are finalized, so this was not a disagreement ofsome kind; Congress was well aware of, and gave its blessing to, the“interpretation” expressed in those regulations.)If, when Section 217 turned into Section 119, the scope of the law did notchange (as the regulations clearly demonstrate), what possible reason couldthere have been to remove from the statute the phrase specifically saying whocould have taxable income from within the U.S.? No honest or justifiable reasoncomes to mind, though a possible deceptive motive is obvious: to mislead theAmerican people regarding the issue of who actually owes federal income taxes.And to a large extent, it worked. The current Section 861 is substantially thesame as Section 119 from 1939, and by itself still does not mention for whom thelisted types of domestic income are taxable. As a result, some tax professionalstoday (though they are in the minority) argue that Section 861 does mean thatU.S. income is taxable for everyone. For example, they cite Section 861(a)(3) tomean that “compensation for labor or personal services performed in the UnitedStates” is taxable for everyone—an understandable mistake if one reads only thecurrent Section 861 by itself—and a mistake which the change in wording of thesection seems to have been intended to cause.The general wording of Sections 861 and 862 categorizes all income—whethertaxable or not—as either “within” income or “without” income. If one readsSection 861, all by itself and out of context, to mean that the listed types ofdomestic income are taxable for everyone in all situations, he would also haveto read the nearly identical wording of Section 862 to mean that the types offoreign income listed there are also always taxable for everyone. The conclusionwould be that all income from anywhere is taxable for everyone on theplanet—which not only is obviously untrue, but also would render all of thewithin/without rules utterly pointless. Why distinguish between the two, only tothen say that both are always taxable no matter who receives them?The current regulations under 861, as will be shown below, still demonstratethat the types of domestic income listed in Section 861 itself are taxable onlyfor certain people in certain circumstances, though it explains that fact in anextremely convoluted and confusing manner. But the legislative history of thesection makes the truth crystal clear. No one, for example, would misunderstandthe following—from the “grandfather” of Section 861—to mean that U.S. wages aretaxable for everyone.“(a) In the case of a nonresident alien individual or of a citizen entitled tothe benefits of section 262, the following items of gross income shall betreated as income from sources within the United States:... (3) Compensation forlabor or personal services performed in the United States;...(b) From the items of gross income specified in subdivision (a) there shall bededucted [the allowable deductions] . The remainder, if any, shall be includedin full as net income from sources within the United States.” [Revenue Act of1925, § 217]Some tax professionals today, not eager to address or respond to such evidence,insist that only current sections of statutes or regulations matter, and thateverything else is obsolete and should be ignored. But that is not at all thecase. As the IRS’s own manual explains, the current language of the tax code“does not solve every tax controversy,” and “Courts also consider the history ofa particular Code section”30 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote30]. As oneillustration of this, the Supreme Court in one case specifically referred backto the old Section 217 to help properly understand the meaning of a laterversion of the law (Section 119 from 1939).31 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote31]As another example, Treasury Decision 8687 (from 1996), in discussing whatcurrent regulations should say, refers all the way back to Section 217 from1921. Both the Judicial and Executive branches of the federal governmentregularly reference so-called “obsolete” law to determine the correct meaningand application of current law. This is because they know that laws do notappear out of thin air every year, but are the result of a sort of statutoryevolution.THE DECEPTION OF 1954Not much changed in the relevant sections between 1932 and 1954, with theexception of the disappearance of two sections of regs under Section 119(Sections 39.119-1 and 39.119-9) which specifically mentioned nonresidentaliens, foreign corporations, and American individuals and companies withpossessions income. (Two other sections mentioning those things remained.)Then, in 1954, the entire tax code underwent a major rearranging, renumbering,and in some cases, rewording. The old Section 119 of the statutes became the newSections 861 through 864, with no significant change in the text of that part ofthe law. Those sections have remained essentially the same ever since. Of note,both houses of Congress, in their respective reports on the 1954 Code, statedthat the application of that part of the law had not significantly changed.Those reports include the following:SUBCHAPTER N - TAX BASED ON INCOME FROM SOURCES WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE UNITEDSTATESPart I - Determination of Sources of Income§ 861. Income from sources within the United States§ 862. Income from sources without the United States§ 863. Items not specified in section 861 or 862§ 864. DefinitionsThese sections, which are identical with sections 861-864 of the House bill,correspond to section 119 of the 1939 Code. No substantive change is made,except that section 861(a)(3) would extend the existing 90-day $3,000 rule inthe case of a nonresident alien employee of a foreign employer to a nonresidentalien employee of a foreign branch of a domestic employer.But while the correct application of this part of the law did not change, andwhile the text of the statute changed hardly at all, the related regulationsunderwent some dramatic (and very suspicious) changes. For example, compare howthe first section of related regulations appeared, before and after 1954:[../Images/image10.jpg]The older version was plainly about people involved in certain types ofinternational trade. After 1954, however, all mention of who could have taxableincome from within the U.S. was removed from the section. A similar, equallyconspicuous change occurred at the same time to the main regulation to be usedfor determining taxable domestic income. Again, compare the section before andafter the change.[../Images/image11.jpg]Keep in mind, Congress specifically said that the application of this part ofthe law had not changed. So why, in one year, did the regulations say thatdomestic income is (after subtracting deductions) taxable for certain peopleengaged in certain types of commerce, and in the next year say simply that suchincome is (after subtracting deductions) taxable? No one would mistake the oldersection to mean that U.S. income is taxable for everyone, while almost anyonecould and would mistake the newer section to mean just that.Of note, both sections went on to give an example of how the section is to beapplied to determine one’s taxable domestic income. Note the only significantchange:[../Images/image12.jpg]The rest of the example, including all the dollar amounts ($9,000 interest froma domestic corporation, $4,000 from dividends, $12,000 in royalties from U.S.patents, and $11,000 from the sale of real property) remained the same. The onlyreal change was that the old section admitted that the example was about anonresident alien, while the new section referred only to “a taxpayer.” Why? Whymight someone not want the reader to know that the example was about aforeigner? Because, of course, when the average American reads a section titled“Computation of taxable income from sources within the United States” (which wasthe title of the section right after 1954), the government gets a lot more moneyif the reader can easily misunderstand the section to mean that domesticallyearned income is taxable for everyone, when in reality it is not. In otherwords, the reason for these changes to the regulations was an intent to deceiveand defraud the American public. Another glaring example occurred in theregulation dealing with domestic “interest.” Once again, a side-by-sidecomparison speaks for itself.[../Images/image13.jpg]Notice that the only change is the removal of the phrase specifying who had toinclude domestic “interest” in their gross income. If the law did not change (asCongress admitted), there is no benign explanation for such changes to thewording of the regulations. The only explanation is that the regulation writersdid not want the general public to know that domestic income is not taxable forthe average U.S. citizen.(As a reminder, it was at the same point in time, just after 1954, when thechanges described above under “Cover-up #1” and “Cover-up #2” occurred,involving the removal of any mention of the Constitution itself exempting someincome from taxation and the removal of the list of the non-exempt (taxable)types of income, which all related to international trade.)THE MOTHER OF ALL OBFUSCATIONSSo, to review, the “evolution” of the relevant portion of the federal income taxlaws (what is now Section 861 and related regs) can be summed up as follows:• In the 1920s, both the statute (Section 217) and the related regulationsstated quite plainly that domestic income (e.g., wages earned in the U.S.,interest and dividends from U.S. investments, rents from property located in theU.S., etc.) was, after subtracting deductions, to be included in the taxableincome of nonresident aliens, foreign corporations, and Americans (individualsand companies) who have possessions income. The sections very obviously were notsaying that domestic income is taxable for all U.S. citizens.• After 1932, the statute (Section 119) by itself no longer specified exactlyfor whom the listed types of domestic income were taxable, though the relatedregulations, virtually unchanged from before, still unmistakably stated thatsuch income was taxable for foreigners, and for Americans with possessionsincome.• Shortly after 1954, neither the statute nor the related regs specificallystated for whom domestic income was taxable. As a result, the average readerwould almost certainly misread the sections to mean that U.S.-source income wastaxable no matter who received it, unless the reader happened to know thehistory of the sections, and/or understood how the different parts of SubchapterN work together (as explained below).• After 1977, one section of the regulations under Section 861 was dramaticallyaltered. (Section 861 itself and the other regulations related to it remainedessentially unchanged.) That one section which changed, Section 1.861-8, isrelated to 861(b) of the statutes (” Taxable income from sources within UnitedStates”) and is repeatedly referred to as the primary section to use todetermine one’s “taxable income from sources within the United States”[32]32[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote32]. The changes which occurred to that sectionafter 1977 were extensive, and very telling.The most immediately apparent change was that, whereas the prior Section 1.861-8filled about one page, the new version of the same regulation occupies more thanthirty pages (which, incidentally, is about a dozen times as long as the statuteit is supposed to “interpret”: Section 861). Also of note, there was no changeat all to the statute to justify such an explosion in the length of theregulation.The two most important things to note about the new Section 1.861-8 are that: 1)it tells the truth about the fact that U.S. source income is taxable only forcertain people engaged in certain types of commerce ( not most Americans); and2) it does so in just about the most convoluted and confusing way possible.While trying to navigate your way through the tangled maze of “legalese”discussed below, keep in mind how brief, concise, and easily understandable thispart of the law had been before (e.g., Section 217 from 1925).After 1977, several new legal terms were used in Section 1.861-8, though thoseterms do not appear and have never appeared anywhere in the statutes, and hadnever before appeared in any other regulation. In other words, these terms weremade up just for use in the new Section 1.861-8. Several of these new terms aredefined below, first using language designed to be clear and understandable, andthen the way they are explained in the actual regulations.1) Operative Sections. As mentioned above, throughout Subchapter N of the taxcode there are various sections which address specific types of commerce (suchas a nonresident alien doing business in the U.S.). These sections, called“operative sections” by Section 1.861-8, include the sections shown in the listbelow.SUBCHAPTER NTax Based on Income From Sources Within or Without the United StatesPART I - Determination of Source of IncomePART II - Nonresident Aliens and Foreign CorporationsSection 871 - Nonresident aliens doing business in the U.S.Section 882 - Foreign corporations doing business in the U.S.PART III - Income From Sources Without the United StatesSection 904 - Limit on the foreign tax creditSection 911 - Foreign Earned IncomeSection 925 - Foreign sales corporationsSection 931 - Citizens with possessions incomeSection 934 - Rules related to the Virgin IslandsSection 936 - U.S. corporations with possessions incomeSection 941 - China Trade Act corporationsSection 952 - Controlled foreign corporationsPART IV - Domestic International Sales CorporationsSection 994 - Domestic International Sales CorporationsPART V - International Boycott DeterminationsSection 999 - International boycott mattersNote that all of the sections deal with international trade or federalpossessions; none relates to a U.S. citizen doing business only in the 50states.2) Specific Sources or Activities. Each operative section (listed above)describes a particular activity or type of commerce. For example, the “specificsource or activity” described in Section 871 is a nonresident alien doingbusiness inside the United States.3) Statutory Grouping. The income generated by a particular activity describedin an “operative section” makes up a “statutory grouping of gross income.” Forexample, the income a nonresident alien receives from doing business in the U.S.falls into a “statutory grouping.”4) Residual Grouping. The income received from any activity other than theactivity described in an “operative section” constitutes a “residual grouping ofgross income” (which is often exempt from tax). For example, the income which aforeigner receives from doing business in his own country (not from doingbusiness in the U.S.) makes up a residual grouping, which in that case is nottaxable.Keeping the above terms in mind, below are some excerpts from the regulationsunder 861.“(ii) Relationship of sections 861, 862, 863(a), and 863(b). Sections 861, 862,863(a), and 863(b) are the four provisions applicable in determining taxableincome from specific sources.” [26 CFR § 1.861-8(f)(3)(ii)]The above admission, which is buried in the middle of the section, shows thatthe general language of Section 861 is about income from “specific sources.”This is akin to the older regulations saying that the types of domestic incomelisted in the statute are taxable for those engaged in certain types of commerce(i.e., foreigners doing business in the U.S. and Americans doing business infederal possessions).The sentence quoted above says nothing about what those “specific sources” mightbe, or even where to find that out, but a text search for “specific sources”brings up only three other places where that term is ever used—all of them inSection 1.861-8, and all quoted from below. The first paragraph of Section1.861-8—the primary section for determining taxable domestic income—includesthis:“The rules contained in this section apply in determining taxable income of thetaxpayer from specific sources and activities under other sections of the Code,referred to in this section as operative sections. See paragraph (f)(l) of thissection for a list and description of operative sections.” [26 CFR §1.861-8(a)(1)]So the section for determining taxable domestic income applies to income fromthose activities described in the “operative sections” throughout Subchapter N(shown above), which are all listed in one place in the regulations at1.861-8(f)(1) (“paragraph (f)(l)”). The same regulation, a little further down,confirms this again:“[T] he term ‘statutory grouping of gross income’ or ‘statutory grouping’ meansthe gross income from a specific source or activity which must first bedetermined in order to arrive at ‘taxable income’ from which specific source oractivity under an operative section. (See paragraph (f)(l) of this section.)”[26 CFR § 1.861-8(a)(4)]This confirms the definitions given above, and again shows that to have “taxableincome” under this section, one must be engaged in one or more of those certaintypes of commerce, or “specific sources and activities,” described in theoperative sections (listed in 1.861-8(f)(1)). If you have no income from suchactivities, you have no “taxable income.”Recall here the former legislative draftsman for the U.S. Treasury Departmentsaying that the federal “income tax” is not actually a tax on income per se, butis an excise tax upon “certain activities and privileges.” That statementcorrelates perfectly with the fact that the section for determining one’s“taxable income from sources within the United States” says that it is aboutincome from “specific sources or activities” (all of which relate tointernational trade).Below is the final place where “specific sources” are mentioned, in “paragraph(f)(l)” itself.“(1) Operative sections. The operative sections of the Code which require thedetermination of taxable income of the taxpayer from specific sources oractivities and which give rise to statutory groupings to which this section isapplicable include the sections described below.(i) Overall limitation to the foreign tax credit. Under the overall limitationto the foreign tax credit, as provided in section 904(a)(2)... Accordingly, inthis case, the statutory grouping is foreign source income…(ii) [Reserved] [This item was most likely intended to refer to section 911,which is about foreign earned income, since 26 CFR § 1.911-6 refers to section911 as an “operative section,” and section 911 is not included anywhere else onthe list.](iii) DISC and FSC taxable income. Sections 925 and 994 provide rules fordetermining the taxable income of a FSC and DISC...(iv) Effectively connected taxable income. Nonresident alien individuals andforeign corporations engaged in trade or business within the United States,under sections 871(b)(1) and 882(a)(1)...(v) Foreign base company income. Section 954 defines the term ‘foreign basecompany income’ with respect to controlled foreign corporations...(vi) Other operative sections. The rules provided in this section also apply indetermining—(A) The amount of foreign source items of tax preference undersection 58 (g)... (B) The amount of foreign mineral income under section 901(e);(C) [Reserved]; (D) The amount of foreign oil and gas extraction income and theamount of foreign oil related income under section 907; (E) The tax base forcitizens entitled to the benefits of section 931 and the section 936 tax creditof a domestic corporation which has an election in effect under section 936; (F)The exclusion for income from Puerto Rico... (G) The limitation under section934 on the maximum reduction in income tax liability incurred to the VirginIslands; (H) The income derived from Guam... (I) The special deduction grantedto China Trade Act corporations under section 941; (J) The amount of certainU.S. source income excluded from the subpart F income of a controlled foreigncorporation under section 952(b); (K) The amount of income from the insurance ofU.S. risks under section 953(b)(5); (L) The international boycott factor and thespecifically attributable taxes and income under section 999; and (M) Thetaxable income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel undersection 607 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936... ” [26 CFR § 1.861-8(f)(1)]Note that the list still includes nonresident aliens, foreign corporations, andcitizens “entitled to the benefits of section 931”—the exact same activitiesdescribed in many decades of equivalent statutes and regulations. (See Exhibit Efor the sections dealing with federal possessions: Section 262 from 1925, and 26CFR § 1.931-1 of the 2004 regulations.) (Of note, the regulation as shown aboveis how it appeared up until 2005. In recent years various sections of the taxcode dealing with matters involving federal possessions, including Section 931,have been repealed or amended, and as a result, items (E), (F) and (H) wererecently removed from the list.)In addition to the activities which have been mentioned in over eighty years ofstatutory and regulatory predecessors, the above list also includes specificrules regarding individual federal possessions, other particular rules aboutcertain foreign income, and the newer rules about DISCs (Domestic InternationalSales Corporations) and FSCs (Foreign Sales Corporations). But all the matterslisted still involve international or foreign trade. Subsection 1.861-8(g) thengives many examples of how to use 1.861-8 to determine one’s taxable income, andsays that the “operative section” for each example, except as otherwiseprovided, is the section about foreign tax credits.So the actual legal scope and application of this part of the law has notchanged for over eighty years. The current regulations still show thatU.S.-source income is taxable only for those engaged in certain internationaltrade, though the sheer size and complexity of the current Section 1.861-8 seemdesigned to prevent the reader from easily understanding that. A reading of theentire section conveys the impression, not of the authors trying to make thingsclear and understandable, but of the regulation-writers trying to confuse thereader, using unnecessarily involved terminology and indirect and evasivelanguage, while conspicuously failing to state in plain, simple terms the bottomline: an American with only domestic income does not have taxable income fromsources within the United States, and therefore does not owe the tax.[../Images/image14.jpg]RELOCATING THE TRUTHWhile the current law books do tell the literal truth about the very limitednature of the federal income tax, the way in which they do so is fundamentallydifferent from the way they did it prior to 1954. Back then, one needed to lookno further than the regulations generally defining “gross income” to learn thatsome income is not subject to the tax because of the Constitution itself, andthat income from certain international trade (mainly the foreign income ofAmericans and U.S. income of foreigners) is taxable.Back then one could also find the truth in the statutes and regulationsspecifically dealing with income from inside the U.S., which said that suchincome is taxable for foreigners, and for certain Americans with possessionsincome—which exactly matches and reinforces what the regs generally defining“gross income” said at the time. After 1954, however, any hint of the truth wascompletely removed from the regulations generally defining “gross income.”Instead, a “legalese” trick was employed.It is common for one section of law to use a certain term, while a differentsection defines the legal meaning of the term, often in a way very differentfrom the way the term is used in common speech. For example, in another part ofthe Title 26 statutes (in an area unrelated to income taxes), one section saysthat the Secretary of the Treasury “shall maintain a central registry of allfirearms in the United States which are not in the possession or under thecontrol of the United States”33 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote33]. Severalsections away, however, the term “firearm” is defined (for purposes of that law)in a way which excludes the vast majority of shotguns, rifles and handguns, butincludes poison gas, silencers and land mines34[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote34]. Obviously that legal definition isdrastically different from the common usage of the term “firearm,” and as aresult, the scope of that law is far more limited than the section read out ofcontext would seem to indicate.After 1954, a similar scenario existed in the federal income tax laws. Section61 generally defines “gross income” to mean “all income from whatever sourcederived”—a definition which has often been erroneously cited as proof that allincome is taxable. However, the regulations many hundreds of pages away say thatSection 861 and following (and related regs) “determine the sources of incomefor purposes of the income tax”35 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote35]. But if thereader is not aware of the fact that certain sections define what is meant by a“source of income,” he will most likely misunderstand Section 61 to mean thatall income is taxable, regardless of where it comes from.But what, according to Section 861 and related sections, are the “sources ofincome for purposes of the income tax”? “Sections 861, 862, 863(a), and 863(b) are the four provisions applicable indetermining taxable income from specific sources.” [26 CFR § 1.861-8(f)(3)(ii)]And what those “specific sources” are is shown above, in the quote from1.861-8(f)(1). Suspiciously, those specific sources— the types of commerce towhich the tax applies—are now listed only in the middle of an enormous,convoluted section of regs, under the unobtrusive heading “Miscellaneousmatters,” instead of in the first paragraph in an early, obviously relevantsection called “What included in gross income,” as was the case with thepre-1954 regulations.OTHER COVER-UPSOver the years there have been several other changes to the law books which mayalso have been designed to conceal the truth about the very limited nature ofthe federal income tax. Such changes include the following:1) In 1988, in some printings of the tax code (e.g., USC and USCA), the title ofPart I of Subchapter N (which begins with Section 861) was changed from“Determination of Sources of Income” to “Source Rules and Other General RulesRelating to Foreign Income.” In the USCS printing of the code, however, whichmore accurately reflects the underlying law (the “Statutes at Large”), the titledid not change. Nor did the title of the related regulations, which stillappears as “Determination of Sources of Income.”Because tables of contents and titles of sections do not affect the legalmeaning of the text of the law36 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote36], and becausethe text of Section 861 did not change, there was no real legal significance tothe changing of the title. But it did have a different kind of effect. Bychanging the title in a way which, read one way, implies that only those withforeign income should be looking at that part of the law, the average Americanwould be deterred from ever looking there. In contrast, note how obviously thetable of contents prior to the change led the reader straight to Section 861.Subtitle A - “Income taxes”Chapter 1 - “Normal taxes and surtaxes”Subchapter N - “Tax based on income from sources within or without the UnitedStates”Part I - “Determination of sources of income”Section 861 - “Income from sources within the United States”861(a) - “Gross income from sources within United States”861(b) - “Taxable income from sources within United States”In addition, up until 1977, the regulations related to 861(b) of the statuteswere entitled “Computation of taxable income from sources within the UnitedStates”—an obvious place to look to determine one’s taxable domestic income.After 1977, however, the title was expanded to read, “Computation of taxableincome from sources within the United States and from other sources andactivities.” Like the new title of Part I (Subchapter N), that title has beeninterpreted by some to mean that only those who have both domestic and foreignincome should be referring to that section. The text of the statutes andregulations (which is all that legally matters) gives no support for such aclaim, but that would hardly matter, if the changes had the effect of dissuadingthe average reader from looking at those sections at all, thereby making itextremely unlikely that he would discover that purely domestic income is notsubject to the tax.2) The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 requires that every form used by thefederal government to collect information from the public be approved by theOffice of Management and Budget (OMB). The regulations at 26 CFR § 602.101contain a table listing the OMB-approved forms for each section of regulations.Section 1 of the tax code imposes the tax on the “taxable income” ofindividuals, and the related regulations are found in Section 1.1-1 (titled“Income tax on individuals”). Until 1995, the first line in the table in Section602.101 identified Form 2555, “Foreign Earned Income,” as the only approved formunder Section 1.1-1. In 1995, after various “tax resistance” groups had becomeaware of that fact, that entry was removed from the list, in order to avoid“confusion” (according to the Treasury Department). At present no forms arelisted as being approved for use related to Section 1.1-1. (The process ofapplying for and receiving OMB approval for a form makes the possibility of anerror extremely remote. The Department of the Treasury requested that the formrelating to foreign earned income—and no other form—be approved for Section1.1-1, and the Office of Management and Budget approved it. When the entry drewtoo much attention, however, it was removed.)3) After 2001, all of the editorially-supplied cross-references, including theone under Section 61 specifically pointing to Section 861 regarding “Income fromsources within the United States,” were removed from the USC and USCA printingsof the tax code. (The USCS printing, however, still includes thecross-references.) Because all such cross-references were removed from the USCversion of the Code, not just the one pointing from 61 to 861, there may havebeen some motivation for the change other than an intent to deceive. However,for such cross-references to be removed just a few years after thousands ofAmericans began looking up that particular cross-reference under 61, after thosecross-references had been in place for almost seventy years (in both the pre-and post-1954 Codes), is more than a little suspicious.HINTS AND CLUESIn addition to what is shown above, many other miscellaneous bits and pieces ofevidence in the law books reinforce the fact that only income from certaininternational trade (“commerce with foreign nations”) was ever subject to thefederal income tax. Taken individually, some would appear as little more thanstrange curiosities; when taken together, on the other hand, they show that theauthors of the federal income tax statutes and regulations were well aware ofthe very limited nature of the tax. A few such hints and clues are describedbelow.1) As mentioned above, Form 2555, “Foreign Earned Income,” was the only formever approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act to be filed in relation toSection 1.1-1 of the regulations (which is titled “Income tax on individuals”).Similarly, the only approved form related to Sections 1.861-2 and 1.861-3 (whichdeal with interest and dividends from within the U.S.) is Form 1040NR, “U.S.Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return,” and the only form approved in relation toSection 1.861-8 itself is Form 1120-F, “U.S. Income Tax Return of a ForeignCorporation.”2) Each federal regulation, when published, cites the legal authority underwhich it was promulgated. Section 1.861-8 cites the general rule-makingauthority delegated by 26 USC § 7805, as well as 26 USC § 882—the “operativesection” related to foreign corporations doing business in the U.S. (Thismatches the fact that the form approved for use with 1.861-8 is for foreigncorporations.) Likewise, the equivalent “temporary” regulations at Section1.861-8T cite Treasury Decision 8228, which states that the section gives“foreign tax credit rules and certain other international tax provisions,” againshowing that the sections for determining taxable domestic income (1.861-8 and1.861-8T) are all about international trade.3) Several sections of the tax code, including Section 1 (which imposes the taxon individuals), as well as Sections 59, 66 and 469, refer to Section 911(d)(2)of the Code regarding the definition of the term “earned income.” There isnothing unusual about the definition itself, which says that “The term ‘earnedincome’ means wages, salaries, or professional fees, and other amounts receivedas compensation for personal services actually rendered” (with a fewexceptions). What is curious is the location of that definition:Subchapter N - “Tax based on income from sources within or without the UnitedStates”Part III - “Income from sources without the United States”Subpart B - “Earned income of citizens or residents of United States”Section 911 - “Citizens or residents of the United States living abroad”Compare this to the fact that the only form approved for use with the regs underSection 1 is about “foreign earned income,” meaning income earned outside of theUnited States.4) Along the same lines, if one looks in the indexes of the United States Codeunder “Income tax” and finds the entries under “citizens,” only things such as“living abroad” and “about to depart from U.S. ” are found—again implying thatU.S. citizens are taxed primarily on income they receive for work done outsideof the country.5) For many years one particular hint about the true nature of the federalincome tax has been hiding right under the noses of many millions of Americans.The infamous Form 1040, the income tax return used by many millions ofAmericans, has an instruction booklet that accompanies it. The form itself isdivided into several parts (e.g., personal information, exemptions, income,etc.), and for each part of the form, the instruction booklet gives some generalinformation, and then gives line-by-line instructions on how to fill out theform. Under the part of the form about “income,” the instruction booklet beginsby saying this:“Foreign-Source IncomeYou must report unearned income, such as interest, dividends, and pensions, fromsources outside the United States unless exempt by law or a tax treaty. You mustalso report earned income, such as wages and tips, from sources outside theUnited States.If you worked abroad, you may be able to exclude part or all of your earnedincome. For details, see Pub. 54, Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and ResidentAliens Abroad, and Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income, or Form 2555-EZ, ForeignEarned Income Exclusion.Community Property States...Rounding Off to Whole Dollars... ”That is all the booklet says about the general topic of “income.” It then givesspecific directions explaining which different items of income to report onwhich line. What is shown above is the only thing in the booklet mentioning thetype of commerce from which the income derives; the rest is about “items” ofincome.Though such forms are not legally binding, this one mirrors the method used inmany decades of regulations: telling U.S. citizens that they must report anyforeign-source income they receive, without specifically saying whether thedomestic income of the average American is also subject to the tax. Theeffectiveness of such a lie-by-omission is demonstrated by the fact that themany millions of Americans who receive that booklet and read it simply assumethat what it means is that citizens must report their foreign income in additionto their domestic income, though that is not what the booklet says, nor is thathow one is meant to interpret the law. (One should not assume that the lawapplies to matters “not specifically pointed out. ”)6) Something very similar exists in IRS Publication 525, which is entitled“Taxable and Nontaxable Income.” Right up front the publication says this:“RemindersForeign IncomeIf you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien, you must report income from outsidethe United States (foreign income) unless it is exempt by U.S. law.”The publication then goes on to discuss (in its own words) “many kinds of incomeand explains whether they are taxable or nontaxable.” Again, the quote above isthe only place where the publication addresses the issue of commerce; the restdeals with specific items of income. And again, most readers would assume thatany income they receive from domestic commerce must also be taxable, thoughnowhere does the publication actually say that.7) There are some places in the tax code where, if the reader assumes that mostpeople owe the tax, he runs into a logical contradiction. For example, onesection deals with income from selling certain kinds of stocks. That sectionsays that if such income “is determined to be derived from sources within theUnited States,” then such income is to be considered “fixed or determinableannual or periodical gains, profits, and income within the meaning of section871(a) or section 881(a), as the case may be”37[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote37]. But sections 871 and 881, which are locatedin Part II of Subchapter N, are clearly and exclusively about nonresident aliensand foreign corporations. If a U.S. citizen with income from that kind of stocksales looks at the law (while assuming that such income is taxable for him) heruns into a logical brick wall, because he is told only that such income shallbe considered taxable under the rules about foreigners—rules which obviously donot apply to him.8) A similar conundrum occurs when conventional wisdom comes up against therules about “community income” (joint income received by married couples). Iftwo married people are living apart, and one or both of them receives such“community income,” the tax code says that such income “shall be treated inaccordance with the rules provided by section 879(a). ” Once again, averageAmericans trying to make sense of the rules (while assuming their income istaxable) hit an impasse. Why? Because Section 879(a) is about “Tax treatment ofcertain community income in the case of nonresident alien individuals,” andapplies only to a couple, one or both of whom are nonresident aliens. Again, thesection cannot be used by average Americans, who are left hanging when they readthe section. If, on the other hand, the reader is aware that purely domesticincome is not taxable for U.S. citizens (but is taxable for foreigners), thenthe law makes perfect sense.9) In 1991 (before the section was removed), the Internal Revenue Manual—theIRS’s own procedural manual—said this:“ The Criminal Investigation Division [of the IRS] enforces the criminalstatutes applicable to income, estate, gift, employment, and excise tax laws...involving United States citizens residing in foreign countries and nonresidentaliens subject to Federal income tax filing requirements...” [IRM, § 1132.55(1991)]What about citizens working in the 50 states? Why is there no mention of them?10) The regulations at 26 CFR § 601.101 generally describe the functions of theInternal Revenue Service. In that section, the only specific mention of who orwhat is subject to taxes administered by the IRS reads as follows:“ The Director, Foreign Operations District, administers the internal revenuelaws applicable to taxpayers residing or doing business abroad, foreigntaxpayers deriving income from sources within the United States, and taxpayerswho are required to withhold tax on certain payments to nonresident aliens andforeign corporations...” [26 CFR § 601.101(a)]11) The official decisions and rulings by the IRS are published regularly in the“Internal Revenue Bulletin.” Year after year, all the way from 1913 to thepresent day, those bulletins reinforce the fact that the federal income tax is(and always has been) a tax upon “commerce with foreign nations.” For example,the Cumulative Bulletin covering the years 1957 through 1960 contains ninelistings of rulings and decisions regarding “citizens,” every one of which isabout citizens who are outside of the United States. Likewise, under thecategory of “Income—Source,” that same bulletin contains thirty-five entries,thirty-four of which are, on their face, obviously about international trade.The other is Treasury Decision 6258, which (as shown above) says that Sections861 and following, and related regs, give the rules for the “determination ofgross income and taxable income derived from sources within and without theUnited States.” (And those rules show only income from international commerce tobe taxed.)Year after year after year, whenever the issue of commerce (or “sources” ofincome) is addressed in the law books, what is discussed is always certainforeign income of Americans, the U.S. income of foreigners, and mattersinvolving federal possessions. What is never specifically discussed is a UnitedStates citizen who lives and works exclusively within the 50 states.As illustrated above, what is not stated in legal documents can be just asimportant as what is stated. Consider all the documents referred to above inwhich the average American earning a living in the U.S. could have beenmentioned, but was not. What are the chances that by sheer coincidence, overeighty years’ worth of legal documents accidentally failed to ever specificallystate that the U.S.-source income of all U.S. citizens is taxable? The very ideais preposterous, but the only alternative explanation is something manyAmericans may not want to consider: that the federal government is collectingwell over a trillion dollars every year from people who do not owe it, and thatthis is the result of an intentional deception planned and carried out by somein the federal government.THE OTHER SIDEFor several years now, some agents of the federal government have continued toloudly declare that most Americans owe federal income taxes, backing thatassertion with little more than “because we say so.” Rather than giving anysubstantive response to the evidence shown above, the IRS and variouslower-court judges have simply harped on the “from whatever source derived”language in the general definition of “gross income” (in Section 61) to theexclusion of just about everything else, asserted (without legal support) thatmost people should not be looking at Section 861 and its regulations, andproclaimed that any view to the contrary is “frivolous.”GENERAL VERSUS SPECIFICThere are several reasons, including those shown above, why it is a mistake torely exclusively upon the general definitions of terms such as “gross income”and “taxable income” when determining what is subject to the tax, as IRSemployees and private sector tax professionals do on a regular basis. First andforemost, if those general definitions were all that mattered, the federal taxcode would be three or four pages in length, instead of many thousands of pagesin length.More importantly, the federal tax statutes and regulations themselves show thatthe general definitions are not the “be all and end all” of tax law. Forinstance, the general definition of “gross income” in Section 61 begins bysaying, “Except as otherwise provided,” showing that there are exceptions to thegeneral rule. Likewise, the regulations under Section 61 say that when “anothersection of the Code or of the regulations thereunder, provides specifictreatment for any item of income, such other provision shall applynotwithstanding section 61 and the regulations thereunder.”38[../Text/endnotes.html#endnote38]That statement in the regulations is really nothing more than an acknowledgmentof a very old and well-established maxim of statutory interpretation, which canbe generalized as “the specific governs the general.” Where any law gives ageneral rule, but also includes a specific rule regarding some narrow issue, thespecific rule “trumps” the general.“General language of a statutory provision, although broad enough to include it,will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part ofthe same enactment. ” [D. Ginsberg & Sons v. Popkin, 285 U.S. 204 (1932)]Section 61 gives a general definition, whereas the regulations under Section 861give the specific rules concerning the issue of when domestic income (incomefrom within the United States) is taxable. So even if the general definition of“gross income” might by itself seem to include all domestic income, the specificrules about such income render the general definition inapplicable.“It is a well-settled principle of construction that specific terms covering thegiven subject-matter will prevail over general language of the same or anotherstatute which might otherwise prove controlling.” [Kepner v. United States, 195U.S. 100 (1904)]Contrary to what IRS employees claim, the general definitions do not make itunnecessary to consult the specific “source” rules.“As always, ‘[w] here there is no clear intention otherwise, a specific statutewill not be controlled or nullified by a general one, regardless of the priorityof enactment’.” [Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc. , 482 U.S. 437(1987)]Quite the opposite: the specific “outranks” the general, and the general willapply only to matters not dealt with by more specific rules.“It is an old and familiar rule that ‘where there is, in the same statute, aparticular enactment, and also a general one, which, in its most comprehensivesense, would include what is embraced in the former, the particular enactmentmust be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only suchcases within its general language as are not within the provisions of theparticular enactment.’” [U.S. v. Chase, 135 U.S. 255 (1890)]So reliance on the general definition of “gross income” alone, while ignoringthe specific rules found in the regulations under Section 861, is completelybackward as a matter of law.Again, it is crucial to understand the difference between the question ofwhether a particular “item” of income is exempt or not, and the question ofwhether the income derives from a taxable type of commerce. While many sectionsof the tax code give various rules about various types of income, citation aftercitation make it abundantly clear that Subchapter N (Section 861 and following)is the place, and the only place, where the issue of commerce is addressed.There are very specific rules in the tax code, stretching back almost a century,which explain when income from inside the United States is taxable. Nowhere elsein the tax code is that issue addressed, and nothing else in the code can renderthat issue moot.It is not unusual for federal law to follow this pattern: imposing a requirementin very general terms in one section, while other sections limit thatrequirement to matters involving commerce which the Constitution puts underfederal jurisdiction. For example, one section of federal law prohibits any“employer” from discriminating against individuals based upon their race,religion, etc.39 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote39], while another sectiondefines the term “employer,” for purposes of that law, to mean an employer doingbusiness related to interstate or international commerce, or commerce in federalpossessions. 40 [../Text/endnotes.html#endnote40]In this way apparently broadrequirements are kept in line with the Constitution by limiting theirapplicability to commerce which Congress has the authority to regulate.Likewise, while earlier sections of the tax code (e.g., Sections 1, 61 and 63)impose what at first glance appears to be an all-encompassing tax, Subchapter N(Section 861 and following) limits the tax to types of commerce which areConstitutionally under federal jurisdiction: international trade and tradewithin federal possessions.WITHIN OR WITHOUTOther than the general definition of “gross income,” about the only othercitation used to try to rebut the issue shown above comes from Section 1.1-1 ofthe regulations, which says that U.S. citizens are liable to the taxes imposedby the code whether their income is “from sources within or without the UnitedStates.” However, as Section 1.1-1 itself admits, the tax imposed is only upontaxable income, not all income. Of course, one statement from the regs could notnegate all the rules for determining what constitutes taxable income, nor doesit claim to. And yes, when those regulations were written, it was possible forcitizens to have taxable income from inside the United States, if they also didbusiness in federal possessions. And yes, every person who receives taxableincome, whether from inside or outside the United States, owes the tax. So, howdoes a citizen determine whether his domestic and/or foreign income is taxable?Subchapter N of the tax code (Section 861 and following) is about “Tax based onincome from sources within or without the United States.” In addition, the indexof the regulations, as cited before, tells one to go to the regs under 861regarding “Income from sources inside or outside U.S. ” And, in case any doubtmight remain, the regulations also say this:“(c) Determination of taxable income. The taxpayer’s taxable income from sourceswithin or without the United States will be determined under the rules of Secs.1.861-8 [and following].” [26 CFR § 1.863-1(c)]So yes, citizens are taxed on any taxable income they receive, whether “fromsources within or without the United States,” and in order to determine theirtaxable income (foreign or domestic) they must refer to Section 861 andfollowing, and related regulations. And, as shown above, those sections showincome to be taxable only when it derives from certain types of internationaltrade.SMOKE AND MIRRORSIronically, the mantra of most of the status quo tax professionals, inside andoutside government, has been, “Those sections [861, etc.] don’t apply to you.”In one sense, that is quite true: those sections are all about internationalcommerce, not about the income of the average American. But the conventionalwisdom adherents then apply backward logic to justify their foregoneconclusions. If the sections specifically designated for determining taxabledomestic income “don’t apply” to your income, the proper conclusion to draw isnot that you should ignore those sections, but that your domestic income is nottaxable.As an analogy, consider the example discussed previously, where one section oflaw imposes requirements applicable to “all firearms,” while a nearby sectionlegally defines the term “firearm” (for purposes of that law) in an extremelylimited way, excluding most handguns, rifles and shotguns. If you own aconventional shotgun, and the legal definition of “firearm” does not apply toyour gun, that obviously does not mean you should ignore the definition; itmeans that that entire law imposes no requirement upon you. Likewise, if youreceive no taxable domestic income and no taxable foreign income—as defined bylaw—then the federal income tax laws impose no legal obligation upon youwhatsoever.Another popular retort to the issue addressed herein is the claim that it takessomething “out of context,” yet the status quo proponents can never cite anysuch “context” which would change the meaning of what the words in the law bookssay (such as those quoted above). To be blunt, the “out of context” accusationis nothing more than a cheap ploy designed to defend the supposed expertise of“the professionals” in the eyes of the public, by implying that only the“experts” could possibly understand the law or know everything it contains, andthat we “common folk” have no business trying to read and understand the law forourselves.Still others try to dismiss an opposing view by labeling it as just one person’s“interpretation”—as if mere evidence and logic cannot make one opinion morevalid than another. In truth, little if any “interpretation” is involved. Theonly time it is even possible to “interpret” something is when one set of wordscould literally have more than one meaning. (For example, “I saw wood” couldmean “I have seen wood” or “I cut wood with a saw.”) Otherwise, the words simplymean what they say, and there is nothing to “interpret.” A review of the variouscitations above will show that few if any of them can have more than onemeaning, so no “interpretation” is required. (It is the conclusions of theso-called experts that don’t match what the law actually says. As a result,their opinions do not even qualify as “interpretations”; they are instead merelybaseless assertions.)Furthermore, keep in mind that if there are two ways to read a given section oftax law, the Supreme Court has often said (in Gould v. Gould and many subsequentcases) that in case of doubt, tax laws are to be construed (interpreted) infavor of the citizen, not in favor of the government.Some particularly unscrupulous naysayers (mostly in government) also routinelymischaracterize the issue as a “tax protestor” issue, when it is nothing of thekind. As can be seen above, the issue is not at all about objecting to the tax.What is being “protested” is not the law itself—which imposes a limited,perfectly Constitutional tax—but the misrepresentation and misapplication of thelaw, resulting in the deprivation of well over a trillion dollars a year frompeople who, by law, did not owe a dime. Put another way, this is not aboutpeople not wanting to pay “their taxes”; it is about people not wanting to beforced to pay something that is not, and never was, “their taxes,” but which isinstead an excise tax upon certain activities relating to international trade.As an aside, any contrary theorizing about what Congress could Constitutionallytax (including such theorizing on the part of federal judges) is obviously farless important than what the law shows they did tax (i.e., international trade).In other words, one can argue until he is blue in the face that Congress doeshave the Constitutional authority to tax the income of all Americans, but if thelaw shows that Congress did not do so (which is exactly what it shows), thatdebate becomes purely academic.ALL THE PIECES FITDespite the complexity of the tax laws, in the end the issue is pretty simple.Let’s review our clue book one last time. Remember, these basic clues were allgiven to us by the government’s own official law books. Go over them one by one,and then ask yourself: How many possible explanations are there which canaccount for all of these clues?[../Images/image15.jpg]In short, there is only one way that all the pieces fit. There is only oneconclusion, albeit a fairly disturbing one, which logically follows from theevidence. And that conclusion is this:The federal “income tax” is and has always been a tax only upon certaininternational trade, and therefore the vast majority of Americans have neverlegally owed a dime in federal income taxes, but have been deceived intobelieving otherwise.MENTAL INERTIA AND CENSORSHIPAnytime a large number of people—in this case hundreds of millions—hold aparticular belief, it takes a lot to change that belief. There is a sort of“mental inertia” that keeps most people from ever questioning things they havealways accepted as obviously true. “Everyone knows” that most Americans owefederal income taxes, but that belief comes, not from all of those peopleexamining the law, but from all of those people hearing each other assertingthat it is so. All too often the human mind accepts something as the gospeltruth based on nothing more than “Everyone says it, so it must be true.”But truth is not a democracy. The popularity of an idea often has no relevanceto whether or not it is true. History is full of examples of popularmisconceptions lasting for hundreds or even thousands of years, based solelyupon the phenomenon of “common knowledge.” And throughout history, when theoccasional nonconformist has stepped forward to challenge the “conventionalwisdom,” he has, more often than not, been ridiculed, insulted, and sometimestortured or even killed. As a result, popular but false beliefs have a tendencyto survive a very long time, even when they fly in the face of all evidence andlogic.Furthermore, if a certain misconception is a source of power for some people,those people will often go to great lengths to defend the lie and destroy thetruth. Few people want to have unpopular beliefs, and even fewer want to expressa belief that will bring down the wrath of a powerful “authority” upon theirheads. The concept of the “heretic,” who is demonized, ostracized, condemned andpunished for disputing the gospel according to the powers that be, is certainlynothing new. Not many people are willing to say something that sounds ridiculousto most people, especially if doing so will put them in harm’s way in theprocess. As a result, ignorance has tremendous staying power.Since the late 1990s, when the legal issue addressed above first began to drawsignificant public attention, some in government (particularly those working forthe IRS and the U.S. “Justice” Department) have waged an all-out attack on thosewho have been vocal about the issue—obtaining court orders to forcibly shut downweb sites, imposing large fines upon those tax professionals who have agreedwith the issue and told their clients about it, and prosecuting and imprisoningas many “tax heretics” as they can, while demonizing and mischaracterizing as“tax protestors,” “tax cheats,” and “scam artists” those who dare to openly andpublicly question conventional wisdom. In addition, the government has shownonly contempt and hostility towards the many thousands of Americans who havemerely asked questions about the above issue, in an effort to better understandthe law.The government’s ongoing thuggery, and suspicious inability or unwillingness tohave a rational discussion about what its own law books say, is almost asdamning as the evidence in the law itself. If there were answers, if there wassome explanation for all of the citations above which could still preserve the“conventional wisdom” about the tax (i.e., that most Americans owe it), it wouldobviously have been in the government’s best interest to give those answers andto provide that explanation. But it has not done so.One who is not sure of what is true will often hesitate to voice his opinion.However, no one should feel shame or fear when simply asking reasonablequestions. A nation in which the people don’t even dare to do that is not “free”by any rational definition. So, for those Americans who still believe that theyhave the right to ask their government questions about the law, the followinglist of questions is included. Based upon the answers he receives to suchquestions, whether from a private tax preparer or a government official, thereader can judge for himself what is true and what is not. What to do about hisconclusion is up to him.EXHIBITS[../Images/EA0-454.jpg]Letter to IRS Commissioner[../Images/EA1-456.jpg][../Images/EA2-457.jpg][../Images/EA3-458.jpg][../Images/EB1-459.jpg][../Images/EC1-460.jpg][../Images/EC2-461.jpg][../Images/ED1-462.jpg][../Images/ED2-463.jpg][../Images/ED3-464.jpg][../Images/EE1-465.jpg][../Images/EE2-466.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX BIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTFOR EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIAPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIAMOTION TO SUPPRESSCOMES NOW, Larken D. Rose and his wife, Tessa David (Rose), “Defendants” herein,pursuant to Rules 12(b)(3)(C) and 41(h) of the Federal Rules of CriminalProcedure file the above-captioned Motion (pro se) and move this honorable courtfor an order compelling the suppression at trial of all materials seized duringthe May 6, 2003 search of Defendants’ residence.BACKGROUND:On May 5, 2003, at the request of IRS Special Agent Donald Pearlman, a warrantwas issued authorizing a search of the Defendants’ residence. The following day,at about 10:00 a.m., a dozen or so agents of the Internal Revenue Service(accompanied by local law officers) forcibly entered Defendants’ residence,delivered the search warrant, and spent approximately eight hours searching thepremises and seizing numerous documents and other items belonging to Defendants.On March 22, 2005, an indictment was issued against Defendants, charging fivecounts of “willful failure to file” federal income tax returns (26 USC § 7203).(Though the search warrant itself mentions six separate statutory offenses, asshown below, the indictment includes only the misdemeanor charge of “willfulfailure to file.”)ARGUMENTOVERVIEWThe search warrant in question was constitutionally invalid under both the Firstand Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution.1) The search was neither reasonable nor necessary because all pertinentinformation was already in the government’s possession (having been made publicand/or directly given to the government by the Defendants), and because theAffidavit of Probable Cause upon which the search was based (herein the “APC”)did not even suggest the existence of any additional evidence, the discovery oracquisition of which would require a search and seizure.2) The overly broad scope of the warrant makes it indistinguishable from the“general warrants” prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.3) The search was motivated, not by a valid investigative need for particularevidence, but by a desire to retaliate against Defendants for exercising theirFirst Amendment rights.4) The government’s seizure of various articles of protected speech wasunquestionably contrary to established law.BASIS FOR SUPPRESSIONUse of the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence obtained unlawfully is meantto act as a deterrent, not to “objectively reasonable law enforcement activity”which is later determined to be technically improper, but only to governmentagents who have “engaged in willful, or at the very least negligent, conductwhich has deprived the defendant of some right”; and despite various exceptionsto the rule, “[a] pplication of the exclusionary rule should continue where aFourth Amendment violation has been substantial and deliberate” (United Statesv. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984)). Such is the case here.The main purpose of the exclusionary rule “is to deter future unlawful policeconduct and thereby effectuate the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment againstunreasonable searches and seizures” (United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338(1974)), and to serve that purpose, “evidence obtained from a search should besuppressed only if it can be said that the law enforcement officer hadknowledge, or may properly be charged with knowledge, that the search wasunconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment” (United States v. Peltier, 422 U.S.531 (1975)).(Though the courts give “great deference” to a magistrate’s judgment on anaffidavit of probable cause, “a reviewing court may properly conclude that,notwithstanding the deference that magistrates deserve, the warrant was invalidbecause the magistrate’s probable-cause determination reflected an improperanalysis of the totality of the circumstances” (United States v. Leon, 468 U.S.897 (1984)).)For reasons shown below, Defendants believe that a failure to apply theexclusionary rule in this case would constitute a “judicial blessing” uponintentional and blatant disregard of the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.FOURTH AMENDMENT ISSUESFor a search warrant to be valid, it must meet certain criteria, including thefollowing:1) A search must be both reasonable and necessary.2) Only evidence related to criminal activity may be seized.3) A search for evidence must be specific and limited.In this case the search warrant and the APC show that none of those criteriawere met. While the APC asserts that there is “probable cause” to suspectcriminal activity and to suspect the existence of seizable evidence, a warrantcannot be based “upon mere affirmance of suspicion or belief without disclosureof supporting facts or circumstances” ( Nathanson v. U.S. , 290 U.S. 41 (1933)).Setting aside conclusory comments, therefore, we must turn to the specific factscited in the APC.1) A search must be both reasonable and necessary“The Fourth Amendment, and the personal rights which it secures, have a longhistory. At the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own homeand there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.” [Silverman v.United States, 365 U.S. 505 (1961)]The Fourth Amendment “forbids every search that is unreasonable” ( Go-BartImporting Co. v. U.S. (282 U.S. 344 (1931))), and “any intrusion in the way ofsearch or seizure is an evil, so that no intrusion at all is justified without acareful prior determination of necessity” ( Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S.443 (1971) (emphasis added)). The Internal Revenue Manual provides that “Priorto utilizing a search warrant, consideration should be given to the use of lessintrusive means for obtaining the evidence (i.e., administrative summons)” (IRM,Section 31.7.2.1(2)(B)), and provides that “[i] n addressing intrusiveness, thespecial agent will explain why other investigative methods cannot produce theevidence being sought, and why the search warrant represents the best and leastintrusive method to secure the evidence” (IRM, Section 9.4.9.3(3)).The APC, however, mentions nothing concerning the necessity of the search, butinstead thoroughly documents that the government was already in possession ofall relevant evidence, rendering the entire search completely unnecessary. Evenwith the use of a summons (a far less intrusive measure than a search warrant),the IRS “must show that the investigation will be conducted pursuant to alegitimate purpose... [and] that the information sought is not already withinthe Commissioner’s possession” ( United States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48 (1964)(emphasis added)). The APC in this case shows the opposite.A brief examination of the violations alleged in the search warrant, and thetypes of evidence relevant to each, illustrates that the search was neitherreasonable nor necessary:26 USC § 7203 (Willful Failure to File)The Criminal Tax Manual (1994 edition) published by the Tax Division of the U.S.Department of Justice (herein the “Criminal Tax Manual”) states the elements ofa willful failure to file charge:“To establish the offense of failure to make (file) a return, the governmentmust prove three essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt:1. Defendant was a person required to file a return;2. Defendant failed to file at the time required by law; and,3. The failure to file was willful. ” [Section 10.04[1], Criminal Tax Manual]Regarding the first element, the APC (in paragraph 8) shows that the IRS alreadypossessed documentation showing substantial income received by the Defendantsfor 1997 through 2001, and includes (in paragraph 10) several examples of theDefendants freely acknowledging the receipt of such income. Because “thegovernment need prove only that a person’s gross income equals or exceeds thestatutory minimum”(Criminal Tax Manual, Section 10.04[2], citing United States v. Wade, 585 F.2d573, 574 (5th Cir. 1978)),” and because the government alleges that the reportedincome of Defendants legally constitutes “gross income” (a position with whichDefendants disagree), there was no need to search for evidence of additionalincome.For the second element, the APC (paragraphs 5, 10.5) documents the Defendants’open admissions that Defendants did not file tax returns for 1997 or anysubsequent year (as supported by transcripts of the meetings mentioned inparagraphs 10.2 and 10.4). Concerning Defendants’ decision not to file or pay,the government has acknowledged, in a motion filed with this court in late Mayof 2004, that the Defendants “have not attempted to conceal their conduct. ”The final element hinges on the Defendants’ beliefs about their legalobligations, which are well known to the government, as documented in paragraphs5, 6, 10.5, 13, 16.3, 16.5, 16.6, and 18 of the APC. In short, the APC showsthat there was no pertinent evidence (regarding income, lack of returns, orDefendants’ beliefs) that was not already in the possession of the government,rendering a “search” for such information pointless.26 USC § 7201 (Willful Tax Evasion)The elements for tax evasion are similar to those above: the government mustprove that a tax was owed, that the individual attempted to avoid payment, andthat such action constituted an intentional violation of a known legal duty.However, for such a charge the government must show, not just a willful“omission” or failure to act, but a “commission” or affirmative act constituting“a willful and positive attempt to evade tax in any manner or to defeat it byany means” ( Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943)), consisting of actsdesigned to conceal or mislead. Defendants’ situation and actions are well knownto the government, and no relevant evidence of such could have required asearch.(Of note, while the warrant (in paragraph 12 of “Attachment A”) seeks to seizeany records related to any “straw parties or fictitious names” used to concealincome or assets, the APC alleges no such conduct, and gives no “probable cause”to search for such records.)Regarding WillfulnessIn the description of the two above-mentioned offenses, the APC (in paragraph 2)fails even to mention the issue of “willfulness,” though that issue isfundamental to such allegations.“A good-faith misunderstanding of the law or a good-faith belief that one is notviolating the law negates willfulness, whether or not the claimed belief ormisunderstanding is objectively reasonable. Statutory willfulness... is thevoluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty.” [Cheek v. UnitedStates, 498 U.S. 192 (1991) (emphasis added)]The purpose of the criminal tax statutes is not “to penalize frank difference ofopinion” about the tax laws ( Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943)), andtherefore without “probable cause” showing that Defendants’ believe their incometo be taxable (which is not found in the APC), a search related to such“willful” offenses cannot be justified.The APC states (in paragraphs 5 and 6) that Defendants are aware of a lowercourt ruling disagreeing with Mr. Rose’s position (or a similar position), andalleges that the opinions of various IRS employees (contrary to Mr. Rose’s)constitute “clear and unequivocal notice that [Defendants’] position isincorrect” (paragraph 14). The insinuation that it is impossible or illegal forMr. Rose to have an honest disagreement with an IRS administrator, or a federaljudge, is absurd. The Supreme Court states that “willfulness” depends entirelyupon the belief of the individual, “however unreasonable a court might deem sucha belief” ( Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192 (1991)). (Ironically, the APCin paragraph 14 cites the opinions of several IRS employees as proof that Mr.Rose’s conclusions are incorrect, yet in paragraphs 17.10, 35, and 45,acknowledges that two former IRS employees and one former federal prosecutoragree with Mr. Rose’s conclusions.)(In paragraph 21.5, the APC alleges that Mr. Rose “conceded that his argumentmight be wrong” based upon two sentence fragments from a conversation betweenMr. Rose and an IRS manager at a restaurant on 6/19/02, which was audio-recordedwithout Mr. Rose’s knowledge or consent (in violation of Pennsylvania law).Defendants are confident that the complete transcripts of that meeting, whichDefendants have requested through the Freedom Of Information Act, will revealthat the selective quoting of those sentence fragments in the APC wasintentionally misleading.) Appendix B, Page 326 USC § 7206(1) and 18 USC § 287 (Filing False Returns and False Claims) TheAPC (in paragraphs 12 and 13) shows that the allegations concerning false claimsand false returns stem from three claims for refund (each made on a Form 1040X)filed by the Defendants for the tax years 1994 through 1996. Since the returnsthemselves are in the government’s possession, and the reason for the claims isshown on the returns themselves, such a charge could not justify a “search” foranything.26 USC § 7212(a) (Corrupt Interference with Administration of Tax Laws) The word“corruptly,” as used in 26 USC § 7212(a), “means to act with the intent tosecure an unlawful advantage or benefit either for oneself or another” (UnitedStates v. Reeves, 752 F.2d 995, 998 (5th Cir.)). While the APC (in paragraph 2)asserts that Defendant Larken Rose “has attempted to corruptly interfere with,and impede” the administration of the tax laws, none of the specific facts inthe APC support such an accusation. (The Criminal Tax Manual (Section 17.04)quotes from Reeves I, 752 F.2d at 999, in which it was stated that “there is noreason to presume that every annoyance or impeding of an IRS agent is done perse ‘corruptly.’”) The specific points in the APC presumed to be examples of sucha “corrupt” endeavor are each addressed below under the related “conspiracy”allegation.18 USC § 371 (Conspiracy to Commit an Offense or Defraud the United States)Under the heading of “Rose’s Attempts to Defraud the United States,” the APCstates that Mr. Rose “advocates his claims” on web sites (paragraph 15), on hise-mail update list (paragraph 16.3), in his Taxable Income report (paragraph16.6), and (in cooperation with Tom Clayton, M.D.) in the Theft By Deceptionvideo and on the Theft-By-Deception.com web site, where orders are taken for thevideo (paragraphs 16.2, 17, 18, 19 and 20), which are then shipped via the U.S.postal system (paragraphs 22, 23 and 24). Mr. Rose also invites people to printand distribute a flier in which Mr. Rose invites the government to prosecutehim, and states that if anyone is to be prosecuted for his legal conclusions, hewants it to be himself (paragraph 16.4). Mr. Rose also openly disagrees with TaxCourt rulings (paragraph 16.5), gives his opinion on the legal weight of lowercourt rulings (paragraph 16.8), and describes his desire to see so manyAmericans sharing his conclusions that “the IRS would be unable to continueextorting money from those who do not legally owe it” (paragraph 16.9). Inshort, rather than alleging conduct designed to conceal or mislead, the APCinstead seeks to characterize the mere expression of opinions as criminal fraudand conspiracy. (This attempt to criminalize protected speech is furtheraddressed below.)(While Mr. Rose here verbally hopes for change via widespread compliance withthe law, as he understands it, the First Amendment even makes it unlawful forgovernment to “forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of lawviolation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producingimminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action” (Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969)).)The APC states that Mr. Rose lists on a web site the names of governmentemployees who have been sent copies of his Theft By Deception video (paragraph21), and on the taxableincome.net web site talks about sending letters to IRSemployees in an effort to persuade the agents to take “personal responsibility”for their actions (paragraph 16.7). In the APC, Agent Pearlman opines that hebelieves those letters to be “a direct attempt to have IRS employees stopenforcing the internal revenue laws,” thereby constituting an attempt to“corruptly” interfere with the administration of the tax laws (paragraph 16.7),and alleges that there is “potential of personal harm” to those governmentofficials whose names have been listed on the internet (paragraph 21). However,the APC makes clear that Mr. Rose is not suggesting that anyone “stop enforcing”the laws, but is merely seeking to change the beliefs of government employees,and to publicly expose the conduct of those government officials who Mr. Rosebelieves are knowingly disregarding the law.The attempt to criminalize such speech (which plainly constitutes a “redress ofgrievances”) under the guise that it may pose a personal risk to the governmentofficials named on the web site (though Mr. Rose suggests no action against thenamed individuals) lacks any legal basis. The Supreme Court has even stated thatthe importance of freedom of the press lies “in its diffusion of liberalsentiments on the administration of Government, its ready communication ofthoughts between subjects, and its consequential promotion of union among them,whereby oppressive officers are shamed or intimidated, Appendix B, Page 4 intomore honourable and just modes of conducting affairs” ( Near v. State ofMinnesota Ex Rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697 (1931) (emphasis added)). The merepublicizing of the fact that certain government officials have been suppliedwith certain information does not even approach speech which can be forbidden,criminalized or punished.“’To prohibit the intent to excite those unfavorable sentiments against thosewho administer the Government... is equivalent to a protection of those whoadminister the Government, if they should at any time deserve the contempt orhatred of the people, against being exposed to it by free animadversions ontheir characters and conduct.’ [footnote omitted] There is nothing new in thefact that charges of reprehensible conduct may create resentment and thedisposition to resort to violent means of redress, but this well-understoodtendency did not alter the determination to protect the press against censorshipand restraint upon publication. ” [Near v. State of Minnesota Ex Rel. Olson, 283U.S. 697 (1931) (emphasis added)]In paragraphs 27 and 28, the APC discusses how Mr. Rose was present for andinvolved in meetings between two other individuals and the IRS, which the APCcharacterizes as a “corrupt” endeavor to interfere with the administration ofthe tax laws, though Mr. Rose’s actions consisted entirely of helping twoindividuals attempt to discover exactly how the IRS had determined their“taxable income.” As the APC admits, Mr. Rose made no secret of this, postingthe transcripts of the meetings on the internet.It is absurd to allege that asking questions about the law could be a crime. TheAPC itself illustrates the ridiculousness of the charge when Agent Pearlmanstates (in paragraph 28) that he believes that Mr. Rose used one meeting “as anopportunity to get IRS reactions to his own views ‘on the record,’ therebycorruptly interfering with, and impeding, the administration of the internalrevenue laws. ” Attempting to get the government to state its own position onthe record is not a crime, nor is it “corrupt” by any sane definition,regardless of who is doing the asking, or in what context.(As an aside, Section 23.07 of the Criminal Tax Manual shows that the “corrupt”endeavor phraseology used repeatedly in the APC applies to so-called “Kleinconspiracies” (United States v. Klein, 247 F.2d 908, 915 (2d Cir. 1957)). TheManual makes it plain (in fifty-nine different examples) that such conspiraciesinvolve the use of misleading records, transactions or financial arrangements,not the open asking of questions about the law.)The APC also mentions (paragraphs 25, 26) that at two meetings with the IRS, Mr.Rose did not give the IRS everything they asked for, and stated that thematerial requested was irrelevant and beyond the IRS’ legal authority to demand.(The IRS did not issue subsequent requests or a summons for the information.)Characterizing these actions as criminal behavior is absurd.Equally absurd is the attempt to criminalize Mr. Rose’s “non-violent threats” totake legal action, including the filing of formal complaints, against IRSemployee who intentionally disregarded IRS regulations and procedures (APC,paragraph 32). Section 17.05 of the Criminal Tax Manual, citing United States v.Hylton, 710 F.2d 1106 (5th Cir. 1983), even acknowledges that a “corruptinterference” charge under Section 7212(a) “can not be based on nonfraudulentcomplaint against IRS agents,” and the APC does not even allege that suchcomplaints were, or would have been, fraudulent.The APC (in paragraphs 29, 30 and 31) also discusses three other individuals(two of whom Mr. Rose does not know) citing Mr. Rose’s publicly-availablematerials in their own correspondence with the IRS. It is neither illegal forMr. Rose to share his opinions and correspondence, nor illegal for others toquote from such documents, with or without Mr. Rose’s knowledge or consent.The APC also discusses the background and actions of Sherry Peel Jackson(paragraphs 33 to 37) and Dr. Tom Clayton (paragraphs 38 to 47), and theirefforts to help spread their own beliefs, which coincide with the beliefs of Mr.Rose.In brief, the APC tries to support allegations of corrupt endeavors, fraud andcriminal conspiracy, based on a laundry list of Defendants’ comments,activities, and documents, none of which are in any way deceptive, fraudulent,or “corrupt.” The courts have cautioned against such tactics, warning that the“conspiracy” statute (18 USC § 371) is so broad that “there is a danger thatprosecutors may use it arbitrarily to punish activity not properly within theambit of the federal criminal sanction” (United States v. Shoup, 608 F.2d 950(3d Cir. 1979)).Similarly, the Supreme Court speaks of trying to “defraud” the United States byinterfering with lawful government functions “by deceit, craft or trickery, orat least by means that are dishonest,” adding that the words “to defraud”“usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick, deceit,chicane, or overreaching” ( Hammerschmidt v. United States, 265 U.S. 182 (1924)(emphasis added)). The government’s own Criminal Tax Manual (Section23.07[1][b]) agrees, stating that “deceit or trickery in the scheme is essentialto satisfying the defrauding requirement in the statute. ”The APC does not even allege any acts of deception or concealment, but insteadmakes it plain that Defendants have been exceedingly open and public about theiractions. Rather than illustrating a pattern of deceit, fraud, or any actualcriminal behavior, the APC manifests instead the government’s resentment andhatred of the Defendants for having had the gall to voice opinions that arecontrary to the opinions of government employees.2) Evidence Sought must be Related to Criminal ActivityAccording to Rule 41(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, searchwarrants can be used to seize only documents or items that: 1) are evidence of acrime; 2) are possessed illegally; or 3) were used or were designed or intendedto be used in committing a crime. In the landmark case of Warden v. Hayden, 387U.S. 294 (1967), the Supreme Court ruled that search warrants could be used toseize “mere evidence” of a crime, but added that “[t] here must, of course, be anexus... between the item to be seized and criminal behavior.” Obviously awarrant which “particularly describes” items to be seized which are unrelated toany criminal activity is impermissible under the Fourth Amendment, and thefailure to provide any factual basis showing why the items sought are believedto be evidence of some crime renders a warrant invalid ( United States v. Kow,58 F. 3d 423 (9th Cir. 1995)).According to the Internal Revenue Manual, IRS District Counsel is required toassure that all evidence sought via warrant “is seizable by virtue of beingconnected with the crime” (IRM, Section 31.7.2.1(3)(C)), and the affidavit ofprobable cause must explain “the relationship of any items described to thealleged violations” (IRM, Section 31.7.2.1(3)(D)(2)). The APC in this case failsto relate any of the items sought to any crime, and “Attachment A” refers tomany things which could not possibly be evidence of any crime, including (butnot limited to):1) All “documents relating to the formation/creation” of web sites (item 10).2) All documents relating to the formation of business entities by Defendants(item 11).3) Documents showing ownership of “automobiles, boats, and/or airplanes” (item13).4) All “copies of Internal Revenue Service Publications and documents” (item19).5) All Theft By Deception videotapes (item 27).In addition, items 1 through 9 in “Attachment A” sought to seize virtually everyfinancial document imaginable. Neither running a business, nor receiving income,is a crime. Absent any allegation that Defendants’ income was either earnedillegally, or was being hidden or misreported (neither of which is alleged inthe APC), such a seizure is not relevant to or necessary for a criminalinvestigation. (Again, while item 12 refers to “straw parties or fictitiousnames” used to conceal income or assets, the APC itself alleges no suchconduct.) In addition, the broad scope of items 1 through 9 would apply to manyitems not even related to Defendants’ income.The search for all documents (by any author) related to “any tax-related issues”(item 18), and the search for any and all computers and computer disks,regardless of content (item 21), would obviously yield enormous amounts ofinformation which could not possibly be related to any criminal activity.The inventory list left with the Defendants after the search showed theconfiscation of other items not specifically mentioned in “Attachment A,” whichalso could not possibly be evidence of criminal activity (and should thereforenot have been seized), including, among other things: scans of older taxstatutes (items A-3 and A-7); Theft-By-Deception.com bumper-stickers (item A-4);a court transcript (item A-7); videos about taxes by other individuals (itemA-10); list of incoming calls from Caller ID on phone (item A-29); TaxableIncome reports (item A-32); city tax documents (item A-32); hospital bills (itemA-33); printed out court cases (item A-33); a phone book (item C-1); deed toDefendants’ house (item C-2); current bills and mail (items C-2 and C-7); twonewspapers (item C-3); records of estate of Tessa David’s father (item C-4); ToHarass Our People book (item C-9); insurance documents (items C-10 and E-1); twoblank checks (item E-3); and an old calendar (item E-4). The IRS obviously didnot limit the search and seizure to items which are “seizable by virtue of beingconnected with [any] crime” (IRM, Section 31.7.2.1(3)(C)), and Defendants failto see how any of the items seized constitute evidence of a crime.(Also, though items 24 through 26 on “Attachment A” seek records concerning “taxadvice,” the APC does not even allege any such conduct by Defendants.)3) Evidence Sought Must be Specific and LimitedEven “those searches deemed necessary should be as limited as possible” (Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443 (1971)). In Coolidge, while condemning“the ‘general warrant’ abhorred by the colonists,” the Supreme Court expressed aconcern, not just about the use of a search warrant per se, but about the use ofwarrants as a means of carrying out “general, exploratory rummaging in aperson’s belongings.”“It is familiar history that indiscriminate searches and seizures conductedunder the authority of ‘general warrant’ were the immediate evils that motivatedthe framing and adoption of the Fourth Amendment. ” [Payton v. New York, 445U.S. 573 (1980)]Even where there is “probable cause” to justify a search, a warrant cannonetheless be rendered invalid by its overly broad scope.“Search warrants... are fundamentally offensive to the underlying principles ofthe Fourth Amendment when they are so bountiful and expansive in their languagethat they constitute a virtual, all-encompassing dragnet of personal papers andproperty to be seized at the discretion of the State. See Stanford, 379 U.S. at481 (the Fourth Amendment “reflect[s] the determination of those who wrote theBill of Rights that the people of this new Nation should forever `be secure intheir persons, houses, papers, and effects’ from intrusion and seizure byofficers acting under the unbridled authority of a general warrant.”(internalquotation marks omitted)); see also Boyd, 116 U.S. at 630-31... Although thelist of items and categories of property set forth in Attachment B is detailed,the list is so expansive that its language authorizes the Government to seizealmost all of ATC’s property, papers, and office equipment in Billings.” [U.S.v. Bridges, No. 01-30316 (9th Cir. 2003) (emphasis added)]The defendants in the Bridges case were voicing unorthodox beliefs concerningthe tax laws, but were also directly involved in advising and assisting clientsin their tax dealings (types of actions not even alleged in the present case).Even so, the court threw out the search as being overly broad. The fact that alist of things to be seized is “specific” is, by itself, not enough. Byspecifically “listing every type of record that could conceivably be found in anoffice,” a warrant may effectively authorize agents “to cart away anything thatthey could find on the premises” ( Roberts v. United States, 656 F.Supp. 929,934 (S.D.N.Y. 1987)), which is precisely what occurred in this case, inviolation of the Fourth Amendment.The Internal Revenue Manual even informs IRS Special Agents that when “preparingthe list of items to be seized, the agent should be specific as to the nature,type, and time frame of items and records to be seized,” adding that the “[u] seof the phrases like ‘any and all records’ should be avoided as they imply anoverly broad and nonspecific search methodology” (IRM, Section 9.4.9.5.1.3(2)(emphasis added)). Numerous examples of such phraseology are found throughout“Attachment A.” For example, item 18 on the list sought to seize “any and allcopies of any publications, research material or other documents relating to theIRS, federal income taxes, and any tax-related issues. ” The insinuation thatevery document related to “any tax-related issue” possessed by the Defendantsmust be evidence of a crime is absurd.Item 21 on “Attachment A” seeks the seizure of any and all computers, harddrives, floppy disks, laser disks, etc., regardless of content. Conducting sucha search and seizure in this day and age is the equivalent of conducting asearch of someone’s home thirty years ago seeking “any and all pieces of paper.”The requirement that computer searches be limited is explained in Part II.C. ofa document from the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice entitled“Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence in CriminalInvestigations,” which includes the following (emphasis has been added):“The Fourth Amendment requires that every warrant must ‘particularly describ[e]. . . the . . . things to be seized.’ U.S. Const. Amend. IV. The particularityrequirement prevents law enforcement from executing ‘general warrants’ thatpermit ‘exploratory rummaging’ through a person’s belongings in search ofevidence of a crime. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 467 (1971). Theparticularity requirement has two distinct elements. See United States v. Upham,168 F.3d 532, 535 (1st Cir. 1999). First, the warrant Appendix B, Page 7 mustdescribe the things to be seized with sufficiently precise language so that ittells the officers how to separate the items properly subject to seizure fromirrelevant items. See Marron v. United States, 275 U.S. 192, 296 (1925) (’As towhat is to be taken, nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executingthe warrant.’); Davis v. Gracey, 111 F.3d 1472, 1478 (10th Cir. 1997). Second,the description of the things to be seized must not be so broad that itencompasses items that should not be seized. See Upham, 168 F.3d at 535...Considered together, the elements forbid agents from obtaining “generalwarrants” and instead require agents to conduct narrow seizures that attempt to‘minimize[] unwarranted intrusions upon privacy.’ Andresen v. Maryland, 427 U.S.463, 482 n.11 (1976)... Agents should be particularly careful when seekingauthority to seize a broad class of information. This often occurs when agentsplan to search computers at a business. See, e.g., United States v. Leary, 846F.2d 592, 600-04 (10th Cir. 1988). Agents cannot simply request permission toseize ‘all records’ from an operating business unless agents have probable causeto believe that the criminal activity under investigation pervades the entirebusiness. [citations omitted] Instead, the description of the files to be seizedshould include limiting phrases that can modify and limit the ‘all records’search... United States v. Hunter, 13 F. Supp. 2d 574, 584 (D. Vt. 1998)(concluding that warrant to seize ‘[a]ll computers’ not sufficiently particularwhere description ‘did not indicate the specific crimes for which the equipmentwas sought, nor were the supporting affidavits or the limits contained in thesearching instructions incorporated by reference.’)”Similarly, the Internal Revenue Manual instructs Special Agents, when doingsearches involving computers, to “[d] etermine the role of the computer in theoffense,” to “[d] evelop probable cause for each component of the computer,” andalso states that the Special Agent “must articulate a factual basis to believethat the computer was used for the creation and/or storage of evidentiaryrecords” (IRM, Section 9.4.10.7). There was no indication in the APC that anysuch procedures were followed in this case.FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES“[W]hile the general rule under the Fourth Amendment is that any and allcontraband, instrumentalities, and evidence of crimes may be seized on probablecause... it is otherwise when materials presumptively protected by the FirstAmendment are involved. Lo-Ji Sales, Inc. v. New York, 442 U.S. 319, 326, n. 5(1979). ” [Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46 (1989) (emphasisadded)]“The use by government of the power of search and seizure as an adjunct to asystem for the suppression of objectionable publications is not new... The Billof Rights was fashioned against the background of knowledge that unrestrictedpower of search and seizure could also be an instrument for stifling liberty ofexpression.” [Marcus v. Search Warrant, 367 U.S. 717 (1961) (emphasis added)]The APC in this case shows not only a complete disregard for the above-expressedprinciples, but exhibits a motive of censorship, both through overt confiscationof First Amendment materials and through retaliation (under “color of law”)against Defendants for exercising their free speech rights.“[T]he constitutional requirement that warrants must particularly describe the‘things to be seized’ is to be accorded the most scrupulous exactitude when the‘things’ are books, and the basis for their seizure is the ideas which theycontain.” [Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476 (1965) (emphasis added)]Nonetheless, the IRS seized multiple copies of Defendant Larken Rose’s TaxableIncome report, and approximately two hundred copies of Mr. Rose’s Theft ByDeception videotape. The APC (in paragraphs 16.6, 18, 19 and 20) shows that theIRS already had copies of the video and the report (and was well aware of theircontents), and was well aware that they constitute two of the primary means bywhich Mr. Rose publicly shares his opinions and beliefs, as is his right underthe First Amendment.Neither the written report nor the video gives any advice, or instructs anyoneto do anything, and the government has never even alleged that either isillegal. Such intentional confiscation of articles of clearly protected speechamounts to a modern-day “book burning,” and has been specifically condemned bythe Supreme Court.“While a single copy of a book or film may be seized and retained forevidentiary purposes based on a finding of probable cause, books or films maynot be taken out of circulation completely until there has been a determinationof [illegality] after an adversary hearing... Mere probable cause to believe aviolation has transpired is not adequate to remove books or film fromcirculation.” [Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46 (1989) (emphasisadded)].“[S]eizing films to destroy them or to block their distribution or exhibition isa very different matter from seizing a single copy of a film for the bona fidepurpose of preserving it as evidence in a criminal proceeding. ” [Heller v. NewYork, 413 U.S. 483 (1973) (emphasis added)].The issuance of a warrant that specifically sought to confiscate all copies ofthe Theft By Deception video (item 27 on “Attachment A”), as well as anydocuments concerning “any tax-related issues” (item 18), from an individual wellknown for publicly expressing his views concerning federal taxes, is preciselythe type of censorship-via-”search” which the Fourth Amendment prohibits.Furthermore, any possibility that the seizure of videos and written reports wasan honest mistake resulting from the searching agents’ ignorance of the law(which by itself would constitute gross negligence) is ruled out by thefollowing facts (see the attached affidavit of Mr. Rose):1) The IRS was well aware of the contents of the video (APC, paragraphs 18 to20), yet seized every copy they could find, including individual copies still inthe “shrink wrap,” as well as sealed cartons containing 50 videos each.2) When, during the search, Mr. Rose asked when the videotapes would bereturned, the IRS agent in charge, Donald Pearlman, openly stated that theywould never be returned, even at the conclusion of the investigation.3) Shortly after the raid, Mr. Rose sent a letter to Agent Pearlman (viacertified mail), specifically citing a Supreme Court ruling (see above) sayingthat while a single video could be seized if necessary, a wholesale confiscationis illegal. Nonetheless, in a subsequent phone call, Agent Pearlman again statedthat the videos would never be returned, even at the conclusion of theinvestigation.4) Though the same Supreme Court citations shown above, specifically condemningsuch confiscation of films, were included in Defendants’ initial motion to quashthe warrant in question, the government still has not returned any of thevideos, and the court has not ordered their return.These facts clearly manifest not only a premeditated agenda of censorship beforethe raid even occurred, but an ongoing and intentional violation of the FirstAmendment rights of the Defendants. It seems that the IRS does not share in the“profound national commitment to the free exchange of ideas” ( Harte-Hanks v.Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657 (1989)), or the “profound national commitment to theprinciple that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, andwide-open” ( New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964)). (Even theeventual return of the First Amendment materials cannot undo the wrong done, asthe “loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury” ( Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347(1976)).)Neither the warrant nor the APC mentions the First Amendment at all, or showsany efforts or precautions taken to avoid violating the Defendants’ freedom ofspeech rights. The author of the APC seems completely unaware that theDefendants have any right to voice their opinions, and instead manifests anattitude more akin to the “Thought Police” in George Orwell’s “1984.” To wit,under the heading of “Rose’s Attempts to Defraud the United States,” the APCmentions that: Mr. Rose “advocates his claims” on web sites (paragraph 15); Mr.Rose expresses his views in his Theft By Deception video (paragraphs 16.2, 18,19 and 20) and in his Taxable Income report (paragraph 16.6); Mr. Rose invitespeople to subscribe to his free e-mail list (paragraph 16.3) on which heexpresses his opinions; Mr. Rose openly disagrees with Tax Court rulings(paragraph 16.5); Mr. Rose voices his opinions concerning the legal weight oflower court rulings (paragraph 16.8); Mr. Rose expresses his desire to see manyothers reaching the conclusion he reached (paragraph 16.9); Mr. Rose and Dr.Clayton cooperated to make the Theft-By-Deception.com web site, on which bothindividuals express their opinions (paragraph 17).More than a dozen pages of the APC (pages 11 to 24, etc.) deal with the ways inwhich Mr. Rose voices his opinions. After documenting in detail the contents ofthe video and the web sites, the APC (in paragraph 20) comes to the remarkableconclusion that Mr. Rose and Dr. Clayton expressing their beliefs using two websites and a video constitutes “efforts to reach a mass audience in an effort togain support for ROSE’s agreement, with others, to attempt to defraud the UnitedStates and to corruptly interfere with, and impede, the administration of theInternal Revenue Code.” Again, the APC does not allege that Mr. Rose has taxclients, gives advice, or is involved with the preparation of tax returns; thebasis for the allegation is that Mr. Rose speaks his mind. (Of note, none of theweb sites in question has a “members” area or any other restricted content, andthey are freely accessible by the general public and the government.) Thegovernment is clearly seeking to punish Mr. Rose, not for actual criminal acts,but for his ideas and opinions.The claim in the APC (paragraph 14) that Mr. Rose has been given “notice” thathis beliefs are incorrect has no effect upon Defendants’ First Amendment rights.Mr. Rose has no obligation to agree with anyone in government, nor do FirstAmendment protections even depend upon “the truth, popularity, or social utilityof the ideas and beliefs which are offered” ( N.A.A.C.P. v. Button, 371 U.S. 415(1963)).“Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea. Howeverpernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on theconscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas. ” [Gertzv. Robert Welch, Inc. , 418 U.S. 323 (1974)]It is a gross understatement to say that armed invasions of private residencesby government agents, in response to individuals stating their opinions, has a“chilling effect” on freedom of speech. As shown above, the raid in this casewent far beyond a mere “callous disregard” for the Defendants’ First Amendmentrights, and instead constituted an intentional violation of such rights, in theform of retaliation and intimidation via armed invasion and forcibleconfiscation of articles of protected speech. The true motive for the raid wasclearly expressed by one IRS agent who, during the search of Defendants’residence, made the following statement (or a statement of very similar wordingand identical meaning): “When people hear you’ve been raided, no one’s going tolisten to you any more” (see attached affidavit).SUMMARYIn the 44 pages of the APC, nowhere does it even suggest that the Defendantswere concealing their actions or any evidence, or that Defendants had doneanything misleading. The government even acknowledges that the Defendants “havenot attempted to conceal their conduct.” While the APC refers to extensiveinformation which the Defendants have either made publicly available and/or havevoluntarily given to the government, the APC does not allege the existence ofany additional or concealed evidence which might necessitate or justify theintrusion and invasion of privacy involved with the execution of a searchwarrant.One has to wonder what additional information the Defendants could have given tothe government, or how the Defendants could have been any more open about theiractions and beliefs, in order to avoid an armed invasion of their home byfederal agents. To have the government committing such acts of forcibleintimidation and retaliation, and to have the courts condoning such actions,based on nothing more than an open, honest disagreement about the law, obviouslygoes against the core purpose of the Fourth Amendment, which is to allow anyone“to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmentalintrusion” ( Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505 (1961)).Not only was the search entirely unnecessary, but the warrant was ridiculouslyoverly broad, seeking to seize numerous items which could not possibly berelated to any crime, as well as many items that constitute articles ofprotected speech. The APC proves that the IRS was already well aware of theinformation contained in those materials, and was well aware of the fact thatthose articles were meant for public distribution. Again, the APC, warrant andsearch show a premeditated and intentional violation of Defendants’ First andFourth Amendment rights (in violation of 18 USC §§ 242, 2235). As such, thesearch should be declared unconstitutional, and nothing obtained in the searchshould be admissible in any criminal trial.REQUEST FOR EVIDENTIARY HEARINGDefendants hereby request a suppression hearing pursuant to Rule 12(b)(3)(C) ofthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in order to further explore the issuesaddressed herein.PRAYER FOR RELIEFFor the above stated reasons, Defendants hereby respectfully move this HonorableCourt to grant this Motion and to order the suppression of all seized materials.March 14, 2005"},{"pageContent":"ENDNOTES[1] [../Text/appendixA.html#endnote1] Flint v.
