But I hope that in this new edition I have succeeded in showing very distinctly that for the student in spirit ual training in the sens e of modern spiritual conditions much more emphasis should be laid on the complete and immediate connection with the objective sp iritual world than any relation to the person of a teacher.' The foundation of a Spiritual Science and its School and Headquarters at Dornach, Switzerland, was meant by Dr. Steiner to replace more and more the individual consultation between pupil and teacher by a dire ctly objective course of direct spiritual teaching, such as is given in this book, and finally referred to on p. 158, in his Appendix to the final Edition of 1918.

CONDITIONS There slumber in every human being, facultie s by means of which he can acquire for himself a knowledge of higher worlds. Mystic s, Gnostics, Theosophi sts - all speak of a world of soul and spirit, which for them is just as real as the world we see with our physical eyes and touch with our physical ha nds. At every moment the listener may say to himself: that, of which they speak, I too can learn, if I develop within myself certain powers which to-day still slumber within me. There remains only one question - how to set to work to develop such faculties. For this purpose, th ey only can give advice who already possess such powers. As long as the human race has existed there has always been a method of training, in the course of which, individuals possessing these higher faculties gave instruction to others who were in search of them. Such a training is called occult (esoteric) traini ng, and the instruction thereby received is called occult (esoteric) teaching, or spiritual science. This designa tion naturally awakens misunderstanding. The listener may very easily be misled into the be lief that this training is the concern of a special, privileged clas s, withholding its knowledge arbitr arily from its fellow-creatures. He may even think that nothing of real impor tance lies behind such knowledge, for it if were a true knowledge - he is tempted to thi nk - there would be no need to make a secret of it; it might be publicly imparted and its advantages made to all. They who have been initiated into the natu re of this higher knowledge, are not in the least surprised that the uninitiated should so think, for the secret of Initiation can only be understood by those who have to a certain degree experienced th is Initiation into th e higher knowledge of existence. The question may be raised: how , then, are the uninitiated, under these circumstances, to develop any human interest in this so-called esoteric knowledge? How and why are they to seek for something of whose nature they can form no idea! Such a question is based upon an entirely erroneous co nception of the real nature of esoteric knowledge. There is, in truth, no difference be tween esoteric knowledge and all the rest of man ’ s knowledge and proficiency. This esoteric knowledge is no more of a secret for the average human being, than writing is a se cret for those who have never learnt. And just as all can learn to write , who choose the correct method, so too, can all who seek the right way become esoteric students, and ev en teachers. In one respect only, do the conditions here differ from those that appl y to external knowledge and proficiency. The possibility of acquiring the art of writing may be withheld from someone through poverty, or through the conditions of civilisa tion into which he is born; but for the attainment of knowledge and proficiency in the higher worlds, there is no obstacle for those who earnestly seek them. Many believe that they must discover, at one place or another, the Masters of higher knowledge, in order to receive enlightenment from them. [footnote: See Appendix and the Editorial Preface.] Now in the first pla ce, whoever strives earnestly after higher"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"knowledge will shun no exertion, and fear no obsta cle in his search for an Initiate who can lead him into the higher knowledge of the world. On the other hand, everyone may be certain that Initiation will find him under all ci rcumstances, if he gives proof of an earnest and worthy endeavour to attain this knowledge. It is a natural law am ong all Initiates to withhold from no man the knowledge that is due to him; but there is an equally natural law which lays down that no word of esoteric knowledge shall be imparted to anyone not qualified to receive it. And the more strictly he observes these laws, the more perfect is an Initiate. The bond of union em bracing all Initiates is spiritual and not external, but the two laws here mentioned, form, as it were, strong clasps, by which the component parts of this bond are held together. You may live in intimate friendship w ith an Initiate, and yet a gap severs you from his essential self, so long as you have not become an Initiate yourself. You may enjoy in the fullest sense, the heart, the love of an Initiate, yet he will only confide his knowledge to you, when you ar e ripe for it. You may flatter him; you may torture him; nothing can induce him to betray anything to you, inasmuch as you, at the present stage of your evolution, are not comp etent to receive it into your soul in the right way. The methods by which a student is prepared for the reception of higher knowledge are minutely prescribed. The direction he is to take is traced with unfad ing, everlasting letters in the worlds of the spirit, where the Initia tes guard the higher secrets. In ancient times, anterior to our history, the temples of the spirit were also outwardly visible; to-day, because our life has become so unspiritual, they are not to be found in the world visible to external sight; yet they are present spiritua lly everywhere, and all who seek, may find them. Only within his own soul can a man find the m eans to unseal the lips of an Initiate. He must develop within himself certain faculties to a definite degree, and then the highest treasures of the spirit can become his own. He must begin with a certain fundamental attitude of the s oul. In Spiritual Science this fundamental attitude is called the path of veneration, of devotion for truth and knowledge. Without this attitude no one can become a student. The disposition shown in their childhood by subsequent students of higher knowle dge, is well known to the experienced in these matters. There are children who look up w ith religious awe to those whom they venerate. For such people they have a respect which forbids them, even in the deepest recess of their heart, to harbour any thought of criticism or opposition. Such children grow up into young men and women who feel happy when they are able to look up to anything that fills them with venera tion. From the ranks of such children are recruited many students of higher knowledge. Ha ve you ever paused outside the door of some venerated person, and have you, on this you r first visit, felt a religious awe as you pressed on the handle to enter th e room which for you is a holy place? If so, a feeling has been manifested within you, which may be the germ of your future a dherence to the path of knowledge. It is a blessing fo r every human being in process of development, to have such feelings upon which to build. Only it must not be thought that this disposition leads to submissiveness and slavery. What wa s once a childish veneration for persons, becomes, later, a veneration for truth and knowledge. Experience teaches that they can"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"best hold their heads erect, w ho have learnt to venerate where veneration is due; and veneration is always due when it flow s from the depths of the heart. If we do not develop within ourselves this de eply rooted feeling that there is something higher than ourselves, we shall never find the strength to evolve to something higher. The Initiate has only acquired the strength to lift his head to the heights of knowledge by guiding his heart to the depths of venerati on and devotion. The heights of the spirit can only be climbed by passing through the portals of humility. You can only acquire right knowledge when you have learnt to esteem it. Ma n has certainly the right to turn his eyes to the light, but he must first acquire this right. There are laws in the spiritual life, as in the physical life. Rub a glass r od with an appropriate material , and it will become electric, that is, it will receive the pow er of attracting small bodies. Th is is in keeping with a law of nature. It is known to all who have learnt a little physics. Similarly, acquaintance with the first principles of Spiritual Science shows that every feeling of true devotion harboured in the soul, develops a power whic h may, sooner or later, lead further on the path of knowledge. The student who is gifted with this feeli ng, or who is fortunate enough to have had it inculcated in a suitable educat ion, brings a great deal along w ith him, when, later in life, he seeks admittance to higher knowledge. Failing such preparation, he will encounter difficulties at the very first step, unless he undertakes, by rigorous self-education, to create within himself this inne r life of devotion. In our time, it is especially important that full attention be paid to this point. Our civ ilisation tends more towards critical judgment, and condemnation, than towards devotion a nd selfless veneration. Our children already criticize far more than they worship. But ev ery criticism, every adve rse judgment passed, disperses the powers of the soul for the at tainment of higher knowledge, in the same measure that all veneration and reverence deve lops them. In this we do not wish to say anything against our civ ilization. There is no question here of levelling criticism against it. To this critical facu lty, this self-conscious human judgment, this ‘ prove all things and hold fast what is best ’ , we owe the greatness of our ci vilization, Man c ould never have attained to the science, the industry, the comm erce, the legal advantages of our time, had he not applied to all things the standard of his critical judgment. But what we have thereby gained in external culture, we have had to pay for with a corresponding loss of higher knowledge of spiritual life. It must be emphasized that higher knowledge is not concerned with the veneration of persons, but the veneration of truth and knowledge. Now the one thing that everyone must at once admit, is the difficulty for those involved in the external civilization of our time to advance to the knowledge of the higher worlds. They can only do so if they work energetically at themselves. At a time when the conditions of material life were simpler, th e attainment of spiritu al knowledge was also easier. Objects of veneration and worship st ood out in better relief from the ordinary things of the world. In an epoch of criticism, ideals are lowered; ot her feelings take the place of veneration, respect, prayer and wonde r. Our own age thrusts these feelings further and further into the background, so that they can only be conveyed to man, through his everyday life, in a very small de gree. Whoever seeks hi gher knowledge, must create it for himself. He must instil it into his soul. It cannot be done by study; it can only"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"be done through life. Whoever, therefore, wishes to become a student of higher knowledge, must assiduously cu ltivate this inner life of devotion. Everywhere in his environment and in his experiences, he must seek motives of admiration and homage. If I meet a man and blame him for his weakness, I rob myself of power to attain higher knowledge; but if I try to enter lovingly into his merits, I gather such power. The student must continually be intent upon following this advice. The spiritua lly experienced know how much they owe to the circumstance, that in face of all things, they ever again turn to the good, and withhold adverse judgment. But this must not remain an external rule of life; rather it must take po ssession of our innermost soul. Man has it in his power to perfect himself, and, in time, completely to transform himself. But this transformation must take place in his innermost self, in hi s thought-life. It is not enough that I show respect only in my outward bear ing; I must have this respect in my thoughts. The student must begin by absorbing this devotion into hi s thought-life. He must be wary of thoughts of disrespect, of adverse cri ticism, existing in his conscious ness, and he must endeavour straightaway to cultiv ate thoughts of devotion. Every moment that we set ourselves to disc over in our consciousness, whatever there remains in it of adverse, disp araging and critical judgment of the world and of life; every such moment brings us nearer to higher knowledge. And we rise rapidly when we fill our consciousness in such moments with thought s evoking in us admiration, respect and veneration for the world and for life. It is well known to those experienced in these matters, that, in every such moment, power s are awakened which otherwise remain dormant. In this way the spiritual eyes of ma n are opened. He begins to see things around him which he could not have seen before. He begins to understand that hitherto he had only seen a part of the world around him. A human being standi ng before him, now presents a new and different as pect. Of course this rule of life alone will not yet enable him to see, for instance, what is described as the human aura, because, for this purpose, a still higher training is necessary. But he can rise to this higher training, if he has previously undergone a rigorous training in devotion. [footnote: In the last chapter of his book, Theosophy, the author describes fully th is Path of Knowledge; here it is only intended to give some practical details.] Noiseless and unnoticed by the out er world is the treading of the Path of Knowledge. No change need be noticed in the student. He pe rforms his duties as hitherto; he attends to his business as before. The transformation goe s on only in the inner part of the soul hidden from outward sight. At first his enti re inner life is flooded by this harmony of devotion for everything which is truly venera ble. His entire soul-life finds in this fundamental feeling its pivot. Just as the sun ’ s rays vivify everything living, so does reverence, in the student, vivify all feelings of the soul. It is not easy, at first, to believe that fee lings like reverence and re spect have anything to do with cognition. This is due to the fact that we are inclin ed to set cognition aside as a faculty by itself - one that stands in no relation to what otherwise transpires in the soul. In so thinking, we do not bear in mind that it is the soul which exercises the faculty of cognition; and feelings are, for the soul, wh at food is for the body. If we give the body stones in place of bread, its activity will cease. It is the same with the soul. Veneration,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"homage, devotion are as nutrime nt making it healthy and stro ng, especially strong for the activity of cognition. Disrespect, antipa thy, under-estimation of what deserves recognition, exert a paralysing a nd withering effect on this faculty of cognition. For the spiritually experienced, th is fact is visible in the aura. A soul which harbours feelings of reverence and devotion, produces a change in its aura. Certain spir itual colourings, as they may be called, yellow-red and brown-red in tone, vanish, and are replaced by blue- red tints. Thereby the cognitional faculty is ripened; it receives intelligence of facts in its environment, of which it has hitherto no id ea. Reverence awakens a sympathetic power through which we attract qualities in the bein gs around us, which would otherwise remain concealed. The power obtained through devotion can be rendered still more effective, when the life of feeling is enriched by yet another quality. To achie ve this the student learns to give himself up le ss and less to impressions of the outer world, and to develop instead a vivid inner life. A person who darts from one impression of the outer world to another, who constantly seeks ‘ distraction ’ , cannot find the way to higher knowledge. The student must not blunt himself to the outer world, but while lending himself to its impressions, he should be directed by hi s rich inner life. When passing through a beautiful mountain district, the traveller with depth of soul and wealth of feeling has different experiences from one who is poor in feeling. Only what we experience within ourselves unlocks for us th e beauties of the outer worl d. One person sails across the ocean, and only a few inward experiences pass through his soul; another will hear the eternal language of the cosmic spirit; for him are unveiled the mysterious riddles of existence. We must learn to remain in touch with our own feelings and ideas, if we wish to develop any intimate relationship with th e outer world. The outer world, with all its phenomena, is filled with di vine splendour, but we must have experienced the divine within ourselves, before we can hope to discover it in our environment. The student is told to set apart moments in his daily life, in which to withdraw into himself, quietly and alone. He is not to occ upy himself with the affairs of his own Ego, in such moments This would result in the contra ry of what is intende d. He should rather let his experiences and the messages from th e outer world, re-echo within his own completely silent self. Every flower, every an imal, every action will unveil to him in such silent moments, secrets undreamed of. And thus he will prepare himself to receive quite new impressions of the outer world, through quite different eyes. For the desire to enjoy impression after impression merely blunts the f aculty of cognition; th e latter, however, is nurtured and cultivated, if the enjoyment on ce experienced is allowed to reveal its message. Thus the student must accustom himself not merely to let the enjoyment reverberate, as it were, but rather to re nounce any further enjoyment, and work upon the past experience. The peril here is very great . Instead of working inwardly, it is very easy to fall into the opposite habit of trying to exploit the enjoyment. Let no one undervalue the fact that unforeseen sources of error here confront the student. He must pass through a host of tempters of his soul. They would all harden his Ego and imprison it within itself. He should rather open it wide for all the worl d. It is necessary that he should seek enjoyment, for only through enjoyment can th e outer world reach him. If he blunts himself to enjoyment, he becomes as a pl ant which cannot any longer draw nourishment from its environment. Yet if he stops short at the enjoyment, he shuts himself up within himself. He will only be something to hims elf and nothing to the world. However much"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"he may live within himself, however intensel y he may cultivate his Ego - the world will reject him. For the world he is dead. The student of higher knowledge considers enjoyment only as a means of ennobling himsel f for the world. Pleasure is to him as a scout informing him concerning the world; but once instructed by pleasure, he passes on to work. He does not learn in order to accumula te learning as his own treasure, but not to occupy in order that he may devote his learning to the service of the world. In all Spiritual Scien ce there is a fundamental principl e which cannot be transgressed without sacrificing success, and it should be impressed on th e student in every form of esoteric training. It runs as follows: ‘ Every knowledge pursued merely for the enrichment of personal learning and the accumulation of personal treasure, leads you away from the path; but all knowledge pursued for growth to ripeness w ithin the process of human ennoblement and cosmic development, brings you a step forward. ’ This law must be rigidly observed, and no student is genuine until he has a dopted it as a guide for his whole life. This truth can be expressed in th e following short sentence - every idea which does not become your ideal, slays a force in your soul; every id ea which becomes your ideal, creates within you life-forces. INNER TRANQUILLITY At the very beginning of his course , the student is directed to the ‘ Path of Reverence ’ and the development of the inner life. Spiritual Sc ience now also gives hi m practical rules, by observing which, he may tread that path and de velop that inner life. These practical rules have no arbitrary origin. They rest upon an cient experience and ancient wisdom, and are given out in the same manner, wheresoever the ways to higher know ledge are indicated. All true teachers of the spiritual life are in ag reement as to the character of these rules, even though they do not always clothe them in the same words. This difference, which is of a minor character, and is more apparent th an real, is due to circumstances which need not be dwelt upon here. No teacher of the spiritual life wishes to establish a mastery over other persons by means of such rules. He would not tamper with any person ’ s independence. Indeed, none respect and cherish human independence more than the spiritually experience d. It was stated in the preceding pages, that the bond of union em bracing all Initiates is spiritual, and that two laws form, as it were, clasps, by which the component parts of this bond are held together. Whenever the Initiate leaves his encl osed spiritual circuit and steps forth before the world, he must immediately take a third law into account. It is this: adapt each one of your actions, and frame each one of your word s in such a way that you infringe upon no man ’ s free-will. The recognition that all true teachers of th e spiritual life are permeated through and through with this principle, will convince a ll who follow the practical rules proffered to them, that they need sacrifi ce none of their independence."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"One of the first of these rules can be expre ssed somewhat in the following words of our language: ‘ Provide for yourself moments of i nner tranquillity, and learn, in these moments, to distinguish between the essential and the non-essential. ’ It is said advisedly: ‘ Expressed in the words of our language. ’ Originally all rules and teachings of Spiritual Science were expressed in a symbolical sign-language, some understanding for which must be acquired before its whole meaning a nd scope can be reali zed. This understanding is dependent on the first step s towards higher knowledge, and these steps result from the exact observation of such rules as are here given. For all who earnestly will, the path stands open to tread. Simple, in truth, is the above rule concerning moments of inner tranquillity; equally simple is its observation. But it only achieves it s purpose when it is observed in as earnest and strict a manner, as it is, in itself, simp le. How this rule is to be observed, will be explained, therefore, without digression. The student must set aside a small part of his daily life, in which to concern himself with something quite different from the objects of his daily occupati on. The way, also, in which he occupies himself at such a time, mu st differ entirely from the way in which he performs the rest of his daily duties. But this does not mean that what he does in the time thus set apart, has no connection with his da ily work. On the contrary, he will soon find that just these secluded mome nts, when sought in the right way, give him full power to perform his daily task. Nor must it be supposed that the observance of this rule will really encroach upon the time needed for the perfor mance of his duties. Should anyone really have no more time at his disposal, five minutes a day will suffice. It all depends on the manner in which these five minutes are spent. At these periods, the student should wrest hims elf entirely free from his work-a-day life. His thoughts and feelings should take on a different colouri ng. His joys and sorrows, his cares, experiences and actions must pass in re view before his soul; and he must adopt such a position that he may regard all his s undry experiences from a higher point of view. We need only bear in mind how, in ordinary life, we regard the experiences and actions of others quite differently from our own. This cannot be otherwise, for we are interwoven with our own actions and experiences, whereas those of others we only contemplate. Our aim in these moments of seclusion, must be so to contemplate and judge our own actions and experiences, as though they applied no t to ourselves but to some other person. Suppose, for example, a heavy misfortune befa lls us. How different would be our attitude towards a similar misfortune, had it befa llen our neighbour! This attitude cannot be blamed as unjustifiable; it is part of human nature, and a pplies equally to exceptional circumstances and to the daily affairs of life. The student must seek the power of confronting his own self, at certain times, as a stranger. He must stand before his own self with the inner tranquillity of a judge. When th is is attained, our own experiences present themselves in a new light. As long as we are interwoven with them and stand, as it were, within them, we cling to the non-es sential just as much as to th e essential. If we attain the calm inner survey, the essential is severed fr om the non-essential. Sorrow and joy, every thought, every resolve, appear different when we confront ourselves in this way. It is as"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"though we had spent the whole day in a place wh ere we saw the smallest objects at the same close range as the largest, and in the evening climbed a neighbouring hill, and surveyed the whole scene at a glance. Then th e various parts appear related to each other in different proportions from those they bore when seen from within. This exercise will not and need not succeed with current blows of fate, but it should be attempted by the student in connection with misf ortune experienced in the pa st. The value of such inner tranquil self-contemplation depends far less on what is actually contemplated, than on our finding within ourselves the power whic h such inner tra nquillity develops. For every human being bears within himself, besides what we may call the work-a-day man, a higher man. And each individual can only himself awaken this higher being within him. As long as this higher being is not awakened, the higher faculties, slumbering in every human being, and leading to supe rsensible knowledge, will remain concealed. The student must resolve to persevere in the st rict and earnest observa tion of the rule here given, so long as he does not feel within himsel f the fruits of this inner tranquillity. To all who thus persevere, the day will come when spiritual light will envelope them, and a new world will be revealed to an organ of sight of whose existence, within them, they were hitherto unaware. And no change need take place in the outward li fe of the student in consequence of this new rule. He performs his duties, and, at first, feels the same joys, sorrows and experiences as before. In no way can it estr ange him from life; he can rather devote himself the more thoroughly to this life, fo r the remainder of the day, having gained a higher life in the moments set apart. Little by little this higher life will make its influence felt on his ordinary life. The tranquillity of the moments set apart will affect also everyday existence. In his whole being, he will grow calmer, he will attain firm assurance in all his actions, and will cease to be put out of countenance by all manner of incidents. By thus advancing he will gradually become more and more his own guide, and will allow himself, less and less, to be led by ci rcumstances and external influences. He will soon discover how great a source of strength is available to him in these moments thus set apart. He will begin no longer to get angry at things which formerly angered him; countless things which he formerly feared c ease to alarm him. He acquires a new outlook on life. Formerly he may have approached so me occupation in a faint-hearted way. He would say: ‘ Oh, I lack the power to do this as well as I could wish. ’ Now this thought does not occur to him, but rather a quite diffe rent thought. Henceforth he says to himself: ‘ I will summon up all my strength to do my work as well as I possibly can. ’ And he suppresses the thought which makes him faint- hearted; for he knows that this very thought might be the cause of a worse performa nce on his part, and that, in any case, it cannot contribute to the improvement of hi s work. And thus thought after thought, each fraught with advantage to his w hole life, flow into the student ’ s outlook. They take the place of those that had a hampering, weakening effect. He begins to steer his own ship on a secure course through the waves of life, wh ereas it was formerly battered to and fro by these waves. This calm and serenity react on the whole being. They assist the growth of the inner man, and with the inner man, those faculties also grow which lead to higher knowledge. For it"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"is by his progress in this direction that the student gradually reaches the point, when he himself determines the manner in which the im pressions of the outer world shall affect him. Thus he may hear a word spoken with the object of wounding or vexing him. Formerly it mould indeed have wounded or vexed him, but now that he treads the path to higher knowledge, he is able to take from th e word the sting which gives it the power to wound or vex; before it has found its way to his inner self. Take another example. We easily become impatient when we are kept wa iting, but if we tread the path to higher knowledge, we so steep ourselves, in our mo ments of calm, with the feeling of the uselessness of impatience, that henceforth, on every occasion of impatience, this feeling is immediately present within us. The impa tience that was about to make itself felt, vanishes, and an interval which would otherw ise have been wasted in expressions of impatience, will be filled by useful obs ervation, which can be made while waiting. Now the scope and significance of these facts must be realized. We must bear in mind that the higher man within man is in consta nt development. But only the state of calm and serenity here described renders an orderly development possible. The waves of outward life press in upon the inner man from all sides, if, instead of masteri ng this outward life, he is mastered by it. Such a man is like a plan t which tries to expand in a cleft in the rock, and is stunted in its growth, until new space is given it. No outward forces can supply space to the inner man. It can only be suppl ied by the inner calm which man himself gives to his soul. Outward circumstances can only alter the course of his outward life; they can never awaken the inner spiritual ma n. The student must himself give birth to a new and higher man within him. This higher man now becomes the inner ruler, who directs the circumstances of the outer man with sure guidance. As long as the outer man has the upper ha nd and control, this inner man is his slave, and therefore cannot unfold his powers. If it depends on something foreign to myself, that I shoul d get angry or not, I am not ma ster of myself, or, to put it better, I have not yet found th e ruler within me. I must develop the faculty of letting the impressions of the outer world approach me onl y in the way in which I myself determine; then only do I become in the real sense a student. And only in so far as the student earnestly seeks this power, can he reach the goal. It is of no impor tance - how far anyone can get in a given time; the point is that he should earnestly seek. Many have striven for years without noticing any appreciable progres s; but many of those who did not despair, but remained unshaken, have then, quite suddenly achieved the ‘ inner victory ’ . No doubt a great effort is required, in many stat ions of life, to provi de these moments of inner calm; but the greater the effort needed, the more important is the achievement. In Spiritual Science everything depends upon the energy, inward truthfulness and uncompromising sincerity with which we confront our own se lves, with all our deeds and actions, as a complete stranger. But only one side of the student ’ s activity is characterized by this birth of his own higher being. Something else is needed in addition. Ev en if he confronts himself as a stranger, it is only himself that he cont emplates; he looks on those e xperiences and actions with which he is connected through his particular station of lif e. He must now disengage"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"himself from it and rise beyond, to a purely hu man level, which no longer has anything to do with his own special situati on. He must pass on to the co ntemplation of those things which would concern him, if he lived under qu ite different circumstances, and in quite a different situation. In this way something be gins to live within him which ranges above the purely personal. His gaze is directed to hi gher worlds than those with which everyday life connects him. And thus he begins to feel and realize, as an inner experience, that he belongs to those higher worlds. These are wo rlds concerning which his senses and his daily occupation can tell him not hing. Thus he now shifts the cen tral point of his being to the inner part of his nature. He listens to the voices within him, which speak to him, in his moments of tranquillity; he cultivates an in tercourse with the spiritual world. He is removed from the everyday world. Its noise is silenced. All around him there is silence. He puts away everything that is around him; he even puts away everything that reminds him of such impressions from without. Calm inward contemplation and converse with the purely spiritual world fill his soul. Such tr anquil contemplation must become a natural necessity in the life of the student. He is now plunged in a world of thought. He must develop a living feeling for this silent thought -activity. He must learn to love what the spirit pours into him. He will soon cease to feel that this thought-world is less real than the everyday things which surround him. He be gins to deal with his thoughts as with things in space, and the moment approaches when he begins to feel that which reveals itself in the silent inward thought-world, to be much higher, much more real than the things in space. He discovers that somethi ng living expresses itself in this thought-world. He sees that his thoughts do not merely har bour shadow-pictures, but that, through them, hidden beings speak to him. From out of the silence speech becomes audible to him. Formerly sound only reached him through his ear; now it resounds through his soul. An inner language, an inner word is revealed to him. This moment , when first experienced, is one of greatest rapture for the student. An i nner light is shed over the whole external world, and a new life begins for him. Through his being there pours a divine stream from a world of divine rapture. This life of the soul in thought, which graduall y widens into a life in spiritual being, is called by Gnosis and by Spiritual Science, Meditation (contemplativ e reflection). This meditation is the means to supersensible knowledge. But the student in such moments must not merely indulge in fee lings; he must not have indefi nite sensations in his soul. That would only hinder him fr om reaching true spiritual knowledge. His thoughts must be clear, sharp and definite, and he will be he lped in this if he doe s not cling blindly to the thoughts that rise within him. Rather must he permeate himself with the lofty thoughts with which men already advanced and possessed of the spirit were inspired, in such moments. He should take as his starting point the writings which themselves had their origin in such revela tion during meditation. In the mystic, gnostic and spiritual scientific literature of to-day, the student will find such writings, and in them the material for his meditation. The seekers of the spirit have themselves set down, in such writings, the thoughts of the divine science, which the Spirit has suffered to be proclaimed to the world through his messengers. Through such meditation a complete transforma tion takes place in the student. He begins to form quite new conceptions of reality. Al l things acquire a fresh value for him. It"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"cannot be repeated too often that this transformation does not alienate him from the world. He will in no way be estranged from his daily duties, for he comes to realize that the most insignificant action he has to accomplish, the most insignificant experience which offers itself to him, stand in connec tion with cosmic beings and cosmic events. When once this connection is revealed to him in his moments of contemplation, he engages in his daily circle of activities w ith a new, fuller power. For now he knows that his labour and his suffering are given and endur ed for the sake of a great, spiritual, cosmic whole. Not weariness, but st rength to live springs from meditation. With firm step the student passes through life. No matter what it may bring him, he goes forward erect. In the past he knew not why he laboured and suffered, but now he knows. It is obvious that such med itation leads more surely to the goal, if conducted under the direction of experienced pers ons, who know of themselves how everything may best be done; and their advice and guidance should be sought. Truly no one loses his freedom. What would otherwise be mere uncertain gr oping in the dark, becomes, under this direction, precise work. All who apply to su ch as possess knowledge and experience in these matters will never apply in vain, only they must realize that what they seek is the advice of a friend and not the domination of a w ould-be ruler. It will always be found that they who really know, are the most modest of men, and that nothing is further from their nature than what is called the lust for power. When, by means of meditation, man rises to be un ited with the spirit, he brings to life the eternal in him, which is limited by neither bi rth nor death. The existence of this eternal being can only be doubted by those who have not themselves experienced it. Thus meditation is the way which also leads man to the knowledge, to the contemplation of his eternal, indestructible, essential being. Gnosis and Spiritual Science tell of the eternal nature of this being, and of its re-incarna tion. The question is of ten asked: Why does a man know nothing of his experiences beyond the borders of life and death? How can we attain such knowledge! In right meditation the path is opened. This alone can revive the memory of experiences beyond the border of life and death. Everyone can attain this knowledge; in each one of us lies the facu lty of recognizing and contemplating for ourselves what genuine Mysticism, Spiritu al Science, Anthroposophy and Gnosis teach. Only the right means must be chosen. Only a being with ears and eyes can apprehend sounds and colours, nor can the eye perceive, if the light, whic h makes things visible, be wanting. Spiritual Science gives the means of developing the spiritual ears and eyes, and kindling the spiritual light; this method of spiritual training may be described as consisting of three stages: (1) Probation; this develops the spiritual senses. (2) Enlightenment; this kindles the spiritual light. (3) Initiation; this establishes intercourse with the higher spiritual beings. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE STAGES OF INITIATION THE information given in the following chapters forms part of an esoteric training, the name and character of which will be underst ood by all who apply this information in the right way. It refers to the three stages through which the training of the spiritual life leads to a certain degree of Initia tion. But only so much will here be explained as can be publicly imparted. These are merely indications extracted from a still far deeper and more intimate doctrine. In esoteric training itself a quite definite course of instruction is followed. Certain exercises enable the soul to attain a conscious intercourse with the spiritual world. These exercises bear about the same relation to what will be imparted in the following pages, as the instruction given in a higher, strictly di sciplined school, to the incidental teaching in a prep aratory school. And yet the earne st and persevering pursuit of the course here indicated, will lead to a genuine esoteric training. But an impatient dabbling, devoid of earnest perseverance, can lead to nothing at all. The study of Spiritual Science can only be successful if the student will retain what has al ready been indicated in the preceding chapter, and on the basis of this proceed further. The three stages which the above-mentioned tradition specifies, are as follows: (1) Probation; (2) Enlightenment; (3) Initiation. It is not altogether necessa ry that the first of these three stages should be completed be fore the second can be begun, nor that the second, in turn, be completed before the third be started. In certain respects it is possible to partake of Enlightenment, and even of Initiation, and in other respects still be in the probationary stage. Yet it will be necessary to spend a certain time in the stage of Probation, before any Enlightenment can be gin, and at least in some respects, Enlightenment must be completed before it is even possible to enter upon the stage of Initiation. But in describing them, it is necessa ry, for the sake of cl arity, that the three stages be made to follow in turn. PROBATION Probation consists of a strict and definite cultivation of the life of thought and feeling through which the psychic-spiritual ‘ body ’ becomes equipped with organs of sense activity, in the same way that natural forces have fitted the physical body with organs built out of indeterminate living matter. To begin with, the attention of the soul is di rected to certain events in the world that surrounds us. Such events are, on the one hand, life that is budding, growing and flourishing, and, on the other hand, all phenomen a connected with fading, decaying and withering. The student can observe these even ts simultaneously, wherever he turns his eyes, and on every occasion they naturally e voke in him feelings a nd thoughts; but under ordinary circumstances, he doe s not devote himself sufficientl y to them. He hurries on too quickly from impression to impression. It is necessary, therefore, that he should fix his attention intently and consciously upon these phenomena. Wherever he observes a definite kind of blooming and flourishing, he must banish ev erything else from his soul,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"and entirely surrender himself, for a short time, to this one impression. He will soon convince himself that a feeling which heretofo re, in a similar case, would merely have flitted through his soul, now swells out, and assumes a powerful and energetic form. He must now allow this feeling to reverberate quietly within himself while keeping inwardly quite still. He must cut himself off from the outer world, and simply and solely follow what his soul tells him of this blossoming and flourishing. Yet it must not be thought that much progress ca n be made if the senses are blunted to the world. First look at the things as keenly and as intently as you possi bly can; then only let the feeling which expands to life, and th e thought which arises in the soul, take possession of you. The point is that the atten tion should be directed with perfect inner balance, upon both phenomena. If the necessary tranquillity be attained, and if you surrender yourself to th e feeling which expands to life in the soul, then, in due time, the following experience will ensue. Thoughts a nd feelings will be noticed, of a new kind and unknown before, uprising in th e soul. Indeed, the more the attention be fixed, in this way, upon something growing, blossoming and flourishing, and upon something else that is fading and decaying, the more vivid will th ese feelings become. And just as natural forces build out of living matter the eyes a nd ears of the physical body, so will the organs of clairvoyance build themselv es from the feelings and thoughts thus evoked. A quite different form of feeling is connected with growth and expansion, and another equally definite with all that is fadi ng and decaying. But this is only the case if the effort be made to cultivate these feelings in the way indica ted. It is possible to describe approximately what these feelings are like. A full concepti on of them is within the reach of all who undergo these inner experiences. If the atten tion be frequently fi xed on the phenomena of growing, blooming and flourishing, a feeling remotely allied to the sensation of a sunrise will ensue, while the phenomena of fadi ng and decaying will produce an experience comparable, in the same way, to the slow ri sing of the moon on the horizon. Both these feelings are forces which, when duly cult ivated and developed to ever-increasing intensity, lead to the most significant spir itual results. A new world is opened to the student if he systematically and deliberately su rrenders himself to such feelings. The soul-world, the so-called astral plane, begi ns to dawn upon him. Growth and decay are no longer facts which make indefi nite impressions on him, as of old, but rather they form into spiritual lines and figures, of which he had previously suspect ed nothing. And these lines and figures have, for the different phe nomena, different form s. A blooming flower, a young animal, a tree that is decaying, evoke in his soul different lines. The soul-world (astral plane) broadens out slowly before him. These lines and figures are not mere inventions. Two students who have reached th e corresponding stage of development, will always see the same lines and figures, under the same conditions. Just as a round table will be seen as round by two normal persons and not as round by one and square by the other - so too, at the si ght of a flower, the same spiritual figure is presented to the soul. And just as the forms of animals and plants are described in ordina ry natural history, so, too, the spiritual scientist de scribes or draws the spiritual forms of the processes of growth and decay, according to species and kind. If the student has progressed so far that he can perceive the spiritual forms of those phenomena which are physically visible to his ex ternal sight, he will then not be far from"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"the stage, when he shall behold things wh ich have no correspondi ng physical existence, and which therefore remain entirely hidden (o ccult) from those who have not received suitable instruction and training. It should be emphasized that the student must never lose himself in speculations on the meaning of one thing or another. Such intellectualizing will only bring him away from the right road. He should look out on the worl d with keen, healthy senses, and quickened power of observation, and then give himself up to the feeling that arises within him. He should not try to make out, through intellect ual speculation, what the things mean, but rather allow the things themselves to tell him. It should be remarked that artistic feeling, when coupled with a quiet introspective natu re, forms the best preliminary condition for the development of spiritual faculties. This feeling pierces through th e superficial aspect of things, and, in so doin g, touches their secrets. A further point of importance is what Spiritual Science calls ‘ Orientation ’ in the higher worlds. This is attained when the student is permeated, through and through, with the conscious realization that feeli ngs and thoughts are veritable real ities, just as much as are tables and chairs in the world of the phys ical senses. In the soul- and thought-world, feelings and thoughts react upon each other just as physical objects react upon each other in the physical world. As l ong as the student is not vi vidly permeated with this consciousness, he will not believe that a wrong thought in his mind may have as devastating an effect upon othe r thoughts that spread life in the thought-world, as the effect wrought by a bullet fired at random , upon the physical objects it hits. He will perhaps never allow himself to perform a physi cally visible action which he considers to be wrong, though he will not shrink from ha rbouring wrong thoughts and feelings, when these appear harmless to the rest of the wo rld. There can be no progress, however, on the path to higher knowledge, unless we guard our thoughts and feelings in just the same way as we guard our steps in the physical world. If we see a wall before us, we do not attempt to dash right through it, but turn aside. In ot her words, we guide our selves by the laws of the physical world. There are such laws, t oo, for the soul- and thought-world, only they cannot impose themselves on us from without. Th ey must flow out of the life of the soul itself. This can be attained if we forbid ourselves to harbour wrong thoughts and feelings. All arbitrary flitting to-and-fro in thought, all accidental ebbing a nd flowing of emotion must be forbidden in the same way. In so doing we do not become deficient in feeling. On the contrary, if we regulate our inner life in this way, we shall soon find ourselves becoming rich in feelings and creative with genuine imagination. In the place of petty emotionalism, and capricious flights of t hought, there appear significant emotions and thoughts that are fruitful. Feeli ngs and thoughts of this kind lead the student to orientation in the spiritual world. He attains a right positi on in relation to the things of the spiritual world; a distinct and definite result comes into effect in his favour. Just as he, as a physical man, finds his way between physical things so, too, his path now leads him between growth and decay, which he has al ready come to know in the way described above. He follows, then, all processes of gr owing and flourishing, and, on the other hand, of withering and decaying, in a way that is necessary for his own and the world ’ s advancement."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The student has also to bestow a further care on the world of sound. He must discriminate between sounds that are produced by the So-called in ert (lifeless) bodies, as, for instance, a bell, or a musical instrument, or a falling mass, and those which proceed from a living creature (an animal or a human being). Wh en a bell is struck, we hear the sound and connect a pleasant feeling with it; but when we hear the cry of an animal, we can detect through it, besides our own feeling, the manife station of an inward experience of the animal, whether of pleasure or of pain. It is with the latter kind of sound that the student sets to work. He must concentrate his whole attention on the fact th at the sound tells him of something that lies outside his own soul. He must merge himself into this foreign thing. He must closely unite his own feeling w ith the pleasure or pa in of which the sound tells him. He must get beyond the point of caring whether, for him, the sound is pleasant or unpleasant, agreeable or disagreeable, and his soul must be fille d with whatever is transpiring in the being from which the sound proceeds. Through such exercises, if systematically and deliberately performed, th e student will develop within himself the faculty of intermingling, as it were, with the being from which the sound proceeds. A person sensitive to music will find it easier to cu ltivate his inner life in this way, than one who is unmusical; but no one should suppose th at a mere sense for music can take the place of this inner activity. The student must lear n to feel in this way in the face of the whole of nature. By doing so, a new faculty is implanted in this world of thought and feeling. Through her resounding tones, the whole of nature begins to whisper her secrets to the student. What was hitherto merely incomprehensible noise to his soul, will become by this means a coherent language of nature. And whereas hitherto, he only heard sound, from the so-called inanimate objects, he now is aware of a new language of the soul. Should he advance further in this inner cultur e, he will soon learn that he can hear what hitherto he did not even surmise. He begins to hear with the soul. To this, one thing more must be added befo re the highest point in this region can be attained. Of very great importance for the deve lopment of the student is the way in which he listens to others when they speak. He mu st accustom himself to do this in such a way that, while listening, his inner self is absolute ly silent. If someone expresses an opinion, and another listens, assent or dissent will, generally speaking, stir in the inner self of the listener. Many people, in such cases, feel th emselves impelled to an expression of their assent, or, more especially, of their dissent. In the student, all such a ssent or dissent must be silenced. It is not impera tive that he should suddenly al ter his way of living, by trying to attain at all times, this complete inner silence. He will have to begin by doing so in special cases, deliberately selected by himsel f. Then quite slowly and by degrees, this new way of listening will creep into his habits, as of itself. In spiritual investigation this is systematically practised. The student feels it his duty to listen, by way of practice, at certain times, to the most contradictory views, and, at the same time, entirely to bring to silence all assent, and, more es pecially, all adverse criticism. The point is, that in so doing, not only all purely intellectual judgment be silenced, but also all feelings of displeasure, denial or even es pecially, of their dissent. disse nt must be silenced. assent. The student must at all times be particularly watchful lest such feelings, even when not on the surface, should still lurk in the innermost recess of the soul. He must listen, for example, to the statements of people who are, in some respects, far beneath him, and yet while doing so, suppress every feel ing of greater knowledge or s uperiority. It is useful for"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"everyone to listen in this way to children, for even the wisest can learn incalculably much from children. The student can thus train hims elf to listen to the words of others quite selflessly, completely shutti ng out his own person, and his opinions and way of feeling. When he practises listening without criticis m, even when a completely contradictory opinion is advanced, when the most ‘ hopeless mistake ’ is committed before him, then he learns, little by little, to ble nd himself with the being of another and become identified with it. Then he hears through the words, in to the soul of the other. Through continued exercise of this kind, sound becomes the ri ght medium for the perception of soul and spirit. Of course it implies the very strictest self-discipline, but the latter leads to a high goal. When these exercises are practised in connection with the others already given, dealing with the sounds of natu re, the soul develops a new sense of hearing. It is now able to perceive manifestations from the spiritual world, which do not find their expression in sounds apprehensible by th e physical ear. The perception of the ‘ inner word ’ awakens. Gradually truths reveal themselves to the student, from the spiritual world. He hears speech uttered to him in a spiritual way. Only to those who, by selfless listening, train themselves to be really reci pient from within, in stillness, unmoved by personal opinion or feeling, only to such can the higher beings speak, of whom Spiritual Science tells. As long as one hurls any personal opinion or feeling against the speaker to whom one must listen, the beings of the spiritual world remain silent. All higher truths are attained through such ‘ inwardly instilled speech ’ , and what we hear from the lips of a true spiritual teacher, has been experienced by him in this manner. But this does not mean that it is unimportant for us to acquaint ourselves with the writings of Spiritual Science, before we can ourselves hear such ‘ inwardly instilled speech ’ . On the contrary, the reading of such writings and the listening to the teachings of Spiritual Science, are themselves means of attaini ng personal knowledge. Every sentence of Spiritual Science we hear is of a nature to direct the mind to the point which must be attained before the soul can experience real pr ogress. To the practice of all that has here been indicated, must be added the ardent study of what the spiritual investigators impart to the world. In all esoteric training, such study belongs to the probationary period, and all other methods will prove ineffective, if due receptivity for the teachings of the spiritual investigators be lack ing. For inasmuch as these instructions are culled from the living ‘ inner word ’ from the living ‘ inwardly instilled speech ’ , they are themselves gifted with spiritual life. They are not mere wo rds; they are living powers. And while you follow the words of one who knows, while you read a book that springs from real inner experience, powers are at work in your soul which make you clairvoyant, just as natural forces have created out of livi ng matter your eyes and your ears. ENLIGHTENMENT Enlightenment is the result of very simple processes. Here, too, it is a matter of developing certain feelings and thoughts whic h slumber in every human being and must be awakened. It is only when these simp le processes are carried out with unfailing patience, continuously and strenuously, that they can lead to the pe rception of the inner"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"light-forms. The first step is taken by observi ng different natural objects in a particular way; for instance, a transparent and beautifully formed stone (a crystal), a plant and an animal. The student should endeavour, at first, to direct his whole attention to a comparison of the stone with the animal, in the following manner. The thoughts here mentioned shall pass through his soul accompanied by vivid feelings, and no other thought, no other feeling, must mingle with them, and disturb what should be an intensely attentive observation. The student says to himself: ‘The stone has a form; the animal also has a form. The stone remains motionless in it s place. The animal changes its place. It is instinct (desire) which causes the animal to change its place. Instincts, too, are served by the form of the animal. Its organs and limbs are fashioned in accordance with these instincts. The form of the stone is not fa shioned in accordance with desires, but in accordance with desireless force.’ [footnote: Th e fact here mentioned, in its bearing on the contemplation of crystals, is in many wa ys distorted by those who have only heard of it in an outward, esoteric manne r, and in this way such practices as crystal gazing have their origin. Such manipulat ions are based on a misunderstanding. They have been described in many books, but they never form the subject of genuine esoteric-teaching] By sinking deeply into such thoughts, and while doing so, observing the stone and the animal with rapt attention, there arise in th e soul two quite separa te kinds of feelings. From the stone there flows into the soul the one kind of feeling, and from the animal the other kind. The attempt will probably not succeed at first, but little by little, with genuine and patient practice, these feelings ensue. This should be practised over and over again. At first the feelings are only present as long as the observation lasts. Later on they continue, and then they grow to something which remains living in the soul. The student has then only to reflect, and both the fee lings will always arise, even without the contemplation of an external object. Out of these feelings and the thoughts that are bound up with them, the organs of clairvoyance are fo rmed. If the plant should then be included, it will be noticed that the feeling flowing fr om it lies between the feelings derived from the stone and the animal, both in quality and degree. The organs thus formed are spiritual eyes. The student gradually learns, by their means, to see something like psychic and spiritual colours. The spiritual world, with its lines and figures, remains dark, as long as he has only attained what has been descri bed as Probation; through Enlightenment it becomes light. Here also, it must be noted that the words ‘ dark ’ and ‘ light ’ , as well as the other expressions used, do but approximately describe what is meant. This cannot be otherwise, if ordinary langua ge is used, for this language was created to suit physical conditions. Spiritual Science de scribes that which, for clairv oyant organs, flows from the stone, as ‘ blue ’ , or ‘ blue-red ’ ; and that which is felt as coming from the animal as ‘ red ’ or ‘ red-yellow ’ . In reality colours of a spiritual kind are seen. The colour proceeding from the plant is green, which little by little, resolves itself into a light ethereal pink. The plant is actually that product of nature which in higher worlds re sembles, in certain respects, its constitution in the physical worl d. The same does not apply to the stone and the animal. It must now be clearly understood that the above-mentioned colour s only represent the principal shades in the stone, plant and animal kingdoms. In reality all possible intermediate shades are present. Every st one, every plant, every animal has its own particular shade of colour. In addition to these, there are also the beings of the higher worlds, which never incarnate physically, but which have their col ours, often wonderful,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"often horrible. Indeed the wealth of colour in these higher wo rlds is immeasurably greater than in the physical world. Once the faculty of seeing with spiritual ey es has been acquired, one then encounters, sooner or later, the beings here mentioned, some of them higher, some lower than man himself - beings which never enter physical reality. If this point has been reached, the way to a great deal lies open. But it is inadvisable to proceed further, without paying careful heed to what is said or otherwise imparted by the spiritual investigator. And for that too, which has been described, attention paid to such experienced guidance is the very best thi ng. Moreover if a man has the strength and the endurance to travel so far, that he fulfils the elementary conditions of Enlightenment, he will assuredly seek and find the right guidance. But, under all circumstances, one precaution is necessary, failing which, it were better to leave untrodden all steps on the path to higher knowledge. It is necessary that the student should lose none of his qualities as a good and noble man, or his receptivity for all physical reality. Indeed, throughout his training, he must continually increase his moral strength, his inner purity and his power of observation. To give an example: during the elementary exercises on Enlightenment, the student must have a care to be always enlarging his sympathy for the animal and the human worlds, and his sense for the beauty of nature. Failing this care, su ch exercises would continually blunt that feeling and that sense; the heart would become hardened, and the senses blunted, and that could only lead to perilous results. How Enlightenment proceeds, if the student rise s, in the sense of the foregoing exercises, from the stone, the plant and the animal, up to man, and how, after Enlightenment, under all circumstances, the union of the soul with the spiritual world is effected, leading to Initiation - of these things the following chapte rs will deal, in so far as they can and may do so. In our time, the path to Spiritual Science is sought by many. It is sought in many ways, and many dangerous and even objectionable practi ces are tried. It is for this reason that they who claim to know something of the trut h in these matters, place before others the possibility of learning somethi ng of esoteric training. Only so much is here imparted as corresponds with this possibility. It is n ecessary that something of the truth should become known, so as to prevent error causi ng great harm. No harm can come to anyone following the way here described, so long as he does not force things. Only one thing should be noted; no student should spend more time and strength upon these exercises than he can spare, with due regard to his station of life and his duties, nor should he change anything, for the time being, in the ex ternal conditions of his life, through taking this path. Without patience, no genuine result s can be attained. After doing an exercise for a few minutes, the student must be able to stop, and continue quietly his daily work, and no thought of these exerci ses should mingle with the day ’ s work. No one is of use as an esoteric student or will ever attain results of real va lue, who has not learnt to wait in the highest and best sense of the word."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE CONTROL OF THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS When the student seeks the path leading to higher knowledge in the way described in the preceding chapter, he should not omit to fortify himself, throughout his work, with one ever-present thought. He must never cease repe ating to himself that he may have made quite considerable progress, after a certain interval, though it may not be apparent to him in the way he perhaps expect ed; otherwise he can easily lose heart, and abandon all attempts after a short time. The powers and facu lties to be developed are of a most subtle kind, and differ entirely, in their nature, fr om the conceptions formed of them by the student in advance. His occupation has been re stricted to the physical world alone; and it is therefore not surprising if he does not im mediately notice the power s of soul and spirit now developing in him. In this respect there is a possibility of erro r for those setting out on the path to higher knowledge, if they ignor e the experience gath ered by responsible investigators. The teacher is aware of th e progress made by his pupil long before the latter is conscious of it. He knows how th e delicate spiritual eyes begin to form themselves, long before the pupil is aware of th eir existence, and a great part of what he has to say is couched in such terms as to prevent the pupil from losing patience and perseverance, before he can himself attain knowledge of his own progress. The teacher, as we know, can confer upon the pupil no power s which are not already latent within him, and his sole function is to assist in the awakening of slumbering faculties. But what he imparts out of his own experience is a pillar of strength for him who will penetrate through darkness to light. Many abandon the pa th to higher knowle dge, soon after having set foot upon it, because their progress is not immediately apparent to them. And even when the first experiences begin to dawn upon the seeker, he is apt to regard them as illusions, because he had formed quite different conceptions of what he was going to experience. He loses courage, either because he regards these first experiences as being of no value, or because they appear to him to be so unlikely that he cannot believe they will lead him to any appreciable results w ithin a measurable time. Courage and self- confidence are two beacons which must neve r be extinguished on the path to higher knowledge. No one will ever travel far who can not bring himself to repeat, over and over again, an exercise which has failed, appare ntly, for a countless number of times. Long before any distinct perception of progre ss, there rises, in the student, from the hidden depths of the soul, a feeling that he is on the right path. This feeling should be cherished and fostered, for it can develop in to a trustworthy guide. Above all it is imperative to extirpate the idea that any fant astic, mysterious practices are required for the attainment of higher knowledge. It must be cl early realized that a start has to be made with the thoughts and feelings with which we continually live , and that these feelings and thoughts are given a new direction. Everyone must say to himself: ‘ In my own world of thought and feeling, the deepest mysteries lie hi dden, only hitherto I have been unable to perceive them. ’ In the end it all resolves itself into the fact that man ordinarily carries body, soul and spirit about with him, and yet is conscious, in a true sense, only of his body, and not of his soul and spir it. The student becomes conscious of soul and spirit, just as the ordinary person is conscious of his body. Hence it is highly important to give the proper direction to thoughts a nd feelings, for then only can the perception be developed of all that is invisible in or dinary life. One of the ways by which this development may be"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"carried out will now be indicated. Again, like a lmost everything else so far explained, it is quite a simple matter. Yet its results are of the greatest consequence, if the necessary devotion and sympathy be applied. Let the student place before himself the sma ll seed of a plant, and while contemplating this insignificant object , construct with intensity, the ri ght kind of thoughts, and through these thoughts develop certain f eelings. In the first place let him clearly grasp what he really sees with his eyes. Let him describe to himself the shape, colour and all other qualities of the seed. Then let his mind dwell upon the following train of thought: ‘ Out of the seed, if planted in the soil, a pl ant of complex structure will grow. ’ Let him build up this plant in his imaginati on, and reflect as follows: ‘ What I am now picturing to myself in my imagination, will, later on, be drawn out of the seed by the forces of the earth and of light. If I had before me an artificial object, which imitated the seed to such a deceptive degree that my eyes could not detect it from a real seed, no forces of the earth or of light could avail to produce from it a plant. ’ If the student thor oughly grasps this thought so that it becomes an inward experi ence, he will also be able to form the following thought and couple it with the right feeling: ‘ All that will ultimately grow out of the seed is now secretly enfolded within it, as the force of th e whole plant. In the artificial imitation of the seed, there is no such force present. And yet both appear alike to my eyes. The real seed therefore contains some thing invisible, which is not present in the imitation. ’ It is on this invisible something that thought and feeling are to be concentrated. [footnote: ‘ Anyone objecting that a micros copical examination would reveal the difference between the real seed and the imitation, woul d only show that he had failed to grasp the point. The intention is not to investigate the physical nature of the object, but to use it for the developmen t of psychic- sp iritual forces.] Let the student fully realize that this invisibl e something will transmute itself later on into a visible plant, which he will have before him in its shape and colour. Let him cling to the thought: ‘ The invisible will become visible. If I could not think, then that could not already make its presence felt to me, which will only become visible later on. ’ Particular stress must be laid on the following point: what the student thinks, he must also feel with intensity. In inner tranquill ity, the thought mentioned above , must become a conscious inner experience, to the exclusion of all ot her thoughts and distur bances. And sufficient time must be taken to allow the thought and the feeling which is coupled to it, to bore themselves into the soul. If this be accomp lished in the right way, then, after a time - possibly not until after numerous attempts - an inner force will make itself felt. This force will create new powers of perception. The grain of seed will appear as if enveloped in a small luminous cloud. In a sensible-supersensibl e way, it will be felt as a kind of flame. The centre of this flame evokes the same fee ling as when one is under the impression of the colour lilac, and the edges as when unde r the impression of a bluish tone. What was formerly invisible now becomes visible, for it is created by the power of the thoughts and the feelings we have stirred to life within ourselves. The plant itself will not become visible until later, so th at the physically invisible now rev eals itself in a spiritually visible way."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"It is not surprising that all this appears to many as illusion. ‘ What is the use of such visions, ’ they ask, ‘ and such hallucinations? ’ And many will thus fall away and abandon the path. But this is precisely the important point: not to confuse sp iritual reality with imagination, at this difficult stage of huma n evolution, and furthermore, to have the courage to press onward and not become timo rous and faint-hearted. On the other hand, however, the necessity must be emphasized of maintaining unimpaired and of perpetually cultivating that healthy sound sense whic h distinguishes truth from illusion. Fully conscious self-control must never be lost dur ing all these exercises, and they must be accompanied by the same sane, sound thinking which is applied to the details of everyday life. To lapse into reveries w ould be fatal. The intellectual clarity, not to say the sobriety of thought, must never for a moment be dulle d. The greatest mistake would be made, if the student ’ s mental balance were disturbed throu gh such exercises, or if he were hampered from judging the matters of his daily life as sanely and as soundly as before. He should examine himself again and again to find out if he has remained unaltered in relation to the circumstances among which he lives, or whether he may perhaps have become unbalanced. Above all, strict care must be taken not to drift at random into vague reveries, or to experiment with all kinds of exercises. The trains of thought here indicated have been tested and practised in esoteric tr aining since the earliest times, and only such are given in these pages. Anyone attempting to use others devised by himself, or of which he may have heard or read, at one place or another, will inevitably go astray and find himself on the path of bound- less chimera. As a further exercise, to succeed the one just described, the following may be taken: Let the student place before him a plant which ha s attained the stage of full development. Now let him fill his mind with the thought that the time will come when this plant will wither and die. ‘ Nothing will be left of what I now s ee before me. But this plant will have developed seeds, which, in their turn, will develop to new plants. I again become aware that in that which I see, something lies hi dden which I cannot see. I fill my mind entirely with the thought: this plant, with its form and colours, w ill in time be no more. But the reflection that it produces seeds, teaches me that it will not disappear into nothing. I cannot at present see with my eyes that which guards it from disappearance, any more than I previously could discern the plant in th e grain of seeds. Thus there is something in the plant which my eyes cannot see. If I le t this thought live with in me, and if the corresponding feeling be coupled with it, the n, in due time, there will again develop in my soul, a force which will ripen into a new perception. ‘ Out of the plant there again grows a kind of spiritual flame-form, which is, of course, correspondingly larger than the one previously described. The flame can be fe lt as being greenish-blue in the centre, and yellowish-red at the outer edge. It must be explicitly emphasized that the colours here described are not seen as the physical eyes see colours, but that through spiritual perception, the same feeling is experienced as in the case of a physical colour-impression. To apprehend blue spiritually, means to have a sensation similar to the one experienced when the physical eye rests on the colour blue. This fact must be noted by a ll who intend to rise to spiritual perception. Otherwise they will expect a mere repetition of the physical in the spiritual. This could only lead to the bitterest deception."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Anyone having reached this point of spiritual vision, is the richer by a great deal, for he can perceive things not only in their present state of being, but also in their process of growth and decay. He begins to see in all th ings the spirit, of which physical eyes can know nothing. And therewith he has taken the first step towards the gradual solution, through personal vision, of the secret of birt h and death. Fur the outer senses a being comes into existence through birth, and passes away through death. This, however, is only because these senses cannot perceive the co ncealed spirit of the being. For the spirit, birth and death are merely a tr ansformation, just as the unfol ding of the flower from the bud is a transformation enacted before our physic al eyes. But if we desire to learn this through personal vision we must first awaken th e requisite spiritual sense in the way here indicated. In order to meet another objection, which may be raised by certain people who have some psychic experience, let it at once be admitted that there are shorter and simpler ways, and that there are persons who have acquired know ledge of the phenomena of birth and death through personal vision, without first going thro ugh all that has here been described. There are, in fact, people with considerable psychic gifts, who need but a slight impulse in order to find themselves already devel oped. But they are the exceptions, and the methods described above are safer and apply equa lly to all. It is pos sible to acquire some knowledge of chemistry in an exceptional way, but if you wish to become a chemist, you must follow the recognized and reliable course. An error fraught with serious results would ensue, if it were assumed that the desired result could be reached more easily, if the grain of seed or the plant mentioned above, were merely imagined, were merely pictured in the imagination. This might lead to results, but not so surely as the method here given. The vision thus attained would, in most cases, be a mere figment of the imag ination, the transformation of which into genuine spiritual vision, would still remain to be accomplished. It is not intended arbitrarily to create visions, but to allow reality to create them within oneself. The truth must well up from the depths of our own soul; it may not be conjured forth by our ordinary Ego, but by the beings themselves, w hose spiritual truth we are to contemplate. Once the student has found the rudiments of spir itual vision by means of such exercises, he may proceed to the contemplation of man himself. Simple appearances of human life must first be chosen. But before making any at tempts in this direc tion, it is imperative for the student to strive for the absolute purity of his moral character. He must banish all thought of ever using knowledge gained in th is way for his own personal benefit. There must be no fear in his mind that he would ev er, under any circumstances, avail himself in a sense that is evil, of any power he may gain over his fellow-creat ures. For this reason, all who seek to discover th rough personal vision the secrets in human nature, must follow the golden rule of true Spiritual Science. Th is golden rule is as follows: For every one step that you take in the pur suit of higher knowledge, take thr ee steps in the perfection of your own character. If this rule be observ ed, such exercises as the following may be attempted:"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Recall to mind some person whom you may ha ve observed when he was filled with desire for some object. Direct you r attention to this desire. It is best to recall to memory that moment when the desire was at its he ight, and it was still uncertain whether the object of the desire would be attained. And now fill your mind with this recollection, and reflect on what you can thus observe. Maintain the utmost inner tranquillity. Make the greatest possible effort to be blind and d eaf to everything that may be going on around you, and take special heed that through th e conception thus ev oked, a feeling should awaken in your soul. Allow this feeling to rise in your soul like a cloud on the cloudless horizon. As a rule, of course, your reflecti on will be interrupted, because the person whom it concerns, was not observed in this par ticular state of soul for a sufficient length of time. The attempt will most likely fail hundreds and hundreds of times. It is just a question of not losing patience. After many attempts you will succeed in experiencing a feeling in your soul corres ponding to the state of soul of the person observed, and you will begin to notice that through this feeling, a power grows in your soul, that leads to spiritual insight into the stat e of soul of the other. A pi cture experienced as luminous appears in your field of visi on. This spiritually luminous pict ure is the so-called astral embodiment of the desire observed in that so ul. Again the impression of this picture may be described as flame-like, yellowish-red in the centre, and reddish-b lue or lilac at the edges. Much depends on treating such spiritua l experiences with gr eat delicacy. The best thing is not to speak to anyone about them , except to your teacher, if you have one. Attempted descriptions of such experiences, in inappropriate words, usually only lead to gross self-deception. Ordinary terms are employed, which are not intended for such things, and are therefore too gr oss and clumsy. The consequence is that in the attempt to clothe the experience in words, we are misled into blending the actua l experience with all kinds of fantastic delusions. Here again is another important rule for the student: know how to observe silence concer ning your spiritual experiences . Yes, observe silence even towards yourself. Do not attempt to clothe in words what you contemplate in the spirit, or to pore over it with clumsy in tellect. Lend yourself freely and without reservation to these spiritual impressions, and do not disturb them by reflecting and pondering over them too much. For you must remember that your reas oning faculties are, to begin with, by no means equal to your new experience. You ha ve acquired these reas oning faculties in a life hitherto confined to the physical worl d of the senses; the faculties you are now acquiring transcend this world. Do not try therefore to apply to the new and higher perceptions, the standard of the old. Only he who has gained some certainty and steadiness in the observation of inner experiences can sp eak about them, and thereby stimulate his fellow-men. The exercise just described may be supplem ented by the following. Direct your attention in the same way upon a person to whom the fulf ilment of some wish, the gratification of some desire has been granted. If the same rules and pre- cautions be adopted as in the previous instance, spiritual insight will once mo re be attained. A spiritual flame-form will be distinguished, creating an impression of ye llow in the centre and green at the edges. By such observation of his fellow-creatures the student may easily lapse into a moral fault. He may become uncharitable. Every c onceivable effort must be made to prevent this. Such observation should only be practised by one who has already risen to the level"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"on which complete certainty is found that t houghts are real things. He will then no longer allow himself to think of his fellow-men in a way that is incompatible with the highest reverence for human dignity and human libert y. The thought that a human being could be merely an object for observation, must never for a moment be entertained. Self-education must see to it that this insight into human nature should go hand in hand with an unlimited respect for the personal privilege of each individual, and with the recognition of the sacred and inviolable nature of that which dwells in each human being. A feeling of reverential awe must fill us, even in our recollections. For the present, only these two examples can be given to show how enlightened insight into human nature may be achieved; they will at least serve to poi nt out the way to be taken. By gaining the inner tranquillity and re pose indispensable for such observation, the student will have undergone a great inner tr ansformation. He will then soon reach the point when this enrichment of his inner se lf will lend confidence and composure to his outward demeanour. And this transformation of his outward demeanour will again react favourably on his soul. Thus he will be able to help himself furt her along the road. He will find ways and means of penetrating more and more into the secrets of human nature, which are hidden from our external senses, and he will then also become ripe for a deeper insight into the mysterious connections between human nature and all else that exists in the universe. By following this path, the stude nt approaches closer and closer to the moment when he can effectively take the firs t steps of Initiation. But before these can be taken, one thing more is necessary, though at first its necessity will be least of all apparent; later on, however, he will be convinced of it. The would-be Initiate must bring with him a certain measure of courage and fearlessness. He must absolutely go out of his way to fi nd opportunities for developing these virtues. His training should provide for their systematic cultivation. In this resp ect, life it self is a good school - possibly the best school. The stude nt must learn to look danger calmly in the face, and try to overcome difficulties unswervingly. For instance, when in the presence of some peril, he must immediatel y rally to the convicti on that fear is of no possible use; I may not feel afraid; I must onl y think of what is to be done. And he must improve to the extent of feeling, upon occasi ons which formerly insp ired him with fear, that ‘ to be frightened ’ , ‘ to be disheartened ’ , are things that are out of the question, as far as his own inmost self is concerned. By self -discipline in this di rection, quite definite qualities are developed, which are necessary for Initiation into the higher Mysteries. Just as man requires nervous force in his physical be ing, in order to use his physical senses, so also he requires, in his soul-nature, the fo rce which is only developed in the courageous and the fearless. For in penetrating to the higher Mysteries he will see things which are concealed from ordinary humanity by the illusion of the senses. If the physical senses do not allow us to perceive the higher truth, they are also for this reason our benefactors. Things are thereby hidden from us which, if realized without due preparation, would throw us into unutterable consternation and th e sight of which we could not endure. The student must be fit to endure this sight. He loses certain supports in the outer world, which he owes to the very illusion surrounding him. It is truly and literally as if the attention of someone were ca lled to a danger which had thre atened him for a long time,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"but of which he knew nothing. Hitherto he fe lt no fear, but now that he knows, he is overcome by fear, though the danger has not been rendered greater by his knowing it. The forces at work in the world are both destructive and constructive; the destiny of manifested beings is birth and death. The s eer is to behold the wo rking of these forces and the march of destiny. The veil enshrouding the spiritual eyes in ordinary life is to be removed. But man is interwoven with these fo rces and with this destiny. His own soul reveals itself to the seer as undisguisedly as the other objects. He mu st not lose strength in the face of this self-knowledge; but stre ngth will fail him unless he brings a surplus on which to draw. For this purpose he must lear n to maintain inner calm and steadiness in the face of difficult circumstances; he must cultivate a strong trust in the beneficent powers of existence. He must be prepared to find that many motives which had actuated him hitherto will do so no longer. He will have to recognize that he hitherto only thought and acted in a certain way b ecause he was still in the th roes of ignorance. Reasons influencing him formerly will now disappear. He often acted out of vanity; he will now see how utterly futile all vanity is for the seer. He often acted out of avarice; he will now become aware how destructive all avarice is. He will have to develop quite new motives for his thoughts and actions and it is just fo r this purpose that courage and fearlessness are required. It is pre-eminently a question of cultivati ng this courage and this fearlessness in the inmost depths of thought-life. ‘ The student must learn never to despair over failure. He must be equal to the thought: ‘ I will forget that I have failed in this matter, and I will try once more as though nothing had happened. ’ Thus he will struggle through to the firm conviction that the fountain-head of strength from which he may draw is inexhaustible. He struggles ever on to the spirit which w ill uplift him and support him, however weak and impotent his earthly self may have proved. He must be capable of pressing on to the future undismayed by any experiences of th e past. If the student has acquired these faculties, up to a certain point, he is then ripe to hear the real names of things, which are the key to higher knowledge. For Initiation consists in this very act of learning to call the things of the world by those names which they be ar in the spirit of their divine Author. In these their names lies the mystery of things. It is for this reason that the Initiates speak a different language from the uninitiate, fo r the former know the names by which the beings themselves are called into existence. INITIATION Initiation is the highest stage of an esoter ic training concerning which it is possible to give some indications in a book intended for the general public. Whatever lies beyond forms a subject difficult to understand, yet the way to it can be found by all who have passed through Probation, Enlightenment and Initiation, and have reached the lower Mysteries. The knowledge and proficiency c onferred by Initiation cannot be obtained in any other manner, except in some far distant future, after many incarnations, by quite different means and in quite a different form. The Initiate of to-day undergoes"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"experiences which would otherwise come to him much later, under quite different circumstances. The secrets of existence are only accessibl e to an extent corresponding to man’s own degree of fitness. For this reason alone, the path to the higher stages of knowledge and power is beset with obstacles. A firearm should not be used until sufficient experience has been gained to avoid damage being cau sed by its use. A pe rson initiated to-day without further ado would lack the experience which the future revelation of this higher knowledge would duly bring to him in the co urse of his incarnations and his normal development. At the Portal of Initiation, ther efore, this experience must be supplied in some other way. Thus the first instructions gi ven to the candidate for Initiation serve as a substitute for these future expe riences. These are the so-called ‘ Trials ’ , which he has to undergo, and which constitute a normal course of inner development resulting from due application to such exercises as ar e described in the preceding chapters. These Trials are often discusse d in books, but it is only na tural that such discussions should as a rule give quite false impressions of their nature. For without passing through Probation and Enlightenment no one can know a nything of these tests and appropriately describe them. The would-be Initiate must come into contac t with certain things and facts belonging to the higher worlds, but he can only see and h ear them if his fee ling is ripe for the perception of the spiritual forms, colours, tones, etc., described in the chapters on Probation and Enlightenment. The first Trial consists in obtai ning a truer vision than is the case with the average man of the corporeal attributes of lifeless things, and later of plants, animals and of human beings. This does not mean what is called to-d ay scientific knowledge , for it is a question not of science but of vision. As a rule the would-be Initiate pro ceeds to learn how the objects of nature and the beings gifted with life manifest themselves to the spiritual ear and the spiritual eye. In a certain way, these th ings then lie disclosed – naked - before the beholder. The qualities which can then be seen and heard are concealed from the physical eyes and ears. For physical perception they ar e enwrapped as in a veil, and the falling away of this veil for the woul d-be Initiate consists in a pr ocess designated as the process of ‘ Purification by Fire ’ . The first trial is therefore known as the ‘ Fire-Trial ’ . For many people, ordinary life is itself a mo re or less unconscious process of Initiation through the Fire-Trial. Such people have passe d through a wealth of experience, so that their self-confidence, courage and fortitude have been greatly stre ngthened in a normal manner, while learning to bear sorrow, disa ppointment and failure in their under-takings, with greatness of soul, and especially with equanimity and unbroken strength. Thus they are often Initiates with out knowing it, and it then needs but little to unseal their spiritual hearing and sight, so that they become clai rvoyant. For it must be noted that a genuine Fire-Trial is not intende d to satisfy the curiosity of the candi date. It is true that he learns many things of which others can have no id ea, but this acquisiti on of knowledge is not the end, but the means to the end; the latter consists in the attainment, thanks to this"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"knowledge of the higher worlds, of greater a nd truer self-confidence, of a higher degree of courage and a magnanimity and per- severance such as cannot, as a rule, be acquired in the lower world. The candidate may always turn back after the Fire-Trial. He will then resume his life, strengthened in body and soul, and wait for a fu ture incarnation to c ontinue his Initiation. In his present incarnation he will prove himself a more useful member of society and of humanity than he was before. In whatever position he may find himself, his firmness, prudence, resoluteness and his beneficent infl uence over his fellows will have greatly increased. But if, after completing the Fire-Trial, he s hould wish to continue the path, a certain writing-system, generally adopted in esoteric training, must now be revealed to him. The actual teachings manifest themselves in this writing, because the hidden (occult) qualities of things cannot be directly expressed in th e words of ordinary language, nor can they be set forth in ordinary writing. The pupils of the Initiates translat e the teachings into ordinary language as best they can. The hidde n writing reveals itself to the soul when the soul has attained spiritual pe rception, for it is traced in the spiritual world and remains there for all time. It cannot be learnt as an artificial wri ting is learnt and read. The candidate grows into clair voyant knowledge, in an appr opriate way, and, during this growth, a new strength is deve loped in his soul, as a new faculty, through which he feels himself impelled to decipher the occurrences and the beings of the spiritual world like the characters of a writing. This strength, with th e experience it brings of the corresponding Trial, might possibly awaken in the soul as though of its own accord, as the soul continually develops, but it will be found safer to follow the instructi ons of those who are spiritually experienced, and who hare some proficiency in deciphering the hidden writing. The signs of the hidden writing are not mere inventions, they correspond to the forces actively engaged in the world. It becomes immediately apparent to the candidate that the signs he is now learning, correspond to the forms, colours, tones, etc ., which he learnt to perceive during his Probation and Enlightenment. He realizes that all he learnt previously was only like learning how to spell, and that he is only now beginning to read in the higher worlds. All the isolated figures, tones and colours reve al themselves to him now in one great connected whole. Now, for the firs t time, he attains complete certainty in observing the higher worlds. Hitherto he c ould never know positively whether the things he saw were rightly seen. A regular understa nding is now, too, at last possible between the candidate and the Initiate in the spheres of higher know ledge. For whatever form the intercourse between an Initiate and another person may take in ordinary life, the higher knowledge in its immediate form can only be imparted by the Initiate in the above- mentioned sign-language. Thanks to this language the student also lear ns certain rules of c onduct and certain duties of which he formerly knew nothing. Having lear nt these he is able to perform actions endowed with a significance a nd a meaning such as the actions of one not initiated can never possess. He acts from out of the higher worlds. Instructions concerning such action"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"call only be read and understood in the writ ing in question. Yet it must be emphasized that there are people unconsciously gifted with the ability and faculty of performing such actions, though they have never under gone an esoteric training. Such ‘ helpers of the world and of humanity ’ , pass through a life of blessing and good deeds. For reasons here not to be discussed, gifts have been bestow ed on them which appear supernatural. What distinguishes them from the candidate for Initiation, is only that the latter acts consciously and with full insight into the en tire situation. He acqui res by training the gifts bestowed on others by higher powers for th e good of humanity. We can sincerely honour and respect these favoured of God; but we s hould not for this reason regard the work of esoteric training as superfluous. Once the student has learnt the sign-language, th ere awaits him yet another Trial, to prove whether he can move with freedom and certainty in the higher worlds. In ordinary life he is impelled to action by exterior motives. He works at one occupation or another because one duty or another is imposed on him by out ward circumstances. It need hardly be mentioned that the student must in no way neglect any of his duties in ordinary life because he is living and working in higher worl ds. There is no duty in a higher world that can force a person to neglect any single one of his duties in the ordinary world. The father will remain just as good a father to his family, the mother just as good a mother, and neither the official nor the soldier, nor anyone else will he detained from their work, if they become esoteric students. On the contrary, all the qualities which make a human being capable and efficient, are enhanced in the student to a degree, of which the uninitiated can form no idea. If, in the eyes of the uninitiated, this does not always appear to be the case, it is simply b ecause he often lacks the ability to judge the Initiate correctly. The deeds of the latter are not always intelligible to the former. But this only happens in special cases. At this stage of Initiation there are duties to be performed for which no outward stimulus is given. The candidate will not be moved to action by external pressure, but only through adherence to the rules of conduct revealed to him in the hidden writing. He must now show, in this second Trial, that, led by such rules, he can act with the same firmness and precision, with which, for instance, an official performs the duties that accrue to him. For this purpose, and in the course of his fu rther training, he will find himself faced by a certain definite task. He must perform some action in cons equence of observations made on the basis of what he has le arnt during Probation and Enlight enment. The nature of this action can be understood by means of the hidde n writing with which he is now familiar. If he recognizes his duty and acts rightly, hi s Trial has been successful. The success can be recognized in the alteration produced by his action in the figures, colours and tones apprehended by his spiritual eyes and ears. Exact indications are given, as the training progresses, showing how these figures, etc., appear and are experienced after the action has been performed, and the candidate must know how to produce this change. This Trial is known as the ‘ Water-Trial ’ , because in his activity in these higher worlds, he is deprived of the support derived from outward circumstances, as a swimmer is without support when swimming in water that is beyond his depth. This activity must be repeated until the candidate attains absolute poise and assurance."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The importance of this Trial lies again in the acquisition of a quality. Through his experiences in the higher worlds, the candidate develops this quality, in a short time, to such a high degree, that he would otherwise have to go through many incarnations, in the ordinary course of his development, before he could acquire it to the same extent. It all centres round the fact that he must only be guided by the results of his higher perception, and of his reading the hidden writing, in order to produce the changes in question, in these higher regions of existence. Should he, in the course of his ac tivity, introduce any of his own opinions, desires, etc., or should he diverge for one moment from the laws which he has recognized to be right, in order to follow his own wilful inclination, then the result produced would differ entirely from what was intended. He would lose sight of the goal to which his action tended, and confusi on would result. Hence ample opportunity is given him in the course of this Trial to deve lop self-control. This is the object in view. Here again, this Trial can be more easily e ndured by those whose life, before Initiation, has led them to acquire self-control. A nyone having acquired the faculty of following high principles and ideas, wh ile putting into the background all personal predilection; anyone capable of always performing his duty, with inclinations and sympathies only too ready to seduce him from this duty - such a one is unconsciously an Initiate in the midst of ordinary life. He will need but little to succ eed in this particular Trial. Indeed, a certain measure of Initiation thus unconsciously acquired in life, will, as a rule, be indispensable for success in this second Trial. For even as it is difficult for those who have not learnt to spell correctly in th eir childhood, to make good this deficiency when fully grown up, so too, it is difficult to develop the necessary degree of self-control, upon glancing into the higher worlds, if a certain measure of it ha s not been acquired in ordinary life. The objects of the physical world do not alter, what ever the nature of our wishes, desires and inclinations. In the higher worlds, however, our wishes, desires and inclinations are causes that produce effects. If we wish to pr oduce a particular effect in these worlds, we must hold ourselves completely under cont rol; we must strictly follow the right precautions and subdue every wayward impulse. A certain human quality is of very special impor tance, at this stage of Initiation, namely, an unquestionably sound judgment. Attention should be paid to the training of this faculty during all the previous stages; for it now re mains to be proved whether the candidate is shaping in a way that shows him to be fit fo r the true path of knowledge. Further progress is now only possible if he is able to dis tinguish illusion, superstit ion and all manner of fancifulness, from true reality. This is, at first, more difficult to accomplish upon the higher stages of existence than upon the lowe r. Every prejudice, ev ery cherished opinion with regard to the things in question, must vanish; truth al one must guide. There must be perfect readiness to abandon at once any idea, opinion or inclination when logical thought demands. Certainty in higher worl ds is only likely to be attained when personal opinion is never spared. People whose mode of thought tends to fa ncifulness and superstition, can make no progress on the path to higher know ledge. It is indeed a precious treasure that the student is to acquire. All doubt regarding the higher wo rlds is removed from him. With all their laws they reveal themselves to his gaze. But he cannot achieve this fortune so long as he is the prey of fancies and illusions. It would indeed be fatal if his imagination and his"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"prejudices ran away with his intellect. Dream ers and fantastical people are as unfit for the path to higher knowledge as superstitious people. This cannot be over-emphasized. For the most dangerous enemies on the way to know ledge of the higher worlds lurk in such fantastical reveries and supers titions. Yet no one need believe that the student loses all sense of poetry in life, all power of enthusiasm because the words: ‘ All prejudice must quit you, ’ are written over the gate way leading to the second Trial of Initiation, and because upon the portal, at the entran ce of the first Trial, he reads: ‘ Without normal common sense all your efforts are in vain. ’ If the candidate be in this way sufficiently advanced, a third Trial awaits him. He finds here no definite goal to be reached. All is le ft in his own hands. He finds himself in a situation where nothing occasions him to act. He must find his way all alone and from out of himself. Things or people to stimulate him to action are non-existent. Nothing and nobody can give him the strength he needs but he himself alone. Failure to find this inner strength will leave him standing where he was. Few of those, however, who have successfully endured the previous Trials will fail to find the necessa ry strength at this point. Either they will have turned back alrea dy or they succeed at this point also. All that the candidate requires is the ability to come quickly to terms with himself, for he must here find his ‘ higher self ’ in the truest sense of the wor d. He must rapidly decide in all things to listen to the insp iration of the spirit. There is no time for doubt or hesitation. Every minute of hesitation would prove that he was still unfit. Whatever prevents him from listening to the voice of the spirit must be eradicated. It is a question of showing presence of mind in this situation, and the tr aining at this stage is concerned with the perfect development of this qua lity. All inducements to act or even to think, as he has been accustomed, now cease. In or der not to remain inactive he must not lose himself, for only within himself can he find the one central point of vantage where he can gain a firm hold. No one on reading this, without further acquaintance with these matters, should feel an antipathy for this principl e of being thrown back on oneself, for success in this Trial brings with it a moment of supreme happiness. At this stage no less than at the others, ordina ry life is itself an esoteric training for many. Anyone having reached the point of being ab le, when suddenly confronted with some task or problem in life to come to a swift d ecision without hesitation or delay, for him life itself has been a training in this sense. Such situations are here meant when success is instantly lost, if action is not rapid. A person who is quick to act when a misfortune is imminent, whereas a few moments of hesita tion would have seen the misfortune an accomplished fact, and who has turned this ab ility into a permanent personal quality, has unconsciously acquired the degree of maturity ne cessary for the third Trial. For at this stage everything centres round the development of absolute presence of mind. This Trial is known as the ‘ Air-Trial ’ , because, while undergoing it, the candidate can support himself neither upon the firm basis of extern al incentive, nor upon th e figures, tones and colours which he has learnt in Proba tion and Enlightenment, but exclusively upon himself. Upon successfully enduring this Trial, the student is permitted to enter the ‘ Temple of Higher Wisdom ’ . All that is here said on this subj ect, can only be the slenderest allusion."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The task now to be performed is often expres sed in the statement that the student must take an ‘ oath ’ never to ‘ betray ’ anything he has learnt. These expressions, however, ‘ oath ’ and ‘ betray ’ are inappropriate and actually misleading. Ther e is no question of an ‘ oath ’ in the ordinary sense of the word, but ra ther of an experience that comes at this stage of development. The candidate learns how to apply the higher knowledge, how to place it at the service of humanity. He then begins really and truly to understand the world. It is not so much a question of w ithholding the higher trut hs, but far more of serving them in the right way a nd with the necessary tact. The ‘ silence ’ he is to ‘ keep ’ refers to something quite different. He acquires this fine quality with regard to things he had previously spoken, and especially with regard to the manner in which they were spoken. He would be a bad Initiate who di d not place all the higher knowledge he had acquired at the service of humanity, as well and as far as this is possible. The only obstacle to giving information in these matters is the lack of unders tanding on the part of the recipients. It is true, of course, that the higher knowledge does not lend itself to promiscuous talk; but no one having reached th e stage of development described above, is actually ‘ forbidden ’ to say anything. No othe r person, no being exacts an ‘ oath ’ from him with this intent. Everything is placed on his own responsibility, and he learns in every situation to discover within himself what he has to do, and an ‘ oath ’ means nothing more than that he has been found qualified to be entruste d with such a responsibility. If the candidate is found fit for the foregoing ex periences, he is then given what is called symbolically the ‘ draught of forgetfulness ’ . This means that he is initiated into the secret knowledge that enables him to act without being continually disturbed by the lower memory. This is necessary for the Initiate, fo r he must have full faith in the immediate present. He must be able to destroy th e veil of memory which envelops man every moment of his life. If we judge something that happens to us to-day according to the experience of yesterday, we are exposed to a mu ltitude of errors. Of course this does not mean that all experience gained in life shoul d be renounced. It should always be kept in mind as clearly as possible. But the Initiate must have the ability of judging every new experience wholly according to what is inhere nt in it, and of letting it react upon him, unobscured by the past. We must be prepared at every moment, th at every object and every being shall bring to us some new revela tion. If we judge the ne w by the standard of the old, we are liable to error. The memory of past experiences will be of greatest use for the very reason that it enables us to perceive the new. Had we not gone through a definite experience, we should perhaps be blind to the qualities of the object or being that comes before us. Thus experience should serve the purpose of perceiving the new and not of judging it by the standard of the old. In this respect the Initiate ac quires certain definite qualities, and thereby many things are revealed to him which remain concealed from the uninitiate. The second ‘ draught ’ presented to the Initiate is the ‘ draught of remembrance ’ . Through its agency he acquires the f aculty of retaining the knowledge of the higher truths ever present in his soul. Ordinary memory woul d be unequal to this task. We must unite ourselves and become as one with the higher truths. We must not only know them, but be able, quite as a matter of course, to manifest and administer them in living actions, even as we ordinarily eat and dri nk. They must become our practi ce, our habit, our inclination."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"‘ There must be no need to keep thinking about them, in the ordinary sense; they must come to living expression through man himself; they must flow through him as the functions of life through his organism. Thus dot h man ever raise himself, in a spiritual sense, to that same height to wh ich Nature raised him in a physical. SOME PRACTICAL ASPECTS THE training of thoughts and feelings, pursued in the way described in the chapters on Probation, Enlightenment and Initiation, introdu ces into the soul and spirit the same organic symmetry with which Nature has c onstructed the physical body. Before this development, soul and spirit are undifferen tiated masses. The clairvoyant perceives them as interlacing, rotating, cloud-like spirals, dully glimmering with reddish, reddish-brown, or also, reddish-yellow tones. After this training they begin to assume a brilliant yellowish-green, or greenish-b lue colour, and show a regul ar structure. This inner regularity, leading to higher knowledge, is atta ined when the student introduces into his thoughts and feelings the same orderly system with which Nature has endowed his bodily organs, so that he should see, hear, digest, breathe, speak, etc. Gradually he learns to breathe and see with his soul, to speak and hear with the spirit. In the following pages some practical aspects of the higher education of soul and spirit will be treated in greater detail. They ar e such that anyone can put into practice, regardless of the other rules, and thereby be led some distance further into Spiritual Science. A particular effort must be made to cultivat e the quality of patience. Every symptom of impatience produces a paralyzing, even a destru ctive effect on the hi gher faculties that slumber in us. We must not expect an imm easurable view into the higher worlds from one day to the next, for, under such cond itions, we shall assuredly be disappointed. Contentment with the smallest fragment atta ined, repose and tranqu illity, must more and more take possession of the s oul. It is quite conceivable that the student should await results with impatience; organic symmetry w ith physical body. Before but he will achieve nothing so long as he fails to master this impa tience. Nor is it of any use to combat this impatience merely in the ordinary sense, fo r it will become only so much the stronger. We overlook it in self-deceit while it plants itse lf all the more firmly in the depths of the soul. It is only when we ever and again su rrender ourselves to a certain definite thought, making it absolutely our own, that any result can be attained. This thought is as follows: I must certainly do everything I can for the traini ng and development of my soul and spirit, but I will wait patiently until higher powers shall have found me worthy of definite Enlightenment. If this thought becomes so power ful in the student that it grows into an actual feature of his character, he is treading the right path. Th is feature soon sets its mark on his exterior. The gaze of his eye becomes steady, the movement of his body becomes sure, his decisions definite and all that goes under the name of nervousness gradually disappears. Rules that appear trifling and in significant must be taken into account. For example, supposing someone affronts us. Before our training we shoul d have directed our"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"resentment against the offender; a wave of anger would have surged up within us. In a similar case, however, the thought is immediately present in the mind of the student that such an affront makes no difference to his in trinsic worth. And he does whatever must be done to meet the affront with calm and composur e, and not in a spirit of anger. Of course it is not a case of simply accepting every affront, but of acting with the same calm composure when dealing with an affront ag ainst our own person, as we would, if the affront were directed against another pe rson, in whose favour we had the right to intervene. It must always be remembered th at this training Is not carried out in rough outward processes but in subtle, silent al terations in the life of thought and feeling. Patience has an attractive, impatience a repe llent effect on the treasures of the higher knowledge. In the higher regions of existen ce noticing can be attained by haste and unrest. Above all things, desire and craving must be silenced , for these are qualities of the soul before which all higher knowledge bash fully withdraws. However precious this knowledge is accounted, the student must not crave for it or anticipate the time of its coming·. If he wishes to have it for his own sake , he will never attain It. This requires that he should be honest with himself in his inne rmost soul. He must in no case be under any illusion concerning his own self. With a feeling of inner truth, he must look at his own faults, weaknesses and unfitness full in the face. The moment he tries to excuse to himself any one of his weaknesse s, he has placed a stone before him on the path which is to lead him upward. Such obstacles can only be removed by self-enlightenment. There is only one may to get rid of faults and failings , and that is, by a just recognition of them. Everything slumbers in the human soul and can be awakened. A person can even improve his intellect and reason, if he quietly and calmly makes it clear to himself why he is weak in this respect. Such self- knowledge is, of course, difficult, for the temptation to self- deceit is immeasurably great. Anyone making a ha bit of being truthful with himself, lays open the portal leading to a deeper insight. All curiosity must fall away fr om the student. He must rid hi mself as much as possible of the habit of asking questions merely for the sake of gratifying a selfish thirst for knowledge. He must only ask when knowledge ca n serve to perfect his own being in the service of evolution, nevertheless his delight in knowledge and his devotion to it, should in no way be weakened. He should listen devoutly to all that contribut es to such an end, and should seek every opportunity for such devotional attention. Special attention must be paid, in esoteric training, to the ed ucation of desires. This does not mean that we are to become destitute of desire, for if we are to attain something we must also desire it, and desire will always tend to fulfilment if backed by a certain particular force. This force is derived from a right knowledge. Do not desire at all until you know what is right in any one sphere. That is one of the golden rules for the student. The wise man first ascertains the laws of the world, and then his desires become powers which realize themselves. The following exam ple brings this out clearly. There are certainly many people who would like to lear n from their own intuition, something about their life before birth. Such a desire is altoge ther useless and leads to no result, so long as the person in question has not acquired a knowledge of the laws that govern the nature of the eternal, and a knowledge of them in thei r subtlest and most intimate character,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"through the study of Spiritual Sc ience. But if, having really acquired this knowledge, he wishes to proceed further, his desire, now ennobled and purified, will enable him to do so. It is also no use saying: ‘ I particularly wish to examine my previous life, and shall study only for this purpose. ’ We must rather be capable of abandoning this desire, of eliminating it altogether, and of studying, at first, with no such intention. We should cultivate a feeling of joy and devotion for what we learn, with no thought of the above end in view. We should learn to cherish and fost er a particular desire in such a way that it brings with it its own fulfilment. If we become angered, vexed or annoyed, we erect a wall around ourselves in the soul- world, and the forces which are to develop the eyes of the soul cannot approach. For instance, if a person angers me, he sends fo rth a psychic current in to the soul-world. I cannot see this current so long as I am myself capable of anger. My own anger conceals it from me. We must not, however, suppose that when we are free from anger, we shall immediately have a psychic (astral) vision. Fo r this purpose an organ of vision must have been developed in the soul. The beginnings of such an organ are latent in every human being, but remain ineffective so long as he is capable of anger. Yet this organ is not immediately present the moment anger has be en combatted to a small extent. We must rather persevere in this combating of anger and proceed patiently on our way ; then some day we shall find that this eye of the soul has become developed. Of course anger is not the only failing to be combatted for the atta inment of this end. Many grow impatient or sceptical, because they have for years comb atted certain qualities, and yet clairvoyance has not ensued. They have just trained some qualities and allowed others to run riot. The gift of clairvoyance first mani fests itself when all those qualities which stunt the growth of the latent faculties, are suppressed. U ndoubtedly the beginnings of such seeing and hearing may appear at an earlier perio d, but these are only young and tender shoots, which are subjected to all possible error, a nd which, if not carefully tended and guarded, may quickly die. Other qualities which, like anger and vexa tion, have to be combatted, are timidity, superstition, prejudice, va nity and ambition, curiosity, the mania of imparting information, and the making of distinctions in human beings according to the outward characteristics of rank, sex, race and so fort h. In our time it is difficult for people to understand how the combatting of such qualiti es can have anything to do with the heightening of the faculty of cognition. But every spiritual scientist knows that much more depends upon such matters than upon th e increase of intelligence and the employment of artificial exercises. This point can be easily misunders tood, especially if the belief prevails that we must become fool hardy because Re must be fearless; that we must close our eyes to the differences in me n, because we must combat the prejudices of rank, race and so forth. Rather is it true that a just recognition of all things is only to be attained when we are no longer entangled in pr ejudice. Even in the ordinary sense it is true that the fear of some phenomenon prevents us from estimating it rightly; that a racial prejudice prevents us from seeing into a man ’ s soul. It is this or dinary sense that the student must develop, in a ll its delicacy and subtlety."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Every word spoken without having been thor oughly purged in thought, is a stone thrown in the way of esoteric training. And here so mething must be considered which can only be explained by giving an example. If anything be said to which we must reply, we must be careful to consider the speaker ’ s opinion, feeling and even his prejudice, rather than what we have to say at the moment on th e subject under discussi on. In this example a refined quality of tact is indicated to the cu ltivation of which the student must devote his care. He must learn to judge what importa nce it may have for the other person, if he opposes the latter ’ s opinion with his own. This does not mean that he must withhold his opinion. There can be no question of that. But he must listen to the speaker as carefully and as attentively as he possibly can, and let his reply derive its fo rm from what he has just heard. In such cases one particular though t recurs ever and agai n to the student and he is treading the right path if this thought lives with him to the extent of becoming a feature of his character. This thought is as follows: ‘ The importance lies not in the difference of our opinions but in his discovering what is right if I contribute something towards it. ’ Thoughts of this and similar nature ca use the character and the behaviour of the student to be permeated with a quality of gentleness, which is one of the chief means used in all esoteric training. Harshness scares away the soul-pictures to be evoked by the eye of the soul; gentleness clears the obstacles away a nd unseals the inner organs. Along with gentleness, another feature will pr esently be developed in the soul of the student, of quietly paying atten tion to all the subtleties in the soul-life of his environment, while reducing to absolute silence any sound within hims elf. The soul-life of his environment will impress itself on him in such a way that his own s oul will grow, and as it grows, become regular in its structure, as a plant expanding in the sunlight. Gentleness and patient reserve open the soul to the soul -world, and the spirit to the spirit-world. Persevere in silent inner secl usion; close the senses to a ll that they brought you before your training; reduce to absolute immobility all the thoughts which, according to your previous habits, surged up and down within you, wait in patience, and then tile higher worlds will begin to fashion and perfect the or gans of sight and hear ing in your soul and spirit. Do not expect immediately to see and he ar in the world of soul and spirit, for all that you are doing does but contribute to the development of your higher senses, and you mill only be able to hear with soul and spirit when you possess these higher senses. Having persevered for a time in silent i nner seclusion, go about your customary daily affairs, imprinting deeply upon your mind this thought: ‘ Some day, when I am ready, I shall attain what I am to attain, ’ and make no attempt to attr act forcefully any of these higher powers to yourself. Every student receive s these instructions at the outset. By observing them he perfects himself. If he negl ects them, all his labour is in vain. But they are only difficult of achievement for the im patient and the unpersevering. No other obstacles exist save those which we ourselves place on our own path, and which can be avoided by all who really will. This point must be continually emphasized, because many people form an altogether wrong conception of the difficulties that beset the path to higher knowledge. It is easier, in a certain se nse, to accomplish the first steps along this path, than to get the better of the commonest everyday difficu lties, without this training. Apart from this, only such things are here imparted as are attended by no danger to the health of soul and body. There are other ways which lead quicker to the goal, but what is here explained has nothing to do with them, because they have certain effects which no"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"experienced spiritual scientist considers desirable. Since fragmentary information concerning these ways is continually finding its way into publicity, express warning must be given against entering upon them. For r easons which only the in itiated can understand, these ways can never be made public in thei r true form. The fragments appearing here and there call never lead to profitable result s, but may easily undermine health, happiness and peace of mind. It were far better for peopl e to avoid having anything to do with such things, rather than risk entrusting themselves to wholly dark forces, of whose nature and origin they can know nothing. Something may here be said concerning the en vironment in which this training should be undertaken, for this is not w ithout some importance. And yet the case differs for almost every individual. Anyone practising in an environment filled onl y with self-seeking interests as, for example, the modern struggle fo r existence, must be conscious of the fact that these interests are not w ithout their effect on the develo pment of his spiritual organs. It is true that the inner laws of these organs are so powerful that th is influence cannot be fatally injurious. Just as a lily can never gr ow into a thistle, however inappropriate its environment, so, too, the eye of the soul can never grow to anything but its destined end, even though it be subjected to the self-seeki ng interests of modern cities. But, under all circumstances, it is well if the student s eeks, now and again for his environment, the restful peace, the inner dignity and sweetness of Nature. Especially fortunate is the student who can carry out his esoteric trai ning surrounded by the green world of plants, or among the sunny hills, where Nature w eaves her web of sweet simplicity. This environment develops the inner organs in a harmony which can never ensue in a modern city. He, too, is more favourably situated than the townsman, who, during his childhood, at least, was able to breath e the perfume of pines, to gaze on snow-y peaks, and observe the silent activity of woodland creatures a nd insects. Yet no city -dweller should fail to give to the organs of his soul and spirit, as they develop, the nurtur e that comes from the inspired teachings of spiritual investigation. If our eyes cannot follow the woods in their mantle of green, every spring, day by day, we should instead open our soul to the glorious teachings of the Bh agavad Gita, or of St. John ’ s Gospel, or of St. Thomas à Kempis, and to the descriptions resulting from Spiritual Science. There are many ways to the summit of insight. The spiritually expe rienced could say much concerning these paths, much that might seem strange to the uninitiated. Someone, for instance, might be very far advanced on the path; he might be st anding, so to speak, at the very entrance of sight and hearing with soul and spirit; he is then fortunate enough to make a journey over the calm or maybe over the tempestuous ocean, and a veil falls away from the eyes of his soul; suddenly he becomes a seer. Another is e qually so far advanced that this veil only needs to be loosened; this occurs through some stroke of destiny. On another this stroke might well have had the effect of paralysing his powers and undermining his energy; for the esoteric student it becomes the occasion of his Enlightenment. A third perseveres patiently for years without any marked result. Suddenly, while silently seated in his quiet chamber, spiritual light envelops him; the walls disappear, become transparent for his soul, and a new world expands before his eyes that have become seeing, or resounds in his ears that have become spiritually hearing."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE CONDITIONS OF ESOTERIC TRAINING The conditions attached to esot eric training are not mere inve ntions. They are the natural outcome of esoteric knowledge. Just as no one can become a painter who refuses to handle a paintbrush, so, too, no one can receiv e esoteric training w ho is unwilling to meet the demands considered necessary by a teach er. In the main, the latter can give nothing except advice, and everything he says should be accepted in this sense. [footnote: See Appendix and Editorial Preface.] He has alr eady passed through the preparatory stages leading to a knowledge of the higher worl ds, and knows from experience what is necessary. It depends entirely upon the freewill of each individual, whether he chooses to tread the same path or not. To insist on being admitted to esoteric training without fulfilling the conditions, would be equivalent to saying: ‘ Teach me how to paint, but do not ask me to handle a paintbrush. ’ The teacher can never offer anything unless the recipient comes forward to meet him of his own freewill. But it must be emphasized that a general desire for higher knowle dge is not sufficient. This desire will, of course, be felt by many, but nothing can be achie ved with it alone, so long as the special conditions attached to esoteric training are not accepte d. This point should be considered by those who complain that the training is difficult. Failure or unwillingness to fulfil these strict conditions must entail the aba ndonment of esoteric training, for the time being. It is true the conditions are strict, yet they are not harsh, since thei r fulfilment not only should be, but indeed must be a voluntary action. If this fact be overlooked, esot eric training can easily appear in the light of a coercion of the soul or the conscience; for the training is based on the development of the inner life, and the teacher must necessarily give a dvice concerning this inner life. And yet no compulsion is used when a demand is met out of free choice. On the other hand, to ask a teacher: ‘ Give me your higher knowledge, but leave me my customary emotions, feelings and thoughts, ’ would be an impossible demand. In this case the gratification of curiosity would be the only motive. When pursued in su ch a spirit, higher knowledge can never be attained. Let us now consider in turn the conditions imposed on the student. It should be emphasized that the complete fulfilment of a ny one of these conditions is not insisted upon, but only the corresponding effort. It is the effort of will that matters and the ready disposition to enter upon this path. 1. The first condition is that the student s hould pay heed to the advancement of bodily and spiritual health. Of cour se, health does not depend, in the first instance, upon the individual; but the effort to improve, in this respect, lies within the scope of all. Sound knowledge can alone proceed from sound huma n beings. The unhealthy are not rejected, but it is demanded of the student that he should have the will to lead a healthy life. In this respect he must attain the greatest possibl e independence. The good counsels of others, freely bestowed though generally unsought, ar e, as a rule superfluous. Each must endeavour to take care of himself. From the physical aspect, it will be more a question of warding off harmful influences than of anyt hing else. In carrying out our duty, we must often do things that are disadvantageous to our health. We must decide at the right"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"moment to place duty higher than the care of our health. But just think how much can be discontinued, with a little goodwill. Duty must in many cases, stand higher than health, often, even, than life itself, but pleasure must never stand higher, as far as the student is concerned. For him pleasure can only be a m eans to health and to life, and in this connection we must, above all, be honest and truthful with ourselves. It is no use leading an ascetic life, when the underlying motive is the same, in this case as with other enjoyments. Some may derive satisfaction from asceticism as others from wine-bibbing, but they must not imagine that asceticism of this kind will assist them to attain higher knowledge. Many ascribe to their station of life everything which apparently prevents them from making progress. They say they cannot develop themselves under their conditions of life. Now many may find it desira ble, in other respects, to change their station of life, but no one need do so for the purpose of esoteric training. For the latter, a person need only do as much as possible, what ever his position, to fu rther the health of body and soul. Every kind of work can serve th e whole of humanity; and it is a surer sign of greatness of soul to percei ve clearly how necessary for th is whole is a petty, perhaps even an unsightly employment, than to think: ‘ This work is not good enough for me; I am destined for something better. ’ Of special importance for the student is the effort to retain complete health of mind. An unhealthy life of thought and feeling will not fail to obstruct the path to higher knowledge. Clear, calm thinki ng, with stability of feeling and emotion, here form the basis of all work. Nothing shoul d be further removed from the student than an inclination towards a fantastical, excitabl e life, towards nervousness, exaggeration and fanaticism. He should acquire a healthy outl ook on all circumstances of life; he should meet the demands of life with steady assuranc e, quietly letting a ll things make their impression on him and reveal their message. He should be at pains to do justice to life on every occasion. All one-sided and extravagant te ndencies in his sentiments and criticisms should be avoided. Failing this he would fi nd his way merely into worlds of his own imagination, instead of higher worlds; in place of truth, his own pet opinions would assert themselves. It is better for the student to be matter-of-fact than excitable and fantastic. 2. The second condition is that the student s hould feel himself co-ord inated as a link in the whole of life. Much is included in the fulfilment of this condition, but each can only fulfil it in his own manner. If I am a teacher and my pupil does not answer my expectations, I must not direct my resentme nt against my pupil, but against myself. I must feel myself as one with my pup il, to the extent of asking myself: ‘ Is my pupil ’ s deficiency not the result of my own action? ’ Instead of directing my feelings against him, I shall rather reflect on the way I should myself behave , so that the pupil may, in the future, be better able to satisfy my demands. Proceeding from such an attitude, a change will come over the whole of the student ’ s way of thinking. This holds good in all things, great or small. Such an attitude of mind, for instance, alters the way I regard a criminal. I suspend my judgment, and say to myself: ‘ I am only a human being as he is. Through favourable circumstances, I received an edu cation which perhaps alone saved me from a similar fate. ’ I may then also come to the conclusion that this brother of mine would have become a different man, had the same pains be en taken with him by my teachers, as they took with me. I shall reflect on the fact th at something was given to me which was withheld from him. And then I shall naturally come to think of myself as a link in the whole of humanity, and a sharer in the respons ibility for everything th at occurs. This does"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"not imply that such a thought should be imme diately translated into external action and agitation. It should be cherished in stillness within the soul. Then, quite gradually, it will set its mark on the outward demeanour of the student. In such matters each can only begin by reforming himself. It is of no ava il, in the sense of th e foregoing thoughts, to make general claims on the whole of humanity. It is easy to decide what men ought to be; but the student works in the depths, not on the surface. It would, therefore, be quite wrong to relate the demand here indicated with any external, say, pol itical claims; with such, this training can have not hing to do. Political agitators ‘ know ’ , as a rule, what to ‘ demand ’ of other people; but they say little of demands on themselves. 3. This brings us to the third condition. The student must work his way upward to the realization that his thoughts a nd feelings are as important fo r the world as his actions. It must be realized that it is equally injurious to hate a fellow-being, as to strike him. The realization will then follow, that by perfecting ourselves, we accomplish something not only for ourselves, but for the whole world. The world derives equal benefit from our untainted feelings and thought s, as from our good demeanour, and as long as we cannot believe in this cosmic importance of our inner life, we are unfit for the path that is here described. We are only filled with the right fait h in the significance of our inner self, of our soul, when we work at it as though it were at least as real as all external things. We must admit that our every feeling produces an effect, just as ev ery action of our hand. 4. These words express the fourth condition: to acquire the conviction that the real being of man does not lie in his exterior, but in his interior. Anyone re garding himself as a product of the outer world, as a result of the physical world, cannot succeed in this esoteric training, for the feeling that we are beings of soul a nd spirit forms its very basis. The acquisition of this feeling renders the st udent fit to distinguish between inner duty and outward success. He learns that the one can not be directly measured by the other. He must find the direct mean between what is indicated by external c onditions, and what he recognizes to be the right conduct for himsel f. He is not to force upon his environment anything for which it can have no understandin g, but he must be quite free from the desire to do only what can be appreciated by those around him. The voice of his own soul struggling manfully towards knowledge, is to bring to him the one and only recognition of the truths for which he stands. But he must learn as much as he possibly can from his environment so as to discover what those around him need, and what is of use to them. In this way he will develop within himself what is known in Spiritual Science as the ‘ spiritual balance ’ . An ‘ open heart ’ for the needs of the outer world, lies on one of the scales, and ‘ inner fortitude and unfaltering endurance ’ on the other. 5. This brings us to the fifth condition: stea dfastness in carrying out a resolution. Nothing should induce the student to deviate from a re solution he may have taken, save only the admission that he was in error. Every resolu tion is a force, and if this force does not produce an immediate effect at the point to which it was applied, nevertheless it works on in its own way. Success is only decisive when an action arises from desire. But all actions arising from desire are worthl ess in relation to the higher wo rlds. Their love towards an action is alone decisive. In this love every motive is implanted that impels the student to action. Undismayed by failure he will never grow weary of endeavouring repeatedly to"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"translate some resolution into action. And in this way he reaches the stage of not waiting to see the outward effect of his actions, but of contenting himself with performing them. He will learn to sacr ifice his actions, even his whole being, to the world, however the world may receive his sacrifice. Readiness for a sacrifice, for an offering such as this, must be shown by all who would pursu e the path of esoteric training. 6. A sixth condition is the development of a feeling of thankfulne ss for everything with which man is favoured. We must realize that our existence is a gift from the entire universe. How much is needed to enable each one of us to receive and maintain his existence! How much do we not owe to Nature and to our fellow human beings! Thoughts such as these must come naturally to all who seek es oteric training, for if they do not feel disposed to them, they will be in capable of developing within themselves that all-embracing love, which is necessary for the attainment of higher knowledge. Nothing can reveal itself to us which we do not love. And every revelation must fill us with thankfulness, for we ourselves are the richer for it. 7. All these conditions must be united in a seventh: to regard life unceasingly in the manner demanded by these conditions. The student thus makes it possible to give his life the stamp of uniformity. All his modes of expression, will, in this way, be brought into harmony, and no longer contradict each other. And thus he will prepare himself for the inner tranquillity he must attain during the prelimin ary steps of his training. Anyone sincerely showing the goodwill to fulf il these conditions may decide to seek esoteric training. He will then be ready to follow the advi ce given above. Much of this advice may appear to be merely on the surf ace, and many will perhaps say that they did not expect the training to proceed in such strict forms. But everything interior must manifest itself in an exterior way, and just as a picture is not evident, when it exists only in the mind of the painter, so, too, there can be no esoteric training without outward expression. Disregard for stri ct forms is only shown by those who do not know that the exterior is the avenue of expression for the interior. No doubt it is the spirit th at really matters, and not the form; but just as form w ithout spirit is null and void, so also would spirit remain inactive if it did not create for itself a form. The above conditions are calculated to re nder the student strong enough to fulfil the further demands made on him in his training. If he fail in these conditions, he will hesitate before each new demand, and, without them, he will lack that faith in man which he must possess. For all striving for truth mu st be founded on faith in and true love for man. But though this is the founda tion it is not the source of all striving for truth, for such striving can only flow from the soul ’ s own fountain-head of st rength. And the love of man must gradually widen to a love for all living creatures, yes, for all existence. Through failure to fulfil the condition here give n, the student will lack the perfect love for everything that fashions and crea tes, and the inclination to re frain from all destruction as such. He must so train himself that not only in his actions, but also in his words, feelings and thoughts he will never destroy anything for the sake of destruction. His joy must be in growth and life, and he must only lend his hand to destruction, when he is also able, through and by means of destruction, to prom ote new life. This does not mean that the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"student must simply look on while evil runs rio t; but rather that he must seek, even in evil, that side through which he may transf orm it into good. He will then see more and more clearly that evil and imperfection may best be combatted by the creation of the good and the perfect. The student knows that out of nothing, nothing can be created, but also that the imperfect can be transformed into the perf ect. Anyone developing within himself the disposition to crea te, will soon find himself capable of facing evil in the right way. It must be clearly realized th at the purpose of this training is to build and not to destroy. The student should therefore bring with hi m the goodwill for sincere and devoted work, and not the intention to criticize and destr oy. He should be capable of devotion, for he must learn what he does not yet know; he s hould look reverently on that which discloses itself. Work and devotion, these are the f undamental qualities which must be demanded of the student. Some come to realize that they are making no progress, though, in their own opinion, they are untiringly active. The r eason is that they have not grasped the meaning of work and devotion in the right wa y. Work done for the sake of success will be the least successful, and learning pursued without devotion will be the least conducive to progress. Only the love of work, and not of success, leads to progress. And if in learning, the student seeks stra ight thinking and sound judgme nt, he need not spoil his devotion with doubts and suspicions. We are not reduced to servile subjection in li stening to some information with respectful sympathy, and because we do not at once oppose it with our own opinion. Anyone having advanced some way in the attainment of higher knowledge, knows that he owes everything to quiet attention and active reflec tion, and not to wilful personal judgment. We should always bear in mind that we do not need to learn what we can critically judge. Therefore if our sole intention is to judge, we can learn nothing mo re. Esoteric training, however, centres round learning; we must have absolutely the goodwill to be learners. If we cannot understand something, it is far better not to judge than to judge adversely. We can wait until later, for a true understa nding. The higher we climb the ladder of knowledge, the more do we require the faculty of listening with quiet devotion. All perception of truth, all life and activity in the world of the spirit, become subtle and delicate in comparison with the processes of the ordinary intellect, and of life in the physical world. The more the sphere of our activity widens out before us, the more delicate are the processes in which we are engage d. It is for this reason that men arrive at such different ‘ opinions ’ and ‘ points of view ’ , regarding the higher regions. But there is one and only one opinion regard ing higher truths and this on e opinion is within reach of all who, through work and devotion, have so ri sen that they can re ally behold truth and contemplate it. Opinions differing from the one true opinion can only be arrived at when people, insufficiently prepared, judge in accord ance with their pet theories, their habitual ways of thought and so forth. Just as th ere is only one correc t opinion concerning a mathematical problem, so also is this true with regard to the higher worlds. But before such an ‘ opinion ’ can be arrived at, due preparation mu st first be undergone. If this were only considered, the conditions attached to es oteric training would be surprising to none. It is indeed true that truth and the higher life abide in every soul, and that each can and must find them for himself. But they lie deeply buried, and ca n only be brought up from"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"their deep shafts afte r all obstacles have been cleare d away. Only the experienced can advise how this may be done. Such advice is found in Spiritual Sc ience. No truth is forced on anyone, no dogma is proclaimed; a wa y, only, is pointed out. It is true that everyone could find this way unaided, but onl y perhaps after many in carnations. By this esoteric training this way is shortened. We thus reach more quickly a point from which we can co-operate in those worlds, where sa lvation and evolution of man are furthered by spiritual work. This brings to an end the in dications to be given in connection with the attainment of knowledge of the higher worlds. In the following chapters, and in further connection with the above, it will be show n how this development affects the higher elements of the human organism (the soul -organism or astral body, and the spirit or thought-body). In this way, the indications here given will be placed in a new light, and it mill be possible to penetrate them in a deeper sense. SOME RESULTS OF INITIATION One of the fundamental principles of true Sp iritual Science is that the individual devoting himself to its study, should do so with full consciousness; he shoul d attempt nothing and practise nothing without knowledge of the effect produced. A teacher of Spiritual Science, when giving advice or instruction, wi ll always explain to those in search of higher knowledge, the effects produced on body, soul and spirit, if his advice and instructions be followed. [footnote: See p. 158 and Editorial Preface.] Some effects produced upon the soul of the student will here be indicated, for such knowledge is indispensable to anyone attemp ting the exercises leading to the knowledge of the higher worlds with full consciousne ss of action. Without the latter, no genuine esoteric training is possible, for it must be understood that all groping in the dark is discouraged, and that failure to pursue this training with open eyes may lead to ‘mediumship’, but not to ‘exa ct clairvoyance’ in the sense of Spiritual Science. The exercises described in the preceding chap ters, if practised in the right way, involve certain changes in the organism of the soul (astral body). The latter is only perceptible to the clairvoyant, and may be compared to a more or less luminous cloud, in the centre of which the physical body is discerned. In th is astral body desires, lusts, passions, ideas, etc., become visible in a spiritual way. Se nsual appetites, for instance, create the impression of a dark red radiance, with a de finite shape; a pure and noble thought finds its expression in a reddish-violet radiance; the clear-cut conception of the logical thinker is experienced as a yellowish figure with sh arply defined outline; th e confused thought of the muddled head appears as a figure with vague outline. The thoughts of a person with one-sided, perverse views, appear sharply outlined but immobile, while the thoughts of people who are accessible to th e points of view of others are seen to have mobile, changeable outlines. [footnote: In all these and the following descriptions, it must be noted that with seeing a colour , spiritual seeing is meant. When the clairvoyant speaks of ‘seeing red,’ he means: ‘I have an experien ce, in a psychic-spiritual way, which is equivalent to the physical experience when an impression of red is received.’ This mode"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"of expression is here used because it is perfec tly natural to the clairvoyant. If this point is overlooked, a mere colour-vision may easily be mistaken for a genuine clairvoyant experience.] The further the student advances in his inner development, the greater will be the organic differentiation introduced into his astral body. The latter is confused and undifferentiated in the case of a person of undeveloped inner life; yet the clairvoyant can perceive even the unorganized astral body as a figure standing out distinctly from its environment. It extends from the centre of the head to th e middle of the physical body, and appears like an independent body possessing certain organs. These organs, now to be considered, are apparent to the clairvoyant near the fo llowing parts of the physical body: the first between the eyes; the second n ear the larynx; the third in the region of the heart; the fourth in the so-called pit of the stomach; th e fifth and sixth are s ituated in the abdomen. These organs are technically known as wheels, chakrams or lotus flowers. They are so called on account of their likene ss to wheels or flowers, but of course it should be clearly understood that such an expressi on is not to be applied more literally than when the lungs are called wings. Just as there is no question of wings in the case of lungs, so, too, in the case of the lotus flowers, the expression mu st be taken as a figurative comparison. In undeveloped persons these lotus flowers are dark in colour, motionle ss and inert. In the clairvoyant, however, they are luminous, mobile, and of variegated colour. Something of this kind applies to the medium , though in a different way; bu t this question need not here be pursued. Now when the student begins hi s exercises, the lotus flowers become brighter; later on they begin to revolve. When this occurs, cl airvoyance begins. For these flowers are the sense organs of the soul, and their revoluti ons express the fact that the clairvoyant perceives supersensibly. No one can perceive the supersensible until he has developed his astral senses in this way. Thanks to the sp iritual organ situated in the vicinity of the larynx, it becomes possible to survey clairvoya ntly the thoughts and mentality of other beings, and to obtain a deeper insight into the true laws of natural phenomena. The organ situated near the heart permits of clairvoyant knowledge of the sentiments and disposition of other souls. When developed, this orga n also makes it possible to observe certain deeper forces in animals and plants. By mean s of the organ in the so-called pit of the stomach, knowledge is acquired of the talents and capacities of souls; by its means, too, the part played by animals, plants, stones, metals, atmospheric phenomena and so on in the household of Nature, becomes apparent. The organ in the vicinity of th e larynx has sixteen petals or spokes; the one in the region of the heart twelve, and the one in the pit of the stomach ten. Now certain activities of the soul are connect ed with the development of these organs, and anyone devoting himself to them in a certa in definite way, contributes something to the development of the corresponding organs. In the 16-petalled lotus, eight of its sixteen petals were developed during an earlier stag e of human evolution, in a remote past. Man himself contributed nothing to this development; he received them as a gift from nature, at a time when his consciousness was in a dul l, dreamy condition. At that stage of human"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"evolution, they were in active use, but the manner of their activity was only compatible with that dull state of consciousness. As c onsciousness became clearer and brighter, the petals became obscured and ceased their activity. Man himself can now develop the remaining eight petals by conscious exerci ses, and thereby the whole lotus flower becomes luminous and mobile. The acquisiti on of certain faculties depends on the development of each one of the sixteen petals . Yet, as already shown, only eight can be consciously developed; the remainder then appear of their own accord. The development proceeds in the following manner. The student must first apply himself with care and attention to certa in functions of the soul, hitherto exercised by him in a careless and inattentive manner. There are eight such functio ns. The first is the way in which ideas and conceptions are acquired. In th is respect people usually allow themselves to be led by chance alone. They see or hear one thing or another and form their ideas accordingly. While this is the case, the si xteen petals of the lotus flower remain ineffective. It is only when the student begins to take his self-edu cation in hand, in this respect, that the petals become effective. His ideas and conceptions must be guarded; each single idea should acquire significance fo r him; he should see in it a definite message instructing him concerning the things of the outer world, and he should derive no satisfaction from ideas devoid of such signifi cance. He must govern his mental life so that it becomes a true mirror of the outer world, and direct his effort to the exclusion of incorrect ideas from his soul. The second of these functions is concerned wi th the control of resolutions. The student must not resolve upon even the most tr ifling act, without we ll-founded and thorough consideration. Thoughtless and m eaningless actions should be foreign to his nature. He should have well-considered gr ounds for everything he does, and abstain from everything for which no significant motive is forthcoming. The third function concerns speech. The student should utter no word that is devoid of sense and meaning; all talking for the sake of talking draws him away from his path. He must avoid the usual kind of conversati on, with its promiscuous discussion of indiscriminately varied topics . This does not imply his precl usion from intercourse with his fellows. It is precisely in such intercour se that his conversation should develop to significance. He is ready to c onverse with everyone, but he do es so thoughtfully and with thorough deliberation. He never speaks without grounds for what he says. He seeks to use neither too many nor too few words. The fourth is the regulation of outward action. The student tries to ad just his actions in such a way that they harmonize with the actions of his fellow-men and with the events in his environment. He refrains from actions wh ich are disturbing to ot hers and antagonistic to his surroundings. He seeks to adjust his actions so th at they combine harmoniously with his surroundings, with his po sition in life, etc. When an external motive causes him to act, he considers how he can best respond. When the impulse proceeds from himself he weighs with minute care the effects of his activity."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The fifth function includes the management of the whole of life. The student endeavours to live in conformity with both Nature and spirit. Never over-hasty, he is also never indolent. Excessive activity a nd laziness are equally alien to him. He looks upon life as a means for work and disposes it accordingly. He regulates his habits, the care of his health, etc., in such a way that a harmonious whole is the outcome. The sixth is concerned with human endea vour. The student tests his capacities and proficiency, and conducts himself in the light of such self-knowledge, He attempts nothing that is beyond his powers, but seeks to omit nothing that is within their scope. On the other hand he sets before himself aims th at coincide with the ideals and the great duties of a human being. He does not mechanica lly regard himself as a wheel in the vast machinery of mankind, but seeks to comprehe nd the tasks of his life, and to look out beyond the limit of the daily and trivial. He endeavours to fulfil his obligations ever better and more perfectly. The seventh deals with the effort to learn as much from life as possible. Nothing passes before the student without giving him occasion to accumulate experience which is of value to him for life. If he has performed a nything wrongly or imperfectly, he lets this be an incentive for repeat ing the performance later on, but th is time rightly and perfectly. When others act, he observes them with the sa me end in view. He tr ies to gather a rich store of experience, and ever to turn to it for counsel; nor indeed will he ever do anything without looking back on experiences from whic h he can derive help in his decisions and affairs. Finally, the eighth is that the student must, from time to time, glance introspectively into himself, sink back into himself, take hims elf carefully to task, form and test the fundamental principles of his life, run ove r, in his thoughts, the sum total of his knowledge, weigh his duties, reflect upon the co ntent and aim of life and so on. All these things have been mentioned in the preceding ch apters; here they are merely recapitulated in connection with the development of the 16- petalled lotus. By means of these exercises the latter will become ever more and more pe rfect, for it is upon such exercises that the development of clairvoyance depends. The better the student’s thoughts and speech harmonize with the processes in the outer worl d, the more quickly will he develop this faculty. Whoever thinks and speaks what is co ntrary to truth destr oys something in the bud of his 16-petalled lotus. Tr uthfulness, uprightness and hone sty are in this connection creative forces, while mendacity, deceitfulness and dishonesty are destructive forces. The student must realize, however, that act ual deeds are needed, and not merely ‘good intentions’. If I think or say anything that does not conform with reality, I kill something in my spiritual organs, even t hough I believe my intentions to be ever so good. It is here as with the child which needs must burn itsel f when it falls into the fire, even though it did so out of ignorance. The regulation of th e above activities of the soul in the manner described, causes the 16-petalled lotus to ray forth in glorious hues, and imparts to it a definite movement. Yet it must be noted that the faculty of clairvoyance cannot make its appearance before a definite degree of developm ent has been attained. It cannot appear so long as it is irksome for the st udent to regulate his life in this manner. He is still unfit, so long as the activities describe d above are a matter of special pre-occupation for him. The"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"first traces of clairvoyance only appear when he has reached the point of being able to live in the specified way, as a person habitua lly lives. These things must then no longer be irksome, but must have become a matter of course. There must be no need for him to be continually watching himself, and urging hi mself on to live in this way. It must all become a matter of habit. Now this lotus flower may be made to deve lop in another way by following certain other instructions. But all such methods are rejected by true Spir itual Science, for they lead to the destruction of physical health and to mora l ruin. They are easier to follow than those here described. The latter, though protracted an d irksome, lead to the true goal and cannot but strengthen morally. The distorted development of a lotus flower results not only in illusions and fantastic conceptions, should a certain degree of clai rvoyance ensue, but also in errors and instability in ordinary life. Such a development may be the cause of timidity, envy, vanity, haughtiness, wilfulness and so on in a person who hitherto was free from these defects. It has already been explained that eight of the sixteen petals of this lotus flower were developed in a remote past, and that thes e will reappear of themselves, in the course of esoteric development. All the effort and a ttention of the student must be devoted to the remaining eight. Faulty training may easily result in the reappearance of the earlier petals alone, while the new petals remain stunted. This will ensue especially if too little logical, rational thinking is introduced into the instru ction. It is of supreme importance that the student should be a rational and clear-thinki ng person, and of further importance that he should practise the greatest clarity of speech. People who begin to have some presentiment of supersensible things, are ap t to wax talkative on this subject, thereby retarding their normal development. The less one talks about these matters the better. No one should speak about them until he has ach ieved a certain degree of clarity. At the beginning of their instruction, students are as a rule astonished at the teacher’s lack of curiosity concerning their own experiences. It mere much the best for them to remain entirely silent on this subject , and to content themselves w ith mentioning if they have been successful or unsuccessful in perf orming the exercises and observing the instructions given them. Fo r the teacher has quite othe r means of estimating their progress than their own communications. Th e eight petals now under consideration always become a little hardened through such communications, whereas they should he kept soft and supple. The following example, taken, for the sake of clarity, not from the supersensible world, but from ordinary life, will illustrate this point. Suppose I hear a piece of news and thereupon immediately form an opinion. Shortly afterwards I receive some further news which does not harmonize w ith the previous information. I am thereby obliged to reverse my previous judgment. The result is an unfavourable influence upon my 16-petalled lotus. Quite the contrary would have been the case had I, in the first place, suspended my judgment, and remained silent both inwardly in thought and outwardly in word, concerning the whole affair, until I ha d acquired reliable grounds for forming my judgment. Caution in the formation a nd pronouncement of judgments becomes, by degrees, the special characteristic of the stud ent. On the other hand his receptivity for impressions and experiences increases; he le ts them pass over him silently, so as to collect and have the largest possible number of facts at his disposal, when the time comes"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"to form his opinions. Bluish-red and reddish-p ink shades colour the lotus flower as the result of such circumspection, whereas, in th e opposite case, dark red and orange shades appear. [footnote: Students will recognize in the conditions attached to the development of the 16-petalled lotus, the instructions given by the Buddha to his disciples for the ‘Path’. Yet there is no question here of t eaching Buddism, but of describing conditions governing development, which are the natural ou tcome of Spiritual Science. The fact that these conditions harmonize with certain te achings of the Buddha is no reason for not finding them true in themselves.] The 12-petalled lotus situated in the region of the heart, is developed in a similar way. Half its petals, too, were already existent a nd in active use, in a remote stage of human evolution. Thus these six petals need not now be especially developed in esoteric training; they appear of themselves, and begi n to revolve when the student sets to work on the other six. Here again he learns to promote this development by consciously controlling and directing certain in ner activities in a special way. It must be clearly understood that the percep tions of each single spiritual organ bear a different character. The 12- and 16-petalled lotus flowers transmit quite different perceptions. The latter perceives forms. The thoughts and mentality of other beings and the laws governing natural phenomena become ma nifest, through the 16-petalled lotus, as figures, not rigid motionless figures, but mobile forms filled with life. The clairvoyant in whom this sense is developed, can distingui sh, for every mode of thought and for every law of Nature, a form bearing their imp ression. A revengeful thought, for example, assumes an arrow-like, pronged form, while a kindly thought is often formed like an opening flower, and so on. Clear -cut, significant thoughts are re gular and symmetrical in form, while confused thoughts have wavy ou tlines. Quite different perceptions are received through the 12-petalled lotus. These perceptions ma y be in a sense likened to warmth and cold, as applied to the soul. A cl airvoyant equipped with this faculty feels this warmth and cold streaming out from th e forms discerned by the 16-petalled lotus. Had he developed the 16- and not the 12-peta lled lotus, he would only perceive, in the kindly thought, for instance, the figure desc ribed above, while a clairvoyant in whom both senses were developed, would also noti ce what can be described as soul-warmth, flowing from the thought. It should be notic ed, in passing, that esoteric training never develops one organ without the other, so that the above-mentioned example may be regarded as an exception referred to for the sa ke of lucidity. The 12-petalled lotus, when developed, reveals to the clai rvoyant a deep understanding of the processes of Nature. From every manifestation of growth and de velopment there issue rays of soul-warmth, while everything that is encompassed by deca y, destruction, ruin, presents an impression of cold. The development of this sense may be furthered in the following manner. To begin with, the student applies himself to regulating his sequence of thought (control of thought). Just as the 16-petalled lotus is developed by cult ivating thoughts that c onform with truth and are significant, so, too, the 12-petalled lotu s is developed by inwardly controlling the trains of thought. Thoughts that dart to and fro like will-o ’-the-wisps, and follow each other in no logical or rationa l sequence, but merely by pure chance, destroy its form. The"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"latter is developed to ever-i ncreasing perfection, the closer thought is made to follow upon thought, and the more strictly everything of illogical nature is avoided. If the student hears illogical thoughts, he immediat ely lets the right thoughts pass through his mind. He should not, however, withdraw in a loveless way from what is perhaps an illogical environment, in order to further his own development. Neither should he feel himself impelled to correct all the illogical t houghts expressed around him. He should rather co-ordinate silently the thoughts as they pour in upon him, in a way conforming with logic and sense, and himself endeavour, in every case, to retain this same method in his own thinking. An equal supervision in his actions forms the second requirement (control of actions). All inc onstancy, all disharmony of acti on conduces to the destruction of the lotus flower here in question. When th e student performs some action, he must see to it that his succeeding action follows in logica l sequence, for if he acts from day to day with variable intent, he will never develop the faculty here considered. The third requirement is the cultivation of endurance (per severance). The student is impervious to all influences which would dive rt him from the goal he has set himself, so long as he can regard it as the right goal. For him, obstacles c ontain a challenge to surmount them, but are never a reas on for restraining his progress. The fourth requirement is forbearance (tol erance) towards persons, creatures and also circumstances. The student suppresses all s uperfluous criticism of everything that is imperfect, evil and bad, and seeks rather to understand everything that comes under his notice. Even as the sun does not withdraw its light from the bad and the evil, so he, too, does not refuse them an intelligent sympathy. Should some trouble befall him, he does not proceed to condemn and criticize, but accepts what necessity has brought him, and endeavours to the best of his ability, to give the matter a turn for the best. He does not consider the opinions of others merely from his own standpoint, but seeks to put himself into the other’s position. The fifth requirement is impartiality toward s everything that life brings. In this connection we speak of faith and trust. Th e student encounters every human being and every creature with this trus t, and lets it insp ire his every action. Upon hearing some information, he never says to himself: ‘I don’t believe it; it contradicts my present opinions.’ He is far rather ready to test and rectify his views a nd opinions. He ever remains receptive for everything that confronts him, and he trusts in the effectiveness of his undertakings. Timidity and scepticism ar e banished from his being. He harbours a faith in the power of his intentions. A hundred failures cannot rob him of his faith. This is the ‘faith which can move mountains’. The sixth requirement is the cultivation of a certain inner balance (equanimlity). The student endeavours to retain his composure in the face of joy and sorrow, and discards the tendency to fluctuate between the seventh h eaven of joy and the depths of despair. Misfortune and danger, fortune and a dvancement alike find him ready armed. The reader will recognize in th e qualities here described, the ‘six attributes’, which the candidate for Initiation strives to acquire. Th e intention has been to show their connection"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"with the spiritual organ k nown as the 12-petalled lotus flower. As before, special instructions can be given to br ing this lotus flower to frui tion, but here again, the perfect symmetry of its form depends on the development of the qualities mentioned, the neglect of which results in this organ being formed to a caricature of its proper shape. In this case, should a certain clairvoyance be attaine d, the qualities in question may take an evil instead of a good direction. A person may b ecome intolerant, timid or contentious towards his environment; may, for instance, acq uire some feeling for the sentiments of others, and for this reason shun them or hate them. This may even reach the point that, by reason of the inner coldness overwhelming him, he is unable to listen to repugnant opinions, or he may behave in an objectionable manner. The development of this organ may be accelera ted, if, in addition to all that has been stated, certain other injunctions be observed which can only be imparted to the student by word of mouth. Yet the instru ctions given above do actually lead to genuine esoteric training, and moreover, the regulation of life in the way described, can be advantageous to all who cannot or will not undergo esoteric training. For it does not fail to produce an effect upon the organism of the soul, even t hough slowly. As regards the esoteric student, the observance of these principles is indisp ensable Should he atte mpt esoteric training without conforming to them, this could only resu lt in his entering the higher worlds with inadequate organs, and instead of percei ving the truth, he would be subjected to deceptions and illusions. He would attain a cert ain clairvoyance, but for the most part, be the victim of greater blindness than before. Fo rmerly he at least stood firmly within the physical world; now he sees through this physical world, and goes astray in it before acquiring a firm footing in a higher world. All power of distinguishing truth from error, would then perhaps fail him, and he would entirely lose his way in life. It is just for this reason that patience is so necessary in these matters. It must ever be borne in mind that the instructions given in esoteric training ma y go no further than is compatible with the willing readiness shown to develop the lotus fl owers to their regular shape. Should these flowers be brought to fruition before they ha d quietly attained thei r correct form, mere caricatures would be the result. Their fruition can be accelerated by the special instructions given in esoteric training, but their form is dependent on the method of life described above. An inner training of a particul arly intimate character is necessary for the development of the l0-petal led lotus flower, for it is now a question of learning consciously to control and dominate the se nse-impressions themse lves. This is of particular importance in the initi al stages of clairvoyance, fo r it is only by this means that a source of countless illu sions and fancies is avoided. Peopl e, as a rule, do not realize by what factors their sudden ideas and memories are dominated, and how they are produced. Consider the following case. Someone is travelling by railway; his mind is busy with one thought; suddenly his thought dive rges; he recollects an experi ence that befell him years ago, and interweaves it with hi s present thought. He did not notice that in looking through the window, he had caught sight of a person who resembled another intimately connected with the recollected experience. He remains conscious, not of what he saw, but of the effect it produced, and so believes that it all came to him ‘of its own accord’. Now much in life occurs in such a way! How great is th e part played in our life by things we hear and learn, without our consci ously realizing the connectio n! Someone, for instance, cannot bear a certain colour, but does not realize that this is due to the fact that the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"school-teacher who used to worry him many years ago, wore a coat of that colour. Innumerable illusions are based upon such asso ciations. Many things leave their mark upon the soul, while remaining outside the pa le of consciousness. The following may occur. Someone reads in the paper about th e death of a well-known person, and forthwith claims to have had a ‘presentiment’ of it ‘y esterday’, although he neither heard nor saw anything that might have given rise to such a thought. And indeed it is quite true that the thought occurred to him ‘yesterday’, as though of its own accord, that this particular person would die; only one thing escaped his attention: two or three hours before this thought occurred to him yesterday, he went to visit an acquaintance; a newspaper lay on the table; he did not actua lly read it, but his eyes unc onsciously fell on the announcement of the dangerous illness of the person in question. He remained unconscious of the impression he received, and yet this impr ession resulted in his ‘presentiment’. Reflection upon these matters will show how great a source of illusion and fantasy is contained in such associations . It is just this source whic h must be dammed up by all who seek to develop their l0-petalled lotus flower . Deeply hidden characteristics in other souls can he perceived by this orga n, but their truth depends on th e attainment of immunity from the above-mentioned illusions. For this purpose it is necessary that the student should control and dominate everything that seeks to influence him from outside. He should reach the point of really receiving no impressions beyond those he wishes to receive. This can only be achieved by the development of a power ful inner life; by an effort of the will he only allows such thi ngs to impress him to which his attention is directed, and he actually evades all impressi ons to which he does not voluntarily respond. If he sees something, it is because he wills to see it. And if he does not voluntarily take notice of something, it is actua lly non-existent for him. Th e greater the energy and inner activity devoted to this work, the more exte nsively will this faculty be attained. The student must avoid all vacuous gazing a nd mechanical listening. For him only those things exist to which he turns his eye or hi s ear. He must practise the power of hearing nothing, even in the greatest disturbance, if he does not will to hear; and he must make his eyes unimpressionable to th ings of which he does not particularly take notice. He must be shielded as by an inner armour against all unconscious impressions. In this connection, the student must devote special ca re to his thought-li fe. He singles out a particular thought and endeavours to link on to it only such other thoughts as he can himself consciously and voluntar ily produce. He rejects all ca sual fancies, and does not connect this thought with anothe r until he has investigated th e origin of the latter. He goes still further. If, for instance, he feels a particular antipathy for something, he will combat it and endeavour to establish a cons cious relation between himself and the thing in question. In this way the unconscious elemen ts that intrude into his soul will become fewer and fewer. Only by such severe self-d iscipline can the l0-petalled lotus flower attain its proper form. The st udent’s inner life must become a life of attention, and he must learn really to keep aw ay from himself everything to which he should not or does not wish to dire ct his attention. If this strict self-discipline be accompanied by meditation prescribed in esoteric training, the lotus flower in the region of the pit of the stomach comes to fruition in the right way, and light and colour of a spiritual kind are now added to the form and warmth perceptible"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"to the organs described above. The talents and faculties of other beings are thereby revealed, also the forces and the hidden attrib utes of Nature. The coloured aura of living creatures then becomes visible; all that is around us manifest s its spiritual attributes. It will be admitted that the very greatest care is necessary at this stage of development, for the play of unconscious memories is here ex ceedingly active. If this were not the case, many people would possess this inner sense, for it comes almost immediately into evidence, when the impressions delivered by the outer senses are held so completely under control, that they become dependent on nothing save attention or inattention. This inner sense remains ineffective so long as th e powerful outer senses smother it and render it insensible. Still greater difficulty attends the development of the 6-petalled lotu s flower situated in the centre of the body, for it can only be achieve d as the result of complete mastery and control of the whole personali ty through consciousness of self, so that body, soul and spirit form one harmonious whole. The f unctions of the body, the inclinations and passions of the soul, the thoughts and ideas of the spirit, must be tuned to perfect unison. The body must be so ennobled a nd purified that its organs ar e impelled to nothing that is not in the service of the soul and spirit. The soul must not be impelled, through the body, to lusts and passions which are antagonistic to pure and noble thought. The spirit, however, must not stand as a slave-driver over the soul, dominating it with laws and commandments; the soul must ra ther learn to follow these la ws and duties out of its own free inclination. The student must not feel dut y to be an oppressive power to which he unwillingly submits, but rather something which he performs out of love. His task is to attain an equilibrium of soul between body and spirit, and he must perfect himself in this way, to the extent of being free to abandon hi mself to the functions of the senses, for these should be so purified that they lose the power to drag him down to their level. He must no longer require to curb his passions, in asmuch as they of their own accord follow the good. So long as self-chastisement is nece ssary, no one can attain a certain stage of esoteric development for a virtue practised on constraint is devoid of value. One single remaining lust will disturb esoteric development, however great the effort made not to humour it. Nor does it matter whether this desi re proceeds from the soul or the body. For example, if a certain stimulant be avoide d for the purpose of self-purification, this deprivation will only prove helpful if th e body suffers no harm from it. Should the contrary he the case, this proves that th e body craves for the stimulant, and that abstinence from it is of no value. In this ca se it may actually be a question of renouncing the ideal to be attained, until more favourable physical conditions, perhaps in another life, shall be forthcoming. A wise renunciation is, at a certain stage, a far greater achievement than the struggle for something which, unde r given conditions, remains unattainable. Indeed a renunciation of th is kind, contributes more towards development than the opposite course. The 6-petalled lotus flower, when developed, pe rmits of intercourse with beings of higher worlds, though only if their existence is mani fested in the astral or soul-world. The development of this lotus flower, however, is not advisable unless the student has made great progress on that path of esoteric devel opment which enables him to raise his spirit into a still higher world. The entry into th e spiritual world proper must always run"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"parallel with the development of the lotus fl owers, otherwise the student will fall into error and confusion. He would undoubtedly be able to see, but he would remain incapable of forming a correct estimate of what he saw. Now the development of the 6-petalled lotus flower itself provides a ce rtain security against confus ion and instability, for no one call be easily confused who has attained pe rfect equilibrium betw een sense (or body), passion (or soul) and idea (or sp irit). And yet, something mo re than this security is required, when, through the development of the 6-petalled lotus flower , living beings of independent existence are revealed to his spirit, beings belonging to a world so completely different from the world known to his physical senses. The development of the lotus flowers alone does not ensure suffi cient security in thes e higher worlds; other higher organs are necessary. The latter will now be described before the remaining lotus flowers and the further organization of th e soul-body [footnote: This expression, though obviously contradictory, when taken literally, is used because, to clairvoyant perception, the impression received spiritually corres ponds to the impression received physically when the physical body is perceived.] are discussed. The development of the soul-body in the ma nner described above permits of perception in a supersensible world, but anyone wishi ng to find his way in this world must not remain stationary at this stage of developmen t. The mere mobility of the lotus flowers is not sufficient. The student must acquire the power or regulati ng and controlling the movement of his spiritual organs indepe ndently and with complete consciousness. Otherwise he would become a plaything for exte rnal forces and powers. To avoid this he must acquire the faculty of hearing what is called the ‘inner word’, and this involves the development not only of the soul-body but also of the etheric body. The latter is revealed to the clairvoyant as a kind of double to th e physical body, and forms to a certain extent an intermediate step between the soul a nd the physical body. It is possible for one equipped with clairvoyant powers, consciously to suggest away for himself the physical body of a person. On a higher plane this corresponds merely to an exercise in attentiveness on a lower plane. Just as a pers on can divert his atten tion from something in front of him, so that it becomes non-existent for him, the clairvoyant can extinguish a physical body from his field of observation so that it becomes physic ally transparent to him. If he exerts this faculty in the case of some person standing before him, then only the etheric [footnote: The word ether is merely used to suggest the fineness of the body in question, and need not in anyway be connect ed with the hypotheti cal ether of physics.] body remains visible to his clairvoyant sight, besides the soul-body, which is larger than the other two and interpenetra tes them both. The etheric body has approximately the size and form of the physical body, so that it practically fills the sa me space. It is an extremely delicate and finely organized structure. Its ground-colour is different from the seve n colours contained in the rainbow. Anyone capable of observing it will find a colour wh ich is actually non-existent for sense perception, and which can be preferably comp ared to the colour of young peach-blossom. If desired, the etheri c body can be examined alone; for this purpose the soul-body must be extinguished by an effort of attentivene ss in the manner descri bed above. Otherwise the etheric body will present an ever-changing picture owing to its interpenetration by the soul-body."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Now the particles of the etheric body are in continual motion. Countless streams pass through it in every direction. By these curren ts life itself is maintained and regulated. Every body that has life, including animals a nd plants, possesses an etheric body. Even in minerals traces of it can be observed. These currents and movements are, to begin with, independent of human will and consciousness, just as the action of the heart or stomach is beyond our jurisdiction, and this independence remains unaltered so long as we do not take our development in hand in the sense of acquiring supers ensible faculties. For development, at a certain stage, consis ts precisely in adding to the unconscious currents and movements of the etheric body, ot hers that are consciously produced and controlled. When esoteric development has progressed so far that the lotus flowers begin to stir, much has already been achieved by the stude nt which can result in the formation of certain quite definite currents and movement s in his etheric body. The object of this development is the formation of a kind of centr e in the region of th e physical heart, from which currents and movements, in the greatest variety of colours and forms, radiate. This centre is, in reality, no t a mere point, but a most complicat ed structure, a most wonderful organ. It glows and shimmers with every shad e of colour, and displays forms of great symmetry, capable of rapid transformation. Ot her forms and streams of colour radiate from this organ to the other parts of the body, and beyond it, to the astral body, which they completely permeate and illumine. The mo st important part of these currents flows to the lotus flowers. They permeate each petal and regulate its revolutions; then streaming out at the points of the petals, they lose themselves in outer space. The greater the development of a person, the greater the circumference to which these rays extend. The 12-petalled lotus flower has a particular ly close connection with this central organ. The currents flow directly into it and thr ough it, proceeding, on the one side, to the 16- and the 2-petalled lotus flowers, and on the ot her, the lower side, to the flowers of eight, six and four petals. It is for th is reason that the very greatest care must be devoted to the development of the 12-petalled lotus, for an imperfection in the latter would result in the irregular formation of the whole structure. Th e above will give an id ea of the delicate and intimate nature of esoteric training, and of th e accuracy needed, if the development is to be regular and correct. It will also be evident beyond doubt, that directions for the development of supersensibl e faculties can only be the concern of those who have themselves experienced everything which they propose to awaken in others, and who are unquestionably in a position to know whether the directions they give lead to the exact results desired. If the student follows the di rections that have been given him, he introduces into his etheric body currents and movements which are in harmony with the laws and the evolution of the world to which he belongs. Consequently these instructions are reflections of the great laws of cosm ic evolution. They consist of the above- mentioned and similar exercises in meditati on and concentration, which, if correctly practised, produce the results described. ‘The student must, at certain times, let these instructions permeate his soul with their content, so that he is inwardly entirely filled with it. A simple start is made with a view to deepening the logical ac tivity of the mind, and producing an inward intensification of thought. Thought is thereby made free and independent of all sense impressions and e xperiences; it is concentrated in one point"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"which is held entirely under control. Thus a preliminary centre is formed for the currents of the etheric body. This centre is not yet in the region of the heart, but in the head, and it appears to the clairvoyant as the point of departure for movements and currents, No esoteric training can be successful which does not first create this centre. If the latter were first formed in the region of the heart, the aspiring clairvoyant would doubtless obtain glimpses of the higher worlds, but he would lack every true insight into the connection between these higher worlds and the worl d of our senses. This, however, is an unconditional necessity for man at the presen t stage of evolution. The clairvoyant must not become a visionary; he must retain a firm footing upon the earth. The centre in the head, once duly fixed, is th en transferred lower down, to the region of the larynx. This is effected by further exercise s in concentration. Then the currents of the etheric body radiate from this point and illumine the astral space surrounding the individual. Continued practice enables the student to dete rmine for himself the position of his etheric body. Hitherto this position depended upon the fo rces proceeding from without or from within the physical body. Through further develo pment the student is able to direct his etheric body to all sides. This faculty is effected by curre nts moving approximately along both hands, and centred in the 2-petalled lotus in the region of the eyes. All that is made possible through the radiations from the lar ynx assuming round forms, of which a number how to the 2-petalled lotus, and thence form undulating currents along the hands. As a further development these currents branch out and ramify in the most delicate manner, and become, as it were, a kind of web, which then encompasses the entire etheric body as though with a network. Whereas hitherto the etheric body was not closed to the outer world, so that the life currents from the univers al ocean of life flowed freely in and out, it now becomes necessary that these currents s hould pass through this membrane. Thus the individual becomes sensitive to these external streams; they become perceptible to him. And now the time has come to give the comp lete system of currents and movements its centre situated in the region of the heart. This again is effected by persevering with the exercises in concentration and meditation; and at this point also the stage is reached when the student becomes gifted with the ‘inne r word.’ All things now acquire a new significance for him. They become as it were spiritually audible in their innermost self, and speak to him of their essential being. The currents described above place him in touch with the inner being of the world to wh ich he belongs. He begi ns to mingle his life with the life of his e nvironment and can let it reverberat e in the movements of his lotus flowers. At this point the spiritual world is entered. If the student has advanced so far, he acquires a new understanding for all that the great teach ers of humanity have uttered. The sayings of the Buddha and the Gospels, for instance, produce a new effect on him. They pervade him with a felicity of which he had not dr eamed before. For the tone of their words follows the movements and rhythms which he ha s himself formed within himself. He can now have positive knowledge that a Buddha or the Evangelists did not utter their own personal revelations, but those which flowed in to them from the innermost Being of all things. A fact must here be pointed out whic h can only be understood in the light of what"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"has been said above. The many repetitions in the sayings of the Buddha are not comprehensible to people of our present e volutionary stage. For the esoteric student, however, they become a force on which he gladly lets his inner senses rest, for they correspond with certain movements in the etheric body. Devotional surrender to them, with perfect inner peace, crea tes an inner harmony with th ese movements, and because the latter are an image of certain cosmic r hythms which also at certain points repeat themselves and revert to former modes, th e individual listening to the wisdom of the Buddha, unites his life with that of the cosmic mysteries. In esoteric training, there is question of four attributes wh ich must be acquired on the so- called probationary path for the attainment of higher knowledg e. The first is the faculty of discrimination in thoughts between trut h and mere semblance or opinion. The second attribute is the correct estimation of what is inwardly true and real, as against what is merely apparent. The third rests in the practi ce of the six qualities already mentioned in the preceding pages: [see above] thought-c ontrol, control of actions, perseverance, tolerance, faith and equanimity. The fourth attribute is the love of inner freedom. A mere intellectual understanding of what is in cluded in these attributes is of no value. They must become so incorporated into the so ul that they form the basis of inner habits. Consider, for instance, the first of these at tributes: the discrimina tion between truth and semblance. The student must so train himself that he qui te as a matter of course distinguishes, in everything that confronts him, between the non-essential elements and those that are significant and essential. He will only succeed in this if, in his observation of the outer world, he quietly and patiently ever and again repeats the attempt. And at the end he will naturally single out the essential and the true at a glance, whereas formerly the non- essential, too, could content him. ‘All things corruptible are but reflection’ - is a truth which becomes an unquestionable conviction of the soul. The same applies to the remaining three of the f our attributes mentioned. Now these four inner habits do actually pr oduce a transformation of the delicate human etheric body. By the first, discrimination betw een truth and semblan ce, the centre already described is formed in the head, and the cen tre in the region of the larynx prepared. The actual development of these centres is of course dependent on the exercises in concentration described above; th e latter develop, and the four attributes bring to fruition. Once the centre in the larynx has been prep ared, the free control of the etheric body and its enclosure within a network covering, as explained above, result from the correct estimation of what is true as against what is apparent and non-esse ntial. If the student acquires this faculty of estimation, the facts of the higher worlds will gradually become perceptible to him. But he must not think th at he has merely to perform actions which appear significant when judged by the standard of a mere intellectual estimate. The most trifling action, every little thing accomplishe d has something of importance in the great cosmic household. A correct estimation of the affairs of daily life is required, not an under-estimation of them. The six virtues of which the third attribute consists have already been dealt with; they are connected with the development of the 12-petalled lotus"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"in the region of the heart, and, as already indicated, it is to th is centre that the life-currents of the etheric body must be directed. The f ourth attribute, the longing for liberation, serves to bring to fruition the etheric or gan in the heart region . Once this attribute becomes an inner habit, the individual frees himself from everything which depends only upon the faculties of his own personal nature. He ceases to view things from his own separate standpoint, and the boundaries of his own narrow self fettering him to this point of view disappear. The secrets of the spiritua l world gain access to hi s inner self. This is liberation from those fetters which constrain the individual to regard things and beings in a manner corresponding to his own personal limit ations. It is from this personal manner of regarding things that the student must become liberated and free. It will be clear from the above that the in structions given in es oteric training exert a determining influence reaching the innermos t depths of human nature. Such are the instructions regarding the four qualities mentioned above. They can be found in one form or another in all the great religions. The f ounders of the great re ligions did not give mankind these teachings from some vague fee ling. They gave them for the good reason that they were great Initiates. Out of their knowledge did they shape their moral teachings. They knew how these would react upon the finer nature of men, and desired that their followers should gradually achieve th e development of this finer nature. To live in the sense of these great religions means to work for the attainment of personal spiritual perfection. Only by so doing can man become a servant of the world and of humanity. Self-perfection is by no means self-seeking; fo r the imperfect man is an imperfect servant of the world and of humanity. The more pe rfect a man is, the better does he serve the world. ‘If the rose adorns hers elf, she adorns the garden.’ The founders of the great religio ns are therefore the great Initiates. Their teaching flows into the soul of men, and t hus, with humanity, the whole world moves forward. Quite consciously did they work to further this evolutionary process of humanity. Their teachings can only be understood if it be remembered that they are the product of knowledge of the innermost depths of human na ture. The great Initiates knew, and it is out of their knowledge that they shaped the ideals of humanity. Yet man approaches these great leaders when he uplifts himself, in his own development, to their heights. A completely new life opens out before the st udent, when the development of his etheric body begins in the way described above, and at the proper time, in the course of his training, he must receive that enlightenment which enables him to adapt himself to this new existence. The 16-petalled lotus, for instance, enables him to perceive spiritual figures of a higher world. He must learn now how different these forms can be when caused by different objects or beings. In th e first place, he must notice that his own thoughts and feelings exert a powerful influe nce on certain of these figures, on others little or no influence. One kind of figure al ters immediately if the observer, upon seeing them, says to himself: ‘that is beautiful,’ and then in the course of his observation, changes this thought to: ‘that is useful.’ It is character istic of the forms proceeding from minerals or from artificial objects, that they change under the influence of every thought and every feeling directed upon them by the obser ver. This applies in a lesser degree to the forms belonging to plants, and still less to those corresponding to animals. These"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"figures, too, are full of life and motion, but th is motion is only partially due to the influence of human thoughts and feelings; in other respects it is produced by causes which are beyond human influence. Now there a ppears within this whole world a species of form which remains almost entirely unaff ected by human influence. The student can convince himself that these forms proceed neither from minerals, nor from artificial objects, nor, again, from plants or animals. To gain complete understanding, he must study those forms which he can realize to have proceeded from the feelings, instincts and passions of human beings. Yet he call find that these forms too are influenced by his own thoughts, if only to a relatively small extent . But there always remains a residuum of forms in this world upon which such influences are less and less effec tive. Indeed at the outset of his career, the student can perceive little beyond this residuum. He can only discover its nature by observing himself. He then l earns what forms he himself produces, for his will, his wishes and so on, are expressed in these forms. An instinct that dwells in him, a desire that f ills him, an intention that he harbours and so forth are all manifested in these forms; indeed his whole character displays itself in this world of forms. By his thoughts and feelings, he consciously can influence all forms not proceeding from himself; on the other hand he has no influe nce on those created unconsciously by his own being in the higher worlds once he has create d them. Now it follows from what has been said that, on this higher plane, man’s inner life of instincts, desires, ideas displays itself outwardly in exterior forms, just like all other beings and objects. For higher knowledge, the inner world appears as part of the outer wo rld. Just as though anyone in the physical world were surrounded by mirrors and could observe his physical body in that way; thus, too, in a higher wo rld, man’s inner being confronts him as a reflected image. At this stage of development, the student ha s reached the point when he can free himself from the illusion derived from the limitation of his personal self. He can now observe that inner self as the outer world, just as he hith erto regarded as oute r world everything that affected his senses. Thus he learns by gra dual experience to deal with himself just as hitherto he dealt with the beings around him. Were the student to obtain an insight in to these higher worlds without sufficient preparation regarding th eir nature, he would find himself confronted by the picture of his own soul as though by an enigma. There his own desires and passions confront him in animal or, more seldom, in human forms. It is true that the animal forms of this world are never quite similar to those of the physical wo rld, yet they possess a remote resemblance. Inexpert observers often take them to be identical. Now upon entering this world, an entirely new method of judgment must be acq uired. For apart from the fact that things actually pertaining to inner natu re appear as outer world, they also hear the character of mirrored reflections of what they really are. When, for instance, a number is perceived, it must be reversed, as a picture in a mirror; 265 would mean here in reality 562. A sphere is perceived as though from its centre. This i nner perception must then be translated. The"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"qualities of the soul appear likewise as in a mirror. A wish directed towards an outer object appears as a form moving towards th e person wishing. Passi ons residing in the lower part of human nature can assume an imal forms or similar shapes, that hurl themselves against the indivi dual. In reality, th ese passions are struggling outward; they seek satisfaction in the outer world, but this se arch in an outward direction appears in the mirrored reflection as an attack on th e individual from whom they proceed. If the student, before attaining insight into higher worlds, has lear nt by quiet and sincere self-observation to realize the qualities and defe cts of his own character, he will then, at the moment when his own inner self confront s him as a mirrored image, find strength and courage to conduct himself in the right way. Pe ople who have failed to test themselves in this way, and are insufficiently acquainted with their own inner self, will not recognize themselves in their own mirrored image, a nd will mistake it for a reality foreign to themselves. Or they may become alarmed at the vision, and, because they cannot endure the sight, deceive themselves into believing the whole thing is nothing but an illusion which cannot lead them anywhere. In e ither case the person in question, through prematurely attaining a certain stage of inner development, would himself fatally obstruct his own progress. It is absolutely necessary that the student should experience this aspect of his own inner self before progressing to higher spheres. Fo r he possesses in himsel f a psychic-spiritual element of which he is himself the best judg e. If he has thoroughly realized the nature of his own personality in the physic al world, and if the image of his personality first appears to him in a higher world, he is then able to compare the one with the other. He can refer the higher to something already known to him, so that his point of departure is on firm ground. Whereas, on the other hand, if ever so many other spiritual beings appeared to him, he would find himself unable to discove r their nature and qua lities, and would soon feel the ground giving way beneath him. Thus it cannot be too often repeated that the only safe entrance into the higher worlds is at the end of a path l eading through a genuine knowledge and estimate of one’s own nature. Pictures, then, of a spiritual kind, are first encountered by the student on his progress into higher worlds; and the reality to which thes e pictures correspond, is actually within himself. He should be far enough advanced to refrain from desiri ng reality of a more direct kind, at this initial stage, and regard these pictures as a ppropriate. He will soon meet something quite new within this world of pictures. His lower self is before him as a mirrored image; but from within this image there appears the true reality of his higher self. From out of the picture of his lowe r personality, the form of the spiritual Ego becomes visible. Then threads are spun from the latter to othe r and higher spiritual realities. This is the moment when the 2-petalled lotu s in the region of the eyes is required. If it now begins to stir, the student finds it possi ble to set his higher Ego in connection with higher spiritual beings. The currents from th is lotus flower flow towards the higher entities in such a way that the movements in question are fully appare nt to the individual."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Just as the light renders the physical objects visible, so, too, thes e currents disclose spiritual beings of higher worlds. Through inward application to the fundamental truths derived from Spiritual Science, the student learns to set in motion, and then to direct the currents proceeding from the lotus flower between the eyes. It is at this stage of development especi ally that the value of sound judgment, and a training in clear and logical thought, is proved. The higher se lf which hitherto slumbered unconsciously, in an embryonic state, is now bor n into conscious existe nce. This is not a figurative, but a positive birth in the spir itual world, and the being now born, the higher self, if it is to be capable of life, must enter that world w ith all the necessary organs and aptitudes. Just as Nature must provide for a child being born into the world with suitable eyes and ears, so, too, the laws of self-development must provide for the necessary qualities, with which the higher self can enter existence. These laws governing the development of the higher spiritual organs are none other than the laws of sound reason and morality of the physical world. The spiritual self matures in the physical self as a child in the mother’s womb. The constitution of the spiritual self is similarly conditioned by the laws of common intelligence and reason that govern physical life. No one can give birth to a soundly constituted higher self, whose life in thought and feeling, in the physical world, is not sound and healthy. Natural, rational life is the basis of all genuine spiritual development. Just as the child when still in the maternal womb, lives in accordance with natural forces to which it has access, after its birth, through its organs of sense, so, too, the human higher self lives in accordance with the laws of the spiritual world, even during physical existence. And even as the child, out of a dim life-instinct, acquires the requisite forces, so, too, can ma n acquire the powers of the spiritual world before his higher self is born. Indeed he must do this if the latter is to enter the world as a fully developed being. It would be quite wrong for anyone to say: ‘I cannot accept the teachings of Spiritual Science until I myse lf become a seer,’ for without inward application to the results of spiritual inve stigation, there is no chance whatever of attaining genuine higher knowledge. It would be as though a child, duri ng gestation, were to refuse the forces coming to it through its mother, and proposed to wait until it could create them for itself. Just as the child in its incipient feeling for life, learns to appreciate what is offered to it, so can the non-seer appr eciate the truth of the teachings of Spiritual Science. An insight into these teachings, base d on a deeply rooted feeling for truth, and a clear, sound, all-round critical and reasoning faculty, is possibl e, even before spiritual things are actually perceived. The esoteric know ledge must first be studied, so that this study becomes a preparation for clairvoyance. A person attaining clairvoyance without such preparation would resemble a child born with eyes and ears but without a brain. The entire world of sound and colour would disp lay itself before him, but he would be helpless in it. At this stage of his esoteric development, the student realizes, through personal inward experience, all that had previously appealed to his sense of truth, to his intellect and reason. He has now direct knowledge of his highe r self. He learns how his higher self is connected with exalted spiritual beings, and forms with them a united whole. He sees"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"how the lower self originates in a higher wo rld, and it is revealed to him how his higher nature outlasts his lower. He can now disti nguish the imperishable in himself from the perishable; that is, he learns, through persona l insight, to understand the doctrine of the incarnation of the higher self in the lower. It will become plain to him that he is involved in a great spiritual complex, and that his quali ties and destiny are due to this connection. He learns to recognize the law of his life, his Karma. He r ealizes that his lower self, constituting his present existe nce, is only one of the form s which his higher being can adopt. He discerns the possibility of worki ng down from his higher self on to his lower self, so that he may perfect himself ever more and more. Now, too, he can rightly distinguish the great differences between hu man beings, in regard to their level of perfection. He becomes aware that there ar e others above him, who have already traversed the stages which still lie before hi m, and he realizes that the teachings and deeds of such men proceed from the insp iration of a higher world. He owes this knowledge to his first glimpse into this hi gher world. The so-called great Initiates of humanity now become vested with reality fo r him. These, then, are the gifts which the student owes to his development at this stage: insight into his higher self; insight into the doctrine of the incarnation of this higher be ing into a lower; insight into the laws by which life in the physical world is regulated acco rding to its spiritual connections, that is, the law of Karma; and finally, insight into the existence of the great Initiates. Thus it is said of a student who has reached this stage, that all doubt has vanished from him. His former faith, based on reason and sound thought, is now replaced by knowledge and insight which nothing can undermine. The va rious religious cults have presented, in their ceremonies, sacraments, and rites, extern ally visible pictures of the higher spiritual beings and events. None but those who have not penetrated to the depths of the great religious cults, can fail to recognize this fact. Personal insight into spiritual reality explains the great significance of these external ly visible cults. Religious service, then, becomes for the seer an image of his own co mmunion with the highe r, spiritual world. It has been shown how the student, by attain ing this stage, becomes, in truth, a new being. He can now mature to st ill higher faculties, and, by means of the life-currents of his etheric body, control the hi gher and actual life-element, t hus attaining independence, to a high degree, from the rest rictions of the physical body. THE TRANSFORMATION OF DREAM LIFE An intimation that the student has reached or will soon reach the stage of development described in the preceding ch apter, will he found in the change which comes over his dream life. His dreams, hitherto confused and haphazard, now begin to assume a more regular character. Their pictures begin to su cceed each other in se nsible connection, like the thoughts and ideas of daily life. He can discern in them law, cause and effect. The content, too, of his dreams is changed. While hitherto he discerned only reminiscences of daily life, and transformed impressions of his surroundings or of his physical condition, there now appear before him pictures of a world he has hitherto not known. At first the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"general character of his dream life rema ins unchanged, in so far as dreams are distinguished from waking mental activity by th e symbolical presentation of what they wish to express. No attentive observer of dream life can fail to detect this characteristic. For instance, one may dream that one has caught some horrible creatu re, and one feels an unpleasant sensation in one’s hand. One wakes to discover that one is tightly grasping a corner of the blanket. The truth is not pr esented to the mind, except through the medium of a symbolical image. One may dream that one is flying from some pursuer, and is stricken with fear. On waking, one finds th at one has been suffering, during sleep, from palpitations of the heart. Di squieting dreams can also be traced to indigestible food. Occurrences in the immediate vicinity may also reflect themselves symbolically in dreams. The striking of a clock may evoke the picture of a troop of soldiers marching by to the beat of their drums. A falling chair may be the occasion of a whole dream drama, in which the sound of the fall is reproduced as the report of a gun, and so forth. The more regulated dreams of esoteric students w hose etheric body has begun its development, retain this symbolical method of expression, but they will cease merely to reflect reality connected with the physical body and physical environment. As the dreams due to the latter causes become more connected, they ar e mingled with similar pictures expressing things and events of another world. These ar e the first experiences lying beyond the range of waking consciousness. Yet no true mystic will ever make his experiences in dreams the basis of any authoritativ e account of a higher world. Su ch dreams must be merely considered as providing the fi rst hint of a higher development. Very soon, and as a further result, the student’s dreams will no l onger remain beyond the reach of intellectual guidance, as heretofore, but, on the contrar y, will be intellectua lly controlled and supervised, like the impressions and c onceptions of waking consciousness. The difference between dream and waking consciou sness grows ever smaller. The dreamer remains awake, in the fullest sense of the wor d, during his dream life; that is, he is aware of his mastery and control over his own vivid mental activity. During our dreams we are actually in a world other than that of our senses; but, with undeveloped spiritual organs, we can form none other than the confused conceptions of it described above. It is only in so far present for us, as, for instance, the world of sense could be for a being equipped with no more than rudimentary eyes. That is why we can see nothing in this world but counterfeits and reflections of daily life. The latter are perceptible to us because our own soul paints its daily experiences in pictorial form into the substance of which that other world cons ists. It must be clearly understood that in addition to our ordinary conscious work-a-day life, we lead a second unconscious life in that other world. We engrave in it all our t houghts and perceptions. These tracings only become visible when the lotus flowers are developed. Now in every human being there are certain beginnings of these lotus flower s. We cannot perceive with them during waking consciousness because the impressions made on them are very faint. We cannot see the stars during the daytime for a simila r reason. Their visibility is extinguished by the mighty glare of the sun. Thus, too, the faint impressions from the spiritual world cannot make themselves felt in the face of th e powerful impressions received through the senses."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Now when the gate of the senses is closed during sleep, these other impressions begin to emerge confusedly, and the dreamer become s aware of experiences in another world. But, as already explained, these experiences cons ist, at first, merely of pictures engraved in the spiritual world by our mental activity attached to the physical senses. Only developed lotus flowers make it possible for ma nifestations not deri ved from the physical world to be imprinted in the same way. And then the etheric body, when developed, brings full knowledge concerning these engrav ed impressions derived from other worlds. This is the beginning of life and activity in a new world, and, at this point, esoteric training must set the student a tw ofold task. To begin with, he must learn to take stock of everything he observes in his dreams, exact ly as though he were awake. Then, if successful in this, he is led to make th e same observations during ordinary waking consciousness. He will so train his attent ion and receptivity for these spiritual impressions, that they need no longer vanish in the face of the physical impressions, but will always be at hand for him, and reach him in addition to the others. When the student has acquired this faculty, there arises before his spiritual eyes something of the picture described in the preceding chapter, a nd he can henceforth discern all that the spiritual world contains as the cause of the physical world. Above all things he can perceive and gain knowledge of his own higher self in this world. The next task now confronting him is to grow, as it were , into this higher self, that is, really to regard it as his own true self and act accordingly. He real izes ever more clearly and intensely that his physical body, and what he hitherto called his ‘I’ are merely the instruments of his higher self. He adopts an attitude towards his lower self, such as a person, limited to the world of the senses, adopt s towards some instrument or vehicle that serves him. No one includes as part of himsel f the vehicle in which he is travelling, even though he says: ‘I travel’; so, too, when an inwardly developed person says: ‘I go through the door,’ his actual concepti on is ‘I carry my body through the door.’ Only this must become a natural habit with him, so that he never for a moment loses his firm footing in the physical world or feels estranged from it. If the student is to avoid becoming a fantastic visionary, he must not impoverish his life through his hi gher consciousness, but on the contrary, enrich it, as a person en riches his life by using the railway and not merely his legs to cover a certain distance. When the student has thus raised himself to a life in the higher E go, or rather during his acquisition of the higher conscious ness, he will learn how to stir to life the spiritual perceptive force in the organ of the heart, a nd control it through the currents described in the foregoing chapter. This perceptive force is an element of higher substantiality, which proceeds from the organ in question, and flows with beautiful radiance through the moving lotus flowers and the other channels of the developed etheric body. Thence it radiates outward into the surr ounding spiritual world, rendering it spiritually visible, just as the sunlight falling on th e objects of the physical wo rld, renders them visible. How this perceptive force in the heart orga n is created, can only be gradually understood in the course of actual development."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"It is only when this organ of perception can be sent through the et heric body and into the outer world, to illumine it, that the actual spiritual world, as composed of objects and beings, call be clearly perceived. Thus it will be seen that complete consciousness of an object in the spiritual world is only possibl e when man himself casts upon it the spiritual light. Now the Ego which creates this organ of perception does not dwell within, but outside the physical body, as already shown. The heart organ is only the spot where the individual kindles, from wit hout, this spiritual light or gan. Were the latter kindled elsewhere, the spiritual perceptions produced by it would have no connection with the physical world. But all higher spir itual realities must be relate d to the physical world, and man himself must act as a channel for them to flow into it. It is precisely through the heart organ that the higher Ego governs the physical self, making it into his instrument. Now the esoterically developed person feels di fferently towards the things of the spiritual world, than the undeveloped feel s to the things of the physi cal world. The latter feels himself to be at a particular place in the worl d of sense, and the surrounding objects to be external to him. The spiritually developed pe rson feels himself to be united with, and as though in the interior of the sp iritual objects he perceives. He wanders, in fact, from place to place, and is therefore called the ‘Wandere r’, in the language of occult science. Should he, however, remain a mere wanderer, he would be unable to de fine any object in spiritual space. Just as objects and places in physical space are define d from a fixed point of departure, this, too, must be the case in the other world. He must seek out some place, thoroughly investigate it, and take it spirit ually in possession. In this place he must establish his spiritual home, and relate everythi ng else to it. In phys ical life, too, a person sees everything in terms of his physical home. Natives of Berlin and Paris will involuntarily describe London in a different way. And yet there is a difference between the spiritual and the physical home. We are bor n into the latter w ithout our co-operation, and instinctively absorb, during our childhood, a number of ideas, by which everything is henceforth involuntarily coloured. The student , however, himself founds his own spiritual home, in full consciousness. His judgment, th erefore, based on this spiritual home, is formed in full unhampered freedom. This f ounding of a spiritual home is called in the language of occult science, ‘the building of the hut’. Spiritual vision, at this stage, extends to th e spiritual counterparts of the physical world, so far as these exist in the so-called astral world. There ev erything is found which, in its nature, is similar to human instincts, feeli ngs, desires and passions. For powers related to all these human characteristics, are associated with all phys ical objects. A crystal, for instance, is cast in its form by powers which, seen from a higher standpoint, appear as an active human impulse. Similar forces drive the sap through the vessels of the plant, cause the blossoms to unfold and the seed-vessels to burst. To developed spiritual organs of perception, all these forces appear gifted with form and colour, just as the objects of the physical world have form and colour for physical eyes. At this stage in his development, the student sees not only the crystal and the plant, but also the above spiritual forces. Animal and human impulses are perceptib le to him not only through their physical manifestation in the individual, but directly as objects, as he sees tables and chairs in the physical world. The whole range of instinct, impulse, desire and passion, both of an"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"animal and a human being, constitute the as tral cloud or aura, in which the being is enveloped. Furthermore, the clairvoyant can, at this st age, perceive things which are almost or entirely withheld from the senses. He can, fo r instance, tell the astral difference between a room full of lower- or of higher-minded people. Not only the physical but also the spiritual atmosphere of a hospital differs from that of a ballroom. A commercial town has a different astral air from that of a university town. In the initial st ages of clairvoyance, this perceptive faculty is but weakly developed; its relation to the objects in question is similar to the relation of dream-consciousness to waking consciousness, in ordinary life; it will, however, become fully awakened also at this stage. The highest achievement of a clairvoyant who has attained the degree of visioI1 described above, is when the astral counter -effects of animal and human impulses and passions are revealed to him. A loving action is accompanied by quite a different astral picture from one inspired by hate. Unbridle d desire gives rise to an ugly astral counterpart, while a feeling evoked by a high idea l creates a counterpart that is beautiful. These astral counterparts ar e but faintly perceptible dur ing the physical life of an individual, for their strength is diminished by life in the physical wo rld. The desire for an object produces an equivalent im age displaying itself as this very desire in the astral world. If, however, the object be attained and the desire satisfied, or if, at any rate, the possibility of satisfaction is forthcoming, the corresponding image will show but faintly. It only attains its rightful state after the d eath of the individual, when thle soul, in accordance with its nature, still harbours such desires, but can no longer satisfy them, because the object and the physical organ ar e both lacking. The gourmand, for instance, will still retain, after death, the desire to please his palate; but there is no possibility of satisfying this desire because he no longer has a palate. As a result, the desire produces an especially powerful counterpart, by which the soul is tormente d. These experiences evoked by the images of the lower soul-natur e after death, are calle d the experiences in the soul-world, especially in the region of de sires. They only vanish when the soul has purified itself from all desi res tending to the physical wo rld. Then only does the soul mount to the higher regions, to the world of spirit. Even though th ese images are faint during life in the physical world, they are none the less present, following the individual as his world of desire, in the way a comet is followed by its tail. They can be seen by a clairvoyant at the requisite stage of development. Such and similar experiences fill the life of the student during the period described above. He cannot attain higher spiritual experience at this stage of development, but must climb still higher from this point. THE CONTINUITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS Human life runs its course in three altern ating states or conditions, namely, waking, dreaming sleep and dreamless sleep. The attain ment of the higher knowledge of spiritual"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"worlds can be readily understood, if a concepti on be formed of the changes occurring in these three conditions, as e xperienced by the individual s eeking such higher knowledge. When no training has been undertaken to atta in this knowledge, human consciousness is continually interrupted by the restful interval s of sleep. During thes e intervals the soul knows nothing of the outer world and equally li ttle of itself. Only at certain periods, dreams emerge from the deep ocean of insens ibility, dreams linked to the occurrences of the outer world or the conditions of the phys ical body. At first, dreams are only regarded as a particular manifestation of sleep-life, and thus only two states are generally spoken of, namely, sleeping and waking. For Spiritu al Science, however, dreams have an independent significance, apart from the othe r two conditions. In the foregoing chapter, a description was given of the alteration en suing in the dream life of the individual undertaking the ascent to higher knowledge. Hi s dreams lose their m eaningless, irregular and disconnected character, and form themse lves, ever more, into a world of law and order, With continued development, not only does this new world born out of the dream world, come to be in no way inferior to outer physical reality, as re gards its inner truth, but facts are seen to reveal themselves in it, representing a higher reality in the fullest sense of the word. Mysteries and riddles lie concealed everywhere in the physical world. In the latter, the effects are s een of certain higher facts, but no one can penetrate to the causes, whose perception is confined merely to his senses. These causes are partly revealed to the student, in the above condi tion developed out of dream life -a condition, however, at which he by no means remains st ationary. Yet he must not regard these revelations as actual knowledge, so long as the same things do not also reveal themselves during ordinary waking life. In time he devel ops this faculty of ca rrying over into waking consciousness the condition he created for hims elf out of dream life. Thus something new is introduced into the world of his senses, to enrich it. Just as a person born blind and successfully operated upon, will recognize the surrounding objects to be enriched by all that the eye perceives, so, too, will anyone having become clairvoyant in the above manner, perceive the whole world surrounding him, peopled with new qualities, things, beings and so forth. He now need no longer wa it for his dreams to live in another world, but he can at any suitable moment put hi mself into the above condition, for the purpose of higher perception. This c ondition then acquires a similar significance for him as, in ordinary life, the perception of things with active senses as opposed to inactive senses. It can truly be said that the st udent opens the eyes of his s oul, and beholds things which necessarily remain concealed from the bodily senses. Now this condition is only transitional to sti ll higher stages of knowledge. If the student continues his esoteric exercises, he will fi nd, in due time, that the radical change, as described above, does not confine itself to his dream life, but that this transformation also extends to what was previously a condition of deep dreamless sleep. Isolated conscious experiences begin to interrupt the complete in sensibility of this deep sleep. Perceptions previously unknown to him, emerge from the pe rvading darkness of sleep. It is, of course, not easy to describe these perceptions, for our language is only ad apted to the physical world, and therefore only approximate terms can be found to express what does not at all belong to that world. Still such terms must be used to describe the higher worlds, and it is only possible by the free use of simile; yet s eeing that everything in the world is inter- related, the attempt may be made. The things and beings of the higher worlds are closely"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"enough related to those of the physical world, that, with a little goodwill, some sort of conception of these higher worlds can be formed, even though words suitable for the physical world are used. Only the reader must always bear in mind that such descriptions of supersensible worlds must, to a large extent , be in the nature of simile and symbol. The words of ordinary language are only partially adopted in the course of esoteric training; for the rest, the student learns another sym bolical language, as a natural outcome of his ascent to higher worlds. The knowledge of this language is acquired during training itself, but that is no reason why something concerni ng the higher worlds s hould not be learned, even from such ordinary desc riptions as those here given. Some idea can be given of those experiences , which emerge from the insensibility of deep sleep, if they be compared to a kind of hearing. We may speak of audible tones and words. While the experiences during dreaming sleep may fitly be designated as a kind of vision, the facts observed during deep sleep ma y be compared to auditive impressions. (It should be remarked in passing, that for the spiritual world, too, the faculty of sight remains the higher. There, too, colours are higher than sounds and words. The student’s first perceptions in this world do not yet ex tend to the higher col ours, but only to the lower tones. Only because man, according to his general development, is already more qualified for the world revealing itself in dr eaming sleep, does he straightaway perceive colours there. He is less qualified for th e higher world unveiling its elf in deep sleep; therefore the first revelations of it he receives are in tone s and words; later on he can here, too, ascend to colours a nd forms.) Now when these experiences during deep sleep first come to the notice of the student, his next task must be to make them as clear and vivid as possible. At first, this presen ts great difficulty, the perception of these experiences being exceedingly slight. The student knows very well, on waking, that he has had an experience, but is completely in the dark as regards its nature. The most important thing during this initial stage, is to remain quiet and composed, and not for a moment lapse into any unrest or impatien ce. The latter is under all circumstances detrimental; it can never accelerate developmen t, but only delays it. The student must cultivate a quiet and yielding receptivity for the gift that is presented to him; all violence must be repressed. Should he, at any peri od, cease to become aware of experiences during sleep he must wait patiently until this is again possible. Some day, this moment will assuredly arrive. And this perceptiv e faculty, if awaited with patience and composure, remains a secure possession; while, should it ap pear momentarily in answer to forcible methods, it may be co mpletely lost for a long time. Once this perceptive faculty is acquired, and the experiences during sleep are present to the student’s consciousness in complete luci dity and clarity, his attention should be directed to the following point . All these experiences are se en to consist of two kinds, which can be clearly distinguished. The first kind will be totally fore ign to anything that he has ever experienced. These experiences wi ll be a source of joy and edification, but they should be left to themselves for the time being. They are the first harbinger of higher spiritual worlds in which the student will find his way later on. In the second kind of experiences, the attentive observer will discove r a certain relationship with the ordinary world in which he lives. The s ubjects of his reflections duri ng life, what he would like to understand in these things around him, but cannot understand with the ordinary intellect,"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"these are the things concerning which the e xperiences during sleep give him information. During everyday life, man reflects on his e nvironment; his mind trie s to conceive and understand the connection existing between things ; he seeks to grasp in thought and idea what his senses perceive. It is to these id eas and conceptions that the experiences during sleep refer. Obscure, shadowy concepts become sonorous and living, in a way comparable only to the tones and the words of the physical world. It seems to the student ever more and more, as though the solution of the riddles over wh ich he ponders, is whispered to him in tones and words from out of a higher world. And he is able to connect with ordinary life wh atever comes to him from out of a higher world. What was formerly only accessible to his thought, now becomes actual experience, as living and substantial as ever an experi ence in this physical world can be. The things and beings of this physical world are by no means only what they appear to be for physical perception. They are the expression and effluence of a sp iritual world. This spiritual world, hitherto concealed from the student, now resounds for hi m, out of his whole environment. It is easy to see that this higher perceptive faculty can only prove a blessing, if the soul-senses that are opened, are in perfect order, just as the ordinary senses can only be used for a true observation of the world if their equipm ent is regular and normal. Now man himself forms these higher senses through the exercise s indicated by Spiritual Science. The latter include concentration, in which the attention is directed to certain definite ideas and conceptions connected with the secrets of th e universe; and meditation, which is a life in such ideas, a complete submersion in them in the right way. By concentration and meditation, the student works upon his soul, a nd develops within it the soul-organs of perception. While thus applying himself to th e task of concentra tion and meditation, his soul grows within his body just as the em bryo child grows in the body of the mother. When the isolated experiences during sleep begin, as described, the moment of birth is approaching for the liberated soul; for it has literally become a new being, developed by the individual within himself, from seed to fruit. The effort required for concentration and meditation, must therefore be carefully and accu rately maintained, for it contains the laws governing the germination and fruition of the higher human soul-being. The latter must appear at its birth as a harmonious, well propor tioned organism, yet, through an error in the instructions, no such normal being will come to existence in the spiritual spheres, but an abortion incapable of life. That this higher soul-being should be born during deep sleep, will be easily grasped, for if that de licate organism chanced to appear during physical everyday life, it could not prevail against the harsh and powerful processes of this life. Its activity would be of no acc ount against that of the body. During sleep, however, when the body rests, in so far as its activity is depende nt on sense perception, then the activity of the higher soul, at first so delicate and inconspicuous, can come into evidence. Here again, the student must bear in mind that these experiences during sleep may not be regarded as fully valid knowledge, so long as he is not in a position to carry over his awakened soul into waking consciousne ss as well. The acquisition of this faculty will enable him to perceive the spiritual world, in its ow n character, among and between the experiences of the day; that is, the hidden secrets of his environment will be conveyed to him as tones and words. Now the student must realize, at this stage of development, that he is dealing with separate and more or less is olated spiritual experiences. He should therefore beware of"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"constructing out of them a complete whole or even a connected system of knowledge. In this case, all manner of fantastic ideas and conceptions would be mixed into the soul- world, and a world might thus ea sily be constructed which ha d nothing to do with the real spiritual world. The student must continually pr actise self-control. The right thing to do is to strive for an ever clearer conception of the isolated real experiences, and to, await the spontaneous arrival of new experiences whic h will connect themselves, as though of their own accord, with those already recorded. By vi rtue of the power of the spiritual world into which he has now found his way, and through continued a pplication to the prescribed exercises, the student experiences an ever increasing ex tension and expansion of consciousness during sleep. The unconscious intervals during sleep-life grow ever smaller, while more and more experiences emerge from erstwhile insensibility. These experiences thus link themselves together, mo re of their own accord, without this true unity being disturbed by all manner of combin ations and inferences, which, in any case, would only originate in an in tellect accustomed to the phys ical world. Yet the less the habits of thought acquired in the physical world are allowe d to play into these higher experiences the better it is. By thus conducting himself, the student approach es ever nearer to the attainment of that condition, on his path to hi gher knowledge, when the uncons ciousness of sleep-life is transformed into complete consciousness. Wh en his body rests, the individual lives in surroundings which are just as r eal as those in his waking dail y life. It is needless to say that the reality referred to during sleep, is different from physical reality surrounding the physical body. The student learns - indeed he must learn - if he is to retain a firm footing in the physical world and not become a vision ary, to connect the higher experiences of sleep with his physical environment. At first, however, the world entered during sleep is a completely new revelation. This important st age of development, at which consciousness is retained in life during sl eep, is known in Spiritual Sc ience as the ‘continuity of consciousness’. The condition here indicated is regarded, at a certain stage of development, as a kind of ideal, attainable at the end of a long path. What the student first learns is the extension of c onsciousness into two soul-states, in the first of which, only disordered dreams were previously possibl e, and in the second, only unconscious dreamless sleep. Anyone having reached this stage of development does not cease experiencing and learning, during those interv als when the physical body rests, and when the soul receives no impressions thro ugh the instrumentality of the senses. THE PARTITION OF HUMAN PERSONALITY DURING SPIRITUAL TRAINING During sleep no impressions are conveyed to the human soul through the mediumship of the sense-organs. The perceptions of the ordi nary outer world do not find their way to the soul, when in that condition. In certain respects , the soul is actually outside that part of the human being - the so-calle d physical body - which, in waki ng life, is the medium for sense perceptions and thought. The soul is then only connected with the finer bodies (the etheric body and the astral body) , which are beyond the scope of the physical senses. But"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"the activity of these finer bodi es does not cease during sleep. Ju st as the physical body is connected with the things and beings of the physical world, affecting them and being affected by them, so, too, does the soul live in a higher world; only this life of the soul continues also during sleep. The soul is in full activity during sl eep, only we can know nothing of this activity so long as we have no spiritual organs of perception, through which to observe what is going on around us and see what we ourselves are doing, during sleep, as we observe our daily physical e nvironment with our or dinary senses. The preceding chapters have shown how esoteric tr aining consists in the development of such spiritual sense organs. Now if, as a result of esoteric training, th e student’s life during sleep be transformed in the manner described in the foregoing chapter, he will be able consciously to follow everythi ng going on around him, when in that condition. He can, at will, find his way in his environment as he coul d when awake, with his ordinary senses. It should here be noted that a higher degree of clairvoyance is required for the higher perception of ordinary physical environment. Th is was indicated in the last chapter. In the initial stages of his developm ent, the student perceives thi ngs pertaining to another world without being able to discer n their connection with the obj ects of his daily physical environment. These characteristics of life during sleep or in dreams, illustrate what is continually taking place in the human being. The soul lives in uninterrupted act ivity in the higher worlds, even gathering from them the im pulse to act upon the physical body. Man is ordinarily unconscious of his higher life; the esoteric studen t renders himself conscious of it, and thereby his whole life becomes transf ormed. The soul, while still incapable of higher sight in the higher worlds, is guided by su perior cosmic beings. And just as the life of a person born blind becomes transforme d, through a successful operation, from its previous state of dependence on a guide, so too does the life of a person become transformed through esoteric training. [foot note: See p. 158 and Editorial Preface.] He outgrows leadership and must henceforward himself undertake to be his own guide. The moment this occurs, he is, of course, lia ble to errors totally unknown to ordinary consciousness. He acts now from a world, from which, formerly, higher powers unknown to himself, influenced him. These higher powers are disposed by the universal cosmic harmony. The student withdraws from this cosmic harmony, and must now himself accomplish things which were hitherto done for him without his co-operation. It is for this reason that so much is found in books dealing with these matters, concerning the dangers connected with the ascent into higher worlds. The descriptions sometimes given of these dangers may well make timid s ouls shudder at the prospect of this higher life. Yet the fact is that dangers only aris e when the necessary precautions are neglected. If all the measures counselled by true esoteric science are ad opted, the ascent will indeed ensue through experiences su rpassing in power and magnitude everything the boldest flights of sense-bound fantasy ca n picture; and yet there can be no question of injury to health or life. The student meets with horribl e powers threatening lif e at every turn and from every side. It will even be possible for hi m to make use of certain forces and beings existing beyond physical perception, and the temp tation is great to control these forces for the furtherance of personal and forbidden interests, or to employ them wrongly out of a deficient knowledge of th e higher worlds. Some of th ese especially important"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"experiences (e.g. the meeting with the Guardian of the Threshold) will be described in the following chapters. Yet we must realize that the hostile powers are none the less present, even though we know nothing of them. It is true that in this case their relation to man is ordained by higher powers, and that this rela tion alters when the individual consciously enters this world hitherto concealed from hi m. But at the same time his own existence is enhanced, and the circle of his life enriched by a great and new field of experience. A real danger can only arise if the student, through im patience or arrogance, assumes too early a certain independence with regard to the experi ence of the higher worlds, or if he cannot wait to gain really sufficient insight into the supersensible laws. In these spheres, modesty and humility are far less empty words than in ordinary life. If the student possesses these qualities in the ve ry best sense, he may be cer tain that his ascent into the higher life will be achieved without danger to a ll that is implied by health and life. Above all things, no disharmony must ensue between the higher experiences and the events and demands of everyday life. Man’s task must be sought on this eart h, and anyone desiring to shirk his tasks on this earth and to escape into another world may be certain he will never reach his goal. Yet what th e senses perceive is only part of the world. In the spirit, beings live, expressing themselves in th e facts of the physical world. Man must participate in the spirit, in order to carry its revelations into the physical world. He transforms the earth by implanting in it what he has ascertained in the spiritual world. That is his task. It is only because the phys ical world is dependent upon the spiritual, and because man can only work upon earth, in a true sense, if he is a pa rticipator in those worlds in which the creative forces lie con cealed - only for these re asons should he have the will to ascend to the higher worlds. No one approaching esoteric training with these sentiments and resolved not to deviate for a moment from these prescribed directions, will have the slightest danger to fear. No one should allow the prospect of these dangers to keep him from esoteric training; it shoul d rather act as a str ong challenge to one and all, to acquire those faculties which ev ery true esoteric student must have. After these preliminary observations to dispel any element of terro r, a description of some of the so-called dangers will he given. It is true that great cha nges take place in the students’ finer bodies, as de scribed above. These changes are connected with certain processes in the development of the three fundamental forces of the soul, with willing, feeling and thinking. Before es oteric training, these forces are subjected to a connection ordained by higher cosmic laws. Man’s willi ng, feeling and thinking are not arbitrary. A particular idea arising in the mind, is attended by a particular feeling, according to natural laws; or is followed by a resolution of the w ill, in equally natural sequence. We enter a room, find it stuffy, and open the window. We hear our name called, and follow the call. We are questioned, and we answer. We percei ve an ill-smelling obj ect and experience a feeling of disgust. These are simple connec tions between thinking, feeling and willing. When we survey human life we find that ev erything is built up on such connections. Indeed life is not qualified as normal, unl ess such a connection, founded on the laws of human nature, is observed between thinki ng, feeling and willing. It would be found contrary to these laws if th e sight of an ill-smelling object gave anyone pleasure, or if anyone, on being questioned, did not answer . The success anticipated from a right education or a fitting instru ction, is based upon the presumption that a connection between thinking, feeling and w illing, corresponding to human nature, can be established"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"in the pupil. Certain ideas are conveyed to him, on the supposition that they will be associated, in regular fashion, w ith his feelings and volitions. A ll this arises from the fact that in the finer soul-vehicle s of man, the central points of the three forces - thinking, feeling and willing - are connected in a defi nitely regular way. This connection in the finer soul organism has its counterpart in the coarser physical body. In the latter, too, the organs of will are connected in a regular way with those of thinking and feeling. A particular thought regularly evokes a feeling or an activity of will. In the course of higher development, the threads inte r-connecting the three fundament al forces, are severed. At first this severance occurs only within the fi ner soul organism; but at a still higher stage the separation extends also to the physical body. It is a fact that in higher spiritual development, the brain divides into three separate parts. Th is separation is not physically perceptible in the ordinary way, nor can it be demonstrated by the keenest instruments. Yet it occurs, and the clairvoyant has means of observing it. The brain of the higher clairvoyant divides into three independently active beings: the thought-brain, the feeling- brain and the will-brain. Thus the organs of thinking, feeling and w illing become individualized; their connection henceforth is not maintained by laws inherent in themselves, but must be managed by the awakened higher consciousness of the indivi dual. This then is the change which the student observes coming over himself: namely that no connection ensues between an idea and a feeling or a will-impulse, unless he himself provides one. No impulse urges him from thought to action unless he himself in fr eedom gives rise to this impulse. He can henceforth confront, devoid of feeling, a fact which, before hi s training, would have filled him with glowing love or bitt er hatred; and he can remain impassive at a thought which, formerly, would have spurred him on to acti on, as though of its own accord. By an effort of the will he can perform actions, for which not the slightest provocation can be detected by anyone not having undergone es oteric training. The student’s great achievement is the attainment of complete mastery over the combined activity of the three soul-forces; but at the same time the responsibility for this ac tivity is placed entirely in his own hands. It is only through the transfor mation of his being that the student can enter consciously into relation with certain supersensible for ces and beings. For hi s own soul-forces are related to certain fundamental forces of the wo rld. The force, for instance, inherent in the will, can affect definite things and beings of the higher worlds, and also perceive them; but it can only do so when liberated from its connection with thinking, feeling and willing within the soul. The moment this connection is severed, the activity of the will can be exteriorized. The same applies to the forces of thinking and feeling. A feeling of hatred sent out by a person is visibl e to the clairvoyant as a fi ne luminous cloud of special colouring; and the clairvoyant can ward off th is feeling of hatred, just as an ordinary person wards off a physical blow that is aimed at him. In the supersensible world, hatred becomes a visible phenomenon, but the clairvoyant can only perceive it in so far as he can project the force inherent in his feeling, just as the or dinary person directs outwards the receptive faculty of his eye. And what is said of hatred applies to far more important facts of the physical world. The student can en ter into conscious in tercourse with them, thanks to the liberation of the fundamental forces of his soul."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Through the separation of the forces of thi nking, feeling and willing, the possibility of a threefold error arises for anyone neglecting the injunctions given by esoteric science. Such an error can occur, if the connecting threads ar e severed before the higher consciousness is sufficiently advanced to hol d the reins and guide properly the separated forces into free and harmoniously combined act ivity. For, as a rule, the three human soul- forces are not equally advanced in their develo pment, at any given period of life. In one person, thinking is ahead of feeling and willing; in a s econd, a different soul-force has the upper hand over its companions. So long as th e connection between the soul-forces is maintained as established by higher cosmic laws, no injurious irregularity, in a higher sense, can ensue, through the predominance of one force or another. Predominating will, for instance, is prevented by the levelling infl uence of thinking and feeling from lapsing into special excesses. When, however, a pe rson of such predominating will undertakes esoteric training, feeling and thinking cease to exert their regular infl uence on the will, as it presses on unchecked, to gr eat exertions of power. If, th en, such a person is not sufficiently advanced to control completely the higher consciousness, and himself restore harmony, the will pursues its own unbridled wa y, continually overpowering its possessor. Feeling and thought lapse into complete im potence; the individual is scourged by his overmastering will. A violent na ture is the result, rushing from one unbridled action to another. A second deviation ensues when feeling unduly shakes off its proper control. A person inclining to the reverence of others, may th en diverge into unlimited dependence, to the extent of losing every personal will and t hought. Instead of higher knowledge, the most pitiful vacuity and feebleness would become the lot of such a person. The third evil is found when thought predominat es, resulting in a c ontemplative nature hostile to life and enclosed within itself. The world, for such people, has no further importance save that it provides them with obj ects for satisfying their boundless thirst for wisdom. So thought ever moves them to an ac tion or a feeling. They appear everywhere as cold and apathetic creatures. They fly from every contact with the things of ordinary life, as though from something which excite d their aversion, or wh ich, at any rate, had lost all meaning for them. These are the three ways of error into which the student can stray: exuberant violence of will, sentimental emotionalism, and cold loveless struggle for wisdom. For outward observation, and also from the ordinary (mat erialistic) medical st andpoint, anyone thus gone astray, is hardly distinguish able (especially in degree), fr om an insane, or, at least, a highly neurasthenic person. Of course the student must not resemble th ese. It is essential for him that the three fundamental soul-for ces, thinking, feeling a nd willing, should have undergone harmonious development before being released from their inherent connection, and subordinated to the awakened higher consciousness. For once a mistake is made, and one of the soul-forces falls a pr ey to unbridled excess, the higher soul comes into existence as a thing misborn. The unrestr ained force pervades the individual’s entire personality, and for a long time there can be no question of the balance being restored. What appears a harmless characteristic, so long as its possessor is without esoteric"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"training, namely, a predominance of thinking or feeling or willing - is so heightened that the universally human element, indisp ensable for life, becomes obscured. A really serious danger cannot threaten the st udent until he has attained the faculty of including in his waking consciousness the e xperiences forthcoming during sleep. So long as there is only question of the illumination of the intervals of sleep, the life of the senses, regulated by universal cosmic laws, reacts, during the waking hours, on the disturbed equilibrium of the soul, tending to restore the balance. That is why it is so essential that the waking life of the student should be, in every respect, regular and healthy. The more capable he is of meeting the demands made by the outer world upon a healthy, sound constitution of body, soul and spirit, the better it is for him. On the other hand it may be very bad for him if his ordinary waking life affects him in an exciting or irritating way, that is, if destructive or hampering infuences of outer life affect him in addition to the great changes taking place in his inner self. He must seek to find everything corresponding to his powers and faculties, which can lead him into undisturbed, harmonious communion with his surroundings, while avoiding everything detrimental to this harmony - everything that brings unrest a nd feverish haste into his life. And here it is not so much a question of casting off this unres t and haste in an exte rnal sense, but much more of taking care that thoughts, feelings, intentions and bo dily health are not thereby exposed to continual fluctuation. All this is not so easy for the stude nt to accomplish as it was before esoteric training, for the higher ex periences henceforth playing into his life react upon his entire existence. Should anything within these higher experiences be not as it should be, the irregularity c ontinues lying in wait for him, and can at every turn throw him off the right path. For this reason th e student should omit nothing which can secure for him mastery over his whole being. He shoul d never be found wanting in presence of mind or in calm penetration of all situations of life. In the main, a genuine esoteric training gives rise of itself to all these qua lities, and, as it progre sses, the student only becomes acquainted with the dangers, while simultaneously and at the right moment acquiring the full power to r out them from the field. THE GUARDIAN OF THE THRESHOLD The important experiences marking the student’s ascent into the highe r worlds include his meeting with the ‘Guardian of the Threshold’ . Strictly speaking, ther e are two: a ‘Lesser’ and a ‘Greater’. The student meets the lesse r Guardian when the threads which connect willing, feeling and thinking within the finer as tral and etheric bodies begin to loosen, in the way described in the foregoing chapter. The greater Guardian is encountered when this sundering of the connections extends to the physical parts of the body, that is, at first, to the brain. The lesser Guardian is an independent being. He does not come into existence, so far as the student is co ncerned, until the stud ent has reached the corresponding stage of development. Only some of his most important characteristics can here be indicated."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The attempt will now be made to describe in narrative form this meeting with the lesser Guardian of the Threshold, as a result of which, the student lear ns that his thinking, feeling and willing have become released w ithin him from their inherent connection. A truly terrible spectral Being confronts him, and he will need all that presence of mind and faith in the security of his path, which he has had ample opportunity to acquire in the course of his pr evious training. The Guardian proclaims his significance some what in the following words: ‘Hitherto, Powers invisible to thyself, wa tched over thee. They saw to it, that in the course of thy life, each one of thy good actions brought its re ward, and each one of thine evil actions was attended by its evil results. Thanks to their influence, thy character formed itself out of thy life’s experiences and t hy thoughts. They were the in struments of thy fate. They ordained the measure of joy and pain allotte d to thee in thine incarnations, according to thy conduct in lives gone by. They ruled over thee as the all-embracing law of Karma. These Powers will now partly release thee fr om their constraining influence; and it now devolves on thee to accomplish for thyself a part of the work which they have hitherto performed on thy behalf. Fate struck thee ma ny a hard blow in the past. Thou didst not know the reason. Each was the consequence of a harmful action in a life gone by. Thou didst find joy and gladness, and thou didst take them as they came. They, too, were the fruits of earlier deeds. Thy character s hows many a beautiful side, and many an ugly flaw. Thou hast thyself to thank for both, for they are the result of thy previous experiences and thoughts. These were, till now, unknown to thee, their effects alone being made manifest. They, however, the Karmic Powers, beheld all thy deeds in former lives, and all thy most secret thoughts and feelings, and determined accordingly thy present self and thy present mode of life. But now all th e good and evil sides of thy bygone lives shall be revealed to thee. Till now, they were interwoven with thine own being; they were in thee a nd thou couldst not see them, even as thou canst not see with physical eyes thine own brain. But now they become released from thee; they detach themselves from thy personality. They assu me an independent form which thou canst behold even as thou seest the stones and plants of the outer world. And ... I am that very Being who shaped my body out of thy good and evil achievements. My spectral form is woven out of thine own life’s account book. Till now thou hast borne me invisibly within thyself, and it was well for thee that this s hould be; for the wisdom of thy destiny, though concealed from thee, could thus work within thee, so that the hideous stains upon my form should be blotted out. Now that I have come forth from within thee, that concealed wisdom, too, has departed from thee. It will pay no further heed to thee; it will leave the work in thy hands alone. I must become a pe rfect and glorious Being, or fall a prey to corruption; and should this occu r, I would drag thee also down with me into a dark and corrupt world. If thou wouldst avoid this, th en thine own wisdom must become great enough to undertake the task of that other concealed wisdom, which has departed from thee. As a form visible to thyself, I will neve r for an instant leave thy side, once thou hast crossed my Threshold. And in future, when ever thou dost act or think wrongly, thou wilt straightway perceive thy guilt as a hideous, de moniacal distortion of my form. Only when thou hast made good all thy bygone wrongs, and ha st so purified thyself that all further evil is, for thee, a thing impossible, only th en will my being have become transformed"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"into radiant beauty. Then, t oo, shall I again become united with thee for the welfare of thy future activity. Yet my Threshold is framed by every timid feeling remaining in thee and by every shrinking from thy full respons ibility for all thy thoughts and actions, because of the power thou needest. So long as a trace of fear is in thee, of becoming thyself the guide of thine own destiny, for just so long does this Threshold lack what still remains to be built into it. And so long as a single stone is found mi ssing, for just so long must thou remain standing, as though transfixed; or else stumble. Seek not, then, to, cross this Threshold until thou dost feel thyself enti rely free from fear and ready for the highest responsibility. Hitherto I only emerged from thy personality, when death recalled thee from an earthly life; but even then, my form was veiled from thee. Only the Powers of Destiny who watched over thee, beheld me, and could thus, in th e intervals between death and a new birth, build in thee, in accord ance with my appearance, that power and capacity, thanks to which thou couldst labour, in a new earthly life, at the embellishment of my form, for thy welfare and progress. It was I, too, whose imperfection ever and again constrained the Powers of Destiny to lead thee back to a new incarnation upon earth. I was present at the hour of thy deat h, and it was on my account that the Lords of Karma ordained thy reincarnation. And it is on ly by thus unconsciously transforming me to complete perfection, in ever recurring earthly lives, that thou couldst have escaped the Powers of Death and passed over into immortality united with me. ‘Visible do I thus stand before thee to-day, as I have ever stood invi sible beside thee in the hour of death. When thou shalt have cr ossed my Threshold, thou wilt enter those kingdoms to which thou hast otherwise onl y had access after physical death. Thou dost now enter them with full knowledge, and hencef orth as thou wanderest outwardly visible upon the earth, thou wilt at the same time wande r in the kingdom of death, that is, the kingdom of life. I am indeed the Angel of Death; but I am at the same time the bearer of a higher life without end. Through me thou wilt die, with thy body still living, to be reborn into an imperishable existence. ‘Into this kingdom thou art now entering; thou wilt meet beings that are supersensible, and happiness will be thy lot. But I myself mu st provide thy first acquaintance with that world, and I am thine own creation. Formerly I lived upon thine own life; but now thou hast awakened me to a separate existence, so that I stand before thee as the visible gauge of thy future deeds, perhaps, too, as thy c onstant reproach. Thou hast formed me, but by so doing thou hast undertaken, as thy duty, to transform me. [footnote: It will be gathered from the above that the Guardian of the Thresh old is an (astral) figur e, revealing itself to the student’s awakened higher sight; and it is to this s upersensible encounter that Spiritual Science conducts him. It is a lower magical process to make the Guardian of the Threshold physically visible also. That was attained by produci ng a cloud of fine substance, a kind of frankin cense resulting from a particul ar mixture of a number of substances. The developed power of the magician is then able to mould the frankincense into shape, animating it with the still unred eemed Karma of the individual. Such physical phenomena are no longer necessary for those sufficiently prepared for the higher sight; and, besides, anyone seeing his unredeemed Karm a, without adequate preparation, appear as a living creature before his eyes, would run the risk of er ring into evil byways. Bulwer"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Lytton’s Zanomi in the form of a novel cont ains a description of the Guardian of the Threshold.] What is here indicated in narrative form, must not be unde rstood in the sense of an allegory, but as an experience of the highest possible reality befalling the esoteric student. The Guardian must warn him not to go a st ep further unless he feels in himself the strength to fulfil the demands exposed in th e above speech. However frightening the form assumed by the Guardian, it is only the effect of the stude nt’s own past life, his own character risen out of him into independent existence. This awakening is brought about by the separation of will, thought and feeling. ‘To feel for the first time that one has oneself called a spiritual Being into existence is, in itself, an experience of the deepest significance. The student’s prep aration must aim at enabling him to endure the terrible sight without a trace of timidity, and, at the mo ment of the meeting, to feel his strength so increased, that he can unde rtake consciously to make himself responsible for the transformation and embellishment of the Guardian. If successful, this meeting with the Guardian results in the student’ s next physical death being an entirely different event from death as he knew it formerly. He experiences death consciously, by laying aside the physical body as a garment that is worn out, or perhaps rendered useless through a sudden rent. Thus hi s physical death is of special importance only for those living with him, whose perception is still rest ricted to the world of the senses. For them the student dies; but for hi mself nothing of importance is changed in his whole environment. The entire supersensibl e world stood open to him before his death, and it is this same world that now confronts him after death. The Guardian of the Threshold is also c onnected with other ma tters. The individual belongs to a family, a nation, a race; his activity in this wo rld depends upon his belonging to some such community. His individual character is also connected with it. The conscious activity of single individuals by no means exhausts everything to be reckoned with in a family, a nation or a race. Besides their character, families, nations and races have also their destiny. For pe rsons restricted to their sens es, these things remain mere general ideas; and the materialistic thinke r, in his prejudice, will look down with contempt on the spiritual scientist when he h ears that for the latter, family and national character, lineal or racial dest iny, are inherent in Beings just as real as the personality in which the character and desti ny of the individual are inhere nt. The spiritual scientist becomes acquainted with higher worlds, of whic h the separate personalities are members, just as arms and legs are members of the hum an being. Beside the se parate individuals, a very real family and national Group Soul, and ra cial Spirit is at wo rk in the life of a family, a people or a race. Indeed, in a certain sense, the separate individuals are merely the executive organs of these family Group Souls, racial Spirits and so on. It is nothing but the truth to say, for instance, that a na tional Group Soul makes use of each individual belonging to that nation for the execution of some work. The national Group Soul does not descend into physical realit y, but dwells in higher worlds, and in order to work in the physical world, makes use of the physical organs of each individual. In a higher sense, it is as when an architect makes use of work men for executing the details of a building. In"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"the truest sense, every indivi dual receives his allotted task from his family, national or racial Group Soul. Now the ordinary pers on is by no means initia ted into the higher scheme of his work. He joins unconsciously in the tasks of his people and of his race. Every extension of his horizon necessarily enla rges the scope of his duties. What actually happens is that the student joins a new body to his finer soul-body. He puts on another garment. Hitherto he found his way through th e world with those enveloping coverings of his personality. And now, a further revelati on made to him by the Guardian of the Threshold is that henceforth these Spirits will withdraw th eir guiding hand from him. He must step out of the circle of his communit y. Yet as an isolated individual, he would become hardened in himself, and decline into ruin, if he did not, himself, acquire those powers which are inherent in the national and racial Spirits. Many, no doubt, will say: ‘Oh, I have entirely freed myse lf from all lineal and racial connections; I only want to be a human being and nothing but a human being’ . To these one must reply: ‘Who, then, brought you to this freedom? Was it not your family who placed you in the world where you now stand? Have you not your lineage, your nation, your race to thank for being what you are? They have brought you up; and if now, exalted above all prejudices, you are one of the light-bringers a nd benefactors of your stock and even of your race, it is to their upbringing that you owe it. Yes, even when you say you are ‘nothing but a human being’, even the fact that you have so become, you owe to the Spirits of your communities.’ Only the esoteric student learns what it means to be entirely cut off from his family, national or racial Spirit. He alone realizes, th rough personal experience, the insignificance of all such edu cation in respect of the life now confronting him. For everything inculcated by education comple tely melts away, when the threads binding will, thought and feeling are severed. He looks back on the result of all his previous education as he might on a house crumbling away brick by brick, which he must now rebuild in a new form. And again, it is more than a mere symbolical expression to say that when the Guardian has enunciated his fi rst statement, there arises from the spot where he stands, a whirlwind which extinguis hes all those spiritual lights that have hitherto illumined the pathway of his life. Utter darkness, relieved only by the rays issuing from the Guardian himself, unfolds be fore the student. And out of this darkness resounds the Guardian’s further admonition: ‘Step not across my Threshold until thou dost clearly realize that thou mu st thyself illumine the darkne ss ahead of thee; take not a single step forward until thou art positive that th ou hast sufficient oil in thine own lamp. The lamps of the Guides whom thou hast hitherto followed, will now no longer be available for thee.’ At these words, the st udent must turn and glance backward. The Guardian of the Threshold now draws aside a veil which till now had concealed deep life- mysteries. The family, national and racial Spirits are revealed to the student in their full activity, so that he perceive s clearly, on the one hand, how he has been led hitherto, and no less clearly, on the other hand, how he will henceforward no longer enjoy this guidance. That is the second warning receiv ed at the Threshold from its Guardian. Without preparation, no one could endure the si ght of what has here been indicated. But the higher training which, in al l respects, makes it possible for the student to advance up to the Threshold, simultaneously puts him in a position to find the necessary strength at the right moment. Indeed the training can be so harmonious in nature , that the entry into the higher life is relieved of everything of an agitating or tumultuous character. His"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"experience at the Threshold will then be at tended by a premonition of that felicity which is to provide the keynote of his newly awaken ed life. The feeling of a new Freedom will outweigh all other feelings; and, attende d by this feeling, his new duties and responsibilities will appear as something whic h man, at a particular stage of life, must needs take upon himself. THE GREAT OR SECOND GUARDIAN OF THE THRESHOLD LIFE AND DEATH In the foregoing chapter the importance of th e meeting with the so-c alled lesser Guardian of the Threshold was explained; and it was seen that in this Guardi an a Being confronts the student whom the latter has himself brought into existence, and whose body consists of the hitherto invisible resu lts of the student’s own actions , feelings and thoughts. These unseen forces have become the cause of his de stiny and his character, and he realizes how he himself founded the present in the past. He can understand why his inner self now standing to a certain extent re vealed before him, includes particular inclinations and habits, and he can also recogni ze the origin of certain blows of fate that have befallen him. He perceives why he loves one thing and hates another; why one thing makes him happy and another unhappy. Visible life is ex plained by the invisible causes. The essential facts of life, too, health and illness, birth and death, unveil themselves before his gaze. He observes how, before his birth, he wore the causes which necessarily led to his return into life. Henceforth he knows that Being within himself which is constructed, with all its imperfections, in the visible wo rld, and which can only be brought to its final perfection in this same visi ble world. For in no other worl d is an opportunity given to build up and complete this Being. Moreover, he recognizes that de ath cannot sever him for ever from this world; for he says to hi mself: ‘Once I came into this world because, being as I was, I needed the life it provided, to acquire qualities unattainable in any other world. And I must remain bound to this world until I have developed within myself everything that can here be gained. I shall on ly some day become a useful collaborator in another world by acquiring all the requisite faculties in this physical world.’ Thanks to his insight into the supersensibl e world, the Initiate gains a better knowledge and appreciation of the true va lue of visible Nature, than wa s possible before his higher training; and this may be counted among hi s most important experiences. Anyone not possessing this insight and perhaps therefore imagining the supersensible regions to be infinitely the more valuable , is likely to underestimate the physical world. Yet the possessor of this insight knows that without experience in visible reality, he would be totally powerless in that other invisible realit y. Before he can live in the latter, he must have the requisite faculties and instrument s which can only be acquired in the visible world. Consciousness in the invisi ble world is not possible wit hout spiritual sight, but this power of vision in the higher world is gra dually developed through experience in the lower. No one can be born in the spiritual world with spiritual eyes without having first developed them in the physical world, any more than a child could be born with physical eyes if they had not already been formed within the mother’s womb."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"From this standpoint it will also be r eadily understood why the Threshold to the supersensible world is watched by a Guardia n. In no case may real insight into those regions be permitted to anyone lacking th e requisite faculties; therefore, upon the individual entering the other world while st ill incompetent to work in it, the higher experiences are shrouded from him, at the hour of death, until he is fit to behold them. When the student enters the supersensible world, life acquires quite a new meaning for him; he discerns in the physical world the seed-ground of a higher wo rld, so that, in a certain sense, the higher will appear def ective without the lower. Two outlooks are opened before him; the first into the past and the second into the future. His vision extends to a past in which th is physical world was not yet ex istent for he has long since discarded the prejudice that the supersensi ble world was developed out of the sense- world, He knows that the former was first exis tent, and that out of it everything physical was evolved. He sees that he himself bel onged to a supersensible world before coming for the first time into this sense-world. Bu t this pristine supersensible world needed to pass through the sense-world, for without this passage its further evolution would not have been possible. It can onl y pursue its course when certain beings will have developed requisite faculties within the kingdom of the senses. These bei ngs are none other than the human beings. The latter owe their present life to an imperfect stage of spiritual existence, and are being led, even within this stage, to that perfection which will make them fit for further work in the higher world. At this point, the outlook is directed into the future. A higher stage of the supersensible world is discerned, which will contain the fruits matured in the sense-world. The sense-world, as such, will be superseded; but its products will be embodied in a higher world. The existence of disease and death in the se nse-world is thus e xplained. Death merely expresses the fact that the original supersensible world reached a point beyond which it could not progress by itself. Universal death must needs have overtaken it, had it not received a fresh life-impulse. Thus this new life has evolved into a battle with universal death. A hardened, dying world saw the blosso ming of a new world. That is why we have death and life in the world. The decaying portion of the old world adheres to the new life blossoming from it, and the process evolve s slowly. This comes to expression most clearly in man himself. The covering he bears is gathered from the preserved remnants of the old world, and within this covering the germ of that being is matured which will live in the future. Thus man is twofold: mortal a nd immortal. The mortal is in its last, and the immortal in its first stage. But it is only w ithin this twofold worl d finding its expression in the sense-world, that he can acquire the requisite faculties to lead the world to immortality. Indeed his task is precisely to gather the fruits of the mortal for the immortal. And as he glances at himself as the product of his own work in the past, he cannot but say: ‘I have in me the elements of a decaying world. They are at work in me, and I can only break their power little by li ttle, thanks to the new immortal elements coming to life within me.’ This is the path leading man from death to life. Could he but speak to himself with full consciousness, at the hour of his death, he would say: ‘The perishing world was my master. I am now dying as a result of the entire past with which I am enmeshed. Yet the soil of mortal life has matured the seeds of immortal life. I carry them with me into another world. If it ha d merely depended on the past, I could never have been born. The life of the past came to an end with birth. Life in the sense-world is"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"wrested from universal death by the newly-formed life-germ . The time between birth and death is merely an expression for the amount wrested from the dying past by the new life; and illness is nothing but the continued e ffect of the dying portions of the past.’ In the above, the answer will be found to the question why man only works his way gradually through error and im perfection to the good and true . His actions, feelings and thoughts are at first dominated by the perishing and the mortal. The latter gave rise to his sense-organs. For this reason, these organs a nd all things reacting on them are doomed to perish. The imperishable will not be found in th e instincts, impulses, passions, and in the organs belonging to them, but only in the work produced by these organs. Man must extract from the perishable everything that can be extracted, and this work alone will enable him to discard those fundamental elem ents out of which he has grown, and which find their expression in th e physical sense-world. Thus the first Guardian confr onts the individual as the coun terpart of his twofold nature, in which perishable and imperishable are ble nded; and it stands clearly proved how far removed he still is from attaining that s ublime luminous figure which may again dwell in the spiritual world. The extent to which he is entangled with the phys ical sense-world, is exposed to his view. The presence of instinct s, impulses, desires, egotistical wishes and all forms of selfishness, etc., are evidence of th is entanglement, as also his membership of a race, a nation and so forth. A race or a nation stands so much the higher, the more perfectly its members express the pure, ideal human type, th e further it has worked its way from the physical and perishable to the supersensible and imperishable. The evolution of man through the incarnations in ev er higher national and racial forms is thus a process of liberation. In a similar way, th e pilgrimage through ever purer forms of morality and religion is a perfecting process; for every moral stage retains the passion for the perishable beside the seeds of an ideal future. Now in the Guardian of the Threshold, as described above, the product of the past is manifest, containing only so many seeds of the fu ture as could be planted in the course of time. Yet everything that can be extracted from the sense-world must be carried into the supersensible world. Were the student to bri ng with him only what had been woven into his counterpart out of the past, his earthly task would remain but partially accomplished. For this reason, the ‘lesser Guardian of the Threshold’ is joine d, after a time, by the Greater Guardian. The meeting with this se cond or Greater Guardian will again be described in narrative form. When the student has recognized all the elements from whic h he must liberate himself, his way is barred by a sublime luminous Being whos e beauty is difficult to describe in the words of human language. This encounter take s place when the sundering of the organs of thinking, feeling and willing extends to the physical body, so that their reciprocal connection is no longer regulated by themselv es, but by the higher consciousness, which has now quite liberated itself from physical conditions. The organs of thinking, feeling and willing will then be controlled from supe rsensible regions, as instruments in the power of the human soul. The latter, thus liberated from all physical bonds, is now confronted by the second Guardian of the Threshold who speaks as follows: ‘Thou hast"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"released thyself from the world of the senses . Thou hast won the right to become a native of the supersensible world, whence thine ac tivity can now be directed. For thine own part, thou dost no longer require thy physical body in its pres ent form. If thine intention was merely to acquire the f aculties necessary for life in the supersensible world, thou needest no longer return to the sense-worl d. But now look on me. See how I tower above all that thou hast made of thyself until now. Thou hast a ttained thy pres ent degree of perfection thanks to the faculties thou wast ab le to develop in the sense-world, so long as thou wast still confined to it. But now a new er a is to begin, in which thy liberated powers must be applied to further work in the worl d of the senses. Hitherto thou hast sought only thine own release, but now, ha ving thyself become free, thou canst go forth as a liberator of thy fellows. Until to-day thou hast striven as an individual, but now seek to co-ordinate thyself in the whole so that thou mayst bri ng into the supersensible world not thyself alone, but all things else existing in the worl d of the senses. Thou wilt some day be able to unite thyself with me, but I cannot be bl essed so long as others are unredeemed. As a separate freed being, thou wouldst fain ente r at once the kingdom of the supersensible, yet thou wouldst be forced to look down on the still unredeemed beings in the physical world, having sundered thy destiny from th eirs, though thou and they are inseparably united. Thou didst perforce descend into the wo rld to gather powers needed for a higher world. To separate thyself from thy fellows would mean to misuse those very powers which thou couldst not have developed save in company with them. Thou couldst not have descended had they not done so, and without them, the powers needed for supersensible existence woul d fail thee. Thou must now share with thy fellows the powers which thou didst, in comp any with them, exert thyself to acquire. I shall therefore bar thine entry into the higher regions of the supersensible wo rld so long as thou hast not applied all the powers thou hast acquired to the liberation of thy companions. With the powers already at thy dispos al, thou mayst sojourn in the lower regions of the supersensible world, but I stand before the por tal of the higher regions as the Cherub with the fiery sword before Paradise, and I bar th ine entrance so long as powers unused in the sense-world still remain in thee. And if thou dost refuse to apply thy powers in this world others will come who will not refuse; and a higher supersensible world will receive all the fruits of the sense-world, while thou wilt lose from under thee the very ground in which thou wast rooted. The purified world will develop above and beyond thee, and thou wilt be excluded from it. Thus thou woul dst tread the black path, while the others from whom thou didst sever thys elf, tread the white path.’ Thus the Great Guardian makes his presen ce known soon after the meeting with the Watcher or first Guardian has taken place. The Initiate knows full well what is in store for him if he yields to the temptation of a pr emature abode in the supersensible world. An undescribable splendour shines forth from this Great Guardian of the Threshold; union with him looms as a far distant ideal before the soul’s vision. Ye t there is also the certitude that this union will not be possibl e until all the powers afforded by this world are applied to the task of its liberation and redemption. By fulfilling the demands of the higher light-being, the Initiate will contribute to the liberation of the human race. He lays his gifts on the sacrificial al tar of humanity. Should he prefer his own premature elevation into the supersensible world, the st ream of human evolution will flow over and beyond him. After his liberation he can gain no new powers from the world of the senses;"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"and if he places his work at the world’s disposal it will entail his renouncement of any further benefit for himself. It does not follow that, when called upon, anyone will naturally follow the white path. That depends entirely upon whether he is so far purified at the time of his decision, th at no trace of self-seeking makes this prospect of felicity appear desirable. For the allurements here ar e the strongest possible; whereas on the other side no special allurements are evident. Here nothing appeals to his egoism. The gift he receives in the higher regions of the supersensible world is no thing that comes to him, but only something that flows from him, that is, love for the world and for his fellows. Nothing that egoism desires is denied upon th e black path, for the latter provides, on the contrary, for the complete gratification of egoism, and will not fail to attract those desiring merely their own felicity, for it is in deed the appropriate pa th for them. No one therefore should expect the occu ltists of the white path to give him instruction for the development of his own egoistical self. They do not take the slightest interest in the felicity of the individual. Each can attain that for himself, and it is not the task of the white occultists to shorten the way; for they are only concerned with the development and liberation of all human beings and all creature s. Their instructions, therefore, deal only with the development of powers for collabora tion in this work. Thus they place selfless devotion before all other quali ties. They never actually refuse anyone, for even the greatest egoist can purify himself; but no one merely seeking an advantage for himself will ever obtain assistance from the white occu ltists. Even when they do not refuse their help, he, the seeker, deprives himself of th e advantage resulting from their assistance. Anyone, therefore, really following the inst ructions of the good oc cult teachers, will, upon crossing the Threshold, understand the de mands of the greater Guardian; anyone, however, not following their instructions, can never hope to reach the Threshold. Their instructions, if followed, produce good results or no results; for it is no part of their task to lead individuals to egoist ical felicity, and to a mere existence in the supersensible worlds. In fact it becomes their duty to k eep the student away from the supersensible world until he can enter it with the will for selfless collaboration. [footnote: See p. 158 and Editorial Preface] APPENDIX TO THE AUTHOR’S LATEST EDITION 1918 The way to supersensible knowledge, as descri bed in this book, l eads the soul through experiences concerning the nature of which it is especially important that all illusions and misconceptions should be avoided. Yet it is but na tural that the latter should arise in such questions as are here considered. In this connection one of the most serious mistakes arises when the whole range of inner experien ce dealt with in true Spiritual Science, is distorted into appearing in the same cat egory as superstition, visionary dreaming, mediumship (spiritualism) and other degenerate pursuits. This distortion is often due to the fact that persons desirous of following the path described in this book, are confused with others who in their s earch for supersensible realit y, and as a result of methods foreign to a genuine striving for knowledge , wander into undesir able paths. The experiences through which the human soul liv es on the path here meant, are wholly"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"confined to the realm of psycho-spiritual occurrence. They are only possible if equal freedom and independence from the bodily li fe are attained for certain other inner experiences, as is the case during ordina ry consciousness, when thoughts are made concerning things outwardly apprehended or inwardly felt and willed, thoughts that do not themselves originate in what is appreh ended, felt and willed. There are people who deny the existence of such thoughts. They belie ve that no thought is possible that is not extracted from perceptions or from the i nner life dependent on the body. For them, all thoughts are, to a certain extent, mere reflecti ons of perceptions and of inner experiences. This view, however, cannot be expressed save by those who have never raised themselves to the faculty of experiencing with their souls a self-sustaining life in pure thought. For others, who have lived through this experience, it is a matter of knowledge that whatever thought dominates the life of th e soul, inasmuch as this thought permeates other functions of the soul, the human being is involved in an activity, in originating which his body has no share. In the ordinary life of the soul, thought is almost always blended with other functions, e.g. appreh ension, feeling, willing, etc. These other functions are effectuated by th e body; yet thought plays into them, and inasmuch as it plays into them, a process takes place, in and through the human be ing, in which his body has no share. This can only be denied so long as the illusion is not discarded which arises from the observation of thought only when the latter is united with other functions. Yet an inner exertion is possible en abling the thinking part of inner life to be experienced, separated from everything else. Something consisting in pure thought alone, can be detached from the compass of soul-life, th at is, thoughts which ar e self-sustaining and from which everything provided by bodily conditioned inner life is excluded. Such thoughts reveal themselves through themselves , through what they are, as spiritual supersensible entity. Anyone uniting hi mself with them, while excluding all apprehension, all memory and every other toke n of inner life, knows himself to be in a supersensible region, and experiences hi mself outside the physical body. For anyone familiar with this whole process, it becomes irrelevant to question whether the soul can live through experience outside the body, in a supersensible world. For it would mean denying what he knows by experience. He is concerned only with inquiring into what prevents such a positive fact from being r ecognized. And the answer he finds to this question, is that the above fact does not reveal itself unless the individual firs t cultivates a condition of soul, allowing him to beco me the recipient of this revelation. Now people become at once suspicious when an activity solely confined to the soul is expected of them, in order that something extr aneous to themselves should reveal itself. They believe that they themselves give th e revelation its content because they prepare themselves to receive it. They expect expe riences to which they contribute nothing and which allow them to remain quite passive. S hould such people, in addition, be ignorant of the simplest scientific requirements for the co mprehension of a given fact, they will take for an objective revelation of non- sensible entity, contents an d productions of the soul, in which the soul’s participation is reduced below the level maintained in apprehension and wilful action. Such are the soul-contents provided by the e xperiences and revelations of the visionary and the medium. But what comes to the fore through such revelations is not a supersensible but a sub-se nsible world. Human waking life does not run its course completely within the body; the most cons cious part of it transpires on the boundary"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"between the body and the physical outer world; thus the process of apprehension in the organs of sense, is as much an extra-phys ical process penetra ting into the body as a permeation of this process from out of the body. So, too, is the life of will, that is founded on the co-ordination of the human being in the cosmic being, so that what occurs in the human being is simultaneously a link in the chain of cosmic occurrence. In this life of the soul transpiring on the boundary of the physical body, the human being is largely dependent on his physical organisation; but the function of thought plays into this activity, and inasmuch as this is the case, the human being makes hi mself independent of his bodily organisation in the functions of apprehending and willing. As a visionary and a medium the human being becomes complete ly dependent on his body. He excludes from the life of his soul that function wh ich, in apprehending and willing, makes him independent of his body. Thus the content and productions of his soul are merely revelations of his bodily life. The experiences of the visionary and the productions of the medium owe their existence to the circum stance that the individual, while thus experiencing and producing, is, with his s oul, less independent of his body than in ordinary apprehending and willi ng. In the experience of the supersensible as indicated in this book, the development of soul-life proceed s in just the opposite direction to that taken by the visionary and the medium. Th e soul acquires a progressively greater independence from the body than is the case in apprehending and willing. The same independence realised in the experience of pure thought, is at tained by the soul for a far wider range of activity. For the supersensible activity of the soul he re meant, it is exceptionally important to grasp and realise, in th e clearest possible way, this experience of lif e in pure thought. For, in the main, this experience is already a s upersensible activity of the soul, only one in which nothing supersensible is as yet pe rceived. With pure thought we live in the supersensible; but we experien ce this alone in supersensible fashion; we do not, as yet, experience anything else supersensibly. A nd supersensible experience must be a continuation of that life already attained by the soul, when united with pure thought. For this reason it is so important to gain knowledge of this union in the right way, for it is from its comprehension that light shines forth to bring correct insight into the nature of supersensible knowledge. The moment the life of the soul sinks below the level of clear consciousness existing in thought, the soul is on the wrong path, so far as true knowledge of the supersensible world is concerned; for the soul is seized by the bodily functions and what is then experienced is not the reve lation of a supersensible world, but bodily revelations confined to the sub-sensible world. Having penetrated to the sphere of the supersensible, the soul’s experiences are of such a nature, that descriptive expre ssions cannot so easily be found for them as for experiences confined to the world of the senses. Care must often be taken not to overlook the fact that to a certain extent, in descrip tions of supersensible experience, the distance separating the actual fact from the language used to describe it, is greater than in descriptions of physical experience. The reader must be at pains to realise that many an expression is intended as an illustration merely indicati ng, in a delicate way, the reality to which it refers. Thus it is said on page 17 of this book: ‘Originally all the rules and teachings of Spiritual Science were expr essed in a symbolical sign- language.’ And on page 52 a"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"‘particular writing system’ was mentioned. Now anyone may easil y be led to suppose that such a writing can be learnt in the same way as the letters of an ordinary physical language, and their combination. In this connect ion it must be pointed out that there have been and there still exist spiritual scie ntific schools and associations possessing symbolical signs, by means of which supers ensible facts are brought to expression. And anyone initiated into the meaning of these sy mbols attains thereby the means of directing his inner life towards the supersensible re alities in question. Yet such an external symbolical language is of no essential importanc e for supersensible expe rience. It is more important that in the course of that supers ensible experience to which the realisation of the contents of this book leads, the soul should, in the contemplation of the supersensible, gain the revelation of such a writing through personal experience. The supersensible says something to the soul which the soul must tr anslate into these illustrative signs, so that it can be surveyed with full consciousness. The statement can be made that what is imparted in this book can be realised by every so ul. And in the course of this realisation, which the soul can personally determine accord ing to the indications given, the resulting events occur as described. Let the reader take this book as a conversat ion between the author and himself. The statement that the student n eeds personal instruction should be understood in the sense that this book itself is pers onal instruction. In earlier tim es there were reasons for reserving such personal instruc tion for oral teaching; to-day we have reached a stage in the evolution of humanity in which spiritua l scientific knowledge must become far more widely disseminated than formerly. It mu st be placed within the reach of every individual, to a quite different extent from what was the case in older times. So the book replaces the former oral inst ruction. It is only to a limited extent co rrect that further personal instruction is necessary, beyond th at contained in this book. No doubt, someone may need assistance, and it may be of importan ce for him or her; but it would be false to believe that there were any cardinal points not mentioned in this book. They can be found by those who read correctly, and, above all, completely. The descriptive instructions given in this book appear at first sight as though they required the complete alteration of the whole human being. Yet, when rightly read, it will be found that no more is intended by them th an a description of the inner condition of soul required by anyone, in those moments wh en he confronts the supersensible world. He develops this condition of soul as a sec ond being within himself; and the other healthy being pursues its course in the old way. He knows how to hold the two beings apart in full consciousness, and how to make them act and react on each other in the right way. This does not make him useless and incompetent for life, nor does he lose his interest and skill in it, and become a ‘spiritual investigator the whole day long’. It is of course true that the student’s manner of experience in the supersensible world will shed its light over his whole being; but far from distracting hi m from life, it makes him more capable and his life more productive. The necessity of a dopting the existing method of description is due to the fact that every cognitive process directed towards the supersensible, calls the whole human being into action; so that in the moment of such cognition the whole human being is engaged. Whereas in the process of apprehension of colour, the eye alone with its adjoining nervous system is engaged, th e supersensible cognitive process engages the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"whole human being. The whole human being be comes an ‘eye’ or an ‘ear’. For this reason, when information is given concerning the construction of supersensible cognitive processes, it appears as t hough a transformation of the human being were meant, as if nothing were right, in the ordinary human be ing, and he should become quite different. I should like to add to what was said on pa ges 81 et seq., concerning ‘some results of Initiation’, something which, with a slight alteration, can appl y to other parts of the book. It may occur to some to ask if such figurativ e descriptions are nece ssary, and if it is not possible to describe these supersensible expe riences in ideas, without such illustrations. In reply it must be pointed out that for th e experience of supersensible reality it is essential that the human being should know hi mself to be a supersensible being in a supersensible world. Without this vision of hi s own supersensible be ing, whose reality is fully revealed, in its way, in the descripti ons here given of the lotus flowers and the etheric body, the individual’s experience of hi mself in the supersensible world would be as though he were placed in the sensible world in such a way that the things and processes around him revealed themselves, while he himself had no knowledge of his own body. But his perception of his own supers ensible form in soul-body and etheric body enables him to stand, conscious of himsel f, in the supersensible world, as he is conscious of himself in the physical world through the perception of his physical body.
