[New English edition, translation completely revise d by Henry B. Monges.] THE social question should not be regarded as a mer e party matter or as a problem resulting from the personal demands of a few indivi duals. It has arisen in the course of social evolution and belongs to the facts of histor y. One of these facts is the proletarian socialist movement which has been growing steadily for more than half a century. According to our own views of life or our circumsta nces, we may regard the conceptions coming to light in this socialist proletarian movem ent, either critically or approvingly. But whatever be our attitude towards it we can only acc ept it as an historic fact which must be dealt with as such. And whoever reflects on the ter rible years of the so-called World-War, (World-War I) even though one may feel compelled to see causes and motives of different kinds for these horrors, must acknowledge that it i s the social demands, the social contrasts which have to a great extent caused them. Especiall y now that we are at the end, at least for the present, of those terrible events, it must be c learly evident to everyone that over a great part of the civilized world the social question has sprung to life as a result of the World-War. If the social question has sprung to lif e as a result of the World War there is little doubt that it was already concealed within i t. Now it will be impossible for anyone to judge this question rightly who regards it from his own narrow, often personal standpoint as is so frequently done to-day. No one who cannot widen his horizon to take in the events of h uman life as a whole is able to take an impartial view of the social question, and it is ju st that widening of our horizon which is aimed at in my book, The Threefold Commonwealth (Die Kernpunkte der Sozi alen Frage). We must remember, too, that most people who speak o n the social question to-day quite naturally regard it in the first place as a questio n of economics; it is even looked upon purely as a question of food, or, at best, as facts plainly demonstrate, as one of labor — a question of food and labor. If we are to regard thi s question merely in the light of a food and labor question, we must remember that the human being is supplied with bread because it is produced for him by the community at large, and that bread can only be produced by labor. But the manner in which that lab or should and must be carried on depends in every respect upon the manner in which h uman society or any separate part of it, for instance a country, is organized. And to an yone who has acquired a wider outlook on life it will be clear that there can be no rise or fall in the price of a piece of bread without"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the occurrence of great, of immense changes in the whole structure of the social organism. To anyone who observes attentively the manner in wh ich the individual worker plays his part in the social organism, it becomes evident tha t when a man works but a quarter of an hour more or less, this fact is expressed in the wa y in which the society of any economic region procures bread and money for the individual. You see from this, that even if we regard the social question merely as one of bread a nd labor, we at once enlarge our horizon, and it is of this wider horizon in its mos t varied aspects that I should like to speak to you in these six lectures. To-day, before going further, I should like to make a few introductory remarks. When we survey the later and very latest history of the evolution of the human race, we soon find confirmation of what has been so impressi vely stated by discriminating observers of social life; of course, this applies only to dis criminating observers. There is a publication of the year 1910 which contains, it may be said, th e best that has been written on this subject and which is the outcome of a real insight into social conditions. It is the work of Hartley Withers, Money and Credit , 1910. The author acknowledges pretty frankly that everyone who professes to deal with the social ques tion at all at the present day should keep in mind that the manner in which credit, prope rty, and money conditions figure in the social organism is so complicated as to have a bewi ldering effect. If we try logically to analyze the functions of credit, money, labor, etc. , Withers tells us that it is an absolute impossibility to collect the material necessary to follow with understanding the things which arise within the social organism. What has be en here stated with so much insight is confirmed by the whole volume of historical thought in modern times on the social problem, and especially on the social and economic cooperation of human beings. What, then, is really the conclusion at which we ha ve arrived? Since the time when the economic life of a country ceased, as one might say , to have institutions of an instinctively patriarchal character, ever since the economic life began to assume a more complicated form, under the influence of modern technical scien ce and modern capitalism, the necessity has been felt to consider the economic si de of life scientifically, and to form such ideas with regard to it as are usually applied in s cientific research or study. And we have seen how in modern times views have arisen regardin g national, or political, economy, (Volkswirtschaft) as it is called, to which the wor ds ‘mercantilistic’ or ‘physiocratic’ have been applied, views such as those of Adam Smith, et c., down to Marx, Engels, Blanc, Fourier, Saint-Simon, and on to the present day. Wh at has come to light in the course of this national-economic thought? Let us look at the school of thought known as the mercantilistic, or at the physiocratic school of na tional economy, and let us examine what Ricardo, the teacher of Karl Marx, has contributed to the study of national economy. We may also examine what many other economists have sa id and we shall always find that these men turn their attention to one or another pa rticular line of thought in the phenomena of economics. From this one-sided stand-p oint they endeavor to arrive at certain laws according to which the economic life o f a nation can be molded. The result has always shown that laws which have thus been discove red, according to the methods of scientific thought, can be adapted to some facts of national economy, but that other facts are found to be too far-reaching for comprehension within these laws. It has always been demonstrated that the views of those who, in the se venteenth, eighteenth, and the beginning of the nineteenth century, claimed to hav e discovered laws, according to which, the economic life of a nation can be constituted, w ere one-sided. And then something"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"extremely remarkable came to pass. It may be said that national, or political, economy has grown to the status of a science. It has taken its place among the sciences in our unive rsities, and the whole armor of scientific thought has been brought to bear on the investigati on of the economic aspect of social life. With what result? What is the answer of Roscher, of Wagner, or others, to this question? They have arrived at a consideration of economic la ws in which they do not dare to formulate maxims or give expression to impulses cap able of actually grappling with and forming the economic life. We might say that the ro le which national economy has taken is that of a contemplative spectator; it has retreated more or less before the activity of social life. It has not discovered laws capable of molding human life within the social organism. The very same thing is seen in another way. We have seen that men have arisen, large- hearted, benevolent, humanitarian, with fraternal f eelings towards their fellow-men. We need only mention Fourier and Saint-Simon. There ar e others like them. Model forms of society have been thought out by these distinguishe d thinkers, the realization of which, they believe, would bring about desirable social co nditions in human life. Now we know how those at the present day think conc erning such social ideas who feel the social question to be one of vital importance. If we ask those who may be said to hold really modern socialistic views for their opinion o f the social ideals of a Fourier, or a Louis Blanc, or a Saint-Simon, they would say: ‘These are Utopias, pictures of social life through which an appeal to the governing classes is made: i f they would act in accordance with these pictures, many evils of social misery would d isappear. But all such imaginary Utopias,’ it is said, ‘are wanting in the force nee ded to inspire the human will, they can never be anything but Utopias. However beautiful ma y be the theories put forward, human instincts — for instance, those of the wealthy clas ses — will never alter so as to put those theories into practice. Other forces are needed to bring that about.’ In short, an absolute unbelief has arisen in the social ideals born of fe eling, sentiment and modern learning which have been presented to humanity. This again hangs together with the general course o f events in the cultured life of humanity, as seen in the development of modern hist ory. It has often been expressly stated that what we now recognize as the social question i s connected in all essentials with the modern capitalistic organization of economic life, and this, again, in its present special form, is the outcome of the preponderance of modern technical science, and so forth. But there are many points to be considered in this conn ection and we shall never be able to deal with these unless we take into account that wi th the capitalist regime, and with the modern application of technical science, an entirel y new attitude of mind has arisen among modern civilized humanity. This new conception of t he world has produced great, epoch- making results, especially in the fields of technic al and natural science. But there is another side to it, of which something must be said. Those of you who are acquainted with my books will not have failed to observe that I am ready to do full justice to, and in no wise deny or criticize unfavorably the discoveries of modern times through scientific methods of research . I fully recognize what has been done for the progress of humanity by the Copernican worl d-conception, by the science of Galileo, the widening of the horizon of mankind by Giordano Bruno, and much besides. But side by"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"side with modern technical science, with modern cap italism, a gradual change has come about in the old world conception. The new concepti on of the world has taken on a decidedly intellectual, above all a scientific, cha racter. It is true that some people find it hard to look facts straight in the face, but we nee d only recall the fact that the scientific world-conception which we now regard with pride has gradually developed, as we can show, out of old religious, artistic, aesthetic, mo ral conceptions of the world. These views possessed a certain impelling force applicable to l ife. One truth, especially, was peculiar to them all. They led man to the consciousness of the spirituality of his own nature. However we may regard those old views, we must agree that t hey spoke to man of the spirit, so that he felt within himself the living spiritual being a s a part of the cosmic spiritual being pulsating throughout the world, weaving the web of the universe. In the place of this old conception, with its impelling social force, giving an impulse to life, another appeared, new and more scientific in its orientation. This new co nception was concerned with more or less abstract laws of nature, and facts of the senses, o utside man himself, abstract ideas and facts. Without detracting in the smallest degree fr om the value of natural science, we may ask: what does it bestow on humanity, especially wh at does it bestow on man in order to help him solve the riddle of his own existence? Nat ural science tells us much about the interdependence of the phenomena of nature, it reve als much regarding the physical constitution of the human being. But when it attemp ts to tell us anything about man's innermost being, science overreaches itself. It can give no answer to this question, and it shows ignorance of itself when it even attempts to answer it. I do not by any means wish to assert that the commo n consciousness of humanity already has its source in the teachings of modern s cience. But it is profoundly true that the scientific mode of thought itself proceeds from a c ertain definite attitude of the modern human soul. He who can penetrate below the surface of life knows that, since the middle of the fifteenth century, something in the attitude of the human soul has changed. when we compare it with former times, and is still changing more and more, and he also knows that the conception of the world which we find typically expressed in scientific thought has been diffused increasingly over the whole human race, fi rst over the cities, then all over the land. It is, therefore, no mere achievement of theoretic natural science of which we are speaking, but an inner attitude of the soul which has gradual ly taken possession of humanity as a whole since the dawn of modern times. It is a signi ficant coincidence that this scientific world-conception made its appearance at the same ti me as capitalism and modern technical culture. Men were called away from their old handiwork and placed at a machine, crowded together in a factory. The machine at which they stand, the factory in which they are crowded together with their fellows, these, gov erned only by mechanical laws, have nothing to give a man that has any direct relations hip to himself as a man. Out of his old handicraft something flowed to him which gave answe r to his query regarding human worth and human dignity. The dead machine gives no answer. Modern industrialism is like a mechanical network spun about the man, in the mid st of which he stands; it has nothing to give him in which he can joyfully share, as did the work at his old handicraft. In this way an abyss opened between the industrial working-class and the employers of labor, between the capitalist and the working-man o f modern times at his machine in the factory. The worker surrounded by machinery, could no longer rise to the old faith, the old world-conception with its impulse for life. He had broken away from it because he could not reconcile it with the actualities of life. He h eld to that, and to that only, which had"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"become a part of modern thought, viz. the scientifi c conception of the world. And this scientific conception of the world, what w as its effect on industrial working-men? It made them feel more and more strong ly that what could be presented to them as a true world conception was mere thought, p ossessing only the reality of thought. Anyone who has lived among modern working-men and k nows the direction taken by social feelings in later times also knows the meani ng of a word which occurs repeatedly in proletarian socialist circles — the word ‘ideology. ’ Under the influences which I have just described, i ntellectual life has come to be regarded by the modern working-classes as ideology. They look upon the natural-scientific view of the world as offering food for thoughts onl y. The old conception had not only thoughts to give; it gave them something which show ed them that their own inmost being was one with the whole spiritual world, it confront ed them, spirit with spirit. The modern conception had only thoughts to give and above all, it contained no answer to the question regarding man's real nature. It was felt to be ideo logy. In this way a division arose between the proletariat and the upper classes who had kept the ancient tradition of the time-honored world-conceptions of the aesthetic, ar tistic, religious, moral beliefs of former times. All this the upper classes retained for the satisfaction of their whole nature., while with their heads they accepted the scientific expla nation of the world. The masses of the people, however, had no inclinati on for the old tradition or sympathy with it. For them the only reasonable conception of the world was the scientific, and this they accepted as ideology; it was to them a mere th ought-structure. To them the economic life was the only reality-production, distribution of products, consumption, the manner of acquiring or bequeathing property, etc. Everything else in human life-equity, ethics, science, art, religion, these are all as vapor risi ng in the form of ideology out of the only reality: the economic life. Thus among the masses, intellectual and spiritual life came to be looked upon as ideology. This was the case especial ly because the leading classes, while they watched the development of the modern economic life and familiarized themselves with it, did not understand how to bring intellectu al and spiritual life into the growing complexity of the economic system. They kept to the old tradition of the intellectual and spiritual life of former days. The masses of the pe ople adopted the new cultural life, but it gave them no comfort or nourishment for heart and s oul. A world-conception such as this, felt as an ideolog y which gives rise to the thought that justice, morality, religion, art, science, are a me re superstructure, a phantom hovering over the only reality, over the conditions of production , the economic order of things, may form a subject for thought, but it gives no support in l ife. However splendid a world-conception such as this may be in the contemplation of Nature, it leaves the human soul empty and cold. The fruits of the scientific conception of th e world are showing themselves in the events of social life in our time. These social facts cannot be understood, if we only take into account the content of human consciousness. People may think consciously: “Why speak to us of the social question as being of a spiritual nature? The truth is that commodities are unevenly distributed. We want equal distribution.” People th ink like this with the brain. But in the unconscious depths of the soul something very diffe rent is stirring. In those depths is"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"stirring that which develops unconsciously, because from the consciousness nothing can flow which could fill the soul with a real spiritua l content, for from that source can come only what leaves it dead, only what is felt to be i deology. The emptiness of modern intellectual life is the first aspect of the social question which we have to recognize; the social question is in its first aspect a spiritual question. Since this is true, since an intellectual life has developed which, for instance, in the science of economics as taught in the universities, has reached a merely contemplative stage, and of itself does not evolve principles of social will; since it is true that the greatest philanthropists, such as Saint-Simon, Louis Blanc, Fourier, have conceived social ideas in which no one believes; since everything without exc eption that arises out of the mind is regarded as Utopian, that is, as mere ideology; sin ce it is a historical fact that a life of thought prevails, which gives the impression of a m ere superstructure on top of the economic actuality, which does not really penetrate to the facts and is therefore felt to be ideology — for this reason the social question must in its first aspect be treated as a spiritual-cultural question. One question, above al l, stands out before us to-day in letters of flame. How must the human mind be changed, in order that it may learn to master the social question? We have seen that science has applied its best meth ods to the study of political economy, and that the result is mere observation wi thout power to reach the social will. On the soil of modern intellectual life a type of mind has arisen, powerless to develop national economy as a groundwork for practical social will. How must the mind be constituted from which a kind of national economy can proceed, capab le of forming the groundwork of a truly social will? We have seen that the great majority of people, whe n they hear of the social ideals of well-meaning philanthropists, exclaim ‘Utopia!’ and they cannot believe that the human intelligence is strong enough to master social fact s. How must the cultural life of a nation be constituted in order that people may learn again to believe that the mind can grasp ideas capable of creating social institutions which will remove certain evils of social life? We have seen that the scientific view of the world is regar ded in wide circles as ideology. But ideology alone empties the soul, and generates in i ts subconscious depths all that we now observe in the bewildering chaotic facts of the soc ial problem. What new form can we give to cultural life, so that it may cease to appear as ideology, so that it may fill the human soul with strength enabling men to work side by side wit h their fellowmen in a really social manner? We thus see why the social question must be called a cultural question, we see that the modern intellect has not been able to inspire faith in itself, that it has not been able to fill the soul with a satisfying content, but that, on th e contrary, as ideology it has desolated the souls of men. In this introduction, treating the su bject historically, I should like to show how out of the circumstances of modern life, the so cial question must he felt in its three aspects as cultural, legal-political, and economic. Take, for example, what was said not long ago and h as often been repeated by a personage actively concerned in the political life, in the statesmanship of our day, himself a product of the intellectual life of the present day ."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"With a deep feeling for the social conditions of Am erica in their development since the War of Secession in the sixties of last century, Wo odrow Wilson perceived the relationship between the political and legal conditions and thos e of the economic life. With a considerable amount of unbiased judgment he watched how the great accumulations of capital have grown in consequence of the complicati on of modern economic life. He saw the formation of trusts and of the great financial companies. He saw how, even in a democratic state, the principle of democracy has te nded more and more to disappear before the secret operations of those companies who se interest was served by secrecy, those companies which with their massed capital acq uired great power and obtained influence over enormous numbers of people. He alway s used his eloquence on the side of freedom in face of the growth of power arising out of economic conditions. He knew from a sentiment of true humanity — this must be said how every single human being has an influence upon the facts of social life, how the so cial life of the community depends upon the manner in which each individual matures for the duties of social life. He showed how important it is for the health of the social body t hat in the breast of every human being a freedom-loving heart should beat. He pointed out ov er and over again that political life must become democratic, that power and the means of power must be taken away from the various trusts, that the individual capacities and powers of every human being who possesses such must have free access to the economi c, social and political life as a whole. He emphatically declared that his own Government, w hich he evidently regarded as the most advanced, was suffering from the prevailing co nditions. Why was this? Because the economic conditions were there: — great accumulatio ns of capital, development of economic power, surpassing everything in this domai n that had ever existed, even a short time ago. Perfectly new forms of human social life had been brought about by economic changes. An altogether new form of economic life ha d suddenly been brought into being. These views are not the outcome of any leaning towa rds a theory of my own; they are the words of this statesman, one may say of this ‘w orld statesman.’ He has declared that the fundamental evil of modern development lies in the fact that, notwithstanding the progress in economic matters, the latter have been controlle d by the secret machinations of certain persons, and the idea of justice, of the political life of the community, has not kept pace with economic progress, but has lingered behind at an earlier stage. Woodrow Wilson has clearly stated: “We carry on business under new con ditions. We think and legislate for the economic life of the nation from a point of view lo ng out of date, an antiquated standpoint. Nothing new has been developed in our political lif e, in our laws. These have stood still. We live in an entirely new economic order, while retai ning the out-of-date legal and political ideas.” These are the words, or nearly so, spoken b y Woodrow Wilson himself. In earnest words he demands that the individual shall work for the benefit of the community, not for his own. He points out that, as long as the incongr uity between the political and the economic life continues to exist, the requirements of human evolution at the present epoch in history cannot be satisfied, and he subjects the life of society around him to a severe criticism. I have taken great pains to examine Woodrow Wilson' s criticism of modern social conditions, especially those he has in view, the Am erican, and to compare it with other criticisms. (I am going to say something very parad oxical, but present conditions often urgently demand a paradox, in order to do justice t o the realities of our day.) I have tried"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"both as to the outer form and the inner impulses to compare Woodrow Wilson's criticism of society, in the first place as criticism, with that exercised by advanced thinkers and those holding radical, social democratic opinions. Indeed , one may even extend this comparison to the opinions of the most extreme radicals of the Socialist Party in thought and action. If we go no further than the opinions of such men, it may be said that Woodrow Wilson's criticism of the present social order agrees almost word for word with the sentiments expressed even by Lenin and Trotsky, the gravediggers of modern civil ization, of whom it may be said that, if their rule continues too long, even in a few places, it will signify the death of modern civilization and must of necessity lead to the destruction of all the attainments of modern civilization. In spite of this we must give expression to the pa radox: Woodrow Wilson, who certainly imagined a very diffe rent reconstruction of social conditions from that of these destroyers of society , directs almost literally the same criticism against the present order as these others , and he comes to the same conclusion that legal and political conceptions in their prese nt form are obsolete, and are no longer fitted to deal with the economic system. And, stran ge to say, when we try to find something positive and to test what Woodrow Wilson has produc ed in order to construct a new social organism, we find hardly any answer, only a few mea sures here and there, which have even been proposed elsewhere by someone much less scathi ng in his criticism. But he gives no answer to the question relative to the changes nece ssary in legal matters, in political conceptions and impulses, in order that these may c ontrol the demands of modern economic life and render it possible for them to in tervene in its activities. Here we find that out of modern life itself emerges the second aspect of the social question, that of law and equity. A foundation must first be sought for the necessary legal and political conditions for the State which must e xist in order to be able to grapple with and dominate modern economic organizations. We ask: how can we attain to a state of rights, to political impulses, which can meet the g reat demands of the problem? This is the second aspect of the social question. If we contemplate life itself we shall find that th e social life of man is threefold. Three aspects are clearly distinguished in him when we co nsider him as a member of human society. If he is to contribute his share, as he ce rtainly must, to the well-being of the social order in modern society, if he is to add to the wel fare of the community by cooperation, in the production of values, of commodities, he must f irst of all possess individual capacity, individual talent, ability. In the second place, he must be able to live at peace with his fellow-men and to work harmoniously with them. Thir dly, he must be able to find his proper place, from which he can further the interes ts of the community by his work, by his activity, by his achievements. With respect to the first of these the individual i s dependent on human society for the development of his capacities and talents, for the training of his intellect, so that the educated intelligence in him may become at the same time his guide in his physical work. For the second, the individual is dependent on the existence of a social edifice in which he can live in peace and harmony with his fellow-me n. The first has to do with the cultural side of life. In the following lectures we shall se e the dependence of the intellectual life on the first aspect. The second leads us into the doma in of equity, and this can only develop in accordance with its own nature, if a social structu re has been established which enables"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"people to work together peacefully and labor for on e another. And the economic aspect, this modern economic organization is compared, as I have described it, by Woodrow Wilson to a man who has outgrown his clothes, so th at his limbs protrude on all sides. These outgrown garments represent to Woodrow Wilson the old legal and political conceptions which the economic body has long since outgrown. The growth of the economic organization beyond the old cultural and p olitical organizations was always strongly felt by socialist thinkers, and we need on ly look at one thing in order to find the forces at work there. As we know (we shall go into all these matters more minutely afterwards), the modern proletariat is completely under the influence of Ma rxism, as it is called. Marxism, or the Marxist doctrine of the conversion of the private o wnership of means of production into public ownership, has been much modified by followe rs and opponents of Karl Marx, but Marxism has, nevertheless, a strong influence on th e minds, the views of life, of great masses of people at the present day, and it shows i tself distinctly in the chaotic social events of our time. If we take up the undoubtedly remarkab le and interesting little book by Friedrich Engels, the friend and collaborator of Ka rl Marx, Socialism in its Evolution from Utopia to Science, and acquaint ourselves with the whole train of thought in this book, we shall see how a socialist thinker regards economics in its relationship to the political and cultural life of modern times. We must fully unders tand one sentence, for instance, which occurs in a summary in Engels's little book: ‘In future there must be no more governments over men, over individuals, but only leadership by the branches of economic life and control of production.’ These are weighty words. They mean that the holders of such views desire that something in the economic life should cease, someth ing which, following the modern evolutionary impulses, has become a part of the eco nomic life. The economic aspect of life has to a great extent over-spread everything, becau se it has outgrown both political and cultural life, and it has acted like a suggestion o n the thoughts, feelings, also on the passions of men. And thus it becomes ever more evident that the manner in which the business of a nation is carried on determines, in reality, the cu ltural and political life of the people. It becomes ever more evident that the commercial and i ndustrial magnates, by their position alone, have acquired the monopoly of culture. The e conomically weak remain the uneducated. A certain connection has become apparen t between the economic and the cultural, and between the cultural and the politica l organization. The cultural life has become more and more one which does not evolve out of its own inner needs and does not follow its own impulses, but which, especially when it is under public administration, as in schools and educational institutions, receives the form most useful to the political authority. The human being can no longer be judged according to his capacities; he can no longer be developed as his inborn talents demand. B ut it is asked: ‘What does the State want? What talents are needed for business? How man y men are wanted with a particular training?’ The teaching, the schools, the examinati ons are all directed to this end. The cultural life cannot follow its own laws of develop ment; it is adapted to the political and the economic life. The immediate effect of this tendency, which we hav e seen especially of late, has been to make the economic system dependent on the politi cal system. Men like Marx and Engels saw this union of economics, politics, and culture; they saw that the new economic life was"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"no longer compatible with the old political form, n or with the old form of culture. They came to the conclusion that the life of rights, the old life of rights, and the cultural life must be excluded from the economic life. But they were l ed into a singular error of judgment, of which we shall have much to say in. these lectures. They regarded the economic life, which they could see with their own eyes, as. the sole re ality. The cultural life and the life of equity they saw as ideology, and they believed that the economic life could bring forth out of itself the new political, and the new cultural c onditions. So the belief arose — the most fatal of errors — that the economic system must be carried on in a definitely ordered manner. If this were done, they thought, then out o f that economic system the cultural life, laws, state-life and politics must come of themselv es. How was it possible for this error of judgment to a rise? Only because the real structure of human economy, actual labor in the economic syst em, was concealed behind what is usually called finance. The financial system made i ts appearance in Europe as an accompaniment of certain events. If we look more de eply into history we shall see that about the time when the Reformation and the Renaiss ance brought a new spirit into European civilization, treasures of gold and silver were opened up in America, and caused an influx of gold and silver, especially from Centr al and South America, into Europe. What was formerly an exchange of natural products was gr adually replaced by the financial system. The natural system of economics could be di rected to that which the soil yielded, that is to say, to actuality. Under this system the capacity of the individual with his productive powers could be taken into account; that is, his value as a worker and that of the actual substance of the commodity could be seen in proper relationship. We shall see in these lectures how, with the circulation of money, the importance attached to the essential elements in economics gradually disappeared; with t he substitution of finance for the system of natural economy, a veil has, as it were, been drawn over the whole economic life; its actual requirements could no longer be perceive d. With what does the economic system provide us? With commodities for our consumption. W e need not pause to-day to distinguish between mental and physical commodities , for the former may also be included in the economic system and used for human consumpti on. The economic system, then, provides commodities and these commodities are valu es, because the individual needs them, because he desires them. The individual must attach a certain value to a commodity, and in this way the latter acquires an objective va lue within the social body, and this value is closely connected with the subjective valuation resulting from the individual's private judgment. But how is the value of commodities expre ssed which may be said to represent the importance of these commodities in the social a nd economic life? It is expressed by the price. We shall have more to say later about value and price; to-day I will only say that in economic intercourse, indeed, in social intercourse generally, in so far as the buying and selling of products is concerned, the value of the products for the consumer is expressed by the price. It is a great error to confound the valu e of commodities with the money price, and people will find out by degrees, not by theoret ical deliberations, but in practice, that the value of commodities produced by the economic b ody and that which is the result of human, subjective judgment, or of certain social an d political conditions, is very different from all that is expressed in the price and in the conditions created by money. But the value of commodities has been concealed in recent times b y the conditions governing prices. This lies at the basis of modern social conditions as the third aspect of the social question. People will learn to recognize the social question as an economic question, when"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"they again begin to give due weight to that which f ixes the actual value of commodities, as compared with all that finds expression in the mere prices. Price standards cannot be maintained, especially in moments of crisis, except when the State, i.e. the domain of law, guarantees the value of money, that is, the value o f a single commodity. Without entering into any theoretical consideration regarding the re sult of misunderstanding the difference between price and value, we can cite something whic h has actually taken place of late. We read in the literature of political economy that lo ng ago in Central Europe and until the end of the Middle Ages the old system of natural econom y was in use. This was built up on the mere exchange of commodities, and its place was tak en by the financial system, in which current coin represents commodities and in which on ly the commodity value is actually exchanged for money. But there is something new mak ing its appearance in social life which seems likely to take the place of the financi al system. This new element is everywhere at work, but it passes unnoticed as yet. Anyone who can see through the mere figures in his cashbook and ledger, and can read th e language of these figures, will find that they do not merely represent the value of commoditi es, but that the figures often express what we may call the conditions of credit in the ne west sense of the word. What a man can do, because someone believes him to be capable of i t, that which can awaken confidence in the man's capacity, this, strange as it may seem, b egins to appear more and more frequently in our dull, dry, business life. Look into business books and you will find that as against the mere money values, mutual confidence, belief in hum an capacity is beginning to be evident. In modern business books, when we know how to read them, a great change is expressed, a social metamorphosis. When it is said that the old natural economy has given place to the financial system, it must now be added that, in the third place, finance is giving way to credit. With this change the place of an old institution ha s again been taken by something new. Thereby a new element appears in social life, the v alue of the human being. The economic body itself, as far as the production of values is concerned, is on the verge of a transformation. It is faced by a problem. This is t he third aspect of the social question. In these lectures we shall have to learn to look at the social question (a) as a cultural question, (b) as one of law, of the State or politi cs, and (c) as an economic question. The spirit must give the answer to the following: H ow can men be made strong and capable, so that a social structure may arise witho ut the present evils, which are unjustifiable? The second question is: Under the advanced conditio ns of the present economic life, what is the political system or system of equity wh ich can lead men to live in peace again? The third is: What social structure will enable eac h individual to find the place from which he can work for the human community and its w elfare, as well as his nature, his talents and capacities permit? We shall be led to t he answer by the question: What credit can be attached to the personal value of a human be ing? Here we see the transformation of the economic system out of new conditions. A cultural, a political, and an economic problem ar e all contained in the social question, and we shall see that the smallest detail of that q uestion can only appear in its true light"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"when we look at it as a whole, fundamentally, in th ese three aspects cultural, legal-political, and economic."}]
