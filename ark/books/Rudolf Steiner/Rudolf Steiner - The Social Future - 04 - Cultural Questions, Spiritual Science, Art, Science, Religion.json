SPIRITUAL SCIENCE (ART, SCIENCE , RELIGION). THE NATURE OF EDUCATION. SOCIAL ART. WHEN we look over the history of the last few years and ask ourselves how the social problems and needs occupying the public mind for mo re than half a century have been dealt with, we can find only one answer. Although i n the greater part of the civilized world, opportunity to carry out in practice their ideas of reconstructing social life was given to people who, after their own fashion, had devoted th emselves for decades to the study of social problems, yet it must be regarded as extreme ly characteristic of the age that all the theories and all the views which are the result of half a century of social work from every quarter have shown themselves powerless to reconstr uct the present social conditions. Of late years, much has been destroyed and, in the eyes of all observant persons, little, or probably nothing, built up. Does not the questio n force itself here upon the human soul: What is the cause of this impotence of so-called ad vanced views, in the face of some positive task? Shortly before the great catastrophe of the World-War, in the spring of 1914, I ventured to answer this question in a short serie s of lectures which I delivered in Vienna before a small audience. A larger number of hearers would probably have treated what was said with ridicule. In regard to all the assumption s of the so-called experts in practical affairs as to the immediate future, I ventured to s ay that an exact observer of the inner life of humanity could see in the social conditions prev ailing all over the civilized world something like an abscess, like a social disease, a kind of cancerous growth, which must inevitably very soon break out in a terrible manner over this world. Those practical statesmen, who were then talking of the “improvemen t in political relations” and the like, looked upon this as the pessimism of an idealist. B ut that was the utterance of a conviction gained by a study of human evolution from the point of view of spiritual science, which I will describe to you this evening. To this kind of research the building known as the Dornach Building, the Goetheanum, is dedicated. Sit uated in the corner of the northwest of Switzerland, this building is the outer representat ive of the movement whose object is the study of the spiritual science of which I speak. Yo u will hear and read all kinds of assertions about the aims and object of this building and the meaning of the movement which it is intended to represent. And it may be said in most c ases that the gossip about these things is the very opposite of the truth; mysterious nonsense , false and senseless mysticism, many varieties of obscure nonsense are attached to the w ork attempted by this movement in the building at Dornach representing it. It cannot be e xpected that anything but misunderstandings without number should still exist regarding this movement of spiritual life. In reality, the meaning of the movement is to be found in its striving with set purpose to bring about a renewal of our whole civilization, as it is expressed in art, religion, science,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"education, and other human activities; in fact, it may truly be said that a renewal is sorely needed from the very foundations of social life upw ards. This stream of spiritual life leads us to the conviction, already indicated by me. in t hese lectures, that it is no longer of any use to devise net schemes for world-improvement; fr om its very nature, human evolution demands a transformation of thoughts and ideas, of the most intimate life of feeling of humanity itself . Such a transformation is the aim of spiritual sci ence, as it is represented in this movement. Spiritual science stimulates the bel ief that the views of society, of which we have just spoken, proceed from the old habits of th ought which have not kept pace with the evolution of humanity and are no longer suited to i ts present life. These views have been clearly proved useless in aiding the reconstruction of social life. What we need is understanding. What is really the m eaning of all the subconscious yearnings, of the demands, which have not yet penet rated into the conscious thought of our present humanity? What do they mean, above all thin gs, with regard to art, with regard to science, religion, and education? Let us look at th e new directions followed by art, especially of late! I know well that in giving the following little sketch of the development of art, I must inevitably give offence to many; indeed , what I am going to say will be taken by many as a proof of the most complete lack of unders tanding of the later schools of art. If we except a few isolated, very commendable effor ts of recent years, the chief characteristic in the development of modern art is that it has lost that inner impulse which should drive it to place before the world that whic h is felt by humanity as a pressing need. The opinion has grown more and more common that, in contemplating a work of art. we must ask: How much of the spirit and significance o f outer reality does it express? How far is external nature or human life reflected in art? One need only ask, what meaning has such a criterion with respect to a “Raphael”, or a “Leon ardo”, or to any other real work of art? Do we not see in such great works of art that the r esemblance to the outer reality surrounding us is by no means the measure of their greatness? Do we not see the measure of their greatness in the creation of something fro m within that is far removed from the immediate outer reality? What worlds are those that unroll before us as we gaze at the now almost effaced picture at Milan, Leonardo's Last Supper , or when we stand before a “Raphael”? Is it not a matter of secondary importan ce that those painters have succeeded more or less well in depicting the laws of nature i n their work? Is it not their chief aim to tell us something of a, world which we do not see w hen we only use our eyes, when, we perceive only with our outer senses ? And do we not find more and more that the only criterion now applied in judging a, work of art, or in judging anything artistic, is whether the thing is really true, and “true” here is to be understood in the ordinary naturalistic sense of the word. Let us ask ourselves — strange a s the question may appear to the holders of certain artistic views — what does an art confer on life, actually on social life, what is an art, which aspires to nothing higher, than the repr oduction of a part of external reality? At the time in which modern capitalism and modern t echnical science became a power, landscape painting began to be developed in the wor ld of art. I know, of course, that landscape painting is justified, fully justified fr om an artistic point of view. But it is also true, that no artistically perfect landscape painti ng, however perfect, equals in any sense the scene lying before me, as I stand on a mountain side and contemplate Nature's: own landscape. Precisely the rise of landscape painting shows to what an extent art has taken refuge in the mere imitation of nature, which it ca n never equal. Art turned to landscape"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"painting because it had lost touch with the spiritu al world; it could no longer create out of the spiritual and supersensible world., What will b e the future of art, if it is inspired only by the recent impulses toward naturalistic art? Art su ch as this can never grow out of life, as a flower grows from its roots; it will be a luxury ou tside life, an object of desire for those only for whom life has no cares. Is it not comprehensibl e that people who are absorbed in the pressing cares of life from morning till evening, w ho are shut off from all culture, the object of which is the understanding of art, should feel t hemselves separated as by an abyss from art? Though one hardly dare to put the sentiment in to words now-a-days, because to many it would stamp the speaker as a philistine, it is d istinctly evident in social life that great numbers of people look on art as something remote, and unconsciously feel it to be a luxury of life, something that does not belong to e very human life, and to every existence worthy of a human being, although, in truth, it bri ngs completion to every human life worthy of the name. Naturalistic art will always be in one sense a luxu ry for those whose lives are free from care, and who are able to educate themselves in tha t art. I felt this when I was teaching for some years in a working-men's college, where I had the opportunity of addressing the workers themselves directly in order to help them u nderstand the socialist theories which were being instilled into their minds, to their rui n, by those who called themselves “leaders of the people.” I learnt to understand — forgive th e personal remark — what it means to bring scientific knowledge from a purely human stan dpoint (See: Appendix VII ) within reach of those unspoiled minds. From a longing to k now something also about modern art a request was made by my students that I take them th rough the museums and picture galleries on Sundays. Though it was possible, of co urse, to explain a great deal to them, since they had themselves the desire to be educated , I knew quite well that what I said did not at all make the same impression on these minds as did the things that I had told them from the standpoint of universal humanity. I felt t hat it would be a cultural untruth to tell them about the luxury art of the later naturalistic school, so far removed from actual life. This on the one hand. On the other hand, do we not see, how art has lost its connection with life? Here, too, praiseworthy endeavors have come to light in the la st few decades; but these have been by no means decided enough, though much has been done in the direction of industrial art. We see how inartistic our everyday surroundings hav e become. Art has made an illusory progress. All the buildings around us with which we come in contact in our daily routine are as devoid of artistic beauty as possible. Pract ical life cannot be raised to artistic form, because art has separated itself from life. Art whi ch merely imitates nature cannot design tables and chairs and other articles of utility in such a manner that when we see them, we at once have the feeling of something artistic. The se objects must transcend nature as human life transcends itself. If art merely imitate s, it fails in the shaping of practical life, and practical life thereby becomes prosaic, uninter esting and dry, because we are unable to give it an artistic form and to surround ourselves with beautiful objects in our everyday lives. This might be further amplified. I shall only indic ate the decided direction which the evolution of our art has nevertheless taken. In lik e manner we have moved in other domains of modern civilization. Have we not seen th at science has gradually ceased to proclaim to us the foundation which lies at the bas e of all sense-life? Little wonder that art"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"has not found the way out of the world of sense sin ce science itself has lost that way. By degrees science has come to the point of merely reg istering the outer facts of the senses, or at most to comprise them in natural laws. Intellect ualism of the most pronounced type has over-spread all modern scientific activity to an ev er increasing degree, and a terrible fear prevails among scientists lest they should be unabl e to exclude everything but intellectualism in their research, lest something l ike imaginative or artistic intuitions should perchance find their way into science. It is easy to see by what is said and written on this subject by scientists themselves how great is the terror they experience at the thought that any other means than the dry, sober intellect and the investigation by sense-perception should find entrance into scientific research. In e very activity which does not keep strictly to intellectual thought men do not get far enough a way from cuter reality to judge it correctly. Thus the modern researcher, the modern s cientist, strives to carry on his work by intellectualism only; because he believes he can by this means get away far enough from the reality to judge it, as he says, quite objectiv ely. Here the question might perhaps be asked: Is it not possible through intellectualism t o get so far away from reality that we can no longer experience it? And it is this intellectua lism, above all, which has made it impossible for us to conquer reality by science, as I have already indicated in these lectures and into which I will enter more fully today. Turning to the religious life: with what mistrust a nd disapproval is every attempt to penetrate into the spiritual world by means of spir itual science received by the religious communities! On what grounds? People are quite igno rant of the reason of their disapproval. From official quarters we learn of a s cience which is determined to keep to the mere world of the senses, and we hear that in these official quarters the claim is apparently allowed that it is only in this way that strict and true scientific knowledge can be attained. But the student of historical evolution does not vi ew the matter in this light. To him it appears that for the last few centuries the religio us bodies have more and more laid claim to he the only authority in matters relating to the spirit and soul, and have recognized as valid only those opinions which they themselves per mit the people to hold. Under the influence of this claim to the monopoly of knowledg e by the Church, the sciences have neglected the study of everything except the outer sense-perceptions, or at most they have attempted to penetrate into the higher regions with a few abstract conceptions. They believe they are doing this purely in the interests of exact science, and do not dream that they are influenced by the Church's pretension to t he monopoly of knowledge, the knowledge of the spirit and the soul as contained i n their religious creeds. What has been forbidden to the sciences for centuries, the scienc es themselves now declare to be an absolute condition for the exactness of their resea rch, for the objective truth of their work. Thus it has happened that the religious communities having failed to develop their insight into the world of soul and spirit, and having prese rved the old traditions, now see in the new methods of spiritual research, in the new paths of approach to the soul and spirit, an enemy to all religion, whereas they ought to recogn ize in these new methods the very best friends of religion. We shall now speak of these three regions of cultur e, art, science, and religion. For it is the mission of Anthroposophy or spiritual science t o build up a new structure in these three regions of culture. To explain what I mean, I must indicate in a few words the vital point of spiritual science. Its premises are very different from those of science as it is commonly known today. It fully recognizes the methods of mod ern science, fully recognizes also the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"triumphs of modern science. But because spiritual s cience believes it understands the methods of research of modern science better than t he scientists themselves, it feels compelled to take other ways for the attainment of knowledge regarding spirit and soul than those which are still regarded by large number s of people as the only right ones. In consequence of the enormous prejudice entertained a gainst all research into the higher worlds, great errors and misunderstandings have bee n spread abroad regarding the aims of the Dornach movement. That here is truly no false m ysticism, nothing in any way obscure in this movement, is plainly evident in my endeavor s in the beginning of the 'nineties, which formed the starting-point for the spiritual-s cientific movement to which I allude, and of which the Building at Dornach is the representat ive. At that time I collected the material which seemed to me then most necessary for the soci al enlightenment of today in my Philosophy of Spiritual Activity . Whoever reads that book will hardly accuse the spiritual science of which I speak of false mystici sm; but he may see what a difference there is between the idea of human freedom contained in m y book and the idea of freedom as an impulse prevalent in our modern civilization. As an example of the latter, I might give Woodrow W ilson's idea of freedom; an extraordinary one, but very characteristic of the c ulture, the civilization of our age. He is honest in his demand for freedom for the political life of the present day. But what does he mean by freedom? We arrive at an understanding of h is meaning when we read words like the following: ‘A ship moves freely,’ he says, ‘whe n it is adapted to all the forces which act upon it from the wind, from the waves, and so on. W hen its construction is exactly adapted to its environment, no hindrance to its progress ca n arise through the forces of wind or wave. Man must also he able to motive freely throug h life, by adapting himself to the forces with which he comes in contact in life, so that no hindrance may ever come to him from any direction.’ He also compares the life of a free human being with a part of a machine, saying: ‘We say of a part, built into a machine, th at it can move freely when it has no connection with anything anywhere; and when the res t of the machine is so constructed that this part runs freely within it.’ I have just one thing to say to this; we can only speak of freedom with regard to the human being when we see in it the very opposite of such an adaptation to the environment, we can only speak of human freedom when we compare it, not with the freedom of a ship on the sea, perfectl y adapted to the forces of wind and weather, but when we compare it with the freedom of a ship that can stop and turn against wind and weather, and can do so without regarding t he forces to which it is adapted. That is to say, at the bottom of such an idea of freedom as this lies the whole mechanical conception of the world, yet at the present day it is considered to be the only possible one. This world-conception is the result of the mere int ellectualism of modern times. In my Philosophy of Spiritual Activity Philosophy of Spiritual Activity I have felt compelled to take a stand against views of this kind. I know very well — forgive another personal remark — that this book has fragments of the Europe an philosophical conception of the world, out of which it is born, still clinging to i t, as a chicken sometimes retains fragments of the eggshell from which it has emerged. For the book has. of course, grown out of European philosophical world-conceptions. It was ne cessary to show in that book the erroneous thought in those world-conceptions. For t his reason the book may appear to some to be pedantic, though this was by no means my intention. The contents are intended to work as an impulse in the immediate practice of life, so that, through the ideas developed in that book, the impulse thus generated in the human will may flow directly"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"into human life. For this reason, however, I was obliged to state th e problem of human freedom quite differently from the usual manner of doing so where ver we turn, throughout the centuries of human evolution, the question regarding the free dom of human will and of the human being has been: Is man free, or is he not free? I w as under the necessity of showing that the question in this form was wrongly framed and must b e put from a different standpoint. For if we take that which modern science and modern hum an consciousness look upon as the real self , but which ought to be regarded as the natural self , then, certainly, that being can never he free. That self must act of inner necessit y. Were man only that which he is held to be by modern science, then his idea of freedom woul d be the same as that of Woodrow Wilson's. But this would be no real freedom; it wou ld be only what might be called with every single action the inevitable result of natura l causes. But modern human consciousness is not much aware of the other self w ithin the human being where the problem regarding freedom really begins. Modern hum an consciousness is only aware of the natural self in man; it regards him as a being subject to natur al causality. But those who penetrate more deeply into the human being must ref lect that man can become something more in the course of his life than that with which nature has endowed him. We first discover what the human being really is, when we re cognize that one part of him is that with which he is born, and all that which he has in herited; the other part is that which he does not owe to his bodily nature, but which he can make of himself by awakening the real self slumbering within him. Because these things are tr ue I have not asked: Is man free or not free? I have stated the question in the followi ng way: Can man become a free being through inner development, or can he not? And the a nswer is: He can become free if he develops within himself that which otherwise slumbe rs, but can be awakened; he can only then become free. Man's freedom is not a gift of na ture. Freedom belongs to that part of man which he can, and must, awaken within himself. But if the ideas contained in my Philosophy of Spiritual Activity are to be further developed and applied to externa l social life, so that these truths may become clear to a larger circle of people, it will be necessary to build a superstructure of the truths o f spiritual science on the foundation of that philosophy. It had to be shown that by taking his evolution into his own hands, man is really able to awaken a slumbering being within him . I endeavored to do this in my book, Knowledge of the Higher Worlds , and in the other books which I have contributed t o the literature of spiritual science. In these books I tried to show that the human being can indeed take his own evolution in hand and that only by so doing, and thus making of it something different from that to which he is born, can he rise to a real knowledge of soul and spirit. It is true that this view is considered by a large part of humanity at the present day to be a most unattractive one. For what does it presuppose? It presupposes that we attain to something like intellectual humility. But few desire this today. I will explain what I mean by this quality of intellectual humility, to w hich we must attain. Suppose we give a volume of Goethe's lyric poems to a child of five. The child will certainly not treat the book as it deserves; he wil l tear it to pieces, or spoil it in some other way. In any case he does not know how to value such a book. But suppose the child to have grown ten or twelve years older, that he has been t aught. and trained; then he will treat Goethe's lyric poems in a different manner. And yet there is no great difference externally between a child of five and one of twelve or fourte en with a book of Goethe's poems before him. The difference lies within the child. He has d eveloped so that he knows what to do"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"with such a volume. As the child feels towards the volume of Goethe's lyrics, so must the man feel towards nature, the cosmos, the whole univ erse, when he begins to think seriously of soul and spirit. He must acknowledge to himself that, in order to read and understand what is written in the book of nature and the unive rse, he must do his utmost to develop his inner self, just as the five-year-old child must be taught in order to understand Goethe's lyric poems. We must acknowledge with intellectual humility our impotence to penetrate the universe with understanding by means of the nat ural gifts with which we are born; and we must then admit that there may be ways of se lf-development and of unfolding the inner powers of our being to see in that which lies spread out before the senses the living spirit and the living soul . My writings to which I have referred show that it is possible to put this in practice. This must be said, because in tellectualism, the fruit of evolution of the last few centuries, is no longer able to solve the riddles of life. Into one region of life, that of inanimate nature, it is able to penetrate, but it i s compelled to halt before human reality, more especially social reality. That quality which I have called intellectual humil ity must be the groundwork of every true modern conception of the impulse towards freed om. It must also be the groundwork of all real insight into the transformation necessa ry in art, religion, and science. Here intellectuality has plainly, only too plainly, show n that it can attain no real knowledge which truly perceives and attains to the things of the soul and spirit. As I leave already pointed out, it has confined itself to the outer wo rld of the senses and to the combining and systematizing of perceptions Hence it has been unab le to prevail against the pretensions of the religious bodies, which have also not attained to a new knowledge of matters pertaining to the soul and spirit, but have on this account ca rried into modern times an antiquated view, unsuited to the age. But one thing must be co nquered, that is the fear I have already described, the fear that we might become too much i nvolved in the objects of the senses, in our endeavors to gain a spiritual knowledge of them . It is so easy to call oneself a follower of intellectualism, because, when we occupy ourselv es merely with abstract ideas, even of modern science, we are so far removed from the real ity that we only view it in perspective, and there is no danger of our being in any way infl uenced by the reality. But with the knowledge that is meant here, which we gain for our selves when we take our own evolution in hand, with such knowledge we must descend into t he realities of life, we must plunge into the profoundest depths of our own nature, deep er than those reached by mere self-training in intellectualism. Within the bounds of intellectualism, we only reach the upper strata of our own life. If with the help of t he knowledge here spoken of, we descend into the depths of our own inner nature, we find th ere not only thoughts and feelings, a mere reflection of the outer world, we find there h appenings, facts of our inner being, from which the merely intellectual thinker would recoil in horror; but which are of the same kind as those within nature herself, of the same ki nd as those which happen in the world. Then, within our own nature, we learn to know the n ature of the world. We cannot learn to know that life of the world if we go no further tha n mere abstract conceptions or the laws of nature. We must penetrate so far that our own inmos t being becomes one with reality. We must not fear to approach reality; our inner develo pment must carry us so far that we can stand firm in the presence of reality, without bein g consumed, or scorched, or suffocated. When we stand in the presence of reality, no longer held at a distance by the intellect, we are able to grasp the truth of things. Thus we find described in my book, Knowledge of the Higher Worlds , the inner development of the human being to the s tage of spiritual"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"knowledge at which he becomes one with reality, but in such wise that, being merged in reality, he can imbibe from it knowledge which is n ot a distant perception by means of the intellect, but is instead saturated with reality it self and for this reason can merge with it. You will find that one characteristic feature of th e spiritual science which occupies us here is that it can plunge into reality, that it do es not merely speak of an abstract spirit, but of the real, tangible spirit, living in our environ ment surrounding us just as the things of the sense-world surround us. Abstract observations are the fruit of modern intellectualism. Take up any new work, with the exception of pure na tural science or pure philosophy, and you will find the conception of life it contains, o ften a would-be philosophical view, is far removed from actual life or from a real knowledge o f things. Read what is said about the will in one of the newer books on psychology, and y ou will find that there is no profound meaning underlying the words. The ideas of those wh o devote themselves to such studies have not the power actually to penetrate to the cor e, even of nature herself. To them matter is a thing outside, because they cannot penetrate i t in spirit. I should like to elucidate this by an example. In one of my last books, Riddles of the Soul , ( Von Seelenraetseln , not translated [yes it is, e.Ed.]. Anthroposophic Press, New York.) I have shown how an opinion of long standing, prevailing in natural science, must be overcome by modern spiritual science. I know how very paradoxical my words must sound to many. But i t is just those truths which are able to satisfy the demands — already making themselves hea rd and becoming more and more insistent as time goes on — for a new kind of thoug ht which will often appear paradoxical, when compared with all that is still looked upon as authoritative. Every modern scientist who has occupied himself with the subject maintains that there are two kinds of nerves (See: Appendix VIII ) in human and animal life (we are now only concern ed with human life), one set, leading from the sense organs to th e central organ, is the sensory nerves, which are stimulated by sense-perceptions, the stim ulus communicating itself to the nerve center. The second kind of nerves, the so-called mo tor nerves, pass from the center out to the limbs. These motor-nerves enable us to use our limbs. They are said to be the nerves of volition, while the others are called the sensory n erves. Now I have shown in my book, Riddles of the Soul , though only in outline, that there is no fundamental difference between the sensory an d the so-called motor nerves or nerves of volition, and that the latter are not subject to the will. The instances brought forward to support the statement that these nerves are obedien t to the will as is shown by the terrible disease of locomotor ataxia really prove the exact opposite, which can easily be shown. They, indeed, prove the truth of my contention. The se so-called voluntary nerves are also sensitive nerves. While the other sensitive nerves pass from the sense organs to the central organ, so that the outer sense-perceptions may be t ransmitted to it, the voluntary nerves, as they are called, which do not differ from the other set, perceive that which is movement within ourselves. They are endowed with the percept ion of movement. There are no voluntary nerves. The will is of a purely spiritual nature, purely spirit and soul, and functions directly as spirit and soul. We use the s o-called voluntary nerves, because they are the sensory nerves for the limb which is going to move and must be perceived if the will is to move it. For what reason do I give this examp le? Because countless treatises on the will exist at the present day, or may be read and h eard, in which the will is dealt with. But the ideas developed have not the impelling power to advance to real knowledge, to press"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"forward to the sight of will in its working. Such k nowledge remains abstract and foreign to life. While such ideas are current, modern science will continue to tell us of motor nerves, of nerves of volition. Spiritual science evolves id eas regarding the will which at the same time show us the nature of the physical human nervo us system. Spiritual science will penetrate the phenomena and facts of nature. Instea d of remaining in regions foreign to life, it will find its way into reality. It will ha ve the courage to permeate material things with the spirit, not to leave them outside as things apa rt. For spiritual science everything is spiritual. Spiritual science will be able to pierce the surface and penetrate into the social order, and will work for a reality in social life, which baffles our abstract, intellectual natural science. And thus, spiritual science will a gain proclaim a spiritual knowledge, a new way of penetrating into the psychic and the spiritu al in the universe. It will proclaim boldly that those spiritual worlds, represented in picture s envisioned by artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci, can no longer suffice for us. In accordance with the progress of human evolution, we must find a new way into the spiritual world. But if we learn to understand the spiritual world anew, if we penetrate into that world, not in the nebulous manner of pantheism, by a continual repeti tion of the word “spirit”, a universal, abstract, vague spirit which “must he there”: if we pierce through to the real phenomena of the spiritual world not by spiritualism, but by the development of the human forces of spirit and soul in the manner described above, then again we shall know of a spiritual world in the only way adapted to the present develo pment of humanity. Then the mysteries of the spiritual world will reveal themselves to us , and then something will happen of which Goethe spoke. Although he was only a beginner in the things which modern spiritual science goes on developing in accordance with his o wn spirit, but of which he had a premonition, Goethe beautifully expressed that whic h will happen in the words: “He to whom nature begins to reveal her open secrets, expe riences a profound longing for her worthiest exponent — art.” Once more will the artist receive a revelation fro m the spiritual world; he will then no longer be led astray in the belief that his portrayal of spiritual things in a material picture is an abstract, symbolic, lif eless allegory; he will know the living spirit and will be able to express that living spirit thro ugh material means. No longer will the perfect imitation of nature be considered the best part of a work of art, but the manifestation of that which the spirit has revealed to the artist. Once more an art will arise, filled with spirit, an art which is in no way symbo lical, in no way allegorical, which also does not betray its luxurious character by attempti ng to rival nature, to the perfection of which it can never attain. It demonstrates its nece ssity, its justification, in human life by proclaiming the existence of something of which the ordinary, direct beholding of nature, naturalism, can give us no information. And even if the artist's attempt to give expression to something spiritual be but a clumsy effort, he is g iving form to something which has a significance, apart from nature, because it transce nds nature. He makes no bungling attempts at that which nature can do better than he . A way opens here to that art in which a beginning has been made in the external structure a nd the external decoration of the Goetheanum at Dornach. The attempt has been made there to create a Univers ity of Spiritual Science for the work to be carried on within it. In all the paintin gs on the ceilings, the wood carvings, etc., an attempt has been made to give form to all that s piritual science reveals in that building. Hence the building itself is a natural development. No old architectural style could be followed here, because the spirit will be spoken of in a new way within it. Let us look at"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"nature and consider the shell of a nut; the kernel within determines the form of it; in nature every sheath is formed in accordance with th e requirements of the inner core. So the whole of the building at Dornach is formed in c onsonance with that which as music will one day resound within it; with those mystery drama s which will one day be presented there; with those revelations of spiritual science which will one day be uttered within its walls. Everything described here will echo in the w ood carvings, in the pillars, and in the capitals. An art as yet only in its beginnings, whi ch is really horn of a new spirit, altogether born of the spirit, is there represented. The artis ts who are working there are themselves their own severest critics. In such an undertaking one is, of course, exposed to misunderstandings; this is only natural. Objections are raised against the Dornach Building by visitors, who say: “These anthroposophists have filled their building with symbols and allegories.” Other visitors who increase in number from day to day, understand what they see here. Now the characteristic of the building is that it d oes not contain a single symbol or allegory; in the work attempted here the spirit has flowed into the immediate artistic form. That which is expressed here has nothing of symboli sm, nothing of allegory, but everything is something in its own form. Up to the present we have only been able to build a covering for a spiritual center of work; for external social conditions do not yet permit us to erect a railway station or even a bank building. For reason s, which may perhaps be easily comprehensible to you, we have not yet been able to find the style of a modern bank or of a modern department store; but they must also he foun d. Above all things, the way must be found along these lines to an artistic shaping of a ctual practical life. Just think of the social importance of art, even fo r our daily bread; for the preparation of bread depends on the manner in which people thin k and feel. It is a matter of great and social significance to men, that everything by which they are immediately surrounded in life should take on an ar tistic form; that every spoon, every glass, should have a form well adapted to its use, instead of a form chosen at random to serve the purpose; that one should see at a glance, from its form, what service a thing performs in life, and at the same time recognize it s beauty. Then for the first time large numbers of people will feel spiritual life to be a vital necessity, when spiritual life and practical life are brought into direct connection w ith each other. As spiritual science is able to throw light on the nature of matter, as I have s hown in the example of the sensory and motor nerves, so will art, born of spiritual scienc e, attain to the power of giving direct form to every chair, every table, to every man-created o bject. Since it is plainly evident that the gravest prejud ices and misunderstandings come from the churches, we may ask: What is the position fina lly reached by the religious creeds? If they have any justification at all, they must have a connection by their very nature with the spiritual world. But they have preserved into our p eriod of time old traditions of these worlds, grown out of very different conditions of t he human soul. Spiritual science strives to advance to the spiritual world, in accordance wi th the new mode of thought, with the new life of the soul. Should this be condemned by t he religious sentiment of humanity, if it understands itself aright? Is such a thing possible ? Never! What is the real aim of religious sentiment and of all religious work? Certainly not the proclamation of theories and dogmas pertaining to the higher worlds. The aim of all rel igious work should be to give all men an"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"opportunity to look up with reverence to higher wor lds. The work of religion is to inculcate reverence for the supersensible. Human nature needs this reverence. It needs to look up in reverence to the sublime in the spiritual worlds. I f human nature is denied the present mode of entrance, then, of course, the old way must still be kept open. But since this way is no longer suited to the thoughts of our day, it mus t be enforced, its recognition must be imposed by authority. Hence the external character of religious teaching as applied to modern human nature. An antiquated outlook on the h igher worlds is imposed by the religious teachers. Let us suppose that there are communities in which an understanding exists of the true nature of religion consisting in reverence for spir itual things. Must it not be to the highest interest of, such communities that their members sh ould develop a living knowledge of the unseen world? Will not those whose souls contain a vision of the supersensible, whose knowledge gives them a familiarity with those world s be the most likely to reverence them? Since the middle of the fifteenth century human evo lution has taken the line of development of the individuality, of the personalit y. To expect of anyone today that he should attain a vision or an understanding of the h igher worlds on authority, or in any other way than by the force of his own individualit y or personality, is to expect of him something which is against his nature. If he is all owed freedom of thought with respect to his knowledge of the supersensible he will unite wi th his fellow-men in order that reverence for the spiritual world, which everyone r ecognizes in his own personal way, may be encouraged in the community. When men have attai ned freedom of thought to approach knowledge of the spiritual world through their own individuality, then the common service of the higher worlds, true religion, will flourish. This will show itself especially in the conception of the Christ Himself. This conception was very different in earlier centuries from that e ven of many theologians of the later centuries, especially of the nineteenth. How greatl y has humanity fallen away from the perception of the true supersensible nature of the Christ, who lived in the man Jesus! How far is it removed from the understanding of that un ion of a supersensible being with a human body, through the Mystery of Golgotha, in ord er that the earth in its development might have a deeper meaning! That union of the supe rsensible with the things of the senses, which was consummated in the Mystery of Gol gotha, how little has it been understood even by theologians of a certain type in recent times! The man of Nazareth has been designated “the simple man of Nazareth”, the c onception of religion has become more and more materialistic. Since no one was able to fi nd a way into the higher worlds, suited to modern humanity, the supersensible path to the Chri st-Being was lost. Many who now believe that they are in communion with the Christ, only believe this. They do not dream how little their thought of Christ and their words concerning Him correspond to the experiences of those who draw near to the great Mys tery of Humanity with a spiritual knowledge that is suited to our time. It must be said that spiritual science makes absolu tely no pretension of founding a new religion. It is a science, a source of knowledge; b ut we ought to recognize in it the means for a rejuvenescence of the religious life of humanity. As it can rejuvenate science and art, so can it also renew religious life, the very great im portance of which must lie apparent to anyone who can appreciate the extreme gravity of th e social future. Much, very much has been said recently on the subject of education, yet it must be acknowledged that a large"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"part of the discussion does not touch the chief pro blem. I endeavored to deal with this problem in a series of educational lectures which I was asked to deliver to the teachers who are to form the staff of the Waldorf School in Stut tgart, which was founded last September [1919], in conformity with ideas underlying the Thr eefold Social Order. At the foundation of the school I not only endeavor ed to give shape to externals, corresponding to the requirements and the impulse o f the Threefold Order; I also strove to present pedagogy and didactics to the teaching-staf f of this new kind of school in such a light that the human being would be educated to fac e life and be able to bring about a social future in accordance with certain unconquerable ins tincts in human nature. It is evident that the old-fashioned system of normal training, w ith its stereotyped rules and methods of teaching, must be superseded. It is true nowadays t hat many people agree that the individuality of the pupil ought to be taken into a ccount in teaching. All sorts of rules are produced for the proper consideration of the child' s individuality. But the pedagogy of the future will not be a normal science; it will be a t rue art, the art of developing the human being. It will rest upon a knowledge of the whole m an. The teacher of the future will know that in the human being before him, who carries on development from birth through all the years of life, a spirit and soul element is working through the organs out to the surface. From the first year of school, he will see how ever y year new forces evolve from the depths of the child's nature. No abstract normal training can confirm this sight; only a living perception of human nature itself. Much has been sa id of late on the subject of instruction through observation and, within certain limits, thi s kind of tuition is justified. But there are things which cannot be communicated through externa l observation, yet which must be communicated to the growing child; but they can onl y be so communicated when the teacher, the educator, is animated by a true unders tanding of the growing human being, when he is able to see the inner growth of the chil d as it changes with every succeeding year; when he knows what the inner nature of the hu man being requires in the seventh, ninth, and twelfth years of his life. For only when education is carried on in accordance with nature, can the child grow strong for the batt le of life. One comes in contact with many shattered lives at the present day, many who do not know what to make of life, to whom it has nothing to offer. There are many more people wh o suffer from such disrupted lives than is commonly known. What is the reason.? It is because the teacher is unable to take note of important laws of the evolving human being. I will give only one instance of what I mean. How very often do we hear well-meaning teache rs say emphatically that one should develop in the child a clear understanding of what is being offered him as mental food. The result of this method in practice is banality, triv iality! The teacher descends artificially to the understanding of the child, and that manner of teaching has already become instinctive. If it is persisted in, and the child is trained in this false clarity of understanding, what is overlooked? A teacher of this kind does not know wh at it means to a man, say thirty-five years of age, who looks back to his childhood and r emembers: “My teacher told me such and such a thing when I was nine or ten years old; I believed it because I looked up with reverence to the authority of my teacher, and becau se there was a living force in his personality through which I was impressed by his wo rds. Now, looking back, I find that his words have lived on in me; now I can understand the m.” A marvellous light is shed on life by such an event, when through inner development we can look back in our thirty-fifth year at the lessons we have learnt out of love for our teacher which we could not understand at the time. That light, which is a forc e in life, is lost when the teacher descends"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"to the banality of the object-lesson, which is prai sed as an ideal method. The teacher must know what forces should be developed in the child, in order that the forces which are already in his nature, may remain with him througho ut his life. Then the child need not merely recall to memory what he learnt between his seventh and fifteenth years; what he then learnt is renewed again and again, and wears a new aspect in each successive stage of life. What the child learnt is renewed at every lat er epoch of life. The foregoing is an effort to place before you an i dea of the fundamental character of a system of pedagogy which, if followed, may truly gr ow into an art; by its practice the human being may take his place in life and find him self equal to all the demands of the social future. However much people may vaunt their social ideals, there are few who are at all capable of surveying life as a whole. But in th e carrying out of social ideals, a wide outlook on life is indispensable. People speak, for instance, of transferring the means of production to the ownership of the community and be lieve that by withdrawing them from the administration of the individual human being, m uch would be accomplished. I have already spoken on this point, and will go into the subject again more thoroughly in the following lectures. But assuming for a moment that it is possible to transfer the means of production to the ownership of the community at onc e, do you suppose that the community of the next generation would still own them? No! Fo r even if the means of production were transmitted to the next generation, it would be don e without taking into account the fact that this next generation would develop new and fru itful forces, which would transform the whole system of production, and thus render the old means useless. If we have any idea of molding social life. we must take part in life in i ts fullness, in all its phases. From a conception of man as a being composed of body, soul , and spirit, and from a real understanding of body, soul, and spirit, a new art of education will arise, an art which may truly be regarded as a necessity in social life. Arising from this way of thinking, something has de veloped within the spiritual movement, centered at Dornach, which has to a great extent met with misunderstanding. There are a number of persons who have learnt in th e course of years to think not unfavorably of our spiritual-scientific movement. B ut when we recently began, in Zurich and elsewhere, to give representations of the art k nown as eurythmy, an art springing naturally out of spiritual science itself, but, as we are fully aware, as yet only in its infancy, people began to exclaim that after all, spiritual s cience cannot be worth much, for to introduce such antics as an accompaniment to spirit ual science only shows that the latter is completely crazy. In such a matter as this, people do not consider how paradoxical anything must appear which works towards reconstitu ting the world on the basis of spiritual science. This art of eurythmy is a social art in the best sense; for its aim is, above all things, to communicate to us the mysteries of h uman nature. It uses the capacities for movement latent in the human being, bringing to exp ression these movements in a manner to be explained at the next representation of the e urythmic art. I will only mention here that eurythmy is a true art; for it reveals the dee pest secrets of human art itself by bringing to evidence a true speech, a visible speech express ed by the whole human being. But beside the mere movements of the body, founder on physiolo gical science and a study of the structure of the human form, eurythmy presents to u s at the same time a capacity of movement through which man, ensouled and inspired, yields himself up to movement. The purely physiological, gymnastic exercises of our ma terialistic age may also be taught to children, and they are now taught in the Waldorf Sc hool of which I have spoken. Ensouled"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"movement, however, actually employs the whole being , while gymnastics on physiological, merely material lines employs only a part of the wh ole nature of the human being, and therefore, unless supplemented by eurythmy, allows much to degenerate in the growing human being Out of the depths of human nature spiri tual life in a new form must enter into the most important branches of life. It will be my task in the next few days to show how external life may really be given a new form in the present and for the future, when th e impulse for the change comes from such a new spirit. Many people of all sorts, notewo rthy people, feel today the necessity of understanding spiritually the modern pressing deman ds of social life. It is painful to see the number of people who are still asleep as regards th ese demands, and the many others who approach them in a confused way as agitators. We fi nd faint indications of a feeling that none of the mere superficial programs can be of any use without a change of thought, of ideas, a new mode of learning from the spirit. But in many cases how superficial is the expression of that longing for a new spirit! We may say that the yearning for a new spirit is dimly and imperceptibly felt here and there in rema rkable men, who most certainly have no idea of that which the Dornach Building represen ts in the outer world. But the expression of a longing for this new spirit can be heard. I will give one out of many examples of this. In addition to the numerous memoirs published in co nnection with the disaster of the World War just ended, those of the Austrian Statesm an, Czernin, will soon appear. This book promises to be extremely interesting. It is di fficult to express what I wish to say without the risk of being misunderstood; I mean tha t it is interesting, because Czernin was a good deal less pretentious than the others who up to now have given expression to their opinions on the War, and he should therefore be len iently judged. In this book of Czernin's we may read something like the following passage: ‘The War continues, though in another form. I belie ve that coming generations will not call this great drama which has held the world in t hrall for five years, the World-War; they will call it the world-revolution and they wil l know that the world-revolution only began with the World-War. Neither the Peace of Vers ailles nor that of St. Germain will create a lasting effect. This peace contains within it the destructive germ of death. The conflicts which shake Europe are not yet on the wan e. As in a mighty earthquake, the subterranean rumbling still goes on. Now here, now there, the earth will continue to open and hurl fire towards heaven. Again and again events of elemental vehemence will sweep over the lands, bringing destruction in their train, till everything has been swept away, reminiscent of the madness of this War. Slowl y, out of: unspeakable sacrifice, a new world will be born. Coming generations will loo k back to our times as to a long, terrible dream. But the darkest night is followed b y the dawn. Generations have sunk into graves, murdered, starved, victims of disease. Millions have died in the effort to annihilate, to destroy, their hearts filled, with h atred and murder. But other generations will arise, and with them a new spirit. They will b uild up, what war and revolution have destroyed. Every winter is followed by spring. It i s an eternal law in the circuit of life that resurrection follows death. Happy those who ar e called upon to cooperate as soldiers of labor in the work of rebuilding the wor ld.’"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Even this man speaks of a new spirit.
