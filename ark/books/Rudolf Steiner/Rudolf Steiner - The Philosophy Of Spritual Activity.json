One of these problems concerns the possibility of attaining such insight into human nature that knowledge of man can become the foundation of all human knowledge and experience of life. We often feel that our experiences and the results of scientific investigations are not self-supporting; fu rther experiences or discoveries may shake our certitude. The othe r problem is: Has man any right to ascribe freedom to his will, or is freedom of will an illusion arising out of his inability to recognize the threads of necessity on which his will depends, just like a process in nature? This question is not ar tificially created. In a certain disposition it arises quite spontaneously in the human soul. And one feels that the soul lacks in stature if it has not at some time faced in deep seriousness the question of free will or necessity. In this book the intention is to show that the inner experiences caused by the second problem depend upon what attitude man is able to take toward the first problem. The attempt will be made to show that it is possible to attain such an insight into man’s nature, that this can support all the rest of his knowledge, and further that this insight completely justifies the concept of freedom of will, provided only that first the region of soul is discovered where free will can unfold. This insight in relation to the two problems is such that, once attained, it can become a living content of man’s soul life. A theore tical answer will not be given which, once acquired is merely carried about as a convi ction, retained by memory. For the whole manner of thinking on which this book is ba sed, such an answer would be no answer. Such a finished, limited answer will not be give n, but a region of experiences within the human soul will be pointed to, where, th rough the soul’s own inner activity, living answers to the questions are to be found ever anew and at every moment when man needs them. Once the region of soul is discovered where these questions unfold, a real insight into this region provides man with what he needs for the solution of these two problems of life so that, with what he has then attain ed, he can penetrate further into the breadth and depth of life’s riddles, as need or destiny leads him. - It will be seen that a knowledge has here been outlined, which proves its just ification and validity, not only through its own existence, but also through the relationship it has with the entire soul-life of man. These were my thoughts about the content of this book when I wrote it twenty-five years ago. Today, again I must write similarly if I am to characterize the aim of this book. In the first edition I limited myself to saying no more than was in the strictest sense connected with the two fundamental problem s described above. If anyone should be surprised at not finding in this book as yet, a ny reference to that region of the world of spiritual experience described in my later writin gs, then he must consider that at that time it was not my purpose to describe results of spiritual research, but first to lay the foundation on which such results can rest . This “Philosophy of Freedom” does not contain any special results of th is kind, any more than it c ontains special results of the natural sciences. But what it contains cannot , in my view, be dispensed with by anyone who strives for certainty in su ch knowledge. What I have said in this book can also be acceptable to many who, for reasons of their ow n, will have nothing to do with the results of my spiritual scientific research. But one who can regard these results of spiritual"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"scientific research as something to which he is drawn, will recognize as important what is attempted here. It is this: to prove that an open-minded considera tion of just the two problems I have indicated, problems which ar e fundamental to a ll knowledge, leads to recognition of the fact that man is living with in the reality of a sp iritual world. In this book the attempt is made to jus tify knowledge of the realm of spirit before entering upon spiritual experience. And this justification is unde rtaken in such a way that, for anyone able and willing to enter into this discussion, there is no nee d, in order to accept what is said here, to cast furtive glances at the expe riences which my later writings have shown to be relevant. Thus it seems to me that, on the one hand, this book occupies a position completely independent of my writings on actual spiritual scientific matters, and yet, on the other hand, it is also most intimately connected wi th them. All this has caused me now, after twenty-five years, to repub lish the content of this book practically una ltered in all essentials. I have, however, made additions of some length to several chapters. The misunderstandings of my argument which have come to my attention seemed to make these detailed extensions nece ssary. Alterations have been ma de only where what I said a quarter of a century ago appeared to me cl umsily expressed. (Only ill-will could find in these changes occasion to suggest that I have changed my fundamental conviction.) The book has been out of print for many years. Nevertheless, and in spite of the fact, apparent from what I have just said, that to me it seems that to-day must be similarly expressed what I did express twenty-five years ago about the problems I have characterized, I hesitated a long time about th e completion of this revised edition. Again and again I have asked myself whether at th is point or that, I ought not to define my position toward the numerous philosophical view s which have been put forward since the publication of the first edition. Yet the heavy de mands on my time in recent years, due to purely spiritual scientific re search, prevented me doing as I might have wished. Also, a survey, as thorough as possible, of the philoso phical literature of the present day has convinced me that such a critical discussi on, tempting though it would be in itself, has no place in the context of what this book has to sa y. All that, from the point of view of the “Philosophy of Spiritual Activity,” it seem ed to me necessary to say about recent philosophical tendencies, may be found in the second volume of my “Riddles of Philosophy.” April 1918   RUDOLF STEINER  THE CONSCIOUS HUMAN DEED Is man in his thinking and acting a spirituall y free being, or is he compelled by the iron necessity of natural law? Few questions ha ve been debated more than this one. The concept of the freedom of the human will ha s found enthusiastic supporters and stubborn opponents in plenty. There are those who, in mora l fervor, declare it to be sheer stupidity to deny so evident a fact as freedom. Opposed to them are others who regard as utterly"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"naive the belief that the uniformity of natural law is interrupted in the sphere of human action and thinking. One and the same thing is here declared as often to be the most precious possession of humanity, as it is said to be its most fatal illusion. Infinite subtlety has been devoted to explaining how human fr eedom is compatible with the working of nature, to which, after all, man belongs. No less pains have been taken to make comprehensible how a delusion like this could have arisen. That here we are dealing with one of the most important questions of lif e, religion, conduct and science, is felt by everyone whose character is not totally devoid of depth. And i ndeed, it belongs to the sad signs of the superficiality of present day th inking that a book which attempts to develop a “new faith”1 out of the results of the late st scientific discoveries, contains, on this question, nothing but the words: “There is no need here to go into the question of the freedom of the human will. The supposed indifferent freedom of choice has al ways been recognized as an empty illusion by every philosophy worthy of the name. Th e moral valuation of human conduct and character remains untouc hed by this question.” I do not quote this passage because I consid er that the book in which it appears has any special importance, but because it seems to me to express the only view which most of our thinking contemporaries are able to reach, concerning this question. Everyone who claims to have advanced beyond an elementa ry education seems nowadays to know that freedom cannot consist in choosing at one’s pleasure, one or the other of two possible courses of action; it is maintained that there is always a quite definite reason why, out of several possible actions, we carry out a particular one. This seems obvious. Nevertheless, up to now, the main attacks by those who oppose freedom are directed only against the freedom of choice. Herbert Spencer, who has views which are rapidly gaining ground, says: “That everyone is able to desire or not to desire, as he pleases, which is the essential principle in the dogma of free will, is negated by the analysis of consciousness, as well as by the contents of the preceding chapter.”2 Others, too, start from the same point of view in combating the concept of free will. The germs of all that is relevant in these arguments are to be found as early as Spinoza.3 All that he brought forward in clear and simple language against the idea of freedom has since been repeated times without number, but usually veiled in the most complicated theoretical doctrines so that it is difficult to recognize the straightfo rward train of thought on which all depends. Spinoza writes in a letter of October or November, 1674: “I call something free which exists and acts fr om the pure necessity of its nature, and I call that compelled, the existence and action of which are exactly and fixedly determined by something else. The existence of God, for example, though necessary, is free because He exists only through the necessity of His nature. Similarly, God knows Himself and all else in freedom, because it follows solely from the necessity of His nature that He knows"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"all. You see, therefore, that I regard free dom as consisting, not in free decision, but in free necessity. “But let us come down to created things wh ich are all determined by external causes to exist and to act in a fixed a nd definite manner. To recognize this more clearly, let us imagine a perfectly simple case. A stone, fo r example, receives from an external cause acting upon it a certain quantity of motion, by which it necessarily continues to move after the impact of the external cause has ceased. The continued motion of the stone is a compelled one, not a necessary one, because it has to be defined by the thrust of the external cause. What is true here for the stone is true also for every other particular thing, however complicated and many-sided it may be , namely, that each thing is necessarily determined by external causes to exist and to act in a fixed and definite manner. “Now, please, suppose that during its motion the stone thinks and knows that it is striving to the best of its ability to continue in motion. This stone which is conscious only of its striving and is by no means indifferent, will beli eve that it is absolutely free, and that it continues in motion for no other reason than its own will to continue. But this is that human freedom which everybody claims to possess and which consists in nothing but this, that men are conscious of their desires, but do not Know the causes by which they are determined. Thus the child believes that he is free when he desires milk, the angry boy that he is free in his desire for vengean ce, and the timid in his desire for flight. Again, the drunken man believes that he says of his own free decision what, sober again, he would fain have left unsaid, and as this pr ejudice is innate in all men, it is not easy to free oneself from it. For although experience teaches us often enough that man, least of all, can temper his desires and that, moved by conflicting passions, he sees the better and pursues the worse, yet he considers himself free, simply because there are some things which he desires less strongly and many desires which can eas ily be inhibited through the recollection of something else which is often remembered.” Because here we are dealing with a clear and definitely expressed vi ew, it is also easy to discover the fundamental error in it. As n ecessarily as a stone continues a definite movement after being put in motion, just as n ecessarily is a man suppos ed to carry out an action when urged thereto by any reason. It is only because man is conscious of his action, that he regards himself as its free originator. But, in doing so, he overlooks the fact that he is driven to it by a cause whic h he has to obey uncondi tionally. The error in this train of thought is soon found. Spinoza, a nd all who think like hi m, overlook the fact that man not only is conscious of his action, bu t may also become conscious of the causes which guide him. No one will deny that when the child desires milk, he is unfree, as is also the drunken man when he says things he later regrets. Neither knows anything of the causes working in the depths of their organisms, which exerci se irresistible power over them. But is it justifiable to lump together ac tions of this kind with those in which a man is conscious, not only of his actions but also of the reasons which cause him to act? Are the actions of men really all of one kind? Should the deed of a so ldier on the field of battle, of the research scientist in his laboratory, of the statesman in complicated diplomatic negotiations, be place d, scientifically, on the same level with that of the child when he desires milk? It is indeed true that it is best to attempt the solution of a problem"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"where the conditions are simplest. But inability to differentiate has caused endless confusion before now. There is, after all, a profound difference between whether I know why I do something, or whether I do not. At fi rst sight this seems a self-evident truth. And yet those who oppose freedom never as k whether a motive wh ich I recognize and see through, compels me in the same sense as does the organic process in the child that causes him to cry for milk. Eduard von Hartmann4 maintains that the human will depends on two main factors: the motive and the character. If one regards all me n as alike, or at any rate the differences between them as negligible, then their will appears as determined from without, namely by the circumstances which come to meet them . But if one takes into consideration that men let a representation become a motive for th eir deeds only if their character is such that the particular representation arouses a desire in them, then man appears as determined from within and not from without . Now, because a representation pressing in on him from without must first, in accordance with his character, be adopted as a motive, man believes himself to be free, that is, independent of external motives. The truth, however, according to Eduard von Hartmann, is that “even though we ourselves first turn a repr esentation into a motive, we do so not arbitrarily, but according to the necessity of our characterological disposition, that is, we are anything but free.” Here again, the difference between motives wh ich I allow to influence me only after I have permeated them with my consciousne ss, and those which I follow without having any clear knowledge of them, is disregarded. And this leads directly to the standpoint from which the facts will be considered here. Is it at all permissible to consider by itself the question of the freedom of our will? And if not: With what other question must it necessarily be connected? If there is a difference between a conscious motive of my action and an unconscious impulse, then the conscious motive will result in an action which must be judged differently from one that springs from bli nd urge. The first question must, therefore, concern this difference, and upon the answer will depend how we are to deal with the question of freedom as such. What does it mean to know the reason for one ’s action? This questi on has been too little considered because, unfortunately, the tendency has always been to tear into two parts what is an inseparable whole: Man. We distinguish the knower from the doer, and the one who really matters is lost sight of : the man who acts because he knows. It is said: Man is free when his reason has the upper hand, not his animal cravings. Or else: Freedom means to be able to determin e one’s life and action in accordance with purposes and decisions."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Nothing is achieved by assertions of this kind. For the question is just whether reason, purposes and decisions exercise compulsion over a man in the same way as do his animal cravings. If, without my doing, a reasonable decision emerges in me with just the same necessity as hunger and thirst, then I must n eeds obey it, and my freed om is an illusion. Another phrase is: To be free means not that one is able to will what one wants, but that one is able to do what one wants. This though t has been expressed wi th great clearness by the poet-philosopher, Robert Hamerling.5 “Man can, indeed, do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants, because his will is determined by motives! He cannot will what he wants? Let us consider these words more closely. Have they any sense? Should fr eedom of will consist in being able to will something without reason, without a motive? But what does it mean to will something, other than to have a reason to do or to strive for this rather than that? To will something without a reason, without a motive, would mean to will something without willing it. The concept of will is inseparable from that of motive. Without a motive to determine it, the will is an empty ability; only through the mo tive does it become active and real. It is, therefore, quite correct that the human will is not ‘free,’ inasmuch as its direction is always determined by that motive which is th e strongest. But, on the other hand, it must be admitted that in contrast with this ‘unf reedom’ it is absurd to speak of a thinkable ‘freedom’ of the will, which would end up in being able to will what one does not will.” Here again, only motives in general are di scussed, without regard for the difference between unconscious and conscious motives. If a motive affects me and I am compelled to act on it because it proves to be the “stronge st” of its kind, then the thought of freedom ceases to have any meaning. Should it matter to me whether I can do a thing or not, if I am forced by the motive to do it? The immediat e question is not whet her I can or cannot do a thing when a motive has influenced me, but whether only such motives exist as affect me with compelling n ecessity. If I have to will so mething, then I may well be absolutely indifferent as to whether I can also do it. And if, thr ough my character, or through circumstances prevailing in my envi ronment, a motive is pressed upon me which to my thinking is unreasonable, then I should even have to be glad if I could not do what I will. The question is not whether I can carry out a decision once made, but how the decision arises within me. What distinguishes man from all other organi c beings is his rational thinking. Actions he has in common with other organisms. Nothi ng is gained by seeking analogies in the animal world to clarify the concept of freedom of action of human beings. Modern natural science loves such an alogies. When scientists have succeeded in finding among animals something similar to human behavior , they believe they have touched upon the most important question of th e science of man. To what mi sunderstandings this view leads is seen, for example, in a book by P. Rée,6 where the following remark on freedom appears:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"“It is easy to explain why the movement of a stone seems to us necessary, while the will- impulse of a donkey does not. The causes which set the stone in motion are external and visible, while the causes which induce in th e donkey impulses of will are internal and invisible, that is, between us and the place wh ere they are active ther e is the skull of the donkey.... The dependence on a cause is not seen and the conclusion, therefore, is drawn that no dependence is present. It is explaine d that the will is, indeed, the cause of the donkey’s turning round, but that it is itself unconditioned; it is an absolute beginning.” Here again, human actions in which man is conscious of the reasons why he acts, are simply ignored, for Rée declares: “Between us and the place wh ere the causes are active there is the skull of the donkey.” From these words can be seen that Ree had no notion that there are ac tions, not indeed of the donkey, but of human beings, in which betw een us and the deed lies the motive that has become conscious. That Ree does not see th is he shows again later, when he says: “We do not perceive the causes by which our will is determined, hence we believe that our will is not causally determined at all.” But enough of examples which show that many oppose freedom without knowing in the least what freedom is. That an action cannot be free, of which the doer does not know why he carries it out, is obvious. But what about an action for which we know the reason! This leads us to the question: What is the origin and significan ce of thinking? For wit hout knowledge of the thinking activity of the soul, it is impossible to form a concept of what it means to know something, and therefore also of what it m eans to know the reason for an action. When we recognize what thinking in general means, then it will also be easy to become clear about the role that thinking plays in human action. As Hegel7 rightly says, “It is thinking that turns the soul, with which the animals ar e also endowed, into spirit.” And this is why thinking gives to human action its characteristic stamp. It is not maintained that all our action spri ngs only from the sober deliberations of our reason. Far be it from me to consider human in the highest sense only those actions which result from abstract judgments. But as soon as our conduct rises above the sphere of the satisfaction of purely animal desires, our motives are always permeated by thoughts. Love, pity and patriotism are motivating forc es for deeds which cannot be analyzed away into cold concepts of the intellect. It is said that here the heart and the mood of soul hold sway. No doubt. But the heart a nd the mood of the soul do no t create the motives. They presuppose them and let them enter. Pity ente rs my heart when the representation of a person who arouses pity appears in my consci ousness. The way to the heart is through the head. Love is no exception. Whenever it is not merely the expre ssion of bare sexual instinct, it depends on the representation we form of the loved one. And the more"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"idealistic these representations are, just so much the more blessed is our love. Here too, thought is the father of feeling. It is said: Love makes us blin d to the failings of the loved one. But this also holds good the other way r ound, and it can be said: Love opens the eyes just for the good qualities of the loved one. Many pass by these good qualities without noticing them. One, however, sees them, and just because he does, love awakens in his soul. He has done nothing ot her than form a representation of something, of which hundreds have none. They have no love b ecause they lack the representation. From whatever point we regard the subject, it becomes ever clearer that the question of the nature of human action pres upposes that of the origin of thinking. I shall, therefore, turn to this question next. THE FUNDAMENTAL URGE FOR KNOWLEDGE Two souls alas are dwelling in my breast; And each is fain to leave its brother. The one, fast clinging, to the world adheres With clutching organs, in love’s sturdy lust; The other strongly lifts itself from dust To yonder high, ancestral spheres. Faust I, Sc. 2 Priest translation8 In these words Goethe expresses a charac teristic feature belo nging to the deepest foundation of human nature. Man is not a uniformly organized being. He always demands more than the world gives him of its own accord. Nature has endowed us with needs; among them are some that are left to our own initiative to satisfy. Abundant are the gifts bestowed upon us, but still more abunda nt are our desires. We seem born to be dissatisfied. Our thirst for knowledge is but a sp ecial instance of this dissatisfaction. If we look twice at a tree and the first time see it s branches motionless, the second time in movement, we do not remain satisfied with th is observation. Why does the tree appear to us now motionless, now in movement? Thus we ask. Every glance at nature evokes in us a number of questions. Every phenomenon we m eet sets us a problem. Every experience contains a riddle. We see emerging from the e gg a creature like the mother animal; we ask the reason for this likeness. We notice that living beings gr ow and develop to a certain degree of perfection and we inves tigate the conditions fo r this experience. Nowhere are we satisfied with what nature spreads before our senses. Everywhere we seek what we call explanation of the facts. The something more which we seek in things, ov er and above what is given us directly in them, divides our whole being into two aspects; we become conscious of our contrast to the world. We confront the world as independe nt beings. The universe appears to us to have two opposite poles: I and world."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"We erect this barrier between ourselves and the world as soon as consciousness first dawns in us. But we never cease to feel that, in spite of all, we belong to the world, that there is a bond of union between it and us, that we are not be ings outside, but within, the universe. This feeling makes us strive to bridge over the contrast. And in th is bridging the whole spiritual striving of mankind ulti mately consists. The history of man’s spiritual life is an incessant search for unity between us and th e world. Religion, art and science all have this same aim. In the revelation God grants him, the religious believer seeks the solution of the problems in the world which his I, di ssatisfied with the world of mere phenomena, sets him. The artist seeks to imprint into ma tter the ideas of his I, in order to reconcile with the world outside what lives within him. He, too, feels dissatisf ied with the world as it appears to him, and seeks to embody into the world of mere phenomena that something more which his I, reaching out beyond it, contains. The thinker seeks the laws of phenomena, and strives to penetrate with th inking what he experiences by observing. Only when we have made the world-conten t into our thought-conten t do we again find the unity from which we separated ourselves. We shall see later that this goal will be reached only when the task of the scientific investigator is understood at a much deeper level than is usually the case. The whole situation I have desc ribed here, presents itself to us on the stage of history in the contrast be tween a unified view of the world or monism,9 and the theory of two worlds or dualism.10 Dualism pays attention only to the separation between I and world, brought about by man’s consciousness. All its efforts consist in a vain struggle to reconcile these opposites, wh ich it calls spirit a nd matter, subject and object, or thinking and phenomena. The dualist f eels that there must be a bridge between the two worlds, but he is unable to find it. In as far as man is aware of himself as “I,” he cannot but think of this “I” as belonging to spirit; and in contrasting this “I” with the world he cannot do otherwise than reckon the perceptions given to the senses, the realm of matter, as belonging to the world. In doing so, man places himself within the contrast of spirit and matter. He must do so all the more because his own body belongs to the material world. Thus the “I” belongs to the re alm of spirit, as part of it; the material things and events which are perceived by th e senses belong to the “world.” All the problems connected with spirit and matter, ma n finds again in the fundamental riddle of his own nature. Monism pays attention only to the unity and tries either to deny or to efface the contrasts, which are there neve rtheless. Neither of these two views is satisfactory, for they do not do justice to th e facts. Dualism sees spirit (I) and matter (world) as two fundamentally different enti ties and cannot, therefore, understand how they can interact upon each other. How shoul d spirit know what goes on in matter, if the essential nature of matter is quite alien to spirit? And how, in these circumstances, should spirit be able to act upon ma tter, in order to transform its intentions into actions? The most clever and the most absurd hypothese s have been put forward to solve these problems. But, so far, monism has fared no bett er. Up to now it has tried to justify itself in three different ways. Either it denies sp irit and becomes materialism; or it denies matter and seeks its salvation in spiritualism11; or it maintains that since even in the simplest entities in the world spirit and matte r are indivisibly bound t ogether, there is no need for surprise if these two kinds of exis tence are both present in the human being, for they are never found apart."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Materialism12 can never arrive at a satisfa ctory explanation of the world. For every attempt at an explanation mu st of necessity begin with man’s forming thoughts about the phenomena of the world. Materialism, theref ore, takes its start from thoughts about matter or material processes. In doing so, it straightway confronts tw o different kinds of facts, namely, the material world and the thoughts about it. The materialist tries to understand thoughts by regarding them as a purel y material process. He believes that thinking takes place in the brain much in the same way that digesti on takes place in the animal organs. Just as he ascribes to matter mechanical and organic effects, so he also attributes to matter, in certain circumstances, the ability to think. He forgets that in doing this he has merely shifted the problem to anothe r place. Instead of to himself, he ascribes to matter the ability to think. And thus he is back again at his starting-point. How does matter come to reflect about its own nature! Why is it not simply satisfied with itself and with its existence? The materialist has turned his attention away from the definite subject, from our own I, and has arrive d at a vague, indefinite imag e. And here again, the same problem comes to meet him. The materialisti c view is unable to solve the problem; it only transfers it to another place. How does the matter stand with the spiritualist ic view? The extreme spiritualist denies to matter its independent existence and regards it merely as product of spirit. But when he tries to apply this view of the world to the solution of the riddle of his own human nature, he finds himself in a corner. Confronting the I, which can be placed on the side of spirit, there stands, without any media tion, the physical world. No spir itual approach to it seems possible; it has to be perceived and experien ced by the I by means of material processes. Such material processes the “I” does not find in itself if it regards its own nature as having only spiritual validity. Th e physical world is never found in what it works out spiritually. It seems as if the “I” would have to admit that the world would remain closed to it if it did not establish a non-spiritual relation to the wo rld. Similarly, when we come to be active, we have to tran slate our intentions into reali ties with the help of material substances and forces. In other words, we are dependent upon the outer world. The most extreme spiritualist - or rather , the thinker who, through absolu te idealism, appears as an extreme spiritualist - is Johann Gottlieb Fichte.13 He attempts to derive the whole edifice of the world from the “I.” What he has actually accomplished is a magnificent thought- picture of the world, without a ny content of experience. As l ittle as it is possible for the materialist to argue the spirit away, just as little is it possible for the idealist to argue away the outer world of matter. The first thing man perceives when he seeks to gain knowledge of hi s “I” is the activity of this “I” in the conceptual elaboration of the world of ideas. This is the reason why someone who follows a world-view which inclin es toward spiritualism may feel tempted, when looking at his own human nature, to acknowledge nothing of spirit except his own world of ideas. In this way spiritualism b ecomes one-sided idealism. He does not reach the point of seeking through the world of ideas a spiritual worl d; in the world of his ideas he sees the spiritual world itself. As a result of this, he is driven to remain with his world- view as if chained within the activity of his “I.”"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The view of Friedrich Albert Lange14 is a curious variety of idealism, put forward by him in his widely read History of Materialism. He suggests that the materialists are quite right in declaring all pheno mena, including our thinking, to be the product of purely material processes, only, in turn, matter a nd its processes are themselves the product of our thinking. “The senses give us the e ffects of things, not true c opies, much less the things themselves. To these mere effects belong the senses themselves, as well as the brain and the molecular vibrations whic h are thought to go on there.” That is, our thinking is produced by the materi al processes, and th ese by the thinking of the “I.” Lange’s philosophy, in other words, is nothing but the story - applied to concepts - of the ingenious Baron M iinnchhausen,15 who holds himself up in the air by his own pigtail. The third form of monism is the one which s ees the two entities, matter and spirit, already united in the simplest being (the atom). But nothing is gained by this, either, for here again the question, which really originates in our consciousness, is transferred to another place. How does the simple being come to manifest itself in two different ways, if it is an indivisible unity? To all these viewpoints it must be objected that it is first and foremost in our own consciousness that we meet the basic and origin al contrast. It is we who detach ourselves from the bosom of nature and contrast ourselv es as “I” with the “world.” Goethe’” has given classic expression to this in his essay On Nature, alth ough at first glance his manner may be considered quite unscientific: “We live in the midst of her (nature) yet are we strangers to her. Ceaselessly she speaks to us, and yet betrays not her secrets.” But Goethe knew the other side too: “All human beings are in her and she is in all human beings.” Just as true as it is that we have estranged ourselves from natu re, so is it also true that we feel: We are within nature and we belong to it. That which lives in us can only be nature’s own influence. We must find the way back to nature again. A simple consideration can show us this way. We have, it is true, detached ourselves from nature, but we must have taken something of it over with us, into our own being. This essen ce of nature in us we must seek out, and then we shall also find the connection with it once again. Dualism neglects this. It considers the inner being of man as a spiritu al entity quite alien to nature, and seeks somehow to hitch it onto nature. No wonde r it cannot find the connecting link. We can only understand nature outside us when we ha ve first learned to recognize it within us. What within us is akin to nature must be our guide. This points out our path. We shall not speculate about the interaction of nature and spirit. But we shall penetrate the depths of our own being, there to find those elements wh ich we took with us in our flight from nature."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Investigation of our own being must bring th e solution of the riddle. We must reach a point where we can say to ourselves: Here I am no longer merely “I,” here I encounter something which is more than “I.” I am aware that many who have read t hus far will not have found my discussion “scientific” in the usual sense. To this I can only reply that so far I have not been concerned with scientific results of any ki nd, but with the simple description of what everyone experiences in his own conscious ness. A few expressi ons concerning the attempts to reconcile man’s consciousness and the world have been used only for the purpose of clarifying the actual facts. I have, therefore, made no attempt to use the expressions “I,” “spirit,” “wor ld,” “nature,” in th e precise way that is usual in psychology and philosophy. Ordinary consciousness is unaware of the sharp distinctions made by the sciences, and up to this point it has only been a matter of describing the facts of everyday conditions. I am concerned, not with how scienc e, so far, has interpreted consciousness, but with how we experience it in daily life. THINKING IN THE SERVICE OF UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD When I see how a billiard ball, when struc k, communicates its motion to another ball, I remain entirely without influence on the c ourse of this event which I observe. The direction and velocity of the second ball is determined by the direction and velocity of the first. As long as I do no more than observe, I cannot say anything about the motion of the second ball until it actually moves. The situati on alters if I begin to reflect on the content of my observation. The purpose of my reflection is to form concepts of the event. I bring the concept of an elastic ball into connection with certain other concepts of mechanics, and take into consideration the special ci rcumstances prevailing in this particular instance. In other words, to the action taking place wit hout my doing, I try to add a second action which unfolds in th e conceptual sphere. The latt er is dependent on me. This is shown by the fact that I c ould rest content with the obser vation and forgo all search for concepts if I had no need of them. If, however, th is need is present, then I am not satisfied until I have brought the concepts ball, elasti city, motion, impact, velocity, etc., into a certain connection, to which the observed process is related in a definite way. As certain as it is that the event takes place independent ly of me, so certain is it also that the conceptual process cannot ta ke place without my doing it. We shall consider later whet her this activity of mine is really a product of my own independent being or whether the modern phys iologists are right who say that we cannot think as we will, but that we must think exactly as the thoughts and thought-connections present in our consciousness determine.17 For the time being we wish merely to establish the fact that we constantly feel compelle d to seek for concepts and connections of concepts standing in a certain relation to obj ects and events given independently of us. Whether this activity is really ours, or whether we accomplish it according to an unalterable necessity, we shall leave aside for th e moment. That at first sight it appears to be our activity is beyond doubt. We know with absolute certainty th at we are not given"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"the concepts together with the objects. That I myself am the doer may be illusion, but to immediate observation this certa inly appears to be the case . The question here is: What do we gain by finding a conceptual counterpart to an event? There is a profound difference between the ways in which, for me, the parts of an event are related to one another before and after the discovery of the corresponding concepts. Mere observation can follow the parts of a give n event as they occur, but their connection remains obscure without the help of concepts. I see the first billiard ball move toward the second in a certain direction and with a de finite velocity. I must wait for what will happen after the impact, and again I can follo w what happens only with my eyes. Let us assume that at the moment the impact occu rs someone obstructs my view of the field where the event takes place: then - as mere onlooker - I have no knowledge of what happens afterward. The situation is different if before my view was obstructed I had discovered the concepts corresponding to the ne xus of events. In that case I can estimate what occurs, even when I am no longer able to observe. An object or event which has only been observed does not of itself reveal anything about its connection with other objects or events. This connec tion comes to light only when observation combines with thinking. Observation and thinking are the two points of departure for all spir itual striving of man insofar as he is conscious of such striving. What is accomplished by ordinary human reason as well as by the most complicated scie ntific investigations rests on these two fundamental pillars of our spirit. Philosophers have st arted from various primary antitheses: idea and reality, subject and object , appearance and thi ng-in-itself, ego and non-ego, idea and will, concept and matter, fo rce and substance, the conscious and the unconscious. It is easy to show, however, that all these antitheses must be preceded by that of observation and thinking, as th e one the most important for man. Whatever principle we wish to advance, we must prove that somewhere we have observed it, or express it in the form of a clear thought which can be re-thought by others. Every philosopher who begins to speak about his fundamental principles must make use of the conceptual form, and thereby makes use of thinking. He therefor e indirectly admits that for his activity he presupposes thinking. Wh ether thinking or something else is the main element in the evolution of the world, we shall not decide as yet. But that without thinking the philosopher can gain no knowledge of the evolution of the world, is immediately clear. Thinking may play a minor part in the coming into being of world phenomena, but thinking certainly plays a major part in the coming into being of a view about them. As regards observation, it is due to our orga nization that we need it. For us, our thinking about a horse and the object horse are two se parate things. But we have access to the object only through observation. As little as we can form a concept of a horse by merely staring at it, just as little are we able to produce a corre sponding object by mere thinking. In sequence of time, observation even precedes thinking. For even thinking we learn to know first by means of observation. It was es sentially a description of an observation"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"when, at the opening of this chapter, we gave an account of how thinking is kindled by an event and of how it goes beyond what is given without its activity. Whatever enters the circle of our experiences we first become aware of through observation. The contents of sensation, of perception, of contemplation, of f eelings, of acts of will, of the pictures of dreams and fantasy, of representations, of concepts and ideas, of all illusions and hallucinations are given us through observation. However, as object of observation, thinking di ffers essentially from all other objects. The observation of a table or a tree occurs in me as soon as th ese objects appear within the range of my experience. But my thinking that goes on about these th ings, I do not observe at the same time. I observe the table; the thi nking about the table I carry out, but I do not observe it at the same moment. I would first have to transport myself to a place outside my own activity if, besides observing the tabl e, I wanted also to observe my thinking about the table. Whereas obser vation of things and events, and thinking about them, are but ordinary occurrences filling daily life, the observation of thinking itself is a sort of exceptional situation. This fact must be take n into account sufficiently when we come to determine the relation of thinking to all other contents of obser vation. It is essential to be clear about the fact that when thinking is obs erved the same procedure is applied to it as the one we normally apply to the rest of the world-content, only in ordinary life we do not apply it to thinking. Someone might object that what I have sa id here about thinking also holds good for feeling and for all other soul activities. When, for example, we feel pleasu re, the feeling is also kindled by an object, and it is this obj ect I observe, and not th e feeling of pleasure. This objection, however, is base d upon an error. Pleasure does not have at all the same relationship to its object as has the concept which thinki ng builds up. I am absolutely conscious of the fact that the concept of a thing is built up by my activity, whereas pleasure is produced in me by an object in the same way as, for instance, a change is caused in an object by a stone which falls upon it. For observati on, a pleasure is given in exactly the same way as that is given which cau ses it. The same is not true of concepts. I can ask: Why does a particular event arouse in me a feeling of pleasure? But it is never possible to ask: Why does an event produce in me a certain number of concepts? That simply has no sense. When I reflect about an event there is no question of an effect on me. I learn nothing about myself by knowing the concepts which correspond to the change observed in a pane of glass when a ston e is thrown against it. But I very definitely do learn something about my personality when I know the feeling which a certain event arouses in me. When I say of an observed objec t: This is a rose, I say absolutely nothing about myself; but when I say of the same thing: It gives me a feeling of pleasure, I characterize not only the ro se but also myself in my relation to the rose. There can, therefore, be no question of co mparing thinking and f eeling as objects of observation. And the same could easily be shown concerning other activities of the human soul. Unlike thinking, they belong in th e same sphere as other observed objects and events. It is characteristic of the nature of thinking that it is an activity directed solely upon the observed object and not upon the thinking personality. This can already be seen from the way we express our thoughts, as dist inct from the way we express our feelings"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"or acts of will in relation to objects. When I see an object and r ecognize it as a table, generally I would not say: I am thinking of a table, but: This is a table. But I would say: I am pleased with the table. In the first instan ce I am not at all interested in pointing out that I have entered into any re lationship with the table, wherea s in the second it is just this relationship that matters. In saying: I am thinking of a table, I already enter the exceptional situation character ized above, where something is made an object of observation which is always contained within our soul’s activity, only normally it is not made an object of observation. It is characteristic of thinking that the thinker forgets thinking while doing it. What occupies him is not thinking, but the object of thinking which he observes. The first thing then, that we observe about th inking is that it is the unobserved element in our ordinary life of thought. The reason we do not observe thinking in our da ily life of thought is because it depends upon our own activity. What I myself do not br ing about, enters my field of observation as something objective. I find myself confr onted by it as by something that has come about independently of me; it comes to meet me; I must take it as the presupposition of my thinking process. While I re flect on the object, I am occupied with it, my attention is turned to it. This activity is, in fact, thinki ng contemplation. My attention is directed not to my activity but to the object of this activity. In other wo rds: while I think, I do not look at my thinking which I produce, but at the object of thinking which I do not produce. I am even in the same position when I let th e exceptional situation come about and think about my own thinking. I can never observe my present thinking, but only afterward can I make into an object of thinking the experien ce I have had of my thinking-process. If I wanted to observe my present thinking, I woul d have to split myself into two persons: one to do the thinking, the other to observe this thinking. This I cannot do. I can only accomplish it in two separate acts. The thinki ng to be observed is never the one actually being produced, but another one. Whether fo r this purpose I observe my own earlier thinking, or follow the thinking process of another person, or else, as in the above example of the movements of the billiard balls, presuppose an imaginary thinking process, makes no difference. Two things that do not go together are activ ely producing something and confronting this in contemplation. This is already shown in th e First Book of Moses. The latter represents God as creating the world in the first six da ys, and only when the wo rld is there is the possibility of contemplating it also present: “And God saw everything that he had made and, behold, it was very good.” So it is also wi th our thinking. It must first be present before we can observe it. The reason it is impossible for us to observe thinking when it is actua lly taking place, is also the reason it is possible fo r us to know it more directly and more intimately than any other process in the world. It is just because we ourselves bring it forth that we know the characteristic features of its course, the manne r in which the process takes place. What in"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"the other spheres of observati on can be found only indirectly: the relevant context and the connection between the individual objects - in the case of thi nking is known to us in an absolutely direct way. Off-hand, I do not know why, for my observation, thunder follows lightning, but from the content of the two c oncepts I know immediately why my thinking connects the concept of thunder with the concep t of lightning. Naturally here it does not matter whether I have correct concepts of thunder and lightning. The connection between those concepts I have is clear to me, and i ndeed this is the case through the concepts themselves. This transparent clarity of the process of thinking is quite indepe ndent of our knowledge of the physiological basis of thinking. I speak he re of thinking insofar as it presents itself to observation of our spiritual activity. How one material proc ess in my brain causes or influences another while I carry out a line of thought, does not come in to consideration at all. What I see when I observe thinking is not what process in my brain connects the concept of lightning with the c oncept of thunder, but I see what motivates me to bring the two concepts into a particular relationship. My observation of thinking shows me that there is nothing that directs me in my conn ecting one thought with another, except the content of my thoughts; I am not directed by th e material processes in my brain. In a less materialistic age than ours this remark woul d of course be entire ly superfluous. Today however, when there are people who believe: When we know what matter is, we shall also know how matter thinks, - it has to be said that it is possible to speak about thinking without entering the domain of brain physiology at the same time. Today many people find it difficult to grasp the concept of th inking in its purity. Anyone who wants to contrast the representa tion of thinking I have here deve loped, with Cabanis’18 statement, “The brain secretes thoughts as the liver does gall or the sp ittle-glands spittle, etc.,” simply does not know what I am talking about. He tries to find thinking by means of a mere process of observation such as we apply to other objects that make up the content of the world. He cannot find it in this manne r because as I have shown, it eludes normal observation. Whoever cannot ove rcome materialism lacks the ability to bring about in himself the exceptional situation described abov e, which brings to his consciousness what remains unconscious in all other spiritual activ ities. If a person does not have the good will to place himself in this situation, then one can no more speak to him about thinking than one can speak about color to a person w ho is blind. However, he must not believe that we consider physiological processes to be thinking. He cannot explain thinking because he simply does not see it. However, one possessing the ability to observe thinking, - and with goodwill every normally organized person has this ability, - this observation is the most important he can make. For he observes something which he hims elf brings to existen ce; he finds himself confronted not by a foreign object, to begi n with, but by his own activity. He knows how what he observes comes to be. He sees th rough the connections and relations. A firm point is attained from which, with well-founde d hope, one can seek for the explanation of the rest of the world’s phenomena. The feeling of possessing such a firm poi nt caused the founder of modern philosophy, Renatus Cartesius,19 to base the whole of human knowledge on the principle, I think,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"therefore I am. All other things , all other events are presen t independent of me. Whether they are there as truth or illusion or dream I know not. Only one thing do I know with absolute certainty, for I myself bring it to its sure existence: my thinking. Perhaps it also has some other origin as well, perhaps it comes from God or from elsewhere, but that it is present in the sense that I myself bring it fo rth, of that I am certain. Cartesius had, to begin with, no justification for giving hi s statement any other meaning. He could maintain only that within the whole world content it is in my thinking that I grasp myself within that activity which is most essentia lly my own. What is meant by the attached therefore I am, has been much debated. It can have a meaning in one sense only. The simplest assertion I can make about somethi ng is that it is, that it exists. How this existence can be further defined I cannot say st raight away about anything that comes to meet me. Each thing must first be studied in its relation to others before it can be determined in what sense it can be said to ex ist. An event that comes to meet me may be a set of perceptions, but it coul d also be a dream, a hallucination, and so forth. In short, I am unable to say in what sense it exists. I cannot gather this from the event in itself, but I shall learn it when I consider the event in it s relation to other things. From this, however, I can, again, learn no more than how it is related to these ot her things. My search only reaches solid ground if I find an object which ex ists in a sense which I can derive from the object itself. As thinker I am such an objec t, for I give my existence the definite, self- dependent content of the activity of thinki ng. Having reached this, I can go on from here and ask: Do the other objects exist in the same or in some other sense? When thinking is made the object of observati on, to the rest of the elements to be observed is added something which usually es capes attention; but the manner in which the other things are approached by man is not altered. One increases the number of observed objects, but not th e number of methods of obser vation. While we are observing the other things, there mingles in the uni versal process - in which I now include observation - one process which is overl ooked. Something different from all other processes is present, but is not noticed. But when I observe my thinking, no such unnoticed element is present. For what now hovers in the background is, again, nothing but thinking. The observed object is qualitatively the same as the activity directed upon it. And that is another characteri stic feature of thinking. When we observe it, we do not find ourselves compelled to do so with the help of something qualitatively different, but can remain within the same element. When I weave an object, given independently of me, into my th inking, then I go beyond my observation, and the question is: Have I a ny right to do so? Why do I not simply let the object act upon me? In what way is it possibl e that my thinking could be related to the object? These are questions wh ich everyone who reflects on his own thought processes must put to himself. They cease to exist wh en one thinks about thinking. We do not add anything foreign to thinking, and consequently do not have to justify such an addition. Schelling20 says: “To gain knowle dge of nature means to creat e nature.” If these words of the bold nature-philosopher are taken literally, we should have to renounce forever all knowledge of nature. For after a ll, nature is there already, a nd in order to create it a second time, one must know the principles according to which it originated. From the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"nature already in existence one would have to learn the cond itions of its existence in order to apply them to the nature one want ed to create. But this learning, which would have to precede the creating, would, however, be knowing nature, and would remain this even if, after the learning, no creation took plac e. Only a nature not yet in existence could be created without knowing it beforehand. What is impossible with regard to nature : creating before knowing, we achieve in the case of thinking. If we wanted to wait and not think until we had first learned to know thinking, then we would never think at all. We have to plunge strai ght into thinking in order to be able, afterward, to know thinking by observing what we ourselves have done. We ourselves first create an object when we observe thinking. A ll other objects have been created without our help. Against my sentence, We must think before we can contemplate thinking, someone might easily set another sentence as being equally valid: We canno t wait with digesting, either, until we have observed the process of diges tion. This objection would be similar to the one made by Pascal21 against Cartesius, when he maintained that one could also say: I go for a walk, therefore I am. Certainly I must re solutely get on with digesting before I have studied the physiological proce ss of digestion. But this could only be compared with the contemplation of thinking if, after having di gested, I were not to contemplate it with thinking, but were to eat and digest it. It is, after all, not without significance that whereas digestion cannot become the object of dige stion, thinking can very well become the object of thinking. This, then, is beyond doubt: In thinking we are gr asping a corner of th e universal process, where our presence is required if anything is to come about. And, after al l, this is just the point. The reason things are so enigmatical to me is that I do not participate in their creation. I simply find them there, whereas in the case of thinking I know how it is made. This is why a more basic starting point than thinking, from which to consider all else in the world, does not exist. Here I should mention another widely current error which prevails with regard to thinking. It consists in this, that it is said: Thinking, as it is in itself, we never encounter. That thinking which connects the observations we make of our experiences and weaves them into a network of concepts, is not at all the same as that thinking which later we extract from the objects we have observed a nd then make the object of our consideration. What we first unconsciously weave into things is something quite different from what we consciously extract from them afterward. To draw such conclusions is not to see that in this way it is impossible to escape from thinking. It is absolutely impossible to come out of thinking if one wants to consider it. When one distinguishes an unconscious thinki ng from a later conscious thinking, then one must not forget that this distinction is quite external and has nothing to do with thinking as such. I do not in the least alter a th ing by considering it with my thinking. I can well imagine that a being with quite diffe rently organized sense organs and with a differently functioning intelligence would have a quite different representation of a horse"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"from mine, but I cannot imag ine that my own thinking becomes something different because I observe it. What I observe is wh at I myself bring about. What my thinking looks like to an intelligence di fferent from mine is not what we are speaking about now; we are speaking about what it l ooks like to me. In a ny case, the picture of my thinking in another intelligence cannot be truer than my ow n picture of it. Only if I were not myself the thinking being, but thinking confronted me as the activit y of a being foreign to me, could I say that my picture of thinking appear ed in quite a definite way, and that I could not know what in itself the thin king of the beings was like. So far there is not the slightest reason to view my own thinking from a standpoint different from the one applied to other things. After all, I consider the rest of the world by means of thinking. How should I make of my thinking an exception? With this I consider that I have sufficientl y justified making thinki ng my starting point in my approach to an understanding of the world. When Archimedes22 had discovered the lever, he thought that with its help he coul d lift the whole cosmos from its hinges if only he could find a point upon which he could s upport his instrument. He needed something that was supported by itself, th at was not carried by anything else. In thinking we have a principle which exists by mean s of itself. From this princi ple let us attempt to understand the world. Thinking we can understand through itse lf. So the question is only whether we can also understand other things through it. I have so far spoken of thinking without c onsidering its vehicle, man’s consciousness. Most present-day philosophers would object: Before there can be thinking, there must be consciousness. Therefore, one should begin, not from thinking, but from consciousness. No thinking can exist without consciousness. To them I must reply: If I want to have an explanation of what relation exists between thinking and consciousness, I must think about it. In doing so I presuppose thinking. To this could be said: When the philosopher wants to understand consciousness he make s use of thinking, and to that extent presupposes it, but in the ordi nary course of life thinking does arise within consciousness and, therefore, presupposes this. If this an swer were given to the World Creator who wished to create thinking, it would no doubt be justified. One naturally cannot let thinking arise without firs t having brought about consciousness. However, the philosopher is not concer ned with the creation of the worl d, but with the un derstanding of it. Therefore he has to find the starting point, not for the creation, but for the understanding of the world. I consider it most extraordinary that a philosopher should be reproached for being concerned first and fore most about the correctness of his principles, rather than turning straight to the objects he wants to understand. The World Creator had to know, above all, how to find a vehicle for thinking; the philosopher has to find a secure foundation for his understanding of what already exists. How can it help us to start from consciousness and apply thinking to it, if first we do not know whether it is possible to reach any explanation of things by means of thinking? We must first consider thinking quite impartia lly, without reference to a thinking subject or a thought object. For in s ubject and object we already have concepts formed by thinking. There is no denying: Before anythi ng else a can be understood, thinking must"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"be understood. To deny this is to fail to realiz e that man is not a first link in creation, but the last. Therefore, for an explanation of th e world by means of concepts, one cannot start from the first elements of existence, but must begin with what is nearest to us and is most intimately ours. We cannot at one bound transport ourselves to the beginning of the world, in order to begin our i nvestigations there; we must start from the present moment and see whether we cannot ascend from the late r to the earlier. As long as geology spoke in terms of assumed revolutions in order to explain the present condition of the earth, it groped in darkness. It was only when it made its beginnings from the investigations of those processes at present at work on the ea rth, and from these drew conclusions about the past, that it gained a s ecure foundation. As long as ph ilosophy assumes all sorts of principles such as atom, motion, matter, will , the unconscious, it will get nowhere. Only when the philosopher recognizes as his absolute first that whic h came as the absolute last, can he reach his goal. But this absolute last in wo rld evolution is Thinking. There are people who say: Whether or not our thinking is right in itself cannot be established with certainty, after all. And to this extent the point of departure is still a doubtful one. It would be just as sensible to raise doubts as to whethe r in itself a tree is right or wrong. Thinking is a fact, and to sp eak of the rightness or wrongness of a fact has no sense. At most, I can have doubts as to wh ether thinking is being rightly applied, just as I can doubt whether a certain tree supp lies a wood suitable for making tools for a particular purpose. To show to what extent the application of th inking to the world is right or wrong, is just the task of this book. I can understand anyone doubting whether we can ascertain anything about the world by mean s of thinking, but it is incomprehensible to me how anyone can doubt the ri ghtness of thinking in itself. Addition to the Revised Edition (1918): In the preceding discussion, the significant difference between thinking and al l other activities of the soul has been referred to as a fact which reveals itself to a really unprejudiced observa tion. Unless this unprejudiced observation is achieved, against th is discussion one is tempted to raise objections such as these: When I think about a ro se, then after all, this also is only an expression of a relation of my “I” to the rose, just as when I feel the beauty of the rose. In the case of thinking, a relation between “I” a nd object exists in the same wa y as in the case of feeling or perceiving. To make this objection is to fail to realize that it is only in the activity of thinking that the “I” knows itself to be complete ly at one with that which is active - going into all the ramifications of the activity. In the case of no other soul activity is this completely so. When, for example, a pleasur e is felt, a more sensitive observation can quite easily detect to what extent the “I” knows itself to be one with something active, and to what extent there is so mething passive in it so that the pleasure merely happens to the “I.” And this is the case with the othe r soul activities. But one should not confuse “having thought-images” with the worki ng through of thought by means of thinking. Thought-images can arise in the soul in the same way as dreams or vague intimations. This is not thinking. - To this could be said: If this is what is meant by thinking, then the element of will is within th inking, and so we have to do not merely with thinking, but also with the will within thinking. However, this would only justify one in saying: Real thinking must always be willed. But this has nothing to do with the characterization of thinking as given in this disc ussion. The nature of thinking may be such that it must"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"necessarily always be willed; th e point is that everything that is willed is - while being willed - surveyed by the “I” as an activity entirely its own. Indeed it must be said that just because this is the nature of thinking, it appears to the observer as willed through and through. Anyone who really takes the trouble to unders tand all that has to be considered in order to reach a judgment about thinking, can not fail to recognize that this soul activity does have the unique character we have described here. A personality highly appreciated as a thinker by the author of this book, has objected that it is impossible to speak about thinking as is done here, becaus e what one believes one is observing as active thinking only appears to be so. In reality one is observing only the results of an unconscious activity, which is the foundation of thinking. Only because this unconscious activity is not observed does the illusion arise that the observed thinking exists through itself, just as when in an illumination made by a rapid succession of electric sparks one believes one is seei ng a continuous movement. This objection, too, rests on an inaccurate examination of the fact s. To make it means that one has not taken into consideration that it is the “I” itself, standing within thinking, that observes its own activity. The “I” would have to stand outside thinking to be de luded as in the case of an illumination with a rapid succession of electric sparks. Indeed one could say: To make such a comparison is to deceive oneself forcibly, like someone who, seeing a moving light, insisted that it was being freshly lit by an unknown hand at every point where it appeared. - No, whoever wants to see in th inking anything other than a surveyable activity brought about within the “I,” must first make himself blind to the plain facts that are there for the seeing, in order to be able to set up a hypothetical act ivity as the basis of thinking. He who does not so blind himself cannot fail to recognize that everything he “thinks into” thinking in this manner take s him away from the essence of thinking. Unprejudiced observation shows that nothing bel ongs to thinking’s own nature that is not found in thinking itself. If one leaves the realm of thinki ng, one cannot come to what causes it. THE WORLD AS PERCEPTION Concepts and ideas arise through thinking. What a concept is cannot be stated in words. Words can do no more than draw attention to our concepts. When someone sees a tree, his thinking reacts to his observation, an idea l counterpart is added to the object, and he considers the object and the ideal counterp art as belonging together. When the object disappears from his field of observation, only th e ideal counterpart of it remains. This latter is the concept of the object. The fu rther our range of experience is widened, the greater becomes the sum of our concepts. But a concept is never f ound isolated. Concepts combine to form a totality built up according to inherent laws. The concept “organism” combines, for example, with those of “gra dual development, growth.” Other concepts formed of single objects merge completely. All concepts that I form of lions, merge into the general concept “lion.” In this way th e single concepts unite in an enclosed conceptual system, in which each concept has its special place. Ideas are not qualitatively different from concepts. They are but concepts that are richer in content, more saturated"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"and comprehensive. At this par ticular point I must draw special attention to the fact that thinking is my point of depart ure, and not concepts and ideas which must first be gained by means of thinking. Concepts and ideas al ready presuppose thinking. Therefore, what I have said about the nature of thinking, that it exists through it self, that it is determined by nothing but itself, cannot simply be carried ove r and applied to concepts. (I mention this at this point explicitly because it is here th at my difference with Hegel lies. For Hegel, the concept is the primary and original.) The concept cannot be gained from observati on. This can already be seen from the fact that the growing human being slowly and gradually forms concepts corresponding to the objects surrounding him. The concep ts are added to observation. A much-read contemporary philosopher, Herber t Spencer,23 describes the mental process which we carry out in response to observation, in the following way: “If, when walking through the fields one da y in September, we hear a sound a few yards in advance, and, on observing the ditch-side where it occurs, see the grass move, we shall probably turn toward the spot to learn by what this sound and motion are produced. As we approach, a partridge flutters in the ditch; on seeing this our curi osity is satisfied; we have what we call an explanation of the phenomena. This explanation, please notice, amounts to this: Because we have experienced countless times in life th at a disturbance of the stationary position of small bodies is accompanied by the movement of other bodies existing among them, and because we have th erefore generalized the relation between such disturbances and such movements, we c onsider this particular disturbance explained as soon as we find it to be an example of just this relationship.”24 A closer examination gives a very different result from what is described above. When I hear a sound, the first thing I do is to find the concept that corresponds to this observation. It is this con cept that takes me beyond the sound. Someone who did not reflect further would simply hear the sound and be content with that. But, because I reflect, it becomes clear to me that I have to understand the sound as an effect. It is therefore only when I connect the concept of effect with the perception of the sound that I am induced to go beyond the single observa tion and look for the cause. The concept of effect calls up that of cause; I then look for the object which is the cause, and in this case I find it to be the partridge. But these concepts , cause and effect, I can never gain by mere observation, however many instances I may have observed. Observation calls up thinking, and it is thinking that then shows me how to fit one indi vidual occurrence to another. If one demands of a “strictly objective scie nce” that it must take its content from observation alone, then one must at the same time require that it is to desist from all thinking. For by its very nature, thin king goes beyond the observed object. We must now pass from thinking itself to the being who thinks, for it is through the thinker that thinking is combined with obs ervation. Human consci ousness is the stage upon which concept and observation meet one a nother and become united. In saying this,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"we have at the same time characterized human consciousness. It is the mediator between thinking and observation. Insofar as the human being observes an object, it appears to him as given; insofar as he thinks, he appear s to himself as active. He regards what comes to meet him as object, and himself as thinki ng subject. While he dire cts his thinking to the observation, he is conscious of the object; while he directs his thinking to himself he is conscious of himself, or is self-consci ous. Human consciousness of necessity, must be self-conscious at the same time, because it is a thinking consciousness. For when thinking turns its attention to its own ac tivity, then its own essential bei ng, that is, its subject, is its object as well. It must, however, not be overlooked that it is only with the he lp of thinking that we can define ourselves as subject and contrast our selves with objects. For this reason, thinking must never be understood as a merely subj ective activity. Thinking is beyond subject and object. It forms these two concepts, just as it forms all others. When therefore as thinking subject, we refer a concept to an object , we must not understand this reference as something merely subjective. It is not the su bject that makes the reference, but thinking. The subject does not think because it is subjec t; rather it appears to itself as a subject because it is able to think. The activity carried out by man as a thinking being is, therefore, not a merely subjective activity. Rather it is neither subjective nor objective; it is an activity that goes be yond both these concepts. I ought never to say that my individual subject thinks; in fact, my s ubject exists by the very grace of thinking. Thinking, therefore, is an element that ta kes me beyond myself a nd unites me with the objects. Yet at the same time it separates me from them, inasmuch as it sets me, as subject, over against them. Man’s twofold nature is due to this: he thinks, and in so doing encompasses himself and the rest of the world; but at the same time, it is also by means of thinking that he defines himself as an individual who confronts the objects. The next step is to ask ourselves: How does the other element, - that in consciousness meets with thinking - which we have so far simply called the object of observation, enter our consciousness? In order to answer this question, we must se parate from our field of observation all that has been brought into it by thinking. For the co ntent of our consciousness at any moment is already permeated with concepts in the most varied ways. We must imagine a being with fully devel oped human intelligence suddenly waking into existence out of nothing, and confronting th e world. Everything of which it was aware before its thinking activity began, would be the pure content of observation. The world would then reveal to this be ing nothing but the mere disconn ected aggregate of objects of sensation: colors, sounds, sensations of pressu re, warmth, taste and smell, then feelings of pleasure and displeasure. This aggregate is the content of pure, unthinking observation. Over against it stands thinking, ready to unfol d its activity if a point of attack can be found. Experience soon shows that it is found. Th inking is able to draw threads from one element of observation to another. It connect s definite concepts with these elements and"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"thereby brings about a relationship between them. We have already seen above how a sound that comes to meet us is connected w ith another observation by our identifying the former as the effect of the latter. If we now remind ourselves that the activity of thinking is never to be understood as a subjective activity, then we shall not be tempted to believe that such relationships, established by thinking, have merely a subjective value. Our next task is to discover by means of thinking reflection what relation the above- mentioned directly given content of ob servation has to our conscious subject. The varied ways of using words make it necessa ry for me to come to an agreement with my readers concerning the use of a word whic h I shall have to employ in what follows. I shall use the word perceptions for the imme diate objects of sensation enumerated above, insofar as the conscious subject becomes aware of them through observation. It is therefore not the process of observation, but the object of observation which I call perception.25 I do not choose the word sensation because in physiology this has a definite meaning which is narrower than that of my concept of perception. I can call a feeling in myself a perception, but not a sensation in the physiological sense. But I also become aware of my feelings by their becoming perceptions for me. And the way we become aware of our thinking through observation is such that we can also call thinking, as it first comes to the notice of our consciousness, a perception. The naive man considers his perceptions, in the sense in which they directly seem to appear to him, as things having an existence completely independent of himself. When he sees a tree he believes, to begin with, that it stands in the form which he sees, with the colors of its various parts, et c., there on the spot toward wh ich his gaze is directed. When in the morning he sees the sun appear as a disk on the horizon and follows the course of this disk, his opinion is that all this actually exists (by itself) and occurs just as he observes it. He clings to this belief until he meets with further perceptions which contradict those he first had. The child who has as yet no experience of distance grasps at the moon, and does not correct his first impre ssion as to the real distance until a second perception contradicts the first. Every extension of the circle of my perceptions compels me to correct my picture of the world. We see this in everyday life, as well as in the intellectual development of mankind. That picture which the ancients made for themselves of the relation of the earth to th e sun and to the other heavenly bodies had to be replaced through Copernicus by a different one, because theirs did not accord with perceptions which were unknown in those earl y times. A man who had been born blind said, when operated on by Dr. Franz,25a that the idea of the size of objects which he had formed by his sense of touch before his opera tion, was a very different one. He had to correct his tactual perceptions by his visual perceptions. Why are we compelled to make these c onstant corrections of our observations?"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"A simple reflection will answer this question. When I stand at one end of an avenue, the trees at the far end seem smaller and nearer together than those where I stand. The picture of my perception changes when I change the place from which I am looking. The form in which it appears to me, therefore, is depende nt on a condition which belongs not to the object, but to me, the perceiver. It is all the same to the avenue where I stand. But the picture of it which I receive de pends essentially on the pla ce where I stand. In the same way, it is all the same to the sun and the pl anetary system that hu man beings happen to consider them from the earth; but the per ception-picture of the heavens which human beings have is determined by the fact that they inhabit the earth. This dependence of our perception-picture upon our plac e of observation is the easie st one to grasp. Matters already become more difficult when we lear n how our perceptions are dependent on our bodily and spiritual organization. The physicist shows us that within the space in which we hear a sound, vibrations of the air occur, and also that in the body in which we seek the origin of the sound, vibrating movements of its parts will be f ound. We perceive this movement as sound, but only if we have a normally constructed ear. Without this, the whole world would be forever silent for us. From physiology we know that there are people who perceive nothing of the splendor of color surrounding us. Their perception- picture shows only degrees of light and dar k. Others are blind to one color, e.g., red. Their picture of the world lacks this shade of color, and therefore is actually a different one from that of the average person. I w ould call the dependen ce of my perception- picture on my place of observation, a math ematical one, and its dependence on my organization a qualitative one. The first determ ines the proportions of size and mutual distances of my perceptions, th e second their quality. The fact that I see a red surface as red - this qualitative determination - depends on the organization of my eye. My perception-pictures, then, are subjective to begin with. Knowle dge of the subjective character of our perceptions ma y easily lead to doubt that th ere is any objective basis for them at all. If we know that a perception, for ex ample, that of the color red or of a certain tone, is not possible without a sp ecific structure of our organi sm, it is easy to believe that it has no existence at all apart from our subj ective organization, that without the act of perceiving - the objective of which it is - it would have no kind of existence. This view found a classical exponent in George Berkel ey.26 His opinion was that man, from the moment he realizes the significance the subjec t has for perception, is no longer able to believe in the presence of a world w ithout the conscious spirit. He said: “Some truths there are so near and obvious to the mind that a man need only open his eyes to see them. Such I take this important one to be, viz., that al l the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth - in a word, all those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world - have not any subsistence without a mind; that their being is to be perceived or known; that, consequently, so long as they are not actually perceived by me, or do not exist in my mind or that of any other created spirit, they must either have no existence at all or else subsist in the mind of some Eternal Spirit.” According to this view, nothing remains of the perception, if one disreg ards the fact of its being perceived. There is no color when none is seen, no sound when none is heard. Apart from the act of perception, extension, fo rm and motion exist as little as do color"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"and sound. Nowhere do we see bare extension or form; these are always connected with color or some other quality unquestionably depe ndent on our subjectivity. If these latter disappear when our perception of them disa ppears, then the former, being bound up with them, must likewise disappear. To the objection that even if figure, color, sound, etc., have no othe r existence than the one within the act of perception, yet there must be things that exist apart from consciousness and to which the conscious perception pictures are similar, the above view would answer that a color can be similar only to a color, a figure only to a figure. Our perceptions can be similar only to our perceptions, and to nothing else. What we call an object is also nothing but a coll ection of perceptions which ar e connected in a particular way. If I strip a table of its form, extension, colo r, etc., - in short, of all that is only my perception-then nothing else remains. If this view is followed to its logical conclusion, it leads to the assertion that th e objects of my perceptions ar e present only through me and, indeed, only in as far as, and as long as I pe rceive them. They disappear with the act of perceiving them, and have no meaning apart fr om it. But apart from my perceptions I know of no objects and cannot know of any. No objection can be made to this assertion as long as in general I merely take into account the fact that the perception is part ially determined by the organization of my subject. It would be very different if we were able to estimate what function our perceiving has in bringing about a percepti on. We should then know what happens to the perception during the act of pe rceiving, and could also determine how much of it must already have existed before it was perceived. This leads us to turn our consideration from the object of percepti on to its subject. I perceive not only other things; I also perc eive myself. The immediate content of the perception of myself is the fact that I am the stable element in contrast to the continually coming and going perception-pictur es. The perception of the I can always come up in my consciousness while I am having other per ceptions. When I am absorbed in the perception of an object that is given, then, for the time being, I am conscious only of this object. To this, the perception of my self can come. I am then conscious, not only of the object, but also of my own pe rsonality, which confronts the object and observes it. I do not merely see a tree, but I also know that it is I who see it. I also realize that something takes place in me while I observe the tree. Wh en the tree disappears from my field of vision, an after-effect of this process remains in my consciou sness: an image of the tree. This image became united with my self dur ing my observation. My self has become enriched; its content has taken a new elem ent into itself. This element I call my representation of the tree. I should never be in a position to speak of representations if I did not experience them in the perception of my own self. Perceptions would come and go; I should let them slip by. Only because I perceive my self, and am aware that with each perception the content of my self also changes, do I find myself compelled to bring the observation of the object into connecti on with the changes in my own condition, and to speak of my representation."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"I perceive the representation in my self in the same sense as I perceive color, sound, etc., in other objects. Now I am also able to make the distinction that I call those other objects that confront me, outer world, whereas the content of my self-p erception I call inner world. Misunderstanding of the relationship between representation and object has led to the greatest mistakes in modern philos ophy. The perception of a change in us, the modification experienced in the self, has b een thrust into the foreground and the object which causes this modification is lost sight of altogether. It is sa id: We do not perceive the objects, but only our repres entations. I am supposed to kn ow nothing of the table in itself, which is the object of my observation, but only of the changes which occur in my self while I perceive the table. This view should not be conf used with that of Berkeley, mentioned above. Berkeley maintains the subjec tive nature of the content of perceptions, but he does not say that I can know only of my own representations. He limits man’s knowledge to his representations because, in his opinion, there are no objects outside the act of representing. What I regard as a tabl e is no longer present, according to Berkeley, when I cease to turn my gaze toward it. This is why Berkeley lets our perceptions arise directly out of the omnipoten ce of God. I see a table because God calls up this perception in me. For Berkeley, therefore, there are no r eal beings other than God and human spirits. What we call “world” is present only within spirits. For Berkeley, what the naive man calls outer world, or physical nature, is not th ere. This view is contrasted by the now predominant Kantian view”’ which limits our knowledge to our representations, not because it is convinced that there cannot be things in existence besides these representations, but because it believes us to be so organized that we can experience only the modification in our own self, not the thing- in-itself that causes this modification. This conclusion arises from the view that I know only my representations, not that there is no existence apart from them, but only that the s ubject cannot take such an existence directly into itself; all it can do is merely through “the medium of its subjective thoughts to imagine it, invent it, think it, cognize it, or perhaps also fail to cognize it.”28 This view believes it expresses something absolutely certain, something that is immediately obvious, in need of no proof. “The first fundamental principle which the philosopher has to bring to clear consciousness consists in th e recognition that our knowledge, to begin with, does not reach beyond our representations. Our represen tation is the only thing we experience and learn to know directly and, just because we have direct expe rience of it, even the most radical doubt cannot rob us of our knowledge . By contrast, the knowledge that goes beyond our representations - taking this expressi on here in the widest possible sense, so that all physical happenings are included in it - is open to doubt. Hence, at the very beginning of all philosophizing, all knowle dge which goes beyond representations must explicitly be set down as being open to doubt.” These are the opening sentences of Volkel t’s book on Kant’s Theory of Knowledge.29 What is put forward here as an immediate and se lf-evident truth is in reality the result of a line of thought which runs as follows: The naive man believes that the objects, just as"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"he perceives them, are also present outsid e his consciousness. Physics, physiology and psychology, however, seem to show that for our perceptions our organization is necessary and that, therefore, we cannot know about anything except what our organization transmits to us from the objects. Our per ceptions therefore are modifications of our organization, not things-in-themselves. The tr ain of thought here indi cated has, in fact, been characterized by Eduard von Hartmann30 as the one which must lead to the conviction that we can have a direct knowledge only of our own representations.31 Outside our organisms we find vibrations of physical bodies and of ai r; these are sensed by us as sounds, and therefore it is concl uded that what we ca ll sound is nothing but a subjective reaction of our orga nisms to these movements in the external world. In the same way, color and warmth are found to be merely modifications of our organisms. And, indeed, the view is held that these two kinds of perceptions ar e called forth in us through effects or processes in the external world which are utterly different from the experiences we have of warmth or of color. If these processes stimul ate the nerves in my skin, I have the subjective per ception of warmth; if they happen to encounter the optic nerve, I perceive light and color. Light, co lor and warmth, then, ar e the responses of my sensory nerves to external s timuli. Even the sense of touc h does not reveal to me the objects of the outer world, but only conditions in myself. In the sense of modern physics, one must imagine that bodies consist of infinitely small particles, molecules, and that these molecules are not in direct contact, but are at certain distances from one another. Between them, therefore, is empty space. Ac ross this space they act on one another by attraction and repulsion. If I put my ha nd on a body, the molecules of my hand by no means touch those of the body directly, but th ere remains a certain distance between body and hand, and what I sense as the body’s resistan ce is nothing other than the effect of the force of repulsion which its molecules exert on my hand. I am completely external to the body and perceive only its e ffects upon my organism. These considerations have been supplemented by the theory of the so-called specific nervous energy, which has been advanced by J. Miiller (1801-1958).32 According to this theory, each sense has the peculiarity that it responds to all external stimuli in one definite way only. If the optic nerve is stimul ated, perception of light results, irrespective of whether the nerve is stimulated by what we call light, or by a mechanical pressure, or an electric current. On the other hand, the same external stimulus applied to different senses gives rise to different perceptions. This app ears to show that our sense-organs can transmit only what occurs in themselves, but nothing from the external world. They determine our perceptions, each according to its own nature. Physiology also shows that ther e is no question of a direct k nowledge of what the objects cause to take place in our sense-organs. When the physiologist traces the processes in our bodies, he discovers that already in the sense-organs, the effects of the external vibrations are modified in the most manifold ways. This can be seen most clearly in the case of the eye and ear. Both are very complicated or gans which modify the external stimulus considerably before they conduct it to the corresponding nerve. Fr om the peripheral end of the nerve the already modified stimulus is then led further to the brai n. Here at last the central organs are stimulated in their turn. From this the conclusion is drawn that the external process must have undergone a seri es of transformations before it reaches"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"consciousness. What goes on in the brain is connected by so many intermediate processes with the external process, that any similarity to the latter is unthinkable. What the brain ultimately transmits to the soul is neither external processes nor processes in the sense- organs, but only such as occur in the brain. But even these are not directly perceived by the soul; what we finally have in conscious ness are not brain pr ocesses at all, but sensations. My sensation of re d has absolutely no similarity to the process which occurs in the brain when I sense the red. The red is caused by the processes in the brain and appears again only as an effect of this in the soul. This is why Hartmann says:33 “What the subject perceives therefore is always only modifications of his own psychic states and nothing else.” When I have sensations, these ar e as yet far from being grouped into what I perceive as objects. For only single sensations can be transmitted to me by the brain. The sensations of hardness and softness are transm itted to me by the sens e of touch, those of color and light by the sense of sight. Yet a ll these can be found united in one and the same object. The unification must, therefore, be caused by the soul itself; this means that the soul combines into bodies the separate sensations tran smitted through the brain. My brain gives me separately and indeed along very different paths, the sensations of sight, touch and hearing, which the soul then combin es into the representation “trumpet.” This last link (the representation of trumpet) is the very first process to enter my consciousness. In it can no longer be found anything of what is outside of me and originally made an impression on my senses. Th e external object has been entirely lost on the way to the brain and th rough the brain to the soul. In the history of man’s intellectual endeavor it would be hard to find another edifice of thought which has been put together with gr eater ingenuity and ye t which, on closer analysis, collapses into nothing. Let us look a little closer at the way it has been built up. The starting point is taken from what is given in naive consciousness, that is, from things as perceived. Then it is shown that nothing of what belongs to th ese things would be present for us had we no senses. No eye: no co lor. Therefore, the color is not yet present in what affects the eye. It ar ises first through the interaction of the eye and the object. The latter must, therefore, be colorless. But neithe r is the color present in the eye, for what is present there is a chemical or physical process which first has to be led by the optic nerve to the brain, and there releases an other process. This is not yet the color. The latter is only called up in the soul through the process in the brain. As yet it does not enter my consciousness, but is first placed by the s oul on a body outside. Here, finally, I believe that I perceive it. We have completed a circle . We are conscious of a colored object. This is the starting point; here the building up of thoughts begins. If I had no eye, for me the object would be colorless. I cannot, therefor e, place the color on the body. I start on a search for it. I look for it in th e eye: in vain; in the nerve: in vain; in the brain: in vain once more; in the soul: here I find it indee d, but not attached to the body. I recover the colored body only there at the point from wh ich I started. The circle is closed. I am confident that I recognize as a product of my soul what the naive man imagines to be present out there in space. As long as one remains here, everything seems to fit beautifully. But we must start again from the beginning. Until now I have been d ealing with the outer perception, of which earlier, as naive man, I had a completely wrong op inion. I believed that just as I perceive"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"it, it had an objective existence. But now I have noticed that in the act of representing it, it disappears; that it is only a modification of my soul condition. Is there any justification for using it as a starting point in my considera tion! Can I say of it that it affects my soul? From now on I have to treat th e table, of which earlier I believed that it acted on me and brought about in me a representation of itself, as being itself a representation. From this it follows logically that my sense-organs and th e processes in them are also mere subjective manifestations. I have no right to speak of a real eye, but only of my representation of eye. And the same holds good in regard to the nerves and the brain process, and no less in regard to what takes place in the soul itself, through which, out of the chaos of manifold sensations, objects are supposed to be built up. If I run through the steps of my act of cognition once more, presupposing the first line of thought to be correct, then the latter shows itself to be a web of representations which, as such, could not act upon one another. I cannot say: My repr esentation of the object aff ects my representation of the eye, and from this interaction the represen tation of color comes a bout. Nor is there any need for saying this, for as soon as it is cl ear to me that my sense-organs and their activity, and my nerve and soul processes as well, can also be given only through perception, then the described line of thought sh ows itself in its full impossibility. It is true that I can have no per ception without the corresponding sense-organ, but neither can I have the sense-organ without perception. From my perception of the table I can go over to the eye which sees it, and to the nerves in the skin which touch it, but what takes place in these I can, again, learn only from per ception. And there I soon notice that in the process which takes place in the eye there is no trace of similarity to what I perceive as color. I cannot deny the existence of my color perception by pointing to the process which takes place in the eye during this percep tion. And just as little can I find the color in the nerve and brain processes; all I do is only add new perceptions, within the organism, to the first perception, which th e naive man placed outside his organism. I simply pass from one perception to another. Apart from this there is an error in the whol e conclusion of the line of thought. I am able to follow what takes place in my organism up to the processes in my brain, even though my assumptions become more and more hypot hetical the nearer I get to the central processes in the brain. But the path of obser vation from outside ceases with what takes place in my brain, ceases, in fact, with what I should observe if I could treat the brain with the assistance and met hods of physics and chemistry. The path of observation from within begins with the sensation and continue s up to the building up of objects out of the material of sensation. In the transition from brain-process to sensation, there is a gap in the path of observation. This characteristic way of thinking, which descri bes itself as critical idealism, in contrast to the standpoint of naive consciousness whic h it calls naive realism, makes the mistake of characterizing one perception as representation while taking another in the very same sense as does the naive realism which it apparently refutes. Critical idealism wants to prove that perceptions have the character of representations; in this attempt it accepts - in naive fashion - the perceptions belonging to th e organism as objective, valid facts, and, what is more, fails to see that it mixes up two spheres of observation, between which it can find no mediation."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Critical idealism is able to refute naive re alism only by itself assumi ng, in naive-realistic fashion, that one’s own organism has objective ex istence. As soon as the critical idealist becomes conscious of the complete similar ity between the perceptions connected with one’s own organism and those which naive r ealism assumes to have objective existence, he can no longer rely on the pe rceptions of the organism as being a safe foundation. He would have to regard his own subjective organization also as a mere complex of representations. But then the possibility ceases of regarding the content of the perceived world as a product of man’s sp iritual organization. One woul d have to assume that the representation “color” was onl y a modification of the repr esentation “eye.” So-called critical idealism cannot be proved without borrowing something from naive realism. Naive realism can only be refuted by accepting it s assumptions - without testing them - in another sphere. This much, then, is certain: Investigations within the sphere of perceptions cannot prove critical idealism, and consequently cannot stri p perceptions of their objective character. Still less can the principle, “T he perceived world is my repres entation,” be stated as if it were obvious and in need of no proof. Sc hopenhaue34 begins his principal work, Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, The World as Will and Representation, with the words: “The world is my representation - this is a truth which holds good for every being that lives and cognizes, though man al one is able to bring it into reflective, abstract consciousness. If he really does this, then he has atta ined to philosophical self- consciousness. It then becomes clear and certain to him that he does not know a sun or an earth, but always only an eye that sees a s un, a hand that feels an earth; that the world which surrounds him is only there as repr esentation, that means throughout only in relation to something else, to th e one who represents, that is, to himself. If ever a truth can be asserted a priori, this one can, for it e xpresses the form most general of all possible and thinkable experiences, more general than time, or space, or causality, for all these presuppose it...” The principle above: “The world is my re presentation,” on which this is based, is, however, wrecked by the fact, already mentioned, that the eye and the hand are perceptions in just the same sense as the sun and the earth. And if one used Schopenhauer’s expressions in his own sense, one could object to his principle: My eye that sees the sun and my hand that feels the earth are my re presentations, just like the sun and the earth themselves. But that, with this, the principle is cancelle d out, is immediately obvious. For only my real eye and my real ha nd could have the repr esentations “sun” and “earth” as their modifications; my represen tations “eye” and “hand” cannot have them. But critical idealism can speak of representations only. It is impossible by means of critical idealism to gain insight into what relation perception has to representation. It is insensible to the distinction, mentioned on page 85, of what happens to the perception while perceiving take s place and what must be inherent in it before it is perceived. We must, therefore, atte mpt to gain this insight along another path."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE ACT OF KNOWING THE WORLD From the foregoing considerations it follows that by investigati ng the content of our observation it is impossible to pr ove that our perceptions are representations. This proof is supposed to follow from the fact that if the process of perception takes place in the way it is imagined, according to th e naive-realistic suppositions as to man’s psychological and physiological constitution, then we are dealing, not with things-in-themselves, but merely with our representations of things. Now if naive realism, when consistently thought through, leads to results which directly cont radict what it presupposes, then one must regard its presuppositions as unsuitable for the foundation of a world view and discard them. It is certainly inadmissible on the one hand to reject the pres uppositions and yet, on the other, to regard their outcome as valid, as does the critical idealist when he bases his assertion, The world is my representati on, on the so-called proof indicated above. (Eduard von Hartmann gives a full account of this line of argument in his work, Das Grundproblem der Erkenntnistheorie, The Basi c Problem of a Theory of Knowledge.) The correctness of critical idealism is one thing, the power of c onviction of its proof another. How it stands with the former will be seen later in the course of our discussion. But the power of conviction of its proof is nil. If one builds a hous e and the first floor collapses while the second floor is being built, then the second floor collapses also. As first floor is related to sec ond floor, so is naive realism related to critical idealism. For the one holding the view th at the whole world we percei ve is only a world that we represent to ourselves and, indeed, only the effect on our soul of things unknown to us, the essential problem of knowledge is natura lly concerned, not with the representations present only in the soul, but with the things which lie outside our consciousness and are independent of us. He asks: How much can we indirectly learn about them, since they are not directly accessible to our observation? From this point of view he is concerned, not with the inner connection of his conscious perceptions, but with their causes, which lie beyond his consciousness and exist independently of him while the perceptions disappear as soon as he turns his senses away from things. From this point of view, our consciousness acts like a mirror from which the pictures of things also disappear the moment its reflecting surface is not turned toward them. He who does not see things themselves, but only their reflections, must obtain information about their nature indirectly by drawing conclusions from the behavior of the reflections. This is the standpoint of modern natura l science, which uses per ceptions only as a means of obtaining information about the processes of matter which lie behind them, and alone really “are.” If the ph ilosopher, as critical idealist, acknow ledges a real ex istence at all, then his sole aim is to gain knowledge of this real existe nce indirectly by means of his representations. His interest skips over the su bjective world of representations and instead pursues what produces these representations. But the critical idealist may go as far as to say: I am confined to the world of my representations and cannot get beyond it. If I think that th ere is something behind my representations, then ag ain this thought is nothing but my representation. An idealist of this kind will then either deny the thing-in-its elf entirely or, at any rate, say that it has no"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"significance for human beings, that it is as good as non-existent since we can know nothing of it. To this kind of critical idealist the whole worl d seems a dream, in the face of which all striving for knowledge is simply meaningless. For him there can be only two kinds of men: those who are victims of the illusion th at their own dream-pictures are real things, and the wise ones who see through the nothingn ess of this dream-world and therefore must gradually lose all desire to trouble them selves further about it. From this point of view, even one’s own personality may beco me a mere dream phantom. Just as during sleep, among our dream-images an image of our self appears, so in waking consciousness the representation of the I is added to the representations of the outer world. We then have in consciousness not the real I, but only our representation of the I. Now, if the existence of things is denied or at least it is denied that we can know anything of them, then the existence or the know ledge of one’s own personality must also be denied. The critical idealist then comes to maintain: “All reality transf orms itself into a wonderful dream - without a life which is dreamed about , and without a spirit which dreams - into a dream which hangs together in a dream of itself.”35 It does not matter whether the person who believes that he recognizes life to be a dream assumes nothing more behind this dream, or whet her he refers his repr esentations to real things: in either case, life must lose all scien tific interest for him. But whereas all science must be meaningless for those who believe th at the whole of the accessible universe is exhausted in dreams, for others who believe they can draw conclusi ons about the things from the representations, science will consis t in the investigati on of such “things-in- themselves.” The first world view could be described as absolute illusionism, the second is called transcendental real ism by its most consistent e xponent, Eduard von Hartmann.36 Both these views have this in common with naive realism that they seek to establish themselves by means of an investigation of perceptions. However, nowhere within this sphere can they find a firm foundation. An essential question for an adherent of transcendental realism must be: How does the I bring about, out of itself, the world of representations? Insofar as it w ould be a means of investigat ing indirectly the world of the I-in-itself, an earnest striving for knowledge could sti ll be kindled by a world of representations that was given us, even if this disappeared as soon as we shut our senses to the external world. If the things we expe rience were representations, then everyday life would be like a dream, and recognition of the tr ue situation would be like an awakening. Our dream pictures also interest us as l ong as we are dreaming a nd, consequently, do not recognize them as dreams. The moment we awaken we no longer look for inner connections between our dream-pictures, but for the physical, physiological and psychological processes which caused them . In the same way a philosopher who considers the world to be his representation cannot be interested in the inner connection of the details within it. If he allows for the existence of an I at all, then he will not ask how his representations are conne cted with one another, but what takes place in the soul that exists independently of him while his consciousness contains a certain content of representations. If I dream th at I am drinking wine which makes my throat burn, and I wake up coughing,37 then the moment I awaken I cease to be interested in what the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"dream was about; now my attention is c oncerned only with the physiological and psychological processes by means of which the irritation which caused me to cough comes to be symbolically expressed in the dream picture. Similarly the philosopher, as soon as he is convinced that the given wo rld consists of nothing but representations, would at once turn from them to the real soul behind them. Things become worse when illusionism completely denies the existence of the I-in-itself behind representations, or at least holds it to be unknowable. One may easily arrive at such a view through the observation that in contrast to dreaming there exists the waking state, in which we have the opportunity to see th rough the dream and to refer it to the real connections of things, but that we have no condition which is relate d similarly to our waking conscious life. To adopt this view is to fail to see that in fact ther e is something which is related to mere perceiving as waking experience is related to dreams. This something is thinking. The naive man cannot be considered to lack the insi ght referred to here. He takes the world as it is and regards things as real in the sense in which he experiences them to be so. The first step, however, which is taken beyond th is standpoint can only consist in asking: How is thinking related to pe rception? Whether or not the perception, in the form given me, continues to exist before and after my form ing a representation of it, - if I want to say anything whatever about it, I can do so only with the help of thinking. If I say: The world is my representation, I have expressed the resu lt of a thinking proce ss, and if my thinking is not applicable to the world, then this re sult is erroneous. Between a perception and any kind of assertion about it, thinking slips in. It has already been indicated why, in our c onsideration of things, we usually overlook thinking (See p. 61f.). This is due to the fact that we direct our attention only toward the object about which we think, but not toward our thinking at the same time. Naive consciousness treats thinking as something which has nothing to do with things, but stands altogether aloof from them and cont emplates them. The picture which the thinker makes of the phenomena of the world is cons idered, not as something belonging to them, but as something existing only in men’s heads. The world is complete, even without this picture. The world is finished and ready-made with all its substances and forces, and of this ready-made world man makes himself a picture. Whoever thinks along these lines should be asked: What gives you the right to declare the wo rld to be complete without thinking? Does the world not produce thinki ng in the heads of men with the same necessity as it produces the blossom on a plant? Plant a seed in the earth. Root and stem will grow. It will unfold leav es and blossoms. Then place the plant before you. In your soul it connects itself with a definite concept. Why shoul d this concept belong to the entire plant any less than leaf and blossom? You say: The leaves and blossoms are there without the presence of a perc eiving subject; the concept, ho wever, does not appear till a human being confronts the plant. Quite true. But leaves and blossoms appear on the plant only if there is soil in which the seed can be planted, and light and ai r in which the leaves and blossoms can unfold. In just this way does the concept of the plant arise when a thinking consciousness confronts it. It is quite arbitrary to regard as a totality, as a thing in its entiret y, the sum of what we experience through mere perception, and to rega rd as a mere addition, which has nothing to do with the thing itself, what reveals itse lf through thinking obser vation. If I receive a"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"rosebud today, the picture that offers itself to my perception is complete only for the moment. If I put the bud into water, tomorrow I shall get a quite different picture of my object. If I do not turn my gaze away from the rosebud, then I shall see today’s state gradually change into tomorrow’s through an in finite number of intermediate stages. The picture which presents itself to me at any one moment is only a chance section of an object which is in a continual process of b ecoming. If I do not put th e bud into water, a whole series of states, which as possibilities lay within the bud, will not be evolved; or tomorrow I may be prevented from observing the blossom further and therefore will have an incomplete picture of it. That opinion is quite subjective which, on the basis of a chance picture of a thing, declares: This is the thing. It is equally inadmissible to declare the sum of perceptions to be the thing. It could well be possible for a being to r eceive the concept at the same time as, and undivided from, the perception. To such a being it would neve r occur that the concept did not belong to the thing. He would ascribe to the concept an existen ce indivisibly bound up with the thing. Let me make myself clearer by an example. If I throw a stone horizontally through the air, I see it in different places, one after the othe r. I connect these places to form a line. In mathematics I learn to know various kinds of lines, one of which is the parabola. I know the parabola to be a line produced by a poi nt moving according to certain laws. If I investigate the conditions under which the stone moves, I find that the path traversed is identical with the line I know as a parabola. That the stone moves ju st in a parabola is a result of the given conditions and necessar ily follows from them. The form of the parabola belongs to the whole phenomenon as mu ch as does any other feature of it. The being described above, who did not have to ma ke the detour of th inking, would be given not only a sum of visual as pects at different points but , undivided from the whole occurrence, also the parabo lic form of the path which we add to the phenomenon by means of thinking. It is not due to the object s that they are given us at first without the corresponding concepts, but to our intellectua l organization. Our being as a to tality functions in such a way that from every reality the elements bel onging to it flow to us from two directions: from the direction of perceivi ng and from that of thinking. How I am organized for grasping them has not hing to do with the nature of things. The breach between perceiving and thinking is not present until the moment I, the one who contemplates them, confront the things. Wh ich elements do, and which do not belong to the object, cannot at all depend on the manner in which I arrive at knowledge of these elements. Man is a limited being. To begin with, he is a being among other bei ngs. His existence is bound up with space and time. Because of this, it is always only a limited section of the total universe that can be given him. But this limited section links itself in all directions,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"both in time and in space, to other sections . If our existence were so bound up with the surrounding world that every process would be a process in us as well, then the distinction between us and things would not exist. But then neither would there be any individual events for us. All events woul d pass over into one a nother continuously. The cosmos would be a unity, a totality enclosed within itself. Nowhere would there be a break in the stream of events. It is because of our limitations that things appear to us as if they were separate, when in reality they are no t separate at all. Nowhere, for example, is the singular quality of red present by itself, in isolati on. It is surrounded on all sides by other qualities, to which it be longs and without which it could not subsist. For us, however, to lift certain sections out from the rest of the world and to consider them by themselves, is a necessity. Our eye can take ho ld of only single colors , one after another, out of a totality of many co lors, our understand ing, of only single concepts out of a coherent system of concepts. This separating o ff is a subjective act, and it is due to the fact that man is not identical with the worl d process, but is a being among other beings. Now all depends on our defining how the being of man is related to other beings. This definition must be distinguished from mere ly becoming conscious of ourselves. This latter depends on the act of perceiving, just as does our becoming conscious of anything else. Self-perception shows me a number of qualities which I comprise in the unity of my personality in the same way as I comprise th e qualities yellow, metallic, hard, etc., in the unity “gold.” Self-perception does not take me beyond the sphere of what belongs to myself. This perceiving myself is to be di stinguished from defining myself by means of thinking. Just as I insert a sepa rate perception of th e external world into the connection of things by means of thinking, so do I insert the perceptions derived from myself into the world process by means of thinking. When I perceive myself, then I see myself as enclosed within certain limits, but my thinki ng has nothing to do with these limits. In this sense I am a twofold being. I am enclosed with in the sphere which I perceive as that of my personality, but I am also the bearer of an activity which, from a higher sphere, determines my limited existence. Our thinki ng is not individual like our sensing and feeling. It is universal. It receives an individual stamp in each separate human being only because it becomes related to his individua l feelings and sensations. Through these particular colorings of the uni versal thinking, single person s differ from one another. A triangle has only one single concept. For the cont ent of this concept it is quite immaterial whether the human bearer of c onsciousness who grasps it is A or B. But it will be grasped by each of the two bearers of consciousness in an individual way. This thought conflicts with a common prejudice which is very hard to overcome. Those who have this prejudice cannot reach the insight that th e concept of triangle which my head grasps is the same concept as that which my neighbor’s head gr asps. The naive man considers himself to be the maker of his concepts. He therefore believ es that each person has his own concepts. It is a fundamental requirement of philosophic thinking to overcome this prejudice. The one undivided concept, triangle, does not become a multiplicity because it is thought by many. For the thinking of th e many is itself a unity. In thinking, we are given that element whic h embraces our particular individuality and makes it one with the cosmos. In that we sense and feel (and also perceive), we are single entities; in that we think, we are the All-On e Being that pervades everything. This is the deeper foundation of ou r twofold being: We see within us a simply absolute force come"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"into existence, a force which is universal, bu t we learn to know it, not as it issues from the center of the world, but at a point of the periphery. Were the former the case, as soon as we came to be conscious, we should know the whole world riddle . But since we stand at a point on the periphery and find that our own existence is confin ed within definite limits, we must learn to know the region whic h lies beyond our own being with the help of thinking, which penetrates into us out of the general world existence. Through the fact that the thinking in us r eaches out beyond our separate existence and relates itself to the general world existence, there arises in us the urge for knowledge. Beings without thinking do not have this urge. When other things confront them, this gives rise to no questioning within them. Thes e other things remain external to such beings. But the concept rises up within thi nking beings when they confront external things. It is that part of things which we r eceive not from outside, but from within. It is for knowledge to bring about the agreement, the union of the two elements, the inner and the outer. The perception therefore is not something fini shed, not something self-contained, but one side of the total reality. The other side is the concept. The ac t of knowledge is the synthesis of perception and concept. Only pe rception and concept together constitute the whole thing. The above explanations give proof that it is meaningless to seek for any common factor in the separate entities of the world, other th an the ideal content to be found in thinking. All efforts must fail which seek to find any othe r world unity than this internally coherent ideal content which we gain by thinking consideration of our perceptions. Neither a humanly personal God, nor force, nor matter, nor idea-less will (Schopenhauer), is acceptable as the universal world unity. All th ese entities belong only to a limited sphere of our observation. Humanly limited personal ity we perceive only in man, force and matter in external things. As regards the will, it can be considered only as the expression of the activity of our finite personal ity. Schopenhauer38 wants to avoid making “abstract” thinking the bearer of the worl d unity, and instead seeks something which seems to him to be immediate reality. This philosopher believes we can never approach the world so long as we regard it as an external world. “In fact, the meaning sought for in the wo rld that confronts me solely as my representation, or the transition from it, as me re representation of the cognizing subject, to whatever it may be besides this, could neve r be found if the investigator himself were nothing more than the pure cognizing subj ect (a winged cherub without a body). But he himself is rooted in that worl d, he finds himself in it as an individual; this means that his knowledge, which is the necessary bearer of the whole world as representation, is yet always given through the medium of a body, whos e affections are, as we have shown, the starting point from which the intellect forms a view of that world. For the pure cognizing subject as such, this body is a representati on like every other re presentation, an object among objects; in this respect its movement s and actions are known to him in no other way than the changes in all other objects whic h he can contemplate, and would be just as strange and incomprehensible to him if thei r meaning were not revealed to him in an"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"entirely different way.... For the subject of cognition, who appears as an individual through his identity with the body, this body is gi ven in two entirely different ways: It is given as a representation for intelligent consideration, as obje ct among objects and subjected to their laws; but also, at the same time, in quite a different way, namely, as that which is directly known to everyone, a nd which is called will. Every true act of his will is also at once and unfailingly a move ment of his body: he cannot will the act without perceiving at the same time that it appears as a movement of the body. The act of will and the action of the body are not two di fferent conditions objectively recognized, connected by the bond of causality; they do not stand in the relation of cause and effect; they are one and the same, but are given in two entirely different ways: once quite directly, and once again for the in telligence that considers it.”39 By these arguments Schopenhauer believes hims elf entitled to see in the human body the “objectivity” of the will. In his opinion one feels in the actions of the body a direct reality, the thing-in-itself in the concrete. Th e objection to these arguments is that the actions of our body come to our consciousness only through self-perceptions, and that, as such, they are in no way superior to other pe rceptions. If we want to learn to know their nature, we can do so only by thinking investiga tion, that is, by fitting them into the ideal system of our concepts and ideas. Rooted most deeply in the naive conscious ness of mankind is the opinion: Thinking is abstract, empty of all concrete content. At most it can give an “ideal” mirror picture of the world, but nothing of the world itself. To ju dge like this is never to have become clear about what perception without the concept, is. Let us l ook at this realm of mere perceptions: it appears as a mere juxtapositi on in space, a mere succession in time, an aggregate of disconnected entities. None of the things which come and go on the stage of perception have any direct, perceptible connec tion with any others. From this aspect, the world is a multiplicity of objects of equal value. None plays any greater part in the hustle and bustle of the world than any other. If it is to become clear to us th at this or that fact has greater significance than another, we must consult our thinking. Without the functioning of thinking, the rudi mentary organ of an animal which has no significance in its life appears to us as equal in value to the most important limb. The separate facts appear in their own significance, as well as in their significance for the rest of the world only when thinking spins its threads from one en tity to another. This activity of thinking is one filled with content. For it is only th rough a quite definite, c oncrete content that I can know why the snail belongs to a lower level of organiza tion than the lion. The mere sight, the perception, gives me no content wh ich can inform me about the degree of perfection of an organization. Thinking brings this content to the perception from man’s world of concepts and ideas. In contrast to the content of perception given to us from outside, the content of thought shines forth in the inner being of man. The manner in which the content of thought fi rst appears, we will call intuit ion. Intuition is for thinking what observation is for perception. Intuiti on and observation are the sources of our knowledge. An observed object or event is foreig n to us as long as we do not have in our inner being the corresponding intu ition which completes for us that part of reality which is missing in the perception. To someone who lacks the ability to find intuitions corresponding to things, the full reality remain s inaccessible. Just as the color-blind sees"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"only differences of brightness without any colo r qualities, so the one who lacks intuition can observe only disconnected fragments of perceptions. To explain a thing, to make it intelligible, means nothing other than to place it into the context from which it has been torn owing to the nature of our organization as described above. Something cut off from the world whole does not exist. Isolation in any form has only subjective validity for our organization. For us the wo rld unity divides itself into above and below, before and after, cause a nd effect, object and representation, matter and force, object and subject, etc. What app ears to our observation as single entities, combines, bit by bit, through th e coherent, undivided world of our intuitions, and through thinking we again fit together into a unity everything we had divided through perceiving. The enigmatic aspect of an object is due to it s separate existence. But this separation is brought about by us and, within the worl d of concepts, can be cancelled again. Except through thinking and perc eiving, nothing is given to us directly. The question now arises: What significance has perception accord ing to our line of thought? We have, it is true, recognized that the proof which critical idealism brings forw ard for the subjective nature of perceptions, collapses, but the insight that the proof is wrong does not necessarily mean that what is asserted is incorrect. Critical ideal ism does not base its proof on the absolute nature of thinking, but relies on the fact that naive realism, when followed to its logical conclu sion, contradicts itself. How doe s the matter stand when the absoluteness of thinking is recognized? Let us assume that a certain perception, for example, red, appears in my consciousness. Continued consideration will show the perception to be connected with other perceptions, for example, a definite form, certain percep tions of temperature, and of touch. This combination I call an object of the sense world. I can now ask: Over and above the perceptions just mentioned, what else is ther e in that section of space where they appear? I shall find mechanical, chemical and other pr ocesses in that section of space. I now go further and investigate the processes I find on the way fr om the object to my sense organs. I can find movements in an elastic me dium, and their nature has not the slightest thing in common with the or iginal perception. I get the same result when I go on and investigate the further transmission between sense organs and brain. In each of these spheres I gather new perceptions, but th e connecting medium permeating all these perceptions standing side by si de in both space and time, is thinking. The air vibrations which carry sound are given me as perception, just as is the sound itself. Thinking alone links all these perceptions to one another, showing them in their mutual relationships. Beyond what is directly perceived, we cannot speak of anything except what can be recognized through the ideal connections of pe rceptions (that is, wh at can be discovered through thinking). That relati onship between the perceptual object and the perceiving subject, which goes beyond what can be perceive d, is therefore a purely ideal one, that is, it can be expressed only by means of concepts. Only if I could perceive how the perceptual object affects the perceiving s ubject, or, the other way round, if I could observe the building up of the perceptual pict ures by the subject, would it be possible to speak as does modern physiology and the cr itical idealism based on it. This view"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"confuses an ideal relation (that of the object to the subject) with a process which we could speak of only if it were possible to perceive it. The principle, “No color without a color- seeing eye,” is therefore not to be taken to mean that the ey e produces the color, but only that an ideal relationship, recognizable by th inking, exists between the perception, color and the perception, eye. Empiri cal science will have to esta blish how the nature of the eye and the nature of colors are related to one another, that is, by wh at means the organ of sight transmits the perception of colors, et c. I can trace how one perception succeeds another and how one is related to others in space, and I can formulate this in conceptual terms, but I cannot perceive how a perception originates out of the non-perceptible. All attempts to seek any relations between per ceptions other than thought relations must of necessity fail. What, then, is a perception? When asked in ge neral, this question is absurd. A perception always appears as a quite defin ite, concrete content. This cont ent is directly given and is completely contained within the given. Th e only question one can ask concerning this given is, What is it apart from being a percep tion; that is, What is it for thinking? The question concerning the “what” of a perception, therefor e, can refer only to the conceptual intuition which corresponds to it. Seen in this light, the question of the subjectivity of perceptions, in th e sense of critical idealism, cannot be raised at all. Only what is perceived as belonging to the subject can be termed “subjective.” No real process, in a naive sense, can form a link between the subjective and the objective, that is, no process that can be perceived; this is possible only for th inking. For us, then, that is objective which, to perception, lie s outside of the perceptual subject. My perceptual subject remains perceptible to me when the ta ble which stands before me has disappeared from my field of observation. My observation of the table has caused in me a change which likewise remains. I retain the ability to reproduce a picture of the table later. This ability to produce a picture remains connected with me. Psychology describes this picture as a memory representation. However, it is th e only thing which can correctly be called the representation of the table. For it corresponds to the perceptible change in me, caused through the presence of the table in my field of vision. And indeed, it is not a change in some “I-in-itself” standing behind the perceptual subject, but a change in the perceptible subject itself. A representation, then, is a subjective perception, in contrast to the objective perception which occurs when the obj ect is present in the field of vision. The confusing of the former subjective with th e latter objective perception leads to the misunderstanding of idealism: Th e world is my representation. The next step must be to define the concep t of representation mo re exactly. What we have so far described of it is not its concept; what we have described has only pointed the way to where in the perceptual field represen tations are to be found. The exact concept of representation will also then make it possible fo r us to gain a satisfactory explanation of the relationship between represen tation and object. This will al so lead us over the border- line, where the relationship between the hum an subject and the object belonging to the world is brought down from the purely concep tual field of knowledge into concrete individual life. Once we know what to think of the world, it will also be easy to adapt ourselves to it. We can only be active with our full human forces when we know the objects belonging to the world to which we devote our activity."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Addition to the Revised Edition (1918): The view I have characterized here can be regarded as one to which man is led at first, as if by a na tural instinct, the moment he begins to reflect upon his relati on to the world. He then finds himself caught in a thought formation which dissolves for him while he fram es it. This thought formation is such that a purely theoretical refutation of it does not suffice. One has to live through it and experience it in order to recognize how far it leads one astray, and then to find the way out. It must be a feature of any discussion concerning man’s relation to the world, not for the sake of refuting others whose view about this relation one believes to be wrong, but because one must oneself experience to what confusion every first reflection about such a relation can lead. One must gain that insight which will enable one to refute oneself with respect to such a first re flection. The above discussion is meant in this sense. When one tries to work out a view about man’s relation to the world, one becomes conscious of the fact that man himself creates this relation, at leas t in part, by forming representations about the things and events in the world. Th is draws his attention away from what is present outside in the world and directs it to his inner world, to his life of forming representations. He begins to say to himself: It is impossible for me to have a relationship to any thing or event unless a representation of it appears in me. From noticing this fact, it is but a st ep to the opinion: All that I e xperience is, after all, only my representation; I know about a world outside me only insofar as it is representation in me. With this opinion, man abandons the standpoint of naive reality which he has before he begins to reflect about his re lation to the world. From the na ive standpoint, he believes that he is dealing with real things. But reflection about hi s own being drives him away from this standpoint. This reflection does not allow him to turn his gaze toward a real world such as naive consciousness believes it confronts. This reflection turns his gaze only toward his representations ; his representations slip in between his own being and that real world the naive standpoint believes in. Man no longer can look through the intervening world of representations to any such reality. He has to assu me that he is blind to this reality. So the thought arises of a “thing-in-itself” which is inaccessible to knowledge. - As long as one considers only the relationship to the wo rld into which man appears to enter through his life of forming representations, one cannot escape from this line of thought. But one cannot remain at the naive standpoint of reality except by artificially curbing the thirst for knowledge. Th e fact that in man the need is present for knowledge about his relation to the world indi cates that the naive standpoint must be abandoned. If the naive standpoint gave us a nything that could be acknowledged as truth, then we should not feel this need. - But one does not arrive at anythi ng else that could be considered as truth if one merely abandons the naive sta ndpoint, but retains - without noticing it - the kind of thought which it imposes upon us. This is the mistake that is made when it is said: I experi ence only my representations, an d while I believe that I am dealing with reality, I am actua lly conscious only of my repres entations of reality; I must, therefore, assume that genuine reality, the “thing in-itself,” exists only outside the boundary of my consciousness and that I know no thing of it directly, but that it somehow approaches me and influences me in such a way that my representations come about. To think in this way is only to a dd in thought, to the world befo re us, another world; but one must begin the whole thinking process over ag ain with regard to this second world. For the unknown “thing-in-itself,” in its relation to man’s being, is thought of in exactly the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"same way as is the known thing of the naive standpoint of reality. - One only escapes the confusion that arises in on e’s critical reflection concer ning this standpoint when one notices that inside everything we can expe rience by means of pe rceiving, be it within ourselves or outside in the world, there is something which cannot succumb to the fate that a representation inserts itself between event and c ontemplating human being. And this something is thinking. With regard to thinking, man can remain at the naive standpoint of reality. If he does not do so, it is only because he has noticed that he has to abandon this standpoint in regard to other thi ngs, but overlooks the fact that this insight, which is true for other things , does not apply to thinking. When he notices this, he opens the portal to yet another insight, that in thinking and through thi nking that must be acknowledged to which man appears to bli nd himself because he has to place between himself and the world the life of representations. - A critic highly esteemed by the author of this book has objected that this discussi on of thinking remains at naive realism in regard to thinking, as it must if the real world and the world of representations are held to be one and the same. However, the author belie ves he has shown in just this discussion this fact: that an unprejudiced observation of thinking inevitably shows that “naive realism” is valid for thinking, and that naive realism, insofa r as it is not valid for other things, is overcome through the recognition of the true nature of thinking. THE HUMAN INDIVIDUALITY In attempting to explain repres entations philosophers have fo und that the main difficulty lies in the fact that we ourselves are not th e external things, and yet our representations must somehow correspond to things. But, on closer inspection, it turns out that this difficulty does not exist at all. We are certainly not the external things, but together with them we belong to one and the same world. That section of the world which I perceive as my subject is permeated by the stream of the universal world process. To my perceiving I appear, in the first instance, enclosed within the boundary of my skin. But all that is contained within the skin belongs to the cosm os as a whole. Hence for a relation to exist between my organism and an external object, it is by no means necessary that something of the object should slip into me or make an impression on my spirit, like a signet ring on wax. A question such as: How do I gain knowledge of the tree ten feet away from me? is wrongly formulated. It springs from the view that the boundari es of my body are absolute barriers, through which information about things filters into me. The forces active within the limit of my body are the same as those whic h exist outside. Theref ore, in reality I am the things; not, however, insofar as I am a per ceiving subject, but insofar as I am part of the universal world process. The perception of the tree and my I is within the same whole. There this universal world process calls forth the perception of the tree to the same extent that here it calls forth the percep tion of my I. Were I wo rld creator instead of world knower, object and subject (perception an d I) would originate in one act. For they depend on each other. As world knower I can discover the element they have in common, as entities belonging together, only through thinking which, by means of concepts, relates them to one another."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Most difficult of all to overcome are the so -called physiological proof s of the subjectivity of our perceptions. If I press the skin of my body, I perceive this as a sensation of pressure. Such pressure will be perceived by the eye as light, by the ear as sound. For example, by the eye I perceive an electric shock as light, by the ear as sound, by the nerves of the skin as shock, and by the nose as a phosphoric smell. What follows from these facts? Only this: that when I perceive an electric shock (or a pressure, as the case may be) followed by a light quality or a sound, re spectively, or a certain smell, etc., then, if no eye were present, no perception of a light quality would accompany the perception of mechanical vibrations in my enviro nment; without the presence of the ear, no perception of sound, etc. But what right has one to say that in the absence of sense- organs, the whole process would not exist at all? From the fact that an electrical process calls forth light in the eye, those who concl ude that outside our or ganism, what we sense as light is only a mechanical process of motion, forget that they are only passing from one perception to another, and nowhere to so mething over and above perceptions. Just as we can say that the eye perceives a mechanic al process of motion in its surroundings as light, we can also say that a re gulated change in an object is perceived by us as a process of motion. If I draw twelve pi ctures of a horse on the circumference of a rotating disc, reproducing exactly the positions which th e horse’s body successively assumes in movement, then by rotating the disc I can pr oduce the illusion of movement. I need only look through an opening in such a way that in the proper intervals I see the successive positions of the horse. I see, not twelve separa te pictures of a horse, but the picture of a single galloping horse. The above-mentioned physiological fact cannot, therefore, throw any light on the relation of perception to representation. Theref ore, we must find some other way. The moment a perception appears in my fi eld of observation, thinking also becomes active through me. A member of my thought-system, a defi nite intuition, a concept, unites itself with the perception. Then when the perception disappear s from my field of vision, what do I retain? My intuition, with the reference to the particular perception which formed itself in the moment of perc eiving. The degree of vi vidness with which I can recall this reference late r depends on the manner in whic h my intellectual and bodily organism is working. A representation is nothi ng but an intuition related to a particular perception; it is a concept that once was connected with a perception and retains the reference to this perception. My concept of a lion is not form ed out of my perceptions of lions. But my representation of a lion is inde ed formed according to my perception. I can convey to someone who has never seen a lion, the concept of a lion. But I can never bring about in him a vivid representation of a lion, without his perceiving one. A representation therefore is an indivi dualized concept. And now we have the explanation as to why our repr esentations can represent reality to us. The complete reality of something is submitted to us in the moment of observation through the flowing together of concept and perception. The concept acquires, through a perception, an individual form, a relation to this particular perception. In this individual form which has as a characteristic feature the reference to th e perception, the concept lives on in us as the representation of the thing in question. If we come across a second thing with which the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"same concept connects itself, we recognize th e second as belonging to the same kind as the first; if we come across the same thing tw ice, we find in our c onceptual system not only a corresponding concept, but the individua lized concept with its characteristic relation to the same object, and th us we recognize the object again. The representation, therefore, stands between perception and concept. It is the definite concept which points to the perception. The sum of those things about which I can form representations may be called my practical experience.40 The man who has the greater number of individualized concepts will be the man of richer practical experience. A man who lacks all power of intuition is not capable of acquiring practical experience. He again loses th e objects from his field of vision because he lacks the concepts which should bring him into relation with them. A man whose power of thinking is well develope d, but whose ability to perceive functions poorly due to clumsy sense-organs, will be no be tter able to gather pr actical experience. It is true that he can acquire concepts by one means and another, but his intuitions lack vivid reference to definite things. The unt hinking traveller and the scholar living in abstract conceptual systems are both incapab le of acquiring rich practical experience. Reality appears to us as perception and concep t, and the subjective representative of this reality is - representati on. If our personality expressed it self only in cogn ition, the totality of all that is objective would be given in perception, concep t and representation. However, we are not satisfied merely to re fer the perception, by means of thinking, to the concept, but we relate it also to our own s ubjectivity, to our indivi dual I. The expression of this individual relationship is feeling, which we experien ce as pleasure or displeasure. Thinking and feeling correspond to the twofol d nature of our being, which we have already considered. Thinking is the element through which we take part in the universal process of the cosmos; fee ling, that through which we can withdraw into the narrow confines of our own soul life. Our thinking unites us with the world; our feel ing leads us back into ourselves, and this makes us individuals. If we were merely th inking and perceiving beings, our whole life would flow along in monotonous indifference. If we could only cognize ourself as a self, we would be totally indifferent to oursel f. Only because with self-knowledge we experience self-feeling, and with the perception of objects pl easure and pain, do we live as individual beings whose existence is not exhausted by the conceptual relations in which we stand to the rest of the world, but who have a special value for themselves as well. One might be tempted to see in the life of f eeling an element more richly saturated with reality than is our thinking contemplation of the world. But the answer to this is that the life of feeling, after all, has this richer m eaning only for my individual self. For the world my life of feeling can attain value only if, as perception of my self, th e feeling enters into connection with a concept and, in this roundabout way, links itself to the cosmos."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Our life is a continual oscillat ion between our living with th e universal world process and our own individual existence. The further we ascend into the universa l nature of thinking where what is individual ultimately interests us only as example, as instance of the concept, the more the character of the quite definite individual personality is lost within us. The further we descend into the depths of our own soul life and let our feelings resound with the experiences of the outer wo rld, the more we cut ourselves off from universal life. A true individuality will be one who reaches up with his feelings farthest into the region of the ideal. There are people in whom even the most general ideas that enter their heads bear, nevertheless, that particular coloring wh ich shows unmistakably their connection with the indi vidual who thinks them. There are others whose concepts come before us without the least trace of i ndividual coloring, as if they had not been produced by a being of flesh and blood at all. The act of representing alrea dy gives our conceptual life an individual stamp. For each one of us has his special place from which he looks out upon the world. His concepts link themselves to his perceptions. He will think the general concepts in his own particular way. This particular determination comes a bout through the place we occupy in the world and from the perceptions bel onging to our sphere of life. Distinct from this determination is another, which depends on our pa rticular organization. Our organization is, indeed, a special, defini te, individual unity. Each of us combines particular feelings, and these in the most varying degrees of intensity, with his perceptions. This is the indivi dual aspect of our personality. It is what remains over when we have allowed fully for all the determining factors in our milieu. A life of feeling devoid of a ll life of thought would gradually lose all connection with the world. But because it is inherent in man to develop his whole nature, his knowledge of things will go hand-in-hand with the edu cation and development of his feeling-life. Feeling is the means whereby, to begin with, concepts atta in concrete life. ARE THERE LIMITS TO KNOWLEDGE? We have established that the elements for e xplaining reality are to be taken from the two spheres: perceiving and thinking. As we have seen, it is our organization that determines the fact that the full, complete reality of th ings, our own subject included, appears at first as a duality. Cognition overcomes this duality by combining the two el ements of reality: the perception and the concept gained by thinking, into the complete thing. If we call the world as it confronts us before it has attained its true aspect by means of cognition, “the world of appearance,” in c ontrast to the unified whole composed of perception and concept, then we can say: The world is give n us as a duality (dua listic), and cognition transforms it into a unity (monistic). A philo sophy which starts from this basic principle may be called a monistic philosophy, or monism, in contrast to the th eory of two worlds, or dualism. The latter does not assume that there are two sides of a single reality, which"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"are kept apart merely by our organization, but, rather, that th ere are two worlds, completely different from each other. Then in the one world it tries to find the principles that can explain the other. Dualism rests on a misunderstanding of what we call knowledge. It divides the whole of existence into two spheres, each of which has its own laws, and it lets these spheres stand opposite to and outside of each other. It is from a dualism such as this that ther e arises the distinction between the perceived object and the thing-in-itself which Kant41 introduced into science and which so far has not been expelled. From our discussion can be seen that it is due to the nature of our intellectual organization that a particular thing can be given us only as perception. Thinking then overcomes this separateness by referring each perception to its rightful place in the world whole. As long as the separa ted parts of the world whole are defined as perceptions, in this elimination we are si mply following a law of our subjectivity. If, however, we consider the sum-total of all perceptions as constituting one part, and confront it with the “thing-in- itself” as a second part, then our philosophising loses all foundation. It then becomes a mere playing wi th concepts. An artificial opposition is constructed, but it is not possibl e to attain a content for the second part of this opposition, since such content for a particular th ing can be drawn only from perception. Every kind of existence which is assumed out side the realm of perception and concept belongs to the sphere of unjustified hypothese s. The “thing-in-itsel f” belongs in this category. It is quite natural that a dualistic th inker should be unable to find the connection between a universal principle which he hypot hetically assumes, and the given, known by experience. One can obtain a content for the hypothetical universal principle only by borrowing a content from the sphere of expe rience and then shutting one’s eyes to the fact of the borrowing. Otherwise it remains an empty concept, a non-concept, which is nothing but a shell of a concept. Then the dua listic thinker usually maintains that the content of this concept is not accessible to our knowledge. We can know only that such a content must be present, but not what it is . In both cases it is impossible to overcome dualism. Even if one brings a few abstract el ements from the sphere of experience into the concept of the thing-in-itsel f, it still remains impossible to derive the rich concrete life of experience from those few qualities which, after all, are themselves taken from perception only. Du-Bois Reymond42 thinks that the imperceptible atoms of matter produce sensation and feeling by means of th eir position and motion, and then comes to the conclusion: We can never find a satisfa ctory explanation of how matter and motion produce sensation and feeling, for “It is abso lutely and forever unintelligible that it should be other than indiffere nt to a number of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, etc., how they lie and move, how they lay a nd moved, or how they will lie and will move. It is impossible to see how consciousness could come into existence through their interaction.” This conclusion is characteristic of this whol e trend of thought. Position and motion are abstractions derived from the ri ch sphere of perceptions. They are then transferred to the imagined world of atoms. Th en astonishment arises that real life cannot be evolved out of this principle which is self-made and borrowed from the sphere of perceptions."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"That the dualist who works with a completely empty concept of the “in-itself” of things can reach no explanation of the world, already follows from the definition of his principle indicated above. A dualist is always compelled to set impassa ble barriers to our faculty of knowledge. The follower of a monistic world view knows that everything he needs fo r the explanation of any given phenomenon in the world must lie w ithin this world itself. What hinders him from reaching the explanation can be only con tingent limitations in space and time, or shortcomings of his organization. And, indeed, not of the human organization in general, but only of his own particular one. It follows from the concept of cognition, as de fined by us, that one cannot speak of limits to knowledge. Cognition is not a concern of th e universe in general, but one which men must settle for themselves. Things clai m no explanation. They exist and act on one another according to laws which thinking can discover. They exist in indivisible unity with these laws. Our egohood confronts them, gr asping at first only what we have called perceptions. In the inner core of our egohood, however, we find the power to discover the other part of reality also. Only when the egohood has again combined for itself the two elements of reality which are indivisibly uni ted in the world, is the thirst for knowledge satisfied: the I has again come to reality. Therefore, the conditions required for cogniti on to arise, come about through and for the I. The I sets itself the problems of cogn ition. And it takes them from the element of thinking, in itself absolutely cl ear and transparent. If we as k questions we cannot answer, then the content of the questi on cannot be clear and distinct in all its details. The world does not set us the questions; it is we ourselves who set them. I can imagine that it would be quite impossi ble for me to answer a question which I happened to find written down somewhere, w ithout knowing the sphere from which the content of the question was taken. In knowledge we are concerned with questions which arise for us th rough the fact that a sphere of perceptions, conditioned by time, space, and our subjective organization, is confronted by a sphere of concepts pointing to a world which is a unity. My task is to reconcile these two spheres, well known to me. One cannot speak here of a limit of knowledge. It may be that at a particular moment, this or that remains unexplained because, through our place in life, we are prev ented from perceiving all that is involved. What is not found to-day, however, may be found tomorrow. The limits due to these causes are only transitory, and can be overcome by the progress of perceiving and thinking. Dualism makes the mistake of transferring the antithesis of object and subject, which has significance only within the sphere of perceptions, to purely in vented entities outside this sphere. But as the separate things within th e field of perception remain separated only as long as the perceiver refrains from thinking, which cancels all separation and shows it to be due to merely subjective factors, so the dua list, in fact, transfers to entities behind the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"sphere of perceptions definitions which, even for perceptions, have no absolute but only relative validity. In doing this he splits up the two factors concerned in the process of cognition, perception and concept, into four: 1) the object-in-itsel f, 2) the perception which the subject has of the object, 3) the subject, 4) the concept which relates the perception to the object-in-itself. The relation between object and subjec t is considered to be real, that is, the subject is considered to be really (dynami cally) influenced by the object. This real process is sa id not to appear in consci ousness. But it is supposed to evoke in the subject a response to the stim ulation from the object . The result of this response is said to be the perception. This at last enters our cons ciousness. The object is said to have an objective real ity (independent of the subject) , the perception a subjective reality. This subjective reality is said to be referred by the s ubject to the object. This latter reference is said to be an ideal one. The dua list, in other words, splits up the process of cognition into two parts. One part, i.e., the pr oduction of the perceptual object out of the thing-in-itself, takes place, according to him, outside of consciousness, the other part, the union of perception with concept and the re ference of this to the object, within consciousness. These presuppositions make it clea r that the dualist believes he receives in his concepts only something subjective, which represents what confronts his consciousness. The objectively real process in the subject, by means of which the perception comes about, and still more the objective relationships between things-in- themselves, remain inaccessible to direct c ognition for such a dualist . In his opinion, man can obtain only concepts that represent th e objectively real. The bond of unity which connects things with one another and also obj ectively with our indivi dual spirit (as thing- in-itself), lies beyond consciousness in a being- in-itself of whom we likewise can have in our consciousness only a concept that represen ts it. The dualist beli eves that the whole world would be nothing but a mere abstract scheme of concepts if he did not insist on “real” connections between the objects beside the conceptual ones. In other words, the ideal principles which can be discovered by th inking seem too airy fo r the dualist, and he seeks, in addition, “real principl es” with which to support them. Let us examine these “real principles” a little more closely. The naive man (naive realist) regards the objects of external experience as realities. The fa ct that his hands can grasp and his eyes can see these objects is for him th e proof of their realit y. “Nothing exists that cannot be perceived” is, in fact, the basic ax iom of the naive man, and it is held to be equally valid in its converse: “Everything whic h can be perceived, exists.” The best proof for this assertion is the naive man’s belief in immortality and in ghos ts. He thinks of the soul as a fine kind of physical matter whic h, in special circumstances, may actually become visible to the ordinary man (naive belie f in ghosts). In contrast to this real world of his, the naive realist regards everything else, especially the world of ideas, as unreal, as “merely ideal.” What we add to objects by, th inking is mere thoughts about the objects. Thought adds nothing real to perception. But it is not only with reference to the exis tence of things that the naive man regards sense perception as the sole proof of reality, but also w ith reference to happenings. According to him, one thing can act upon anot her only when a force actually present to sense perception issues from the one and se izes upon the other. The older physicists thought that very fine substa nces emanate from the objec ts and penetrate through the"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"sense-organs into the soul. They thought th e actual seeing of these substances to be impossible only because of the coarseness of our sense organs in comparison with the fineness of these substances. In principle, the reason for attributing reality to these substances was the same as that for attri buting it to the objects of the physical world, namely, the form of their existence, whic h was thought to be analogous to that of physical reality. The self-dependent nature of what can be experienced, not physically but ideally, is not regarded by naive consciousne ss as being real in the same sense. Something grasped “merely as idea” is regarded as a chimera until sense perception can provide conviction of its reality. In short, in addition to the ideal ev idence of his thinking, the naive man demands the real evidence of hi s senses. This need of naive man is the reason why primitive forms of belief in revelation arise. For naive consciousness, the God who is given through thinking always remains a God merely “thought.” Naive consciousness demands that the manifestati on should be through means accessible to physical perception. God must appear in bodily form; little value is attached to the evidence of thinking, but only to the Divine Nature bei ng proved by the changing of water into wine in a way which can be testifie d by the senses. The act of cognition, too, is regarded by naive man as a process analogous to sense-perception. Things must make an impression on the soul or send out imag es which penetrate the senses, etc. What the naive man can perceive with his senses he regards as real, and that of which he has no such perception (God, soul, cognition, et c.) he regards as analogous to what is perceived. A science based on naive realism will consist in an exact description of the content of perception. Concepts are only means to this end. They exist to provide ideal counterparts of perceptions. For things themselves, they ha ve no significance. For the naive realist, only the individual tulips which ar e seen or could be seen, are real. The one idea of the tulip, is to him an abstraction, is to him an unreal thought-picture, wh ich the soul has put together for itself out of the characteristics common to all tulips. Naive realism, with its fundamental principle of the reality of all pe rceived things, is cont radicted by experience, which shows us that the content of perceptions is of a transitory nature. The tulip I see, is real to-day; in a year it will have vanished in to nothingness. What persists is the species tulip. This species, however, for the naive real ist is “merely” an id ea, not a reality. Thus, this worldview finds itself in the position of seeing its realities ar ise and perish, while what it regards as unreal, in c ontrast to the real, persists. Hence the naive realist has to allow for the existence of something ideal besides the perceptions. He has to accept entities which he cannot perceive by means of the senses. He justifies this by imagining their existence to be analogous to that of physical obj ects. Such hypothetically assumed realities are the invisible forces by means of which objects perceptible to the senses act on one another. Heredity is thought of in th is way; it goes beyond the individual and is the reason why a new being develops from th e individual which is similar to it, and by means of it the species is maintained. The life principle permeating the organic body is also thought of in this way, and so is the soul, for which one always finds in naive consciousness a concept based on an analogy to sense reality, and finally so, too, the naive man thinks of the Divine Being. This Divine Being is thought of as active in a"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"manner exactly corresponding to what can be perceived as actions of men, that is, the Divine Being is thought of anthropomorphically . Modern physics traces sense-impressions back to processes in the smallest particles of bodies and to the infinitely fine substance, the ether, or to something similar. For example, what we sense as warmth, is, within the space occupied by the warmth-giving body, movement of its parts. Here again, some thing imperceptible is thought of on the analogy of what is perceptible. The physical an alogue to the concept “body” is, in this sense, something like the interior of a tota lly enclosed space in which elastic balls are moving in all directions, impinging on one a nother, bouncing on and off the walls, etc. Without such assumptions, for naive realism, the world would collapse into a disconnected chaos of perceptions with no mutual relationships to unite them. It is clear, however, that naive realism can arrive at these assumptions only by inconsistency. If it remained true to its fundamental principle th at only what is per ceived is real, then it would not assume a reality where it percei ves nothing. The imperceptible forces which proceed from perceptible things are essentiall y unjustified hypotheses from the standpoint of naive realism itself. And as the naive re alist acknowledges no other realities, he invests his hypothetical forces with pe rceptual content. In doing th is he applies a form of existence (perceptual existence) to a sphere where he lacks the only means that can give any evidence of such existence: perceivi ng by means of physical senses. This self- contradictory world view leads to metaphysical realism. Beside the perceptible reality, the metaphysical realist constructs an impe rceptible one which he thinks of on the analogy of the former. Metaphysical realism therefore, is of necessity dualistic. Where the metaphysical realist observes a re lation between perceptible things (mutual approach through movement, becoming conscious of an object, etc.), there he regards a reality as existing. But the relation that he notices he can, however, express only by means of thinking; he cannot perceive it. The relation, which is purely ideal, is arbitrarily made into something similar to what is perceptible. Thus, according to this line of thought, the real world is composed of pe rceptual objects which are in ceaseless flux, arising and disappearing, and of imperceptib le forces which are permanent and produce the perceptual objects. Metaphysical realism is a c ontradictory mixture of naiv e realism and idealism. Its hypothetical forces are imperceptib le entities endowed with th e qualities of perceptions. In addition to the sphere, for the form of existence of which he has a means of cognition in its perceptibility, the metaphysical realis t has decided to acknowledge another sphere to which this means is not applicable, a s phere which can be ascertained only by means of thinking. But he cannot at the same time decide also to acknowledge the form of existence which thinking mediates, namely the concept (the idea), as being of equal importance with perceptions. If one is to avoid the contradicti on of imperceptible perceptions, then it must be admitted th at the relation thinking mediates between perceptions can have no other form of existence for us than that of the concept. When the untenable part of metaphysical realism is reje cted, we then have the world before us as the sum of perceptions and their conceptual (ideal) relations. Then metaphysical realism"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"merges into a world view which requires the principle of perceptib ility for perceptions and that of “thinkability” for the relations be tween the perceptions. Side by side with the realm of perceptions and that of concepts , this world view can not acknowledge a third realm for which both principles, the so-called re al principle and the id eal principle, have equal validity. When the metaphysical realist maintains th at beside the ideal relation between the perceptual object and the perc eiving subject, there must also exist a real relation between the “thing-in-itself” of the perception and the “thing-in-itself” of the perceptible subject (of the so-called individual spirit), then this assertion is due to the mistaken assumption of the existence of a process, analogous to a process in the sense-world, but imperceptible. Further, when the metaphysical realist says: I have a conscious ideal relationship with my world of perceptions, but with the real world I can have only a dynamic (force) relationship, he then makes the above mistake to an even greater degree. One can only speak of a force-relationship with in the world of perceptions (in the sphere of the sense of touch), not outside that sphere. Let us call the world view characterized a bove, into which metaphys ical realism merges if it discards its contradictory elements, m onism, because it unites on e-sided realism with idealism in a higher unity. For the naive realist, the real world is an aggregate of objects of perception; for the metaphysical realist also the imperceptible fo rces are realities. In stead of forces, the monist has ideal connections which he atta ins by means of his thinking. The laws of nature are such connections. For a law of nature is nothing other than the conceptual expression for the connection of certain per ceptions. The monist never has any need to ask for factors other than pe rceptions and concepts, with which to explain reality. He knows that in the whole sphere of reality there is no need to ask for this. In the sphere of perceptions, directly acce ssible to his perceiving, he sees half of a reality; in the union of this sphere with the sphere of concepts, he finds the full reality. The metaphysical realist may make the objection to the adherent of moni sm: It could be that for your organization your knowledge is complete in itself, that no pa rt is lacking; but what you do not know is how the world is mirrored in an intelligence or ganized differently from your own. To this the monist would reply: If there are intellig ences other than human, if their perceptions have a different form than ours, then all th at would be of significance for me would be what reaches me from them by means of pe rceptions and concepts. By means of my perceiving and, in fact, by means of this specifically human ma nner of perceiving, as subject I am placed over against the object. Th e connection of things is thereby broken. The subject restores this connection by mean s of thinking. In doing so, things are re- inserted into the world whole. Since it is only through our subject th at this whole appears rent in two at the place between our perception and our concept, so likewise the union of these two factors gives us a true knowledge . For beings with a different world of perceptions (if, for example, they had twi ce as many sense-organs), the connection would appear broken in another place, and the restoration would, accordingly, have a form specific for such beings. The question concerni ng limits of knowledge exists only for the naive and metaphysical realists, both of whom see in the cont ent of the soul only an ideal"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"representation of the world. Fo r them, what exists outside the subject is something absolute, something self-dependent, and the co ntent of the subject is a picture of this absolute and is completely external to it. How complete is knowledge of this absolute would depend on the greater or lesser degree of resemblance between the picture and the absolute object. A being with fewer senses th an man would perceive less of the world, one with more senses would perceive more . The former’s knowledge would therefore be less complete than that of the latter. For the monist, things are different. It is th e organization of the perceiving being that determines how the world unity appears to be torn apart into s ubject and object. The object is not something absolute, but is onl y something relative in relation to this particular subject. The bridging of the contras ting entities can, therefore, take place again only in the quite specific way that is characteri stic of the human subject. As soon as the I, which, in perceiving, is separated from the worl d, reinserts itself in to the connection of things through thinking investigation, all further questioning ceases, since all questions arose only as a result of the separation. A differently constituted being would have a differently constituted knowledge. Our knowledge suffices to answer the questions asked by our nature. The metaphysical realist shoul d ask: How does what is given as perception come to be the given; what is it th at affects the subject? For the monist, the perception is determined by the subject. But in thinking, the subject has, at the same time, the means for can celling this determination, caused through the subject itself. The metaphysical realist is faced by a furthe r difficulty when he seeks to explain the similarity of the world pictures of diff erent human individuals. He cannot but ask himself: How is it that th e world picture which I build up out of my subjectively determined perceptions and out of my concep ts, turns out to be like that which another individual builds up out of th e same two subjective factor s? How, from my subjective world picture, can I infer anything about that of another human being? The metaphysical realist believes he can infer, from the fact that people come to terms with one another in practical life, that their subjective world pictur es must be similar. Fr om the similarity of these world pictures he then further infers that the “individual sp irits” behind the single perceiving human subjects, or th e “I-in-itself” behind the subjects, must also be similar. Therefore this inference is dr awn from a sum of effects to the nature of their underlying causes. It is believed that from a sufficiently large number of instances, the situation can be so recognized that one can know how the inferred causes will behave in other instances. Such an inference is called an i nductive inference. It will be necessary to modify the results if, from further observa tion, some unexpected element is discovered, because the result, after all, is determined only by the particular form of the earlier observation. The metaphysical realist maintain s that this stipulated knowledge of causes is quite sufficient for practical life."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Inductive inference is the methodical foundati on of modern metaphysical realism. At one time it was believed that out of concepts coul d be evolved something that is no longer a concept. It was believed that from concepts could be derived the metaphysical realities which of necessity, metaphysical realism must have. This kind of philosophizing is now superseded. Instead, it is believed that from a sufficiently large number of perceptual facts one can infer the character of the thing- in-itself which underlies these facts. Just as in the past one tried to derive the metaphys ical from concepts, so to-day one tries to derive it from perceptions. As concepts are transparent in their clarity, it was believed that one could also deduce the metaphysical from them with absolute certainty. Perceptions are not of such transparency. Each later perception is always a little different from those of the same kind that preceded it. Therefore, anything inferred from the earlier perception is, in reality, some what modified by each following one. The aspect of the metaphysical arrived at in this way, therefore, can be said to be only relatively correct, for it is subject to correction by future instan ces. Eduard von Hartmann’s metaphysics is of a kind that is determined by this methodical prin ciple. This is expressed in the motto he gave on the title-page of his first major work: “Speculative results according to the inductive method of natural science.” The form which the metaphysical realist give s to his things-in-themselves today is obtained by inductive inferences. His consid eration of the process of knowledge has convinced him that a connection of things, wh ich is objectively real, exists side by side with the “subjective” connection that can be known through perception and concept. The nature of this objective realit y he believes he can determin e by inductive inferences from his perceptions. Addition to the Revised Edition, (1918): Ce rtain representations which arise from investigations of natural phenomena tend, again and again, to disturb unprejudiced observation - as the effort has been made to describe it above - of how we experience concepts and perceptions. Such investigations show that in the light-spectrum the eye perceives colors from red to violet. However, within the spectrum’s sphere of radiation, but beyond the violet there are forces to wh ich corresponds no color perception of the eye, but a chemical effect and, similarly, be yond the limit of the red th ere exist radiations which have only effects of wa rmth. Investigation of these and similar phenomena has led to the opinion that the range of man’s sphere of perceptions is determined by the range of his senses, and that he would have before hi m a very different world if he had more or altogether different senses. Those who are in clined to flights of imagination, for which the glittering discoveries of recent scientific research in particular offer such tempting opportunities, may come to the conclusion: No thing can enter man’s field of observation except what is able to affect the senses of his bodily organization, and he has no right to regard what he perceives, by means of his limited organization, as being in any way a standard for ascertaining real ity. Every new sense would give him a different picture of reality. - Within its proper limits, this opinion is entirely correct. But one who allows this opinion to prevent him from observing wit hout prejudice the re lationship between concept and perception, as explai ned here, will put obstacles in the way to any realistic knowledge of man and world. To experience th inking in its own nature, that is, to experience the active working-out of the sphe re of concepts, is something entirely"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"different from the experience of something perceptible through the senses. Whatever senses man might possibly have, not one would give him reality if through the activity of thinking, he did not permeate with concepts the perceptions they conveyed to him; and indeed, every sense, of whatever kind, if thus permeated, gives man the possibility to live within reality. Speculations about quite differe nt perceptual pictur es conveyed by other senses, has nothing to do with the question concerning man’s relati on to reality. It is essential to recognize that every perceptual pi cture derives its form from the organization of the perceiving being, but the perceptual picture when permeated by thinking which is livingly experienced leads man into reality. A fanciful description of how different the world would appear to other than human senses cannot act as an incentive to man to seek for knowledge concerning his relationship to th e world; rather will this happen through the insight that every percepti on gives us only a part of th e reality it conceals, that, therefore, it leads away from its reality. This then brings us to the further insight that it is thinking which leads into that part of reality which the per ception conceals within itself. An unprejudiced observation of the relation between perceptions, and concepts worked out by thinking, as here described, may also be disturbed by the fact th at in the sphere of applied physics it becomes necessary to speak not at all of directly perceptible elements, but of non-perceptible magnitudes, such as line s of electric or magnetic force, etc. It may appear as if the elements of reality, spoken of in physics, had nothing to do either with what is perceptible or with concepts actively worked out by thinking. But such a view is based on self-deception. What matters is that all th at is worked out in physics - as long as it is not based on unjustifiable hypotheses whic h must be excluded - is obtained by means of perceptions and concepts. By a correc tly working instinct for knowledge in the physicist, what is apparently a non-perceptible c ontent will always be placed into the field of perceptions, and will be thought of in concepts belonging to this field. The magnitudes in electric and magnetic fields, etc ., are attained, owing to their nature, by no other process of cognition than the one which takes place between perception and concept. - An increase or a transformation of the human senses would give a different perceptual picture; it would be an enrichme nt or a transformation of human experience. But a real knowledge of this experience also could be attained only through the interplay of concept and perception. A deepening of knowledge depends upon the active power of intuition contained in thinking (see p. 113). In the living experience within thinking, this intuition can dive down into lesser or greater depths of reality. Through extension of the perceptual picture this diving down of intu ition can receive stimulation and thus be indirectly strengthened. But neve r should this diving into the de pths to attain reality be confused with being confronted with a wide r or narrower perceptual picture, in which there would always be contained only a half -reality determined by the organization of the cognizing being. If one avoids getting lost in abstractions, it w ill be recognized how significant, also for knowledge of the being of man, is the fact that in physics one has to include the existence, in the field of percep tions, of elements for which no sense organ is directly tuned as for color or sound. The essential being of ma n is determined not only by what confronts him through his organization as direct perception, but also by the fact that he excludes something else from this direct perception. Just as life needs, in addition to the conscious waking state, an unconscious sl eeping state, so, for man’s self-experience is needed besides the sphere of his sense perceptions, another sphe re also - indeed, a much larger one - of elements not perceptibl e to the senses, but existing within the same"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"field where sense-perceptions or iginate. All this was already indirectly indicated in the first edition of this book. The author here adds these amplifications to the content because he has found by experience that many readers have not read accurately enough. - Another thing to be considered is that the idea of perception, as presen ted in this book, is not to be confused with the idea of ex ternal sense-perception, which is but a special instance of perception. The reader will gather from what has already been said, but even more from what will follow, that here perception include s everything that man meets, physically or spiritually, before he has grasped it in ac tively worked out concepts. We do not need what we usually mean by senses in order to have perceptions of a soul or spiritual kind. It may be said that such extension of the ordina ry use of a word is inadmissible. Yet such extension is absolutely necessary if one is not to be barred by the current use of a word from enlarging the knowledge of certain fiel ds. If the word per ception is applied to physical perception only, then one cannot arri ve at a concept that can be of use for attaining knowledge even of this (physical) perception. Often it is n ecessary to enlarge a concept in order that it may preserve in a na rrower field the meaning appropriate to it. Or it is sometimes necessary to add something diff erent to the previous content of a concept in order that its first content may be justified or even readjusted. For example, it is said in this book (p. 124): “A representation, therefore, is an individualized concept.” It has been objected that this is an unusual use of the wo rd. But this use of the word is necessary if we are to find out what a representation real ly is. What would beco me of the progress of knowledge if, when compelled to readjust con cepts, one is always to be met with the objection: “This is an unusual use of the word”? THE FACTORS OF LIFE Let us recapitulate the results arrived at in the previous chapters. The world confronts man as a multiplicity, as a sum of separate entities. Man himself is one of these separate entities, a being among other beings. This aspect of the world we characterized simply as that which is given, and inasmuch as we do not evolve it by conscious activity, but find it present, we called it perception. Within the world of perceptions we perceive ourself. This self perception would remain merely one among the many other perceptions, did not something arise from the midst of this self-perception which proves capable of connecting perceptions in genera l and therefore also the sum of all other perceptions with that of ourself. This something which emerge s is no longer mere perception, neither is it, like perceptions, simply given. It is brought about by our activity. To begin with, it appears united with what we perceive as ourself. But in accord ance with its inner significance it reaches out beyond the self. It bestows on the separate perceptions ideal definitions, and these relate themselves to one another and stem from a unity. What is attained by self-perception, it defines ideally in the same way as it defines all other perceptions, placing this as subj ect, or “I,” over against th e objects. This something is thinking, and the ideal definitions are the c oncepts and ideas. Thinking, therefore, first manifests itself in the perception of the self, but it is not me rely subjective, for the self characterizes itself as subject on ly with the help of thinking. This relationship to oneself by means of thoughts is a life-de finition of our personality. Through it we lead a purely"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"ideal existence. Through it we f eel ourselves to be thinking beings. This life-definition would remain a purely conceptual (logical) one if no other definitions of our self were added to it. We should then be beings w hose life would be exhausted in establishing purely ideal relations between perceptions th emselves, and between them and ourself. If we call the establishing of such a thought connection, an act of cognition, and the resulting condition of our self knowledge, then according to the abovementioned presupposition, we should have to consider ou rselves as beings who merely cognize or know. However, the presupposition does not correspond to th e facts. We relate perceptions to ourselves not merely ideally, through con cepts, but also, as we have seen, through feeling. Therefore we are not beings with a merely conceptual life-content. The naive realist even sees in the life of feeling a more genuine life of the personality than in the purely ideal element of knowledge . And from his standpoint he is right in interpreting the matter in this way. For feeling on the subjective side to begin with, is exactly the same as perception on the objective side. From the basic principle of na ive realism, that everything that can be perceive d is real, it follows that feeling is the guarantee of the reality of one’s own personali ty. Monism, however, as unders tood here, must confer upon feeling the same supplement that it considers ne cessary for all perceptions if these are to be present as a complete reality. For monism, feeling is an incomplete reality which, in the form it is first given to us, does not as yet contain its second f actor, the concept or idea. This is why in actual life, feelings, like perceptions, appear before cognition has occurred. At first we have merely a feeling of existence, and it is only in the course of gradual development that we reach the point where the concept of our self dawns within the dim feeling of our existence. But what fo r us appears only late r is fundamentally and indivisibly bound up with feeling. This fact leads the naive man to the belief that in feeling, existence is presen t directly, in knowledge only indirectly. Therefore the development of the feeling-life appears to him more important than anything else. He will believe that he has grasped the connection of things only when he has felt it. He attempts to make feelings rather than knowing the mean s of cognition. But as feeling is something quite individual, something equivalent to pe rception, a philosopher of feeling makes into the universal principle, a principle which has significance only within his personality. He tries to permeate the whole world with his ow n self. What the moni st, in the sense we have described, strives to grasp by means of concepts, the philosopher of feeling tries to attain by means of feeling, and considers this relationship with objects to be the one that is most direct. The view just characterized, the philosophy of feeling, is often called mysticism. The error in mysticism based on feeling alone is that the mystic wants to experience43 in feeling what should be attained as knowledge ; he wants to develop something which is individual, into something universal. Feeling is purely individual, it is the relation of the external world to our subject, insofar as this relation comes to expression in merely subjective experience. There is yet another expression of the human personality. The I, through its thinking, lives within the universal life of the world; through thinking the “I” relates purely ideally (conceptually)"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"the perception to itself, and its elf to the perception. In feelin g, it experiences a relation of the object to its own subject. In the will, the opposite is the case. In will, we are again confronted with a perception, namely that of th e individual relation of our own self to the object. Everything in the will which is not a purely ideal factor is just as much a merely perceived object as any obj ect in the external world. Nevertheless, here again the na ive realist believes that he has before him something far more real than can be reached by thinking. He sees in the will an element in which he is directly aware of a process, a causation, in contrast to thinki ng, which must first grasp the process in concepts. What the I brings about by its will re presents to such a view, a process which is experienced directly. An adhe rent of this philosophy believes that in the will he has really got hold of a corner of the universal process. Whereas all other events he can follow only by perceiving them from outside, he believes that in his will he is experiencing a real process quite directly. The form of existence in which the will appears to him within the self becomes for hi m a direct principle of reality. His own will appears to him as a special case of the univers al process, and he therefore considers the latter to be universal will. The will becomes the universal principle just as in mysticism of feeling, feeling becomes th e principle of knowledge. This view is a Philosophy of the Will (Thelism).44 Here something which can be experienced only individually is made into the constituent factor of the world. The philosophy of will can be called a science as little as can mys ticism of feeling. For both maintain that to permeate things with c oncepts is insufficient. Both demand, side by side with an ideal-principle of existence, a real principle also. And this with a certain justification. But since for this so-called real principle, perceiving is our only means of comprehension, it follows that mysticism of feeling and philosophy of will are both of the opinion that we have two sources of k nowledge: thinking and perceiving, perceiving being mediated through feeling and will as individual experience. According to mysticism of feeling and philosophy of w ill, what flows from the source of experience44a cannot be taken up directly into what flows fr om the source of thinking; therefore the two forms of knowledge, perceivi ng and thinking, remain standing side by side without a higher mediation. Besides the ideal principle attainable through knowledge, there is also supposed to exist a real principle which, although it can be experienced cannot be grasped by thinking. In other words: mysticism of feeling and philosophy of will are both forms of naive real ism; they both adhere to the principle: What is directly perceived is real. Compared with naive realism in its original form, they are guilty of the further inconsistency of ma king one definite kind of perceiving (feeling or will) into the one and onl y means of knowing existence; and this they should not do when they adhere in general to the principle: What is perceived is real. According to this, for cognition, external perceptions should have equal value with inner perceptions of feeling Philosophy of will becomes metaphysical rea lism when it considers will also to be present in those spheres of ex istence where a direct experien ce of it, as in one’s own subject, is not possible. It hypothetically assumes a principle outside the subject, for which subjective experience is the sole crite rion of reality. The philosophy of will as a"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"form of metaphysical realism is open to the cr iticism indicated in the preceding chapter; it has to overcome the contradictory element inherent in every form of metaphysical realism, and acknowledge that the will is a universal world process only insofar as it relates itself ideally to the rest of the world. Addition to the Revised Version, 1918. The reas on it is so difficult to observe and grasp the nature of thinking lies in the fact that its nature all too easily eludes the contemplating soul, as soon as one tries to focus attention on it. What then is left is something lifeless, abstract, the corpse of living thinking. If this abstract al one is considered, then it is easy, by contrast, to be drawn into the “living” element in mysticism of feeling, or into the metaphysics of the will, and to find it strange that anyone should expect to grasp the nature of reality in “mere thought.” But one who really penetrates to the life within thinking will reach the insight that to experience existence merely in feeling or in will cannot in any way be compared with the inner richne ss, the inwardly at rest yet at the same time alive experience, of the life within thinking, and no longer will he say that the other could be ranked above this. It is just be cause of this richness, because of this inner fullness of living experience, that its reflection in the ordinary life of soul appears lifeless and abstract. No other human soul-activity is so easily underestimated as thinking. Will and feeling warm the human soul even when experienced only in recollection. Thinking all too easily leaves the soul co ld in recollection; the soul-life then appears to have dried out. But this is only the strong shadow cast by its warm luminous reality, which dives down into the phenomena of the world. This diving down is done by a power that flows within the thinking activ ity itself, the power of spiritual love. The objection should not be made that to see love in active thinking is to transfer into thinking a feeling, namely love. This objection is in truth a confirmation of what is said here. For he who turns toward the living essence of thinking will find in it both feeling and will, and both of these in their deepest reality; whereas for someone who tu rns away from thinking and instead turns toward “mere” feeling or will, for him these will lose their true reality. One who is willing to experience intuitively in thinking, will also be able to do justice to what is experienced in the realm of feeling and in the element of will, whereas mysticism of feeling and metaphysics of will are incapab le of doing justice to the activity of permeating existence with intuitive thinking. Th ey all too easily come to the conclusion that they have found reality, whereas the intu itive thinker produces in abstract thoughts without feeling, and far remove d from reality, a shadowy, chill ing picture of the world. THE IDEA OF FREEDOM For cognition the concept of a tree is condi tioned by the perception of the tree. When confronted with a particular perception I can lift out only one definite concept from the general system of concepts. The connection between concept and perception is determined indirectly and objectively through thinking acco rding to the perception. The connection of the perception with its concept is recognized afte r the act of perception; but that they belong to one another is al ready inherent in the object itself."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The process is different when the relation of man to the world is considered, as it arises within knowledge. In the preceding explanation th e attempt has been made to show that it is possible to throw light on this relation if one observes it without prejudice. A real understanding of such an observation leads to the insight that thin king can be directly experienced as a self-contained reality. In order to explain thinking as such, those who find it necessary to add something to it, such as physical brain-pr ocesses or unconscious spiritual processes lying behind the conscious thinki ng which is being observed, underestimate what can be seen when thinki ng is observed without prejudice. During his observation of thinking, the obser ver lives directly within a spiritual, self-sustaining activity of a living reality. Ind eed one can say that he who wa nts to grasp the reality of spirit in the form in which it first presents itself to man, can do this in his own self- sustaining thinking. When thinking is observed, two things coinci de which elsewhere must always appear apart: concept and perception. If this is not recognized, then in the concepts which have been worked out according to perceptions, one is unable to see anything but shadowy copies of the perceptions, and will take the perceptions to be the full reality. Further, one will build up a metaphysical sphere on th e pattern of the perceived world, and each person, according to his views, will call this world a world of atoms, a world of will, a world of unconscious spirit, and so on. And he will not notice that with all this he merely hypothetically builds up a metaphysical world on the pattern of his world of perceptions. But if he realizes what he has before him in thinking, then he will also recognize that in the perception only a part of rea lity is present, and that the ot her part that belongs to it and first allows it to appear as full reality, is experienced in the act of permeating the perception with thinking. Then in what arises in consciousness as thinking, he will also see not a shadowy copy of some reality, but spiritual reality itself. And of this he can say that it becomes present in his consciousness through intuition. Intui tion is a conscious experience of a purely spiritual content, taki ng place in the sphere of pure spirit. Only through an intuition can the re ality of thinking be grasped. Only when, by observing thinking without prej udice, one has wrestled one’s way through to recognizing the truth that the nature of thinking is intuitive, is it possible to gain a real understanding of the body-soul organization of man. Then one recognizes that this organization cannot affect the nature of thi nking. Quite obvious facts seem to contradict this at first. For ordinary experience, human thinking onl y takes place connected with, and by means of, the organization. This comes so strongly to the fore that the true facts can only be seen when it has been recogni zed that nothing from the organization plays into thinking as such. And then it is impo ssible not to notice how extraordinary is the relation of the human organization to thinking. For this organization has no effect at all on thinking; rather it withdraws when the activity of thinking takes place; it suspends its own activity, it makes room, and in the space th at has become free, thinking appears. The spiritual substance that acts in thinking has a twofold task: first it presses back the human organization in its activity, and next, it steps in to the place of it. The first, the pressing back of the bodily organization, is also a cons equence of the thinking activity, and indeed of that part of this activity which prepares the manifestation of thinking. This explains the sense in which thinking finds its counterpart in the bodily organization. And when this is"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"recognized, one will no longer mistake this c ounterpart for thinking itself. If someone walks over soft ground, his feet leave impression s in the soil. But one is not tempted to say that the forces of the ground have formed these imprints from below. One will not ascribe to these forces any pa rticipation in the creating of the footprints. So too, one who, without prejudice, observes the nature of thi nking will not ascribe to the imprints in the bodily organization any participation in the na ture of thinking, for the imprints in the organization come about through the fact that thinking prepares its manifestation through the body.” [footnote: The significance of the above view in relation to psychology, physiology, etc., in various directions has been set forth by the author in works published after this book. Here the aim is only to characterize wh at can be recognized by an unprejudiced observation of thinking.] Now a significant question arises. If the human organism does not partake in the spiritual substance of thinking, what significance has this organism within man’s being as a whole? Now what happens in this organism through thinking has nothing to do with the nature of thinking, but indeed it has to do w ith the arising of the I-consciousness within thinking. The real “I” exists wi thin the being of thinking, but not so the I-consciousness. This will be recognized if only thinking is obs erved without prejudice. The “I” is to be found within thinking; the “I-consciousness” aris es through the fact that the imprints of the activity of thinking are engraved upon the general consciousness in the sense explained above. (The I-consciousness therefor e arises through the bodily organism. But by this is not meant that the I-consciousness, once it has arisen, re mains dependent on the bodily organism. Once arisen, it is taken up into thinking and henceforth shares its spiritual nature.) The human organism is the foundation of the “I -consciousness.” It is also the source of will-activity. It follows from the preceding expl anation that an insight into the connection between thinking, conscious I, and will activity can only be obtained if we first observe how will-activity issues from the human organism.44b The factors to be considered in a particul ar act of will are the motive and the driving force. The motive is either a concept or a representation; the driving force is the will element and is directly conditioned by the human organism. The conceptual factor, or motive, is the momentary source from which th e will is determined; the driving force is the permanent source of determination in the individual. A motive of will may be a pure concept or a concept with a definite referen ce to what is perceive d, i.e. a representation. General and individual concepts (representations) become mo tives of will by influencing the human individual and determine him to act in a particular dire ction. But one and the same concept, or one and the same repres entation, influences different individuals differently. It impels different people to different actions. Will, therefore, does not come about merely as a result of the concept, or representation, but also through the individual disposition of human beings. Th is individual disposition we will call - in this respect one can follow Eduard von Hartmann45 - the characterological disposition. The way in which"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"concepts and representations influence the ch aracterological disposi tion of a person gives his life a definite mo ral or ethical stamp. The characterological disposition is formed through the more or less constant life-content of our subject, that is, through the content of our representations a nd feelings. Whether a present representation stimulates me to will or not, depends on how the representation is related to the content of the re st of my representations, and al so to my particular feelings. The content of my representations is determin ed in turn by all those concepts which in the course of my individual life have come into contact with per ceptions, that is, have become representations. This again depends on my greater or lesser capacity for intuition, and on the range of my observations, that is, on the subjective and the objective factors of experience,46 on my inner determination a nd my place in life. The characterological disposition is more particularly determin ed by the life of feeling. Whether I make a definite representation or concept the motive of my action will depend on whether it gives me pleasure or pain. - These are the elem ents which come into consideration in an act of will. The immediately present representation or concept which becomes motive, determines the aim, the purpose of my will; my characterological disposition determines me to direct my activity toward this aim. Th e representation, to go for a walk in the next half-hour, determines the aim of my action. But this representa tion is elevated to a motive of will only if it meets with a suitable charac terological disposition, that is, if during my life until now I have formed representations concerning the purpose of walking, its value for health, and further, if the representation of walking combines in me with a feeling of pleasure. We therefore must distinguish: 1) the possi ble subjective dispositions which are suitable for turning definite representations and c oncepts into motives; and 2) the possible representations and concepts which are capable of so influencing my characterological disposition that willing is the result. The first represents th e driving force, the second, the aims of morality. We can find the driving force of morality by investigating the elements which comprise individual life. The first level of individual life is percei ving, more particularly, perceiving by means of the senses. Here we are concerned with that region of our individual life where perceiving, without a feeling or a concept co ming between, is directly transformed into willing. The driving force in man, which comes into consideration here, we shall simply call instinct. The satisfaction of our lo wer, purely animal needs (hunger, sexual intercourse, etc.) takes place in th is way. What is most characte ristic of instinctive life is the immediacy with which a particular per ception releases the will. This kind of determination of the will, which is characteri stic only of lower sense-life to begin with, can also be extended to the perceptions of the higher senses. We let a deed follow upon the perception of some event or other in th e outer world without further reflection and without linking any particular feeling to the perception, as in fact happens in conventional social life. The driving force of such conduct is what is called tact or moral etiquette. The more often such a direct re lease of activity by a perception takes place, the more the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"person concerned is able to act purely under th e guidance of tact, that is: tact becomes his characterological disposition. The second level of human life is feeling. De finite feelings link themselves to the perceptions of the outer world. These feelings can become the driving forces of deeds. When I see a starving person, pity for him can become the driving force of my action. Such feelings, for example, are shame, pride, honor, humility, remorse, pity, revenge, gratitude, piety, loyalty, love and duty.46a The third level of life is thinking and form ing representations. A representation or a concept can become motive for an action through mere reflection. Representations become motives because in the course of lif e we continuously link certain aims of will with perceptions which keep re turning in more or less modified form. This is why, when people not entirely without expe rience have certain perceptions , there always also enter into their consciousness repres entations of deeds which they themselves have carried out in a similar instance, or have seen carried ou t. These representations hover before them as determining models for all later decisions; they become united with their characterological disposition. We could call this driving force of the will, practical experience. Practical experience gradually me rges into purely tactful conduct. This happens when definite typical pi ctures of actions have become so firmly connected in our consciousness with representations of certain s ituations in life that in any given case we skip over all deliberation based on experience and pass over directly from perception into willing. The highest level of individual life is that of conc eptual thinking without reference to a definite perceptual content. We determine th e content of a concept through pure intuition from the ideal sphere. Such a concept contains no reference to definite perceptions at first. If we pass over into willing under the influence of a concept pointing to a perception, that is, a represen tation, then it is this per ception which determines us indirectly via the conceptual thinking. When we act under the influence of intuitions, then the driving force of our deed is pure thinki ng. Since in philosophy it is customary to call the faculty of pure thinking, reason, it would be justifiable to call the moral driving force characteristic of this level, practical reason. The clearest acc ount of this driving force of the will has been given by Kreyenbühl.47 (Phi losophische Monatshefte, Vol. XVIII, No. 3). I count his article on this subject among the most importa nt contributions to present- day philosophy, particularly to ethics. Kreye nbühl characterizes this driving force as practical apriori, that is, an impulse to action springing directly from my intuition. It is clear that in the strictest sense of the word, such an impulse can no longer be considered as belonging to th e characterological disposi tion. For here what acts as driving force is no longer something merely individual in me, but is the ideal and therefore the universal content of my intui tion. As soon as I see the justification for making this content the foundation and startin g-point of an action, I pass over into willing, irrespective of whethe r I had the concept already, or whether it enters my consciousness only immediately before acting, th at is, irrespective of whether or not it was already present in me as disposition."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"An action is a real act of will only when a mo mentary impulse of action, in the form of a concept or representation, influences the characterological disposition. Such an impulse then becomes the motive of will. Motives of morality are representations and concepts. There are philosophers of ethics who also see in feeling a motive for morality; th ey maintain, for example, that the aim of moral conduct is the furtherance of the grea test possible quantity of pleasure in the individual who acts. But in itself a pleas ure cannot be a motive; only a represented pleasure can. The representation of a future feeling, but not the feeling itself, can influence my characterologica l disposition. For in the moment of acting the feeling itself is not yet there; moreover it is to be produced by the action. The representation of one’s own or someone else ’s welfare, however, is rightly regarded as a motive of will. The principle: through one ’s deed to bring about the greatest amount of pleasure for oneself, that is, to attain personal advantage, is egoism. It is striven for either by ruthlessly considering only one’s own welfare, even at the cost of the happiness of others (pure egoism), or by furthering th e welfare of others because indirectly one expects a favorable influence upon one’s own self through the happiness of others, or because one fears to endanger one’s own in terest by injuring others (morality of prudence). The particular content of egoisti cal principles of mo rality will depend upon what representations a person has of his ow n or of another’s ha ppiness. A person will determine the content of his egoistical strivi ng according to what he considers to be the good things in life (luxury, hope of happiness, deliverance from various misfortunes, etc.). Another motive is the purely conceptual conten t of actions. This content does not refer to a particular action only, as in the case of the representation of one’s own pleasures, but to the reason for an action derived from a system of moral principles. In the form of abstract concepts these moral principles may govern moral life without the single individual troubling himself about the origin of the con cepts. In that case, we simply feel the subjection to the moral concept which, like a command, overshadow s our deeds as a moral necessity. The reason for this necessity we leave to those who demand our moral subjection, that is, to the moral authority we acknowledge (the head of the family, the state, social custom, the author ity of the church, divine reve lation). A particular instance of these moral principles is when the co mmand announces itself to us, not through an external authority, but thr ough our own inner being (moral autonomy). In this case, within ourselves we sense the voice to which we have to submit. This voice finds expression in conscience. It means moral progress when man does not simply take the command of an outer or inner authority as motive fo r his action, but strives to recognize the reason why a particular principle of conduct should act as motive in him. This is the advance from morality based on authority, to conduct based on moral insight. At this level of morality the person will consider the needs of moral life and will let this knowledge determine his actions. Such needs are: 1) the greatest possi ble welfare of humanity, purely for its own sake; 2) the progress of cultu re, or the moral development of mankind to ever greater"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"perfection; 3) the realization of individua l aims of morality, which are grasped purely intuitively. The greatest possible welfare of humanity wi ll naturally be understood differently by different people. The above principle does not refer to a definite representation of this welfare, but to the fact th at each person who acknowledges th is principle strives to do what in his opinion best furthe rs the welfare of humanity. The progress of culture is seen as a sp ecial instance of the above-mentioned moral principle by those who connect feelings of pl easure with the advantages of culture, but they will have to accept into the bargain th e decline and destruction of much that also contributes to the welfare of mankind. However, it is also possible that in the progress of culture someone sees a moral necessity, qui te apart from the feeling of pleasure connected with it. Then for him, the progress of culture is a particular moral principle, distinct from the one mentioned previously. The principle of the general welfare, as well as that of the progress of culture, is based upon a representation, that is, upon how one relate s the content of moral ideas to certain experiences (perceptions). But the highest th inkable principle of morality is one which contains no such relation from the start, bu t springs from the source of pure intuition and only afterward seeks the relation to perceptions (to life). Here th e decision as to what is to be willed proceeds from a different sphere than that of the previous examples. In all his conduct, one in favor of the principle of the general welfare will first ask what his ideals will contribute to this general welfare. He who acknowledges the moral principle of the progress of culture, will do the same. But at th is level he could do something even higher: if in a particular case he were not to pro ceed from one single definite aim of morality, but were to recognize a certain value in all prin ciples of morality and were always to ask whether the one or the other would be more im portant here. It may ha ppen that in certain circumstances one considers the progress of cult ure, in others, the general welfare, and in yet others, the furtherance of his own welfar e, to be the right aim and motive of his actions. But when all such reasons take second place, then first and foremost the conceptual intuition itself comes into cons ideration. When this happens, then all other motives retreat from the leading position a nd the idea-content of the action alone is effective as its motive. Among the levels of characterol ogical disposition, we have shown the one which acts as pure thinking, as practical re ason, to be the highest. From the motives, we have now shown conceptual intuition to be the highest. On closer considerati on, it will soon be seen that at this level of morality driving force and motive coincide, that is, neither a predetermined characterological disposition no r an external moral principle accepted on authority, influences our conduct. The deed therefore is neither a conventional one, carried out according to some rule or other, nor one automatically performed in response to an external impulse; rather it is one wh ich is determined solely through its ideal content."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Such conduct presupposes the capacity for mora l intuition. Whoever lacks the ability to experience the moral principle that applies in a particular instance, will never achieve truly individual willing. The exact opposite to this mora l principle is the Kantian: Ac t so that the principles of your actions can be valid for all men. This prin ciple is death to all individual impulses of action. How all men would act cannot be a standa rd for me, but rather what is right for me to do in the particular instance. To this, a superficial judgment could perh aps object: How can an action be individually adapted to the particular instan ce and the particular situation, and yet at the same time be determined purely ideally by intuition? This objection is due to a confusion of the moral motive and the perceptible content of the action. The perceptible content could be a motive, and is one, for example, when an act is done for the progress of culture or out of pure egoism, etc., but it is not the motive wh en the reason for action is a pure moral intuition. My I naturally takes notice of this perceptual content, but is not determined by it. This content is used only to form a c ognitive concept, but the moral concept that belongs to it, the I does not take from the object. The cognitive concept of a given situation confronting me is also a moral con cept only if I base my view on a particular moral principle. If my viewpoi nt is limited to the general moral principle of the progress of culture, then I go through lif e along a fixed route. From every event I perceive which can occupy me, a moral duty also springs, na mely, to do my best toward placing the particular event in the servi ce of the progress of culture. In addition to the concept which reveals to me the natural law inherent in an event or object, there is also a moral label attached to it which contains for me, as a mo ral being, an ethical direction as to how I am to behave. This moral label is justified at a ce rtain level, but at a hi gher level it coincides with the idea that arises in me when I face the concrete instance. Men differ greatly in their cap acity for intuition. In one person ideas bubble up easily, while another person has to acquire them w ith much labor. The situation in which men live, which is the scene of their actions, is no less different. How a man acts will therefore depend on the way his capacity for intuition f unctions in the face of a given situation. The sum of ideas active within us, the actual cont ent of our intuitions, is what, for all the universality of the idea-world, is individually constituted in each human being. Insofar as this intuitive content is direct ed toward action, it is the mo ral content of the individual. To let this content come to expression is the highest moral driving force and also the highest motive for the one who has recognized that ultimately all other moral principles unite in this content. This standpoint can be ca lled ethical individualism. The discovery of the quite individual intuiti on which corresponds to the situation, is the deciding factor in an intuitively determined action. At this level of morality one can speak only of general concepts of morality (n orms, laws) insofar as these result from the generalization of individual impulses. Genera l norms always presuppose concrete facts from which they can be derived. But facts must first be produced by human deeds."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"When we look for the laws (concepts) underlyi ng the conduct of indi viduals, peoples and epochs, we obtain a system of ethics, not as a science of moral rule s, but as a natural philosophy of morality. It is true that laws obtained in this way are related to human conduct, as the laws of nature are related to a particular phenomenon. But they are not at all identical with the impulses upon which we base our conduct . If one wants to grasp the means by which man’s action springs from his moral will, then one must first consider the relation of this will to the action. One must first select actions where this relation is the determining factor. If I, or someone else, reflect on such an action later, then can be discovered upon what principle of morality th e action is based. While I am acting I am moved to act by the moral principle insofar as it lives in me intuitively; the moral principle is united with my love for what I want to accomplish by my deed. I ask no man and no code, Shall I do this? - ra ther I do it the moment I have grasped the idea of it. This alone makes it my action. The deeds of a person who acts solely because he acknowledges a definite moral standard, come about as a result of a principle which is part of his moral code. He is merely the agen t. He is a higher kind of automaton. If some impulse to action enters his consciousness, then at once the clockwork of his moral principle will be set in motion and run to ru le, in order to bring about a deed which is Christian, or humane, or is deemed unselfish, or to further the progr ess of culture. Only when I follow my love for the object is it I my self who acts. At this level of morality I do not act because I acknowledge a ruler over me, an external authority, or a so-called inner voice. I do not acknowledge any external princi ple for my conduct, because I have found the source of my conduct within myself, name ly, my love for the deed. I do not prove intellectually whether my deed is good or bad; I do it out of my love for it. My action will be “good” if my intuition, immersed in l ove, exists in the ri ght way within the relationship between things; this can be expe rienced intuitively; the action will be “bad” if this is not the case. Nor do I ask myself: How would another person act in my place? - rather I act, as I, as this particular indi viduality, find my will motiv ated to act. I am not guided directly by what happens to be the us ual thing, the general habit, some general human code or moral standard, but solely by my love for this deed. I feel no compulsion - neither the compulsion of nature which rules me through my instincts, nor the compulsion of moral commands. Rather, I si mply carry out what lies within me. Those who defend general moral standards will perhaps object: If each person strives to express and do only what he pleases, then there is no difference between a good deed and a crime; every depraved impulse in me has the same right to express itself as has the intention to do my best. The fact that I have a deed in mind, according to an idea, cannot set my standard as a moral human being, but only the test as to wh ether it is a good or evil deed. Only if it is good should I carry it out. My reply to this obvious objection, which none theless is based on a misunderstanding of what is meant here, is this: One who wants to understand the nature of human will must differentiate between the path which brings th is will to a certain degree of development, and the unique character which the will assume s as it approaches its goal. On the way toward this goal standards do play their justifie d part. The goal consis ts in the realization of aims of morality, grasped purely intuitively. Man attain s such aims to the degree that he is at all able to raise himself to the in tuitive idea-content of the world. In particular"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"instances such aims are usually mixed with ot her elements, either as driving force or as motive. Nevertheless, in the hum an will intuition can be the de termining factor, wholly or in part. A person does what he ought to do, he provides the stage upon which “ought” becomes deed; it is absolutely his own deed which he brings to expression. The impulse here can only be completely individual. A nd, in fact, only an act of will which springs from intuition can be individual. To call the acts of criminals and what is evil an expression of the individuality, in the same se nse as the embodiment of pure intuition, is only possible if blind urges are reckoned as pa rt of the human individuality. But the blind urge which drives a person to crime does not spring from intuition and does not belong to what is individual in man, but rather to what is most general in him, to what is equally valid in all men, and out of which man works his way by means of what is individual in him. What is individual in me is not my or ganism with its urges a nd feelings, but rather the universal world of ideas which lights up w ithin this organism. My urges, instincts, passions confirm nothing more than that I belong to the general species, man; the fact that something ideal comes to expression in a par ticular way within these urges, passions and feelings, confirms my individuality. Through my instincts and urges I am a person of whom there are twelve to the dozen; through th e particular form of the idea, by means of which I name myself “I” within the dozen, I am an individual. Only a being other than myself could distinguish me from others by the difference in my animal nature; through my thinking, that is, through the active grasp of what expresse s itself as an ideal within my organism, do I distinguish myself from others. Therefore one definitely cannot say that the action of a crim inal springs from the idea in him. Indeed, this is just what is characteristic of a criminal deed: it stems from elements in man which are external to the ideal-element in him. An action is felt to be free insofar as the r eason for it springs from the ideal part of my individual being; any other part of an acti on, irrespective of whethe r it is carried out under the compulsion of nature or under the obligation of a moral code, is felt to be unfree. Man is free insofar as he is able, in every mo ment of his life, to follow himself. A moral deed is my deed only if it can be called fr ee in this sense. What here have to be considered are the presuppositions necessary for a willed action to be felt as free; how this purely ethically grasped idea of freedom r ealizes itself in human nature, will be seen in what follows. A deed done out of freedom does not at all exclude, but includes moral laws, but it will be a deed done from a higher sphere compared with those dictated solely by such laws. Why should my deed serve the general welfare any less when it is done out of love, than when I do it solely for the reas on that I feel that to serve the general welfare is a duty? The concept of mere duty excludes freedom because it does not include what is individual, but demands subjection of the indi vidual to a general standard. Freedom of action is thinkable only from the st andpoint of ethical individualism. But how is it possible for people to live in a community if each person strives to assert only his own individuality? Th is objection is characteristi c of misunderstood moralism. A"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"person holding this viewpoint believes that a co mmunity of people is possible only if all men are united by general fixed moral rules. He simply does not understand the oneness and harmony of the idea-world. He does not re alize that the idea-world which is active in me is none other than the one active in my fellow-man. This unity of ideas is indeed nothing but a result of men’s experience of life .47 Only this can it be. For if the unity of the idea-world could be recognized by any m eans other than by i ndividual observation, then general rules and not personal experience would be valid in its sphere. Individuality is possible only when each individual is acquainted with othe rs through individual observation alone. The difference between me a nd my fellow men is not at all because we live in two quite different spiritual worlds, but because from the world of ideas which we share, he receives different intuitions from mine. He want s to live out his intuitions, I mine. If we both really draw from the id ea, and are not obeying any external impulses (physical or spiritual), then we cannot but meet in the same striving, in having the same intentions. A moral misunderstanding, a clash between men who are morally free, is out of the question. Only the morally unfree who follow natural instincts or some accepted command of duty, turn away from a fellow-man if he does not follow the same instinct and the same command as themselves. To live in love of the action and to let live, having understanding for the other person’s will, is the fundamental principle of free human beings. They know no other “ought” than that with which their will is intuitively in accord; how they shall will in a particular in stance, their power of ideation will tell them. If human nature were not fundamentally social , no external laws could make it so! Only because individual human beings are one in the sp iritual part of their being, can they live out their lives side by side. The free man is confident that others who are free belong to the same spiritual world as he does, and that they will meet him in their intentions. The free man does not demand agreement from hi s fellow men, but he expects it, because it lies in human nature. This does not refer to the existing necessity for this or that external arrangement, but rather to th e disposition, the attitude of soul through which man, in his experience of himself among fellow men for whom he cares, comes nearest to doing justice to human dignity. There are many who will say that the concept of a free human being outlined here is a chimera, is nowhere to be found as a reality, and that we have to deal with real people from whom one can hope for mo rality only when they obey some moral law, when they regard their moral mission as a duty, and do not freely follow their inclinations and preferences. - I certainly do not doubt this. Only a blind man could do so. But then, away with all hypocrisy of morality if this is to be the ultimat e conclusion. Then simply say: Human nature must be compelled as long as it is not free. Whether the unfreedom is dealt with by physical means or through moral laws, whether man is unfree because he follows his immeasurable sexual instinct, or becau se he is hemmed in by the fetters of conventional morality, is quite immaterial fr om a certain point of view. But one should not maintain that such a man can rightly call hi s actions his own, for he is driven to them by external powers. But there are human beings who raise themselves above all these compelling rules, free spirits who find their own self in the jumble of habits, regulations, religious observance, etc. They are free in sofar as they follow only themselves; unfree"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"insofar as they submit themselves. Which of us ca n say that he is really free in all that he deed But in each of us exists a higher bei ng in whom the free man comes to expression. Our life is composed of free and unfree deed s. But we cannot complete the concept of man without including the free spirit as the purest characteri stic of human nature. After all, we are truly human only insofar as we are free. That is an ideal, many will say. Without doubt - but it is an ideal which works itself to the surface from within our nature as a reality. It is no “thought out” or imagined ideal, but one in which there is life, one which clearl y announces its presence even in its least perfect form of existence. If man were mere ly a product of nature, the search for ideals, that is, for ideas which for the moment ar e inactive but whose r ealization we demand, would not be possible. In the case of exte rnal objects the idea is determined by the perception. We have done our share when we have recognized the connection between idea and perception. But with man this is not so. His content is not determined without him; his true concept as a moral being (fr ee spirit) is not objectively united with the perceptual picture “man” from the start mere ly in order to be confirmed by knowledge later. By his own activity man must unite his concept with the perception, man. Concept and perception only coincide he re if man himself brings it about. But he cannot do this till he has found the concept of the free spirit, that is, his own concept. In the objective world a line of division is drawn by our organization betw een perception and concept; cognition overcomes this division. In our subjective nature th is division is no less present; man overcomes it in the course of his development by bringing his concept to expression in his outward existence. Both man’s intellectual as well as his moral life point to his twofold nature: perceiving (dir ect experience) and thinking. In the intellectual life the two-foldness is overcome through knowledge; in the moral life through actually bringing the free spirit to realization. Every being has its inborn concept (the law of its existence and activity), but in external objects the concept is indivisibly connected with the perception and separated from it only within our spiritual organism. In man concept and perception are to begin with, actually apart, to be united by him just as actually. One could object: To our perception of a man a de finite concept corresponds at every moment of his life, just as is the ca se with everything else. I can fo rm a concept of a typical man, and I may also find such a man given to me as a perception. If to this I also bring the concept of the free spirit, then I have two concepts for the same object. This line of thought is one-sided. As percep tual object I am subjected to perpetual change. As a child I was one thing, another as a youth, yet another as a man. In fact, at every moment the perceptual picture of myse lf is different from what it was a moment ago. These changes may take place in such a way that either it is always the same (the typical) man who expresses himself in them, or they become the expression of the free spirit. The perceptual object of my action is subjected to these changes. In the perceptual object “man ” the possibility of transforma tion is given, just as in the plant-seed there lies the possibility of becoming a fully developed plant. The plant transforms itself because of the objective laws which are inherent in it; man remains in his imperfect state unless he takes hold of th e substance to be transformed within him and"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"transforms it through his own power. Nature ma kes man merely into a product of nature; society makes him into a being who acts rationa lly, but he alone can make himself into a free being. At a definite stage in his development nature re leases man from its fetters; society carries his development a stage further; the final polish he can only apply himself. Therefore, from the standpoint of free morality it is not asserted that as free spirit is the only form in which a man can exist. Free sp irituality is the ultimate stage of man’s development. And it is not denied that conduct according to rules has its justification as a stage of development. However, this cannot be acknowledged as the highest level of morality. But the free spirit in man overcomes ru les in the sense that he does not accept only commands as motives, but also regulat es his conduct in accordance with his impulses (intuitions). When Kant says of duty:48 “Duty! You sublime, you great name, you encompass nothing beloved or endearing, but you demand submi ssion,” you “lay down a law ... before which all inclinations become silent, even if in secret they also go against it,” then man, conscious of the free spirit, answers: “Freedom! You friendly, humane name, you encompass all that is morally beloved, all th at is most worthy of my humanity, you make me no one’s servant, you do not merely lay down a law, but wait for what my moral love will of itself recognize as law, because it feels unfree when faced with any law simply forced upon it.” This is the contrast between mere law-abiding morality and morality born of freedom. The philistine who sees mora lity embodied in some external rule, may perhaps even regard the free spirit as a dangerous person. But this is simply because his view is limited to a certain period of time. If he were able to see beyond this, he would soon find that the free spirit need go beyond the laws of his state as seldom as the philistine himself, and is never in any real opposition to them. For all the laws of the state have sprung from the intuitions of free spirits, just as have a ll other objective laws of morality. No law is exercised through a family authority which was not at some time intuitively grasped and laid down by an ancestor. Similarly the conve ntional laws of mora lity were first laid down by definite people and so too the laws of the state first arise in the head of a statesman. These individualities have establis hed laws over other people, and only he is unfree who forgets this origin and either looks upon these laws as extra-human commands, that is, as objective moral concepts of duty independent of man, or turns them into the commanding voice thought of - in a fa lsely mystical way - as compelling him in his own inner being. However, he who does not forget the origin of such laws, but looks for it in man, will reckon with them as bel onging to the same idea-world as that from which he too draws his moral in tuitions. If he believes his ow n intuitions to be better, then he will try to replace those in existen ce with his own; but if he finds the existing ones justified, he will act in accordance with them as if they were his own. The formula must not be coined: Man is m eant to realize a moral world order which exists independent of him. Insofar as know ledge of man is concerned, one maintaining this stands at the point where natural scie nce stood when it belie ved that the goat has"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"horns in order to be able to butt. Fortunate ly natural scientists have rejected such a concept of purpose as a dead theory. It is mo re difficult to get rid of such theories in ethics. However, just as horns do not exist because of butting, but butting exists through horns, so man does not exist because of mo rality, but morality exists through man. The free human being acts morally because he has a moral idea, but he does not act in order that morality may come about. Human indivi duals, with the mora l ideas belonging to their nature, are the presupposition for a moral world-order. The human individual is the source of all mora lity and the center of earthly life. State and society have come about only because they are the necessary results of life shared by individual human beings. That state and society should react in turn upon the life of the individual is understandable, just as it is understandable that butting, which exists through the horns, reacts in turn upon the further deve lopment of the goat’s horns, which would waste away by prolonged disuse. Similarly, the individual would waste away if he led a separate existence outside a hum an community. This is just why the social order arises, so that it can react favor ably upon the individual. PHILOSOPHY OF FREEDOM (SPIRI TUAL ACTIVITY) AND MONISM The naive man who regards as real only what he can see with his ey es and grasp with his hands, also needs to have motives for his moral life that are perceptible to the senses. He needs someone who will impart these motives to him in a way that he can understand by means of his senses. He will let them be di ctated to him as commands by a person whom he considers wiser and more powerful than hi mself, or whom he acknowledges, for some other reason, to be a power standing above hi m. In this way the moral principles already mentioned come about through being prescribed by authority of family, state, society, church, or the Divinity. An undeveloped person still trusts in the authority of a single individual; a somewhat more advanced pers on lets his moral conduc t be dictated by a majority (state, society). But it is always perceptible powers upon which he relies. When at last the conviction dawn s upon him that fundamentally all these are weak human beings just like himself, then he will seek guidance from a higher power, from a divine Being, whom, however, he endows with sens e-perceptible qualities. He lets the conceptual content of his moral life be di ctated to him by this Being, again in a perceptible way, for example when God app ears in the burning bush, or moves among men in bodily human form and in a manner percep tible to their ears tells them what to do and what not to do. The highest level of development of naive r ealism in the moral sphere is reached when the moral command (moral idea) has been se parated from every foreign entity, and is hypothetically thought of as an absolute force in one’s own inner being. What at first is sensed as the external voice of God, is now sensed as an independent power within man, and is spoken of in a way that shows the inne r power to be identifie d with the voice of conscience."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"When this happens, the level of naive c onsciousness has been abandoned and we enter the region where moral laws become independe nt rules. They no longer have a bearer, but have become metaphysical entities, existi ng by themselves. They are similar to the invisible-visible forces of the metaphysical realist who does not look for the reality of things in the human soul’s participation in this reality through thinking, but who hypothetically imagines reality as an additi on to actual experience. Extra-human moral rules, therefore, always accompany metaphys ical realism. Metaphysical realism cannot do otherwise than seek the origin of mora lity too in a sphere beyond human reach. And here there are several possibili ties. If the presupposed Being is thought of as in itself unthinking, acting according to purely mechanical laws, as materialism thinks of it, then out of itself it must also produce, by purely mechanical necessity, the human individual and all that belongs to him. The consciousness of freedom can then be only an illusion. For while I believe myself to be the creator of my deeds, it is the material substances of which I am composed, together with their proces ses, that are at work within me. I believe myself to be free, whereas in reality all my actions are but resu lts of the material processes which are the foundation of my bod ily and spiritual organism. According to this point of view, it is simply because we do not know the motives compelling us, that we have the feeling of freedom. “We must em phasize that the feeling of freedom is due to the absence of external compelling motives.” “Our actions as well as our thinking are subject to necessity.”49 Another possibility is that th e extra-human absolute is seen as a spiritual Being behind the world of phenomena. Then the impulse to action will also be sought in such a spiritual power. The moral principles to be found in man’s reason will be regarded as issuing from this Being-in-itself, which has it s own particular intentions with regard to man. Moral laws appear to such a dualist as dictated by the Absolute, and through his reason, man simply has to discover and carry out these decisions of the Absolute Being. The moral world-order appears to the dualist as the perceptible re flection of a higher order that stands behind it. Earthly morality is the manifestation of the extra-human world order. It is not man that matters in this moral order, but the Being-in-itself, the extra- human Being. Man ought to do what this Be ing wills. Eduard von Hartmann, who sees the Being-in-itself as the Godh ead whose very existence is suffering, believes that this divine Being has created the world in order that through the world he will be redeemed from his infinitely great pain. This philos opher therefore regards the moral development of mankind as a process whic h exists for the purpose of redeeming the Godhead. “Only through the building up of a moral world-order by sensib le, responsible individuals can the aim of the world-process be carried through....” “Existence in its reality is the incarnation of the Godhead - th e world process is the Passion of the God becoming flesh, and at the same time the path of redemption of Him who was crucifie d in the flesh; and morality is the co-operation in the shortening of this path of suffering and redemption.”50 Here man does not act because he wills, but he ought to act because it is God’s will to be redeemed. Just as the materialistic dualist makes man into an automaton whose conduct is merely the result of purely mechanical laws, so the spiritualistic dualist (that is, he who sees the Absolute, the Being-in-itself, as a spiritual entity in which man has no conscious"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"share) makes him into a slave of the will of the Absolute. Freedom is out of the question in materialism as well as in one-sided spirit ualism, in fact in any kind of metaphysical realism which does not experience, but infers something extra-human as the true reality. Naive as well as metaphysical realism, in or der to be consistent, must deny freedom for one and the same reason, since they regard ma n as being simply the agent or executor of principles which are forced upon him by necessity. Naive realism kills freedom through subjection to the authority either of a percep tible being or of an entity thought of as similar to a perceptible being, or else through submission to th e authority of the abstract inner voice which is in terpreted as “conscience;” the me taphysical realist, who merely infers something extra-human, cannot acknowledge freedom because he lets man be determined, mechanically or morally, by a “Being-in-itself.” Monism must acknowledge the partial jus tification of naive realism because it acknowledges the justification of the world of perceptions. Someone who is incapable of bringing forth moral ideas through intuition, wi ll have to receive them from others. Insofar as a man receives his moral principles from outside, he is positively unfree. But monism ascribes equal significance to the id ea compared with pe rception. And the idea can come to manifestation in the human indi vidual. Insofar as man follows the impulses coming from this side, he feels free. But moni sm denies all justifi cation to a metaphysics which merely draws inferences, and conseque ntly also to impulses of action stemming from a so-called “Being-in-itself,” According to the monistic view, man’s action is unfree when he obeys some perceptible external com pulsion; it is free when he obeys himself. Monism cannot acknowledge any kind of unconscious compulsion hidden behind perception and concept. When someone mainta ins that a fellow man was not free when he performed an action, it must be possible to prove the existence within the perceptible world of the thing, the person, or the institution that made the man act; but if an appeal is made to causes for the action lying outside th e sphere of physical and spiritual reality, then monism cannot enter the discussion. According to monism, in his activity man is par tly unfree, partly free. He is unfree in the world of perceptions, but brings the fr ee spirit to realization in himself. The moral commands which the metaphysical realist merely infers and cannot but consider as issuing from a higher power, for the monist are thoughts of men; for the monist the moral world order is neither a c opy of a purely mechanical natural order, nor of an extra-human world order, but entir ely a free undertaking of man. Man does not have to carry out the will of some Being existing beyond his reach; he carries out his own will; he does not bring to realization the deci sions and intentions of another Being, but brings his own to realization. Monism does not see the purpose of a foreign rulership behind man, determining him from outside, but rather that insofar as they bring intuitive ideas to realization, human beings pursue solely their own human purposes. And indeed, each individual pursues his own particular pur pose. For the world of ideas expresses itself not in a community of men, but only in th e individual man. The co mmon goal of a group of men is nothing but the result of the separate will-activities of th e individual persons, and usually of a few outstanding ones whom the rest follow as their authorities. Each one"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"of us is destined to become a free spirit, just as every rose seed is destined to become a rose. The monistic view, in the sphere of truly moral conduct, is a philosophy of freedom. And as it is also a philosophy of reality, it reje cts metaphysical and unr eal restrictions of man’s free spirit just as it ac knowledges physical and historical (naively real) restrictions of the naive man. Since monism does not rega rd man as a finished product, as a being who at every moment of his life unfolds his fu ll nature, it seems futile to discuss whether man, as such, is free or not. Man is seen as a being in the process of self-development, and one may ask whether, in the course of th is development the stage of the free spirit can be attained. Monism knows that nature doe s not release man from its care complete and finished as a free spirit, but it leads him up to a certain level from which, still unfree, he continues to develop until he reaches the point where he finds his own self. To monism it is obvious that a being acti ng under physical or moral compulsion cannot be moral in a real sense. It regards the level of transition through automatic conduct (according to natural urges and instincts) and through obedient conduct (according to moral rules) as necessary preliminary stages of morality, but it also recognizes the possibility for man to overcome both transito ry levels through his free spirit. A truly moral world view is released by monism, both from the fetters of naive moral principles in man’s inner world, and from the moral pr inciples of the specu lating metaphysicist in the external world. The naive principles of mo rality can be eliminated from the world as little as can perceptions. The me taphysical view is rejected because monism seeks all the factors for explaining world-phe nomena within the world, a nd none outside it. Just as monism finds it unnecessary to entertain though ts of principles of knowledge other than those inherent in man, (p. 140) so it also de finitely finds it unnecessary to entertain thoughts of principles of morality other than those inherent in man. Human morality, like human knowledge, is determined through human nature. And just as knowledge would mean something quite different to beings othe r than man, so other beings would also have a different morality. Morality for the monist is a specifically huma n quality, and freedom is the form in which human morality finds expression. First Addition to the Revised Edition, 1918. Difficulty in judgi ng what is presented in the two preceding chapters may arise because one believes oneself to be confronted by a contradiction. On the one hand, the experien ce of thinking is spoken of as having a general significance of equal value for every human c onsciousness; on the other hand, it is shown that though the ideas realized in mora l life are of the same kind as those worked out by thinking, they come to expression in each human consciousne ss in an individual way. If one cannot overcome seeing a “contradi ction,” in this, and cannot recognize that it is just in a living experience of this actually present contrast that a glimpse into man’s true being is revealed, then it is also impossible to see either the idea of knowledge or the idea of freedom in their true light. For those who think of concepts as merely drawn (abstracted) from the sense-world, and who do not give full recogniti on to intuitions, the thought presented here as the reality must seem a “mere contradiction.” For an insight"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"that recognizes how ideas are intuitively experienced as a self-sustaining reality, it is clear that in the sphere of the world of id eas man penetrates in cognition into something which is universal for all men, but when he derives from that same idea world the intuitions for his acts of will, then he i ndividualizes a member of this idea world by means of the same activity which, as a gene ral human one, he unfol ds in the spiritual ideal process of cognition. For this reason what appears as a logical contradiction, namely the universal character of cognitive ideas and the individual character of moral ideas, when experienced in its true reality, becomes a living concept. A char acteristic f eature of human nature consists in the fact that what can be intui tively grasped oscillates in man like a living pendulum between kno wledge which is universally valid, and the individual experience of this universal element. For the man who cannot recognize one swing of the pendulum in its reality, thinking will remain merely a subjective human activity; for the one who cannot recognize the other swing, all individual life appears to cease in man’s activity of thinking. To the fi rst person, cognition is unintel ligible, to the second, moral life is unintelligible. Both will call in all sorts of representations in order to explain the one or the other, all of which miss the point , because both persons, fundamentally, either do not recognize that thinking can be experi enced, or take it to be an activity which merely abstracts. Second Addition to the Revised Edition, 1918. On page 189, materialism was referred to. I am well aware that there are thinkers li ke the above-mentioned Th. Ziehen, who do not in the least consider themselves materialists , but who must neverthe less be described as such from the point of view expressed in this book. It is not a matter that someone says that for him the world is not re stricted to merely material ex istence and therefore he is not a materialist. It is a matter of whether or not he develops concepts which are applicable only to a material existence. One who sa ys: “Our conduct, like our thinking, is necessitated,” expresses a concept applicable only to material processes, but applicable neither to actions nor to existe nce; and if he thinks his c oncepts through, he will have to think materialistically. That he does not do this is only the outcome of that inconsistency which is so often the result of a thinking not ca rried through. - One of ten hears it said nowadays that the materialism of the nineteenth century no longer plays a part in science. But in reality this is not so at all. It is only that at present it is of ten not noticed that no other ideas are available than those which can be applied only to something material. This veils present day materialism, whereas in the second half of the nineteenth century it was plain for all to see. And pr esent day veiled materialism is no less intolerant of a view that grasps the world spiritually than was the openly-admitted materialism of the last century. However, it deceives many who believe they must reject a comprehension of the world which includes spirit, because after all, the natural scientific comprehension of the world “has long ago abandoned materialism.” WORLD PURPOSE AND LIFE PURPOS E (THE DESTINATION OF MAN) Among the many currents of thought pursued in th e cultural life of ma nkind, it is possible to trace one which can be described as the ove rcoming of the concep t of purpose in those"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"spheres to which it does not belong. Pur pose belongs to a special sequence of phenomena. In reality one can only speak of purpose when, in contrast to the relation between cause and effect where an earlier even t determines a later one, the reverse is the case and the later event influe nces the earlier. This applie s only to human action. Man carries out a deed which he represents to himsel f first of all, and he lets the representation determine his action. The later, the deed, with the help of the representation influences the earlier, the person who acts. This detour through the act of re presenting is always necessary for a connection to have purpose. In a process which can be divided into cause and effect, perception must be distinguished from concept. The perception of the cause precedes the perception of the effect; cause and effect would simply remain side by side in our consciousness if we were not able to connect them with one another through thei r corresponding concepts. The perception of an effect can follow only upon the perception of the cause. The effect can have a real influence upon the cause only through the concep tual factor. For the perceptual factor of the effect is simply not present prior to the perceptual factor of the cause. If someone says that the blossom is the purpose of the root, that is, that th e blossom influences the root, then he can say this only concerning that f actor in the blossom which he confirms in it through his thinking. The perceptu al factor of the blossom ha d as yet no exis tence at the time the root came into being. For a connection of things to have purpose it is necessary to have not merely an ideal c onnection (the law in it) of the later with the earlier, but also the concept (the law) of the effect must re ally, i.e. by means of a perceptible process, influence the cause. However, a perceptible influence of a c oncept upon something else is to be observed only in human actions. This is therefore the only sphere in which the concept of purpose is applicable. Naive consci ousness, which regards as real only what is perceptible, attempts - as we said before - to place something perceptible where only ideal factors are to be rec ognized. In perceptible events it also looks for perceptible connections, or, if it does not find them, imag ines them to be there. The concept of purpose, valid for subjective actions, is an element that easily lends itself to such imaginary connections. The naive man knows how he brings about an event, and from this he concludes that nature must do likewis e. In the purely ideal connections of nature he sees not only imperceptible forces but also imperceptible r eal purposes. Man makes his tools to fit a purpose; on the same pattern, the naive realist lets the Creator build up all organisms. Only very gradually does this mi staken concept of purpose disappear from the sciences. In philosophy, even t oday, it still does a great deal of mischief. The purpose of the world is thought to exist out side the world, and man’s dest ination (therefore also his purpose) outside man, and so on. Monism rejects the concept of purpose in ever y sphere, with the sole exception of human action. It looks for laws of nature, but not fo r purposes of nature. Purposes of nature are arbitrary assumptions, just lik e the imperceptible forces (p. 138). And from the standpoint of monism, life purposes that man does not set himself are unjustifiable assumptions. Only that is purposeful which man has first made so, for only thr ough the realization of an idea does a purpose arise. And ideas are e ffective in a realisti c sense in man alone. Therefore human life has only the purpose and the destination that the human being gives it. To the question: What is man’s task in life? monism can only answer: The task he sets"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"himself. My mission in the worl d is not predetermined, but at every moment is the one I choose. I do not begin lif e along a fixed route. Only by human beings are ideas realized according to purpose. It is therefore inadmissible to speak of the embodiment of ideas through history. All such phrases as: “History is the development of mankind toward freedom,” or the realization of the moral world order, and so on, are untenable from the monistic point of view. The adherents of the concept of purpose be lieve that by abandoning it they would also have to abandon all order and uniformity in the world. Listen, for example, to Robert Hamerling:50a “As long as there are instin cts in nature, it is fool ish to deny purposes in it. Just as the structure of a lim b of the human body is not determined and conditioned by an idea of this limb, floating in the air, but by the connection with the greater totality, the body, to which the limb belongs, so the structur e of every being in nature, be it plant, animal, or man, is not determined and conditi oned by an idea of it floating in the air, but by the formative principle of the great totali ty of nature which expresses and organizes itself according to a purpose.” And on page 191 of the same volume: “The theory of purpose maintains only that in spite of the thousand discomforts and miseries of the life of creatures, lofty purpos e and plan are unmistakably present in the formations and in the development of nature . - A purpose and a plan, however, that come to realization only within th e bounds of natural laws, and cannot aim at a Utopia in which life is not confronted by death, growth by deca y, with all the more or less unpleasant, but quite unavoidable intermedia ry stages between them. When the opponents of the concept of purpose bring a laboriously-co llected rubbish-heap of partial or complete, imaginary or real examples showing lack of purpose, against a world full of wonders of purpose such as nature shows in all its realms, then I find it just as droll.” - What is it that here is called purpose? A conc ordance of perceptions that form a totality. But since all perceptions are based on laws (ideas) which we discover by means of our thinking, it follows that the planned concord betw een single parts of a perceptual totality is just the ideal concord between the single parts of the idea totality contained in the perceptual totality. When it is said that an animal or a man is not determined by an idea floating in the air, then this is a mislead ing way of putting it, and the condemned view ceases to be absurd when rightly formulated. Certainly an animal is not determined by an idea floating in the air, but indeed is dete rmined by an idea inborn in it and constituting the law of its nature. It is just because the id ea is not outside of the object, but is effective in it as its nature, that one ca nnot speak of purpose. Just thos e who deny that the beings of nature are determined from outside (whether by an idea floating in the air or existing"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"outside the creature in the mind of a world Creat or, is immaterial in this context) should admit that these beings are not determined by purpose and plan from outside, but by cause and law from within. I construct a m achine according to a purpose when I bring its parts in connection with one another in a way that they did not acquire from nature. The purpose contained in the arrangemen t consists in the fact that I have placed the idea of the working of the machine into its foundation. The machine thereby becomes a perceptual object with a corresponding idea. The beings of nature are also entities of this kind. One who says that something contains purpose be cause it is built according to laws can use the same description for the beings of nature, if he likes. However, the laws at work in nature must not be confused with the purpos es in subjective human action. For a purpose to be present, it is always necessary that th e effective cause is a concept, and indeed it must be the concept of the effect. But nowhere in nature are concepts in evidence as causes; concepts always appear only as th e ideal connection betw een cause and effect. Causes are present in nature onl y in the form of perceptions. Dualism speaks of world purpose and nature purpose. Where, for perception, a link can be seen between cause and eff ect according to law, there th e dualist assumes that one sees only the copy of a connection in which the ab solute Being has real ized its purposes. For monism, along with the absolute Being that ca nnot be experienced and is only inferred, the reason for assuming any world purpose also falls away. Addition to the Revised Version, 1918. No one who thinks through without prejudice what is presented here, could come to the conc lusion that the author rejects the concept of purpose for all facts not produced by man, because his view is similar to that of those thinkers who, by rejecting this concept, cr eate the possibility of presenting, first, everything except human action - and then hum an action too - as being only a natural process. The fact that thinking is presented here as a purely spirit ual process should be a protection against such misunderstanding. The reason for here rejecting the concept of purpose for the spiritual world also, insofar as it lies outside human action, is because in that world something higher is revealed than purpose realized in human life. And when the purpose of mankind’s destination, thought of on the pattern of human purpose, is referred to here as a mistaken concept, it is meant that the individual human beings set themselves purposes, and the resu lt of these is the to tal activity of manki nd. This result is then something higher than its pa rts, the single human purposes. MORAL IMAGINATION (DAR WINISM AND MORALITY) A free spirit acts according to his impulses; these are intuitions chosen by means of thinking from the totality of his world of id eas. The reason an unfree spirit singles out a particular intuition from his id ea world in order to use it as a basis for a deed, lies in the world of perception given to him, i.e., in his past experience. Before making a decision he recalls what someone else has done or recommen ded as suitable in a similar instance, or what God has commanded to be done in such a case and so on, and he acts accordingly. For a free spirit these preconditions are not the only impulses to action. He makes an"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"absolutely original decision. In doing so he worries neither about what others have done in such an instance, nor what commands they have laid down. He has purely ideal reasons which move him to single out from th e sum of his concepts a particular one and to transform it into action. Bu t his action will belong to pe rceptible reality. What he brings about will therefore be identical with a quite definite perceptual content. The concept will be realized in a pa rticular concrete event. As con cept, it will not contain this particular event. It would be related to th e event only in the same way as a concept in general is related to a perception, for exampl e, as the concept, lion is related to a particular lion. The link between concept and perception is the repr esentation (cp. p. 124, f.). For the unfree spirit this intermediate li nk is given from the out set. At the outset the motives are present in his consciousness as representations. When he wants to do something he does it as he has seen it done or as he is to ld to do it in the particular instance. Here authority is most effective by way of examples, that is, by conveying quite definite particular actions to the consciousness of the unfree spirit. The Christian, as unfree spirit, acts less on the teaching than on the example of the Redeemer. Rules have less value when they refer to positive deeds th an when they refer to what should not be done. Laws appear in the form of general c oncepts only when they forbid something, not when they bid things to be done. Laws con cerning what he should do must be given to the unfree spirit in a quite concrete form: Cl ean the walk in front of your door! Pay your taxes in such and such an amount to the Trea sury Department, etc. Laws which are meant to prevent deeds take on conceptual form: Thou shalt not steal! Thou shalt not commit adultery! But these laws also influence the unfree spirit only through reference to a concrete representation such as that of the corresponding earthly punishment, the pangs of conscience, eternal damnation, and so on. As soon as the impulse to action is present in general conceptual form (for example: Thou shalt do good to thy fellow men! Thou shal t live in a way that best furthers thy welfare!), then in each case must be found fi rst of all the concrete representation of the deed (the relation of the concep t to a perceptual content). For the free spirit, who is driven neither by any example nor by fear of punish ment, etc., it is always necessary to transform the concept into a representation. By means of imagination representations are produced by man out of his world of ideas. Therefore what the free spirit needs in order to carry out his ideas, in order to bring them to fruition, is moral imagination. Moral imag ination is the source from which the free spirit acts. Hence, only people with moral im agination are also morally productive in the real sense of the word. Those who merely preach morality, that is, people who devise moral rules without being able to condense them into concrete representations, are morally unproductive. They are like those cr itics who know how to explain rationally what a work of art should be like, but are incapable of any artistic creation themselves. In order to produce a represen tation, man’s moral imagination must set to work in a definite sphere of perception. Men’s deed s do not create percep tions, but transform already existing perceptions, that is, impart a new form to them. In order to be able to transform a definite perceptual object, or a sum of such objects, in accordance with a moral representation, one must have grasped th e laws at work in the perceptual picture"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"(the way it has worked hitherto, to which one now wants to give a new form or a new direction). Further, one must find a way by wh ich these laws can be transformed into new ones. This part of moral activity depends on a knowledge of the sphere of phenomena with which one has to do. It must therefore be sought in a branch of general scientific knowledge. Hence moral deeds presuppose not only the faculty of moral ideation as well as moral imagination, but also the ability to transform the sphere of perceptions without breaking the laws of their natural connection. [footnote: Only superfic iality could find in the use of the word “faculty” in this and othe r passages, a reversion to the teachings of older psychology concerning soul faculties. The exact meaning of this word, as used here, will be seen when compared with what is said on pp. 113-114.] This ability is moral technique. It can be learned in the sense in which science in general can be learned. Because people usually are better able to fi nd the concepts for the already created world than productively out of imagination to decide future deeds, not yet in existence, it very well may be possible that persons without moral imagination receive moral representations from others, a nd skillfully imprint these into actual reality. The opposite may also occur: that persons with moral imag ination are without the technical skill, and therefore must make use of others for carrying out their representations. Insofar as knowledge of the objects in the s phere of our activity is necessary, our action will depend upon this knowledge. What must be c onsidered here are laws of nature. Here we have to do with natural science, not with ethics. Moral imagination and the f aculty of moral ideation can become objects of knowledge only after they have been produced by the in dividual. By then they no longer regulate life, but have already regulated it. They must be explained in the same way as all other effective causes (they are purposes only for th e subject). We therefor e deal with them as with a natural philosophy of moral representations. In addition to the above, one cannot have ethics in the form of a sc ience of standards. The standardized character of moral laws has been retained at least insofar as to enable one to explain ethics in the same sense as di etetics, which deduce general rules from the life-condition of the organism in order that on this basis they can influence the body in a particular way.51 This comparison is mistake n, because our moral life is not comparable with the life of the or ganism. The function of the organi sm takes place without our doing anything about it; we find its laws present, ready-made, and therefore can investigate them and then apply what we discover. But mo ral laws are first created by us. We cannot apply them until they have been created. The mistake arises through the fact that moral laws, insofar as their content is concerned, are not newly created at every moment, but are handed over. Those that we take over fr om our ancestors appear as given, like the natural laws of the organism. But they can ne ver be applied by a later generation with the same rights as can dietetic ru les. For they apply to indivi duals and not, like natural laws, to examples of a species. As an organism I am such an example of a species, and I shall live in accordance with nature if I apply the natural laws of the species to my particular case. As a moral being I am an individual and have laws which are wholly my own.51a"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"This view seems to contradict the fundame ntal teaching of modern natural science described as the theory of evolution. But it onl y seems to do so. By evolution is meant the real development of the later out of the earlier in accordance w ith natural law. By evolution in the organic world is meant that the later (more perfect) organic forms are real descendents of the earlier (imperfect) forms, and have developed from them in accordance with natural laws. According to hi s view, the adherent of the theory of organic evolution would have to represent to himself that there was once a time on earth when it would have been possible to watch th e gradual development of reptiles out of proto-amniotes,52 if one could have been present there as obs erver and had been endowed with a sufficiently long span of life. He also would have to represent to himself that it would have been possible to observe th e development of the solar system out of the Kant-Laplace primerdial nebul a53 if, during that infinitely long time, one could have occupied a suitable spot out in the world-ether. The fact that in such a representation, both the nature of protoamniotes and that of the Kant-Laplace primordial nebula would have to be thought of in a way other than th at of the materialistic thinker, will not be considered here. But it should not occur to any evolutionist to maintain that he can extract from his concept of the proto-amniote th e concept of the reptile with all its characteristics, if he had never seen a reptile. And just as little coul d one extract the solar system from the Kant-Laplace primordial nebula , if this concept is thought of as being determined only from the direct perception of the primordial nebula. In other words, this means: if the evolutionist thinks consistently, th en he is able to maintain only that out of earlier phases of evolution late r ones come about as real fact s, that if we are given the concept of the imperfect and the concept of the perfect, we can recognize the connection; but never should he say that the concept derived from what was earlier suffices to develop from it what came later. In the sphere of ethics this means that one can recognize the connection of later moral concepts with ea rlier ones, but not that as much as a single new moral idea could be extracted from earlie r ones. As a moral being, the individual produces his own content. This content which he produces is for ethics something given, just as reptiles are something given for natu ral science. Reptiles have evolved out of proto-amniotes, but from the concept of th e protoamniote the natural scientist cannot extract the concept of the reptile. Later moral ideas develop out of ear lier ones, but from the moral concepts of an earlier cultural epoc h ethics cannot extract those for a later one. The confusion arises because when we invest igate nature the facts are there before we gain knowledge of them, whereas in the case of moral action we ourselves first produce the facts which we afterwards cognize. In th e evolutionary process of the moral world order we do what nature does at a lower level: we alter so mething perceptible. As we have seen, an ethical rule cannot be cognized straight away like a law of nature; it must first be created. Only when it is presen t can it become the object of cognition. But can we not make the old the standard fo r the new? Is it not necessary for man to measure by the standard of earlier moral rules what he produces through his moral imagination? For something that is to reveal itself as morally productive, this would be as impossible as it would be to measure a new species in nature by an old one and say, Because reptiles do not harmonize with the protoamniotes, their form is unjustified (diseased)."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Ethical individualism then, is not in oppositio n to an evolutionary theory if rightly understood, but is a direct continuation of it. It must be possible to continue Haeckel’s genealogical tree,54 from protozoa to man as organic being, without interruption of the natural sequence, and without a breach in the uniform development, right up to the individual as a moral being in a definite sens e. But never will it be possible to deduce the nature of a later species from the nature of an ancestral speci es. True as it is that the moral ideas of the individual ha ve perceptibly evolved out of those of his ancestors, it is also true that an individual is morally barren if he himself has no moral ideas. The same ethical individualism that I have built up on the foundation of the preceding consideration, could also be derived from an evolutionary theory. The final result would be the same, only the path by which it was reached would be different. The appearance of completely new moral idea s through moral imagination is, in relation to an evolutionary theory, no more of a marv el than is the appearance of a new kind of animal from previous ones. Only such a theo ry must, as monistic world view, reject in moral life and also in science, every infl uence from a Beyond (metaphysical) which is merely inferred and cannot be experienced by means of ideas. This approach would then be following the same principle which urges man on when he seeks to discover the causes for new organic forms and in doing so does not call upon any interference by some Being from outside the world, who is to call forth every new kind according to a thought of a new creation, by means of supernat ural influence. Just as monism has no need of supernatural thoughts of creation fo r explaining living organisms, neither does it derive the morality of the world from cause s which do not lie within the world we can experience. The monist does not find that the nature of a will impulse, as a moral one, is exhausted by being traced back to a con tinuous supernatural influence upon moral life (divine world rulership from outside), to a par ticular revelation at a particular moment in time (giving of the Ten Commandments), or to the appearance of God on the earth (Christ). Everything that happens to and in man through all this becomes a moral element only if within human experience it become s an individual’s own. For monism, moral processes are products of the world like ever ything else in existe nce, and their causes must be sought in the world, i.e., in ma n, since man is the bearer of morality. Ethical individualism, therefore, is the crow ning of that edifice to which Darwin55 and Haeckel aspired for natural science. It is sp iritualized science of evolution carried over into moral life. Whoever from the outset restricts the concept natural within an arbitrary boundary, in a narrow-minded manner, may easily fail to find any room in it for the free individual deed. The consistent evolutionist is in no danger of remaining at such a narrow-minded view. He cannot let natural development come to an end with the ape, while granting to man a “supernatural” origin; in his search for man’ s ancestors he must seek spirit already in nature; also, he cannot remain at the organic functions of man and consider only these to be natural; he cannot but consider the free, moral life of man to be the spiritual continuation of organic life."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"In accordance with his fundamental principles the evolutionist can maintain only that a new moral deed comes about through a kind of process other than a new species in nature; the characteristic featur e of the deed, that is, its definition as a free deed, he must leave to direct observation of the deed. So, too, he only maintains that men have developed out of not yet human ancestors. How men are constituted must be determined by observation of men themselves. The resu lts of this observation cannot possibly contradict a true histor y of evolution. Only if it were as serted that the results exclude a natural development would it c ontradict recent tendencies in natural science. [footnote: We are entitled to speak of thoughts (ethic al ideas) as objects of observation. For, although the products of thinking do not enter the field of obs ervation, so long as thinking goes on, they may well become objects of obser vation subsequently, and in this way we can come to know the characteri stic feature of the deed.] Ethical individualism, then, cannot be opposed by natural science when the latter is properly understood; observati on shows freedom to be charact eristic of the perfect form of human conduct. This freedom must be attri buted to the human will, insofar as this will brings purely ideal intuitions to realization. For these do not come about through external necessity, but exist through them selves. When we recognize an action to be an image of such an ideal intuition, we feel it to be free. In this character istic feature of a deed lies its freedom. From this point of view, how do matters sta nd with regard to the distinction, mentioned earlier (p. 41 f.) between the two statements: “To be free means to be able to do what one wants,” and the other: “To be able, to desire or not to desire, as one pleases, is the real meaning of the dogma of free will”? Hamerling bases his view of free will on just this distinction and declares the first statement to be correct, the second to be an absurd tautology. He says: “I can do what I want. But to say, I can will what I want, is an empty tautology.” Now whether I can do, th at is, transform into realit y what I want, what I have set before me as the idea of my doing, de pends on external circumstances and on my technical skill (cp. p. 208). To be free means to be able to determine for oneself by moral imagination the representations (impulses) on which the action is based. Freedom is impossible if something external to me (mech anical processes or a merely inferred God whose existence cannot be experienced) dete rmines my moral repr esentations. In other words, I am free only if I produce these repres entations myself, not when I am only able to carry out the impulse which someone else has induced in me. A free being is someone who is able to will what he considers right . One who does something other than what he wills, must be driven to it by motives which do not lie within himself. Such a man is unfree in his action. Therefore, to be able to will what one considers right or not right, as one pleases, means to be free or unfree, as one pleases. This, of course, is just as absurd as it is to see freedom in the ability to be ab le to do what one is forced to will. But the latter is what Hamerling maintains when he says: “It is perfectly true that the will is always determined by motives, but it is absurd to say that it is therefore unfree; fo r a greater freedom one can neither wish for nor imagine than the freedom to let one’s will realize itse lf in accordance with its strength and determination.”"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Indeed, a greater freedom can be wished fo r, and only this greater is true freedom. Namely: to decide for oneself th e motive (foundation) of one’s will. There can be circumstances under which a man may be induced to refrain from doing what he wants to do. But to let others prescrib e to him what he ought to do, that is, to do what another, and not what he himself consid ers right, this he will accept only insofar as he does not feel free. External powers may prevent my doing what I want; they then simply force me to be inactive or to be unfree. It is only when th ey enslave my spirit, drive my motives out of my head and want to put theirs in the place of mine, that they intentionally aim at making me unfree. This is why the Church is not only against the mere doing, but more particularly against impure thoughts, that is, against the impulses of my action. The Church makes me unfree if it considers impur e all impulses it has not itself indicated. A Church or other community causes unfreedom when its priests or teachers take on the role of keepers of conscience, that is, when the believers must receive from them (at the Confessional) the impulses for their actions. Addition to Revised Edition, 1918. In this inte rpretation of the human will is presented what man can experience in his actions and, through this, come to the conscious experience: My will is free. It is of particular significance that the right to characterize the will as free is attained through the experien ce: In my will an ideal intuition comes to realization. This experience can only come about as a result of observation, but it is observation in the sense that the human will is observed within a stream of evolution, the aim of which is to attain for the will the possibility of being carried by pure ideal intuition. This can be attained because in id eal intuition nothing is active but its own self- sustaining essence. If such an intuition is pr esent in human consciousness, then it is not developed out of the processes of the orga nism (cp. p. 161 ff.), but the organic activity has withdrawn to make room for the ideal act ivity. If I observe will when it is an image of intuition, then from this will the necessary organic activity has withdrawn. The will is free. This freedom of will no one can observe who is unable to observe how free will consists in the fact that, firs t, through the intuitive element the necessary activity of the human organism is lamed, pressed back, and in its place is set the spiritual activity of idea-filled will. Only one who is unable to make this observation of the two-fold aspect of will that is free, will believe that every will-impulse is unfree. One who can make the observations will attain the insight that man is unfree insofar as he is unable to carry through completely the process of repressing th e organic activity, but that this unfreedom strives to attain freedom, and that this free dom is by no means an ab stract ideal, but is a directive force inherent in human nature. Man is free to the degree that he is able to realize in his will the same m ood of soul he also experiences when he is conscious of elaborating pure ideal (s piritual) intuitions. THE VALUE OF LIFE (PESSIMISM AND OPTIMISM)"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The question concerning life’s value is a counterpart to the que stion concerning its purpose or destination (cp. pp. 198 ff.). In this connection we meet with two contrasting views, and between them all imaginable at tempts at compromise. One view says: The world is the best possible, and to live and be active in it is a blessing of untold value. Everything exists harmoniously and is full of purpose; it is worthy of admiration. Even what is apparently bad and evil may be seen to be good from a higher point of view, for it represents a beneficial cont rast to the good; we are more able to appreciate the good when it is contrasted with evil. Moreover, evil is not genuinely real: it is only that we see as evil a lesser degree of good. Evil is the absence of good; it has no significance in itself. The other view maintains: Life is full of misery and want, everywhere displeasure outweighs pleasure, pain outweighs j oy. Existence is a burden, and under all circumstances non-existence would be preferable to existence. The main representatives of the former view, i.e., optimism, are Shaftesbury and Leibnitz;56 those of the latter, i.e., pessimism, are Schopenhauer and Eduard von Hartmann.57 Leibnitz says the world is the best of all possible worlds. A better one is impossible. For God is good and wise. A good God would want to create the best possible world; a wise God would know which is the best possible; He is able to distingui sh it from all other possible inferior ones. Only a bad or unwise G od could create a world inferior to the best possible. Starting from this viewpoint, one will easily be able to indicate the direction human conduct should take in order to contribute its share to the best of all worlds. All that man has to do is to find out God’s decisions a nd to act in accordance with them. When he knows what God’s intentions are with regard to the world and mankind, then he will also do what is right. And he will feel happy to add his share to the rest of the good in the world. Therefore, from the optimistic standpoin t life is worth living. This view cannot but stimulate us to cooperative participation. Schopenhauer presents matters differently. He thinks of the world’ s foundation not as an all-wise and all-kind Being, but as blind urge or will. Eter nal striving, ceaseless craving for satisfaction which yet can never be attaine d, in his view is the fundamental essence of all will. For if an aim one has striven for is attained, then immediately another need arises, and so on. Satisfaction can always be onl y for an infinitely short time. All the rest of the content of our life is unsatisfied urge, that is, dissatisfaction and suffering. If at last the blind urge is dulled, then all content is gone from our lives; an infinite boredom pervades our existence. Therefore, the relative best one can do is to stifle all wishes and needs within one, and exterminate one’s will. Schopenhauer’s pessimism leads to complete inactivity; his moral aim is universal laziness. By a very different argument Hartmann attemp ts to establish pessimism and use it as a foundation for ethics. In keeping with a favorite trend of our time, he tries to base his world view on experience. By observation of life he wishes to find out whether pleasure"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"or displeasure is the more plentiful in the wo rld. He passes in review before the tribunal of reason whatever appears to men to be wort h while in life, in or der to show that on closer inspection all so-calle d satisfaction turns out to be nothing but illusion. It is illusion when we believe that in health, yout h, freedom, sufficient income, love (sexual enjoyment), pity, friendship and family lif e, honor, reputation, glory, power, religious edification, pursuit of science a nd of art, hope of a life her eafter, participation in the furtherance of culture, - we have sources of happiness and satisfaction. Soberly considered, every enjoyment brings much more evil and misery than pleasure into the world. The displeasure of a hangover is always greater than the plea sure of intoxication. Displeasure far outweighs pleasure in the worl d. No person, even the relatively happiest, if asked, would want to live through the mi sery of life a second time. Since Hartmann does not deny the presence of an ideal factor (wisdom) in the world, but even grants it equal significance with blind urge (will), he can attribute the creation of the world to his primordial Being only if he lets the pain in the world serve a wise world purpose. He sees the pain in the world as nothi ng but God’s pain, for the life of the world as a whole is identical with the life of God. The aim of an all-wise Being, however, could only be release from suffering, and since all existen ce is suffering, release from existence. The purpose of the world’s creation is to transform existence in to nonexistence, which is so much better. The world process is nothing but a continual battle against God’s pain, which at last will end with the annihilation of all existence. The moral life of men must therefore be participation in the annihilation of existence. God has created the world in order to rid Himself of His infi nite pain through it. The world “in a certain sense is to be regarded as an itching eruption on the absolu te,” through which the unconscious healing power of the absolute rids itself of an inwa rd disease, “or even as a painful drawing- plaster which the alone Being applies to Himsel f in order first to di vert an inner pain outward, and then to remove it altogether.” Human beings are parts of the world. In them God suffers. He has created them in order to split up His infinite pain. The pain each one of us suffers is but a drop in the infinite ocean of God’s pain.58 Man must recognize to the full that to pursue in dividual satisfaction (egoism) is folly, that he ought to follow solely his task and thr ough selfless devotion dedi cate himself to the world-process of redeeming God. In contrast to Schopenhauer’s pessimism, that of von Hartmann leads us to devoted activity for a lofty task. But is the above really based on experience? To strive after satisfaction m eans that the life activities go beyond the life content of the being in question. A being is hungry, that is , it strives for satiety when for their continuation, its organic functions demand to be supplied with ne w life content in the form of nourishment. The striving for honor cons ists in the person not regarding what he does as worth while unless he receives appr eciation from others. Striving for knowledge arises when a person finds that something is mi ssing in the world that he sees, hears, etc., as long as he has not understood it. The fulf ilment of striving produces pleasure in the striving individual; non-fulfilment produces disp leasure. Here it is important to observe that pleasure or displeasure depend only upon the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of striving. The striving itself can by no means be regarded as displeasure. Therefore, if it so happens"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"that in the moment a striving is fulfilled, immediately a new one ar ises, I should not say that the pleasure has produced displeasure in me, because in all circumstances an enjoyment produces desire for its repetition, or for a new pleasure. Here I can speak of displeasure only when this desire runs up agai nst the impossibility of its fulfilment. Even when an experienced enjoyment produces in me the demand for the experience of a greater or more refined pleasure, I can sp eak of a displeasure being produced by the previous pleasure only at the moment when the means of experiencing the greater or more refined pleasure fail me. Only when disp leasure follows enjoyment as a natural law, for example when woman’s sexual enjoyment is followed by the suffering of childbirth and the nursing of children, is it possible to rega rd the enjoyment as the source of pain. If striving as such called forth displeasure, then the removal of striving would be accompanied by pleasure. But the opposite is th e case. When the cont ent of our life lacks striving, boredom is the result, and this is c onnected with displeasure. And as the striving naturally may last a long time before it attains fulfilment, and as it is satisfied with the hope of fulfilment meanwhile, it must be ac knowledged that displeasure has nothing to do with striving as such, but depends solely on its non-fulfilment. Schopenhauer, then, is wrong in any case in regarding desi re or striving (the will) as such, to be a source of pain. In reality, even the opposite is correct. Stri ving (desire), as such, gives pleasure. Who does not know the enjoyment caused by the hope of a remote but intensely desired aim? This joy is the companion of all labor, the fruits of which will be ours only in the future. This pleasure is quite independent of the a ttainment of the aim. Then when the aim is attained, to the pleasure of st riving is added that of the fulfilment as something new. Should someone now say: To the displeasur e of a non-fulfilled aim is added that of disappointed hope, and in the end this make s the displeasure of non-fulfilment greater than the awaited pleasure of fulfilment, th en the answer would be: Even the opposite could be the case; the recollecti on of past enjoyment, at the time when the desire was still not satisfied, will just as often act as consol ation for the displeasure of non-fulfilment. In the moment of shattered hopes, one who exclai ms, I have done what I could! proves this assertion. The blessed feeling of having tried one’s best is overlooked by those who say of every unsatisfied desire that not only has the pleasure of fulfilmen t not arisen, but also the enjoyment of desiring has been destroyed. The fulfilment of a desire calls forth pleasur e and its non-fulfilment, displeasure. From this must not be concluded that pleasure mean s satisfaction of a desire, displeasure means its non-satisfaction. Both pleasure and displeasur e may also appear in a being where they are not the result of desire. Il lness is displeasure for which there has been no desire. One who maintains that illness is an unsatisfied desire for health, makes the mistake of regarding the obvious but unconscious wish, not to be ill, as a positive desire. When someone receives a legacy from a rich relativ e of whose existence he had no notion, this event gives him pleasure without any preceding desire. Therefore, one who sets out to investigate wh ether the balance is on the side of pleasure or of displeasure, must bring into the account the pleasure of desiri ng, the pleasure of the fulfilment of desire, and those pleasures wh ich come to us without any striving on our part. On the debit side of our account-sheet w ould have to be entered the displeasure of"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"boredom, the displeasure of unfulfilled stri ving, and, lastly, displeasures that come without being preceded by any desire. To th e last kind belongs also the displeasure caused by work which is not self -chosen but is forced upon us. Now the question arises: What is the right m eans of estimating the balance between debit and credit? Eduard von Hartmann is of the opini on that reason is able to establish this. However he also says: “Pain and pleasure exist only insofar as they are felt.”59 From this statement it would follow that there is no othe r yardstick for pleasure than the subjective one of feeling. I must feel whet her the sum of my feelings of displeasure, compared with my feelings of pleasure, leaves me with a ba lance of joy or of pain. But disregarding this, Hartmann maintains that: “Even if the life-value of every being can be estimated only according to its own subjective measure, this is not to say that ev ery being is able to calculate, from all that influences its life, the correct algebraic sum or, in other word s, that its final judgment of its own life, in regard to its subjective experiences, is correct.” This, however, only means that rational judgmen t is still made to estimate the value of feeling. [footnote: One who wants to calculate whether the sum tota l of pleasure or of displeasure is the greater, overlooks that he is calculating something which is never experienced. Feeling does not calculate, and wh at matters for a real estimation of life is true experience, not the result of an imagined calculation.] One whose view more or less inclines in the direction of thinkers like Eduard von Hartmann may believe that in order to arrive at a correct valuation of life he must clear out of the way those factors which falsify our judgment about the ba lance of pleasure or displeasure. There are two ways in which he can do this. One way is by showing that our desires (urges, will) ac t disturbingly in our sober judgmen t of our feeling-values. While, for example, we should tell ourselves that se xual enjoyment is a source of evil, the fact that the sexual instinct is very strong in us misleads us into anticipating a pleasure far greater than in fact occurs. We want to enjoy, and therefore will not admit to ourselves that we suffer through the enjoyment. Another wa y is to subject feelings to criticism, and attempt to prove that the objects to which f eelings attach themselves are revealed as illusions by the insight of reason, then are de stroyed the moment our continually growing intelligence recognizes the illusion. He can reason out the situation in the follo wing way. If an ambitious person wants to make clear to himself whether, up to the mo ment of making this calculation, pleasure or displeasure has occupied the greater part of his life, he must free himself from two sources of error before passing judgment. As he is ambitious, this fundamental feature of his character will make him see the pleasur es of recognition of his achievements as larger, and the hurts suffered through being slight ed as smaller than they are. At the time he suffered from being slighted he felt it just because he wa s ambitious, but in recollection this appears in a milder light, whereas the pleasures of recognition to which he is so very susceptible leave a deeper im pression. Now it is of real benefit for an ambitious person that this is so. The deception diminishes his feeling of displeasure in the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"moment of self-observation. Nevertheless, hi s judgment will be misled. The sufferings, over which a veil is drawn, he really did experi ence in all their intens ity, and therefore he really gives them a wrong valu ation on his balance-sheet of li fe. In order to come to a correct judgment, an ambitious person would have to get rid of his ambition during the time he is making his calculation. He would ha ve to consider his life up to that point without placing distorting gla sses before his mind’s eye. Otherwise he is like a merchant who, in making up his books, also enters hi s own business zeal on the income side. He could go even further. He could say: Th e ambitious man must also make clear to himself that the recognition he pursues is so mething valueless. Through his own effort, or with the help of others, he must come to see that for a sensible person recognition by others counts little, since one can always be sure that “In all matters which are not vital questions of evolution or are already finally settled by science, the majority is wrong and the mi nority right.” “Whoever makes ambition his lodestar, puts the happiness of his life at the mercy of an unreliable judgment.”60 If the ambitious person admits all this to hi mself, he will have to recognize as illusion, not only everything his ambition caused him to regard as reality, but also the feelings attached to the illusions. For this reason it co uld then be said: From the balance sheet of life-values must also be eras ed those feelings of pleasure that have been produced by illusions; what then remains represents, free of a ll illusions, the totality of pleasure in life, and this, in contrast to the totality of displeas ure, is so small that life is no joy and non- existence is preferable to existence. While it is quite obvious that the deception caused by the interfer ence of ambition leads to a false result when making up the account of pleasure, what is said about the recognition of the illusory char acter of the objects of not only everything pleasure must nonetheless be challenged. To eliminate from the balance-sheet all pleasurable feelings connected with actual or supposed illusions would positively falsify it. For the ambitious person did genuinely enjoy being appreciated by the multitude, quite irrespective of whether later he or someone else recognizes this appreciation as illusion. The pleasure already enjoyed is not diminished in the leas t by such recognition. The elimination of all such “illusory” feelings from life’s balance- sheet, far from making our judgment about feelings more correct, actually eliminates from life feelings which were genuinely present. And why should these feelings be eliminat ed? One possessing them derives pleasure from them; one who has overcome them, gain s through the experiences of self-conquest (not through the vain emotion, What a noble fellow I am! but through the objective sources of pleasure which lie in the se lf-conquest) a pleasure which is indeed spiritualized, but no less significan t for that. If feelings are er ased from the balance-sheet because they attached themselves to objects which later are revealed as illusions, then life’s value is made dependent not on the quantity, but on the quali ty of pleasure, and this, in turn, on the value of the objects which cause the pleasure. If I set out to determine the value of life by the quantity of pleasure or displeasure it brings, then I have no right to"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"presuppose something else by which to determine first the qualitative va lue of pleasure. If I say I will compare the amount of pleasure wi th the amount of displeasure and see which is greater, then I must also bring into th e account all pleasure and displeasure in their actual quantities, regardless whet her they are based on illusion s or not. To ascribe to a pleasure which rests on illusion a lesser value for life than to one which can be justified by reason, is to make the value of life dependent on factors other than pleasure. Someone estimating pleasure as less valuable when it is attached to a worthless object, is like a merchant who enters in his accounts the considerable profit of a toy-factory at a quarter of the actual amount because the factory produces playthings for children. When it is only a matter of weighing pleasure against displeasure, th e illusory character of the objects of some pleasures must be left out of the picture altogether. The rational consideration of the quantities of pleasure and displeasure produced by life, which Hartmann recommends, has led us as far as knowing how to set up the account, that is, to knowing what we have to put down on each side of our balance sheet. But how are we to make the actual calculations? Is reason also capable of determining the balance? The merchant has made a mistake in his acc ount if the calculated balance does not agree with the profit which has demonstrably been enjoyed from the busine ss or which can still be expected. The philosopher, too, will undoubted ly have made a mistake in his judgment if the calculated surplus of pl easure or, as the case may be , of displeasure, cannot be proved by actual sentiments. For the moment I shall not go into the account of those pessimists who base their world view on rational estimation; but a person who is to decide whether or not to carry on the business of life will first demand proof that th e calculated surplus of displeasure exists. Here we touch the point where reason is not in a position to determine on its own the surplus of pleasure or of displeasure, but where it must point to this surplus in life in the form of perception. For reality is attainab le for man not through concept alone, but through the inter-penetration, mediated by th inking, of concept and perception (and a feeling is a perception) (cp. pp. 153 ff.). A merchant, too, will give up his business only when the loss of income, calculated by his accoun tant, is confirmed by the facts. If this is not the case, he will let the accountant go thr ough the books once more. And in regard to life, man will do exactly the same. If the philo sopher wants to show him that displeasure is far greater than pleasure, and if he has not felt it to be so, he will reply: You have gone astray in your brooding; thi nk things through once more. But if there comes a time in a business when such losses are really present that no credit any longer suffices to meet the claims, then the result will be bankruptcy, even though the merchant may have avoided keeping himself informed about his affair s by means of accounts. Similarly, if there comes a time when the quantity of displeas ure a man suffers is so great that no hope (credit) of future pleasure could carry him through the pai n, then this would lead to bankruptcy of life’s business."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"However, the number of suicides is relatively small in proportion to the number of those who bravely live on. Very few people give up the business of life because of the displeasure involved. What follows from this? Ei ther that it is not co rrect to say that the amount of displeasure is greater than the amount of pleasure, or that we do not make our continuation of life at all dependent upon the amount of pleasure or displeasure we feel. The pessimist, Eduard von Hartmann, in a quite extraordinary manner reaches the conclusion that life is valueless because it c ontains more pain than pleasure, and yet he maintains the necessity of carrying it through. This necessity lies in th e fact that the world purpose mentioned above (p. 222) can be ach ieved only through the ceaseless, devoted labor of human beings. So long as men still pur sue their egoistic desires they are useless for such selfless labor. Not until they have convinced themselves through experience and reason that the enjoyments of life pursued out of egoism ar e unattainable, do they devote themselves to their real task. In this way th e pessimistic conviction is supposed to be a source of selflessness. An education based on pessimism is meant to exterminate egoism by convincing men of its hopelessness. This means that this view considers striving for pleasure to be funda mentally inherent in human nature. Only through insight into the impossibility of its fulfilment does this striving abdicate in favor of higher tasks of humanity. Of such a moral world view, which, from recognition of pessimism, hopes to achieve devotion to non-egoistical aims in life, it cannot be said that it re ally overcomes egoism in the true sense of the word. Moral ideas ar e supposed to be strong enough to take hold of the will only when man has recognized that selfish striving after pleasure cannot lead to any satisfaction. Man, whose selfishness desire s the grapes of pleasure, finds them sour because he cannot reach them; he turns his back on them and devotes himself to an unselfish life. According to the opinion of pessimists, moral ideals are not strong enough to overcome egoism, but they establish thei r rulership on the ground which recognition of the hopelessness of egoism ha s first cleared for them. If in accordance with their natural dispositi on human beings strove after pleasure which they could not possibly attain, then anni hilation of existence and redemption through non-existence would be the only rational goal. And if one accepts the view that the real bearer of the pain of the world is God, it follo ws that the task of men consists in helping to bring about the salvation of God. To comm it suicide does not advance, but hinders, the accomplishment of this aim. God must have created men wisely for the sole purpose of bringing about His salvation through thei r action. Otherwise creation would be purposeless. And such a view of the world envisages extra-human purposes. Every one of us has to perform his own definite task in th e general work of salvation. If he withdraws from the task by suicide, another has to do the work which was intended for him. Someone else must bear the agony of existence in his place. And sin ce in every being it is, fundamentally, God who is the ultimate bear er of all pain, it follows that the suicide does not in the least diminish the quantity of God’s pain, but rather imposes upon God the additional difficulty of creating a substitute to take over the task."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"All this presupposes that pleasure is the standa rd of life’s value. No w life manifests itself through a number of craving (needs). If the value of life depended on whether it brought more pleasure than displeasure, a craving wh ich brought a surplus of displeasure to its owner, would have to be called valueless. Le t us examine craving and pleasure, in order to see whether or not craving can be measured by pleasure. A nd lest we give rise to the suspicion that life does not begi n for us below the level of the “aristocratic intellect,” we shall begin our examination with a “purely animal” need: hunger. Hunger arises when our organs are unable to continue their pr oper function without a fresh supply of substance. What a hungry man ai ms at, in the first place, is to have his hunger stilled. As soon as the supply of nouris hment has reached the point where hunger ceases, everything that the food-instinct cr aves has been attained. The enjoyment connected with satiety consists , to begin with, in the remova l of the pain which is caused by hunger. Also to the mere food-instinct a fu rther need is added. Man does not merely desire to overcome the disturbance in the f unctioning of his organs by the consumption of food, or to get rid of the pain of hunger: he seeks to accompany this with pleasurable sensations of taste. When he feels hungry and is within half an hour of an enjoyable meal, he may even avoid spoiling his enjoyment of the better food by re fusing inferior food which might satisfy his hunger sooner. He needs hunger in order to obtain the full enjoyment from his meal. In this way hunger be comes a cause of pleasure for him at the same time. If all the hunger in the world co uld be satisfied, then the total amount of enjoyment due to the need for nourishment woul d come about. To this would have to be added the special pleasure which gourmets atta in by cultivating the se nsitiveness of their taste-nerves beyond the usual measure. This amount of enjoyment would have the great est value possible if no aspect of this kind of enjoyment remained unsatisfied, and if with the enjoyment a certain amount of displeasure did not have to be accepted into the bargain. The view of modern natural sc ience is that nature produces more life than it can sustain, that is, nature produces more hunger than it is able to satisfy. The surplus of life produced must perish in pain in the struggle for existen ce. It is granted that at every moment of the world process, the needs of life are greater than the correspondi ng available means of satisfaction, and the enjo yment of life is thereby impaire d. But the individual enjoyments actually present are not in the least reduced thereby. Wherever a desire is satisfied, there the corresponding amount of pleasure is also present, even though in the creature itself which desires, or in its fellow-creatures, a la rge number of unsatisfied cravings exist. What is thereby diminished is not the quantit y, but the value of the enjoyment of life. If only a part of the needs of a living creature find satisfaction, the creature experiences enjoyment accordingly. This has a lesser value the smaller it is in proportion to the total demands of life in the sp here of the desire in question. We might represent this value as a fraction, of which the numerator is the enjoyment actually experienced and the denominator is the sum total of needs. This fraction has the value 1 when the numerator and the denominator are equal, i.e., when all needs are fully satisfied. The fraction becomes greater than 1 when a creature e xperiences more pleasure than its desires demand. It becomes smaller than 1 when the amount of enjoyment falls short of the sum"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"total of desires. But the fraction can never be nought so long as the numerator has any value at all, however small. If a man were to make up a final account before his death, and thought of the amount of enjoyment conne cted with a particular craving (e.g. hunger) as being distributed over the w hole of his life with all the demands made by this craving, then the value of the pleasure experienced mi ght perhaps be very small, but it could never be nil. If the quantity of enjoyment remain s constant, then with every increase in the needs of the living being the va lue of the pleasure diminishes . The same is true for the totality of life in nature. The greater the number of living beings in proportion to those able to fully satisfy their cravings, the sma ller is the average pleasure-value of life. The shares in life enjoyment, made out to us in the form of instincts, become less valuable in proportion as we cannot e xpect to cash them at their full face value. If I get enough to eat for three days and then have to go hungry fo r three days, the enj oyment during the three days when I do eat is not there by diminished. But I have to th ink of it as distributed over six days, and this reduces its value for my f ood instinct by half. The same applies to the quantity of pleasure in relati on to the degree of my nee d. If I am hungry enough for two sandwiches and can have only one, the enjoymen t gained from it has only half the value it would have had if after I had eaten it my hunger had been stilled. This is how the value of a pleasure is determined in life. It is m easured by the needs of lif e. Our desire is the yardstick; pleasure is what is measure d. The enjoyment of eating has a value only because hunger is present, and it attains a value of a specific degree through the proportion it bears to the de gree of the hunger present. Unfulfilled demands of our life throw their shadow even upon desires which have been satisfied, and impair the value of enjoyable hours. But one can also speak of the present value of a feeling of pleasure. This value is the more insignificant, the less the pleasure is in proportion to the duration a nd intensity of our desire. An amount of pleasure reaches its full value for us when its duration and degree exactly coincide with our desire. An amount of pl easure which is smalle r than our desire diminishes the value of pleasure; a greater amount produces a surplus which has not been demanded and which is felt as pleasure only so l ong as we are able to increase our desire during the enjoyment. If we are not able to increase our demand in order to keep pace with the increasing pleasure, then the pleasur e turns into displeasure. The thing that otherwise would satisfy us now assails us w ithout our wanting it, and we suffer under it. This is proof that pleasure has value for us only so long as we can measure it by our desires. An excess of pleasurab le feeling turns into pain. Th is may be observed especially in people whose desire for a particular kind of pleasure is very small. In people whose desire for food is dulled, eati ng readily produces nausea. This too shows that the desire is the yardstick for measuri ng the value of pleasure. Here pessimism could say: The unsatisfied craving for food brings not only the displeasure of lost enjoyment, but also posit ive pain, torment and misery into the world. In this he can point to the untold misery of people who starve, and to the amount of displeasure such people suffer indirectly thr ough lack of food. And if he wants to extend the assertion to the rest of nature, he can poi nt to the torment of animals that starve to"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"death at certain times of the year. The pessi mist maintains that these evils far outweigh the amount of enjoyment which the f ood-instinct brings into the world. There is no doubt that one can compare pleasur e and displeasure, a nd can determine the surplus of the one or the other, as is done in the case of profit and loss. But when the pessimist believes that there is a surplus on the side of displeasure and that from this one can conclude that life is valu eless, he already makes a mistake, insofar as he makes a calculation that is not made in actual life. Our desire, in each instance, is directed to a definite object. The value of the pleasure of satisfaction will, as we have seen, be the gr eater, the greater the amount of pleasure, in relation to the degree of our desire.[footnote: We disreg ard here the instance where excessive increase in pleasure turns it into displeasure.] But upon the degree of our desire also depends how great is the amount of disple asure we are willing to accept in order to achieve the pleasure. We compare the quantit y of displeasure not with the quantity of pleasure, but with the intensity of our desire. If someone fi nds great pleasure in eating, by reason of his enjoyment in better times he w ill find it easier to bear a period of hunger than will someone for whom eating is no enjoyment. A woman who desires a child compares the joy of possessing the child, not with the amount of displeasure due to pregnancy, childbirth, cares of nursing, etc., but with her desire to have the child. We never want a certain quantity of pleasure in the abstract, but a c oncrete satisfaction in a quite definite way. When we want a pleasur e which must be satisfied by a particular object or a particular sensation, it will not satisfy us if we ar e offered some other object or some other sensation, even though they give the same amount of pleasure. One desirous of food cannot substitute the pl easure this would give him by a pleasure equally great but produced by a walk. Only if our desire were , quite generally, for a certain quantity of pleasure, would it have to die away at once if this pleasure were unattainable except at the price of an even greater quantity of displeasure. But because we aim toward a particular kind of satisfacti on, we experience the pleasure of realization even when we have to bear a much greater displeasure al ong with it. The instinct s of living creatures tend in definite directions and aim at defi nite goals, and for this reason we cannot set down as an equivalent factor in our calculations the amount of displeasure that must be endured on the way to the goal. Provided the desire is sufficiently intense to still be present in some degree after having overcome the displeasure - how ever great that may be - then the pleasure of satisfaction can still be tasted to the full. The desire, therefore, does not measure the pain directly against the pleasure achieved, but indirectly by relating its own intensity to that of the di spleasure. The question is not whether the pleasure to be gained is greater than the disp leasure, but whether the desire for the goal is greater than the opposition of the displeasur e involved. If the opposition is greater than the desire, then the desire yields to the inev itable, weakens, and strives no further. Since our demand is always for some quite specific kind of satisfaction, the pleasure connected with it acquires significance for us in such a way that once we have achieved satisfaction, we need take the quantity of displeasure in to account only insofar as it has reduced the intensity of our desire. If I am passionately f ond of beautiful views, I never calculate the amount of pleasure the view from the mountain- top gives me as compared directly with"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"the displeasure of the toilsome ascent and descent, but I re flect whether, after having overcome all difficulties, my desire for th e view will still be sufficiently intense. Consideration of pleasure and pa in can lead to a result only indirectly in relation to the intensity of the desire. Theref ore the question is not at all whether there is a surplus of pleasure or of displeasure, but whether the desire for the pleasure is strong enough to overcome the displeasure. A proof of the correctness of this view is th e fact that we put a higher value on pleasure when it must be purchased at the price of great displeasure, than when it simply falls into our lap like a gift from heaven. When sufferi ngs and misery have toned down our desire and yet our aim is attained, then the pleasur e, in proportion to the remaining quantity of desire, is all the greater. And as I have shown (p. 235), this proportion represents the value of the pleasure. A further proof is given in the fact that all living beings (including man) seek satisfaction for their cravings as l ong as they are able to bear the opposing pain and agony. The struggle for existence is but a consequence of this fact. All existing life strives for fulfilment, and only that part give s up the fight in which the desire has been suffocated by the power of the assailing diffi culties. Each living being seeks food until lack of food destroys its li fe. Man, too, lays hands on himself only when he believes (rightly or wrongly) that he is not able to attain the aims in life which to him are worth while. As long as he still believes in the possibi lity of attaining what in his view is worth striving for, he will fight against all suffe ring and pain. Philosophy would first have to convince man that the element of will has sense only when the pleasure is greater than the displeasure, for it is man’s nature to strive to a ttain the objects of his de sire if he is able to bear the necessary displeasure involved, be it ever so great. The above mentioned philosophy would be mistaken, because it w ould make the human will dependent on a factor (surplus of pleasure over displeasure) which is f undamentally foreign to man’s nature. The actual yardstick for measuring will is desire, and the latter persists as long as it can. One can compare the calculation that is made in actual life, - not the one an abstract philosophy makes concerning the ques tion of pleasure and pain connected with the satisfaction of a desire - with the fo llowing. If when buying a certain quantity of apples, I am forced to take twice as many bad ones as good ones because the seller wants to clear his stock, then I shall not hesitate for one moment to accept the bad apples as well if the few good ones are worth so much to me that, in addition to their purchase price, I am also prepared to bear the expens e of disposing of the bad ones. This example illustrates the relation between the amounts of pleasure and displeasure that arise through an instinct. I determine the value of the good apples not by subtracting the sum of the good ones from that of the bad ones, but by whether the good ones retain any value for me despite the presence of the bad ones. Just as I leave the bad apples out of account in my enjoyment of the good ones, so I give myself up to the satisfaction of a desire after having shaken off the unavoidable pain. Even if pessimism were correct in its asse rtion that there is more displeasure than pleasure in the world, this would have no infl uence on the will, since living beings would still strive after what pleasure remains. Th e empirical proof that pain outweighs joy, if such proof could be given, would certainly be effective for showing the futility of the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"school of philosophy that sees the valu e of life in a surplus of pleasure (Eudaemonism).61 It would not, however, be suit able for showing that will in general is irrational, for will does not seek a surplus of pleasure, but seeks the amount of pleasure that remains after removing the displeasure. And this always appears as a goal worth striving for. Attempts have been made to refute pessi mism by asserting that it is impossible by calculation to determine the surplus of pleasure or of displeasure in the world. The possibility of any calculation depends on the co mparability of the things to be calculated in respect to their quantity. Every displeasure and every pl easure has a definite quantity (intensity and duration). Furthe r, we can compare pleasurable feelings of different kinds with one another, at least a pproximately, with regard to their quantity. We know whether we derive more pleasure from a good ciga r or from a good joke. No objection can be raised against the comparability of different kinds of pleasures and displeasures in respect to their quantity. The investigator who sets himself the task of determining the surplus of pleasure or displeasure in th e world, starts from presuppositions which are undeniably legitimate. One may declare the conclusions of pessimism to be mistaken, but one cannot doubt that quantities of pleasure and displeasur e can be scientifica lly estimated, and the balance of pleasure determined thereby. But it is incorrect to maintain that the result of this calculation has any consequence for the human will. The cases in which we really make the value of our activity dependent on whether pleasure or displeasure shows a surplus, are those in which the objects to ward which our activity is directed are indifferent to us. When it is only a question of whether after my work I am to amuse myself by a game or by light conversation, and if I am completely indifferent what I do for this purpose, I then ask myself: What give s me the greatest surplu s of pleasure? And I definitely refrain from an activity if the scal es incline toward the side of displeasure. When buying a toy for a child we would consider what will give him the greatest pleasure. In all other cases we are not dete rmined exclusively by c onsiderations of the balance of pleasure. Therefore, when pessimistic philosophers of et hics believe that by showing displeasure to be present in greater quantity than pleasure, they are preparing the way for selfless devotion toward cultural work, they do not rea lize that by its very nature the human will is not influenced by this knowledge. Human st riving directs itself to the measure of possible satisfaction after all di fficulties have been overcome. Hope of this satisfaction is the very foundation of human activity. The work of each individual and of the totality of cultural work springs from this hope. Pessimistic ethics believes that it must present the pursuit of happiness as an impossibility for ma n, in order that he may devote himself to his proper moral tasks. But these moral task s are nothing but the c oncrete natural and spiritual cravings, and their satisfaction is st riven for, despite the displeasure involved. The pursuit of happiness, which the pessimist wants to exterminate, does not exist at all. Rather, the tasks which man has to fulfil he fu lfils because from the depth of his being he wills to fulfil them when he has truly recogni zed their nature. Pessimistic ethics maintains that man can devote himself to what he recogn izes as his life’s task, only when he has given up the pursuit of pleasure. But there are no ethics that can i nvent life-tasks other than the realization of the sa tisfactions demanded by man’s de sires, and the fulfilment of"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"his moral ideals. No ethics can take from him the pleasure he has in the fulfilment of what he desires. When the pessimist says: Do not strive after pleasure, for you can never attain it, strive for what you recognize to be your task, then the answer is : It is inherent in human nature to do just this, and it is the i nvention of a philosophy gone astray when it is maintained that man strives only for happiness. He strives for the sati sfaction of what his being demands, and its fulfilment is his pleasure; he has in mind the concrete objects of this striving, not some abstract “happiness.” When pessimistic ethics demands: Strive not after pleasure, but after the attainment of wh at you recognize to be your life’s task, it lays its finger on the very thing that , through his own nature, man wants. He does not need to be turned inside out by philosophy, he does not need to discard his human nature before he can be moral. Morality lies in striving for an aim that has been recognized as justified; it lies in human nature to pursue it so long as the displeasure connected with it does not extinguish the desire for it altogether. And this is the nature of all real will. Ethics does not depend on the extermination of all strivi ng after pleasure in order that bloodless abstract ideas can set up thei r control where they are not opposed by a strong longing for enjoyment of life; ethics depe nds rather on that strength wi ll has when it is carried by ideal intuitions; it achieve s its aim even though the path be full of thorns. Moral ideals spring from the moral imagina tion of man. Their atta inment depends upon whether his desire for them is strong enough to overcome pain and suffering. They are his intuitions, the driving forces spanned by his sp irit; he wills them, because their attainment is his highest pleasure. He needs no ethics fi rst to forbid him to strive for pleasure and then to prescribe to him what he ought to stri ve for. Of himself, he will strive for moral ideals when his moral imaginati on is active enough to impart to him intuitions that give strength to his will and enable him to carry them through, despite the obstacles present in his own organization, to which nece ssary displeasure also belongs. If a man strives for sublimely great ideals, it is because they are the content of his own nature and their realization will bring him a joy compared with which the pleasure, derived from the satisfaction of their ordinary cravings by those who lack ideals, is of little significance. Idealists revel spirituall y in translating their ideals into reality. Anyone who wants to exterminate the pleasure in the fulfilment of human desires will first have to make man a slave who acts, not because he wants to, but only because he ought to. For the attainment of what has b een willed gives pleasure. What we call goodness is not what a man ought but what he wills to do when he unfolds the fulness of his true human nature. Anyone who does not acknowledge this must first drive out of man all that man himself wills, and then prescr ibe to him from outside what content he is to give his will. Man values the fulfilment of a desire because the desire springs from his own nature. Achievement has its value because it has been wi lled. If one denies value to the aims of man’s own will, then worth wh ile aims must be taken from something that man does not will."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Ethics based on pessimism arises from a di sregard for moral imagination. Only someone who considers the individual human ego incap able of giving a cont ent to its striving would see the totality of w ill as a longing for pleasure. A man without imagination creates no moral ideas. They must be given to him. Physical nature sees to it that he strives to satisfy his lower desires. But to the development of the whole man belong also desires that arise from the spirit. Only if one takes the view that ma n has no such spiritual desires can one maintain that he should rece ive them from outside. And then it would also be justifiable to say that it is man’s dut y to do what he does not will. All ethics which demand of man that he should suppress his will in order to fulfil tasks that he does not will, reckon not with the whole man, but with one in whom the faculty of spiritual desire is lacking. For a man who is harmoniously de veloped, the so-called ideas of what is “right” are not outside but within the sphe re of his own nature. Moral action does not consist in extermination of one-sided self-w ill, but in the full development of human nature. One considering moral id eals to be attainable only if man exterminates his own will, does not know that these ideals are willed by man just as much as the satisfaction of so-called animal instincts. It cannot be denied that th e views outlined here can easil y be misunderstood. Immature persons without moral imagination like to look upon the instincts of their undeveloped natures as the full content of humanity, and to reject all moral ideas which they have not produced, in order that they may “live them selves out” without restriction. But it is obvious that what holds good for a fully deve loped human being does not apply to one who is only half-developed. On e who still has to be brought by education to the point where his moral nature breaks through the she ll of his lower passions, cannot lay claim to what applies to a man who is mature. Here there is no intention to outline what an undeveloped man requires to be taught, but ra ther to show what human nature includes when it has come to full maturity. For this is also to prove the po ssibility of freedom, which manifests itself, not in actions done unde r constraint of body or soul, but in actions sustained by spiritual intuitions. The fully mature man gives himself his value. He neither strives for pleasure, which is given to him as a gift of grace either from na ture or from the Creator, nor does he merely fulfil what he recognizes as ab stract duty after he has divest ed himself of the desire for pleasure. He does what he wants to do, that is, he acts in accordance with his ethical intuitions, and in the attainment of what he wants he feels the true enjoyment of life. He determines life’s value by the ratio between wh at he attains and what he attempts. Ethics which puts “you ought” in the place of “I w ill,” mere duty in the place of inclination, determines man’s value by the ratio between what duty demands of him and what he fulfils. It applies a standard to man that is not applicable to his nature. - The view developed here refers man back to himself. It recognizes as the tr ue value of life only what each individual himself regards as such according to what he desires. This view accepts neither a value of life not recognized by the individual, nor a purpose of life which has not sprung from the individual. In th e individual who is cap able of true self knowledge it recognizes someone who is hi s own master and the assessor of his own value."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Addition to the Revised Edition, 1918. What is presented in this chapter can be misunderstood if one clings to the apparent ob jection that the will is simply the irrational factor in man and that this must be proved to him because then he will realize that his ethical striving must consist in working towa rd ultimate emancipation from the will. An apparent objection of this kind was brought ag ainst me by a competent critic who stated that it is the business of the philosopher to make good what the thoughtlessness of animals and most men fail to do, namely, to strike a proper balance in life’s account. But in making this objection he does not recognize the real issue: If freedom is to be attained, then the will in human nature must be carried by intuitive thinking; at the same time it is true that an impulse of will may also be de termined by factors othe r than intuition, but morality and its worth can be found only in the free realization of in tuitions flowing from the nature of true manhood. Ethical individualis m is well able to present morality in its full dignity, for it is not of the opinion that the trul y moral is brought about by conforming to an external rule, but is only what comes about through man when he develops his moral will as a member of his total being, so that to do what is immoral appears to him as a stunting and crippling of his nature. INDIVIDUALITY AND SPECIES The view that it is inherent in man to develop into an independent, free individuality seems to be contradicted by two facts: that he exists as a member within a natural totality (race, tribe, nation, family, male or female se x) and that he is active within a totality (state, church, etc.). He show s the general characteristics of the community to which he belongs, and he gives his deeds a content that is determined by the place he occupies within a plurality. Is individuality possible nevert heless? Can we regard man as a totality in himself when he grows out of a totality and inte grates himself into a totality? The characteristic features and functions of the individual parts be longing to a whole are determined by the whole. A tribe is such a whole, and all the human beings comprising it have characteristic features which are conditi oned by the nature of the tribe itself. How the individual member is constituted and hi s actions will be determined by the character of the tribe. This is why the physiognomy and activity of the individual will express something generic. If we ask why some particul ar thing about him is like this or that, we are referred beyond the nature of the individual to the species. The species explains why something about the individual appears as it does. But man makes himself free from what is generic. For the generic qualities of the human race, when rightly experienced by the indivi dual do not restrict his freedom, and ought not to be made to restrict it by artificial m eans. Man develops qualities and activities, the sources of which we can seek only in himsel f. In this, the generic element serves him only as a medium through which to express hi s own particular bei ng. The characteristic features that nature has given him he uses as a foundation, giving them the form that"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"corresponds to his own being. We shall look in vain among the laws of the species for the reason for an expression of this being. Here we have to do with something individual which can be explained only through itself. If a person has advanced so far as to loosen himself from the generic, and we still atte mpt to explain everythi ng about him from the character of the species, then we have no sense for what is individual. It is impossible to understand a human being co mpletely if one’s judgment is based on a concept of the species. The tendency to judge according to species is most persistent where the differences of sex are concerne d. Man sees in woman, and woman in man, nearly always too much of the general char acter of the other sex, and too little of the individual. In practical life this harms me n less than women. The social position of women is often so unworthy because in many respects it is not determined, as it should be, by the individual qualitie s of the particular woman herself, but by general representations of what is considered the na tural task and needs of woman. Man’s activity in life comes about through the individual’s cap acities and inclinations, whereas woman’s tends to be determined exclusively by the fact that she is a woman. Woman is supposed to be the slave of her species, of womanhood in general. As long as men continue to debate whether according to her “natural disposition” woman is suited to this or that profession, the so-called woman’s question cannot advance beyond the most elementary stage. What woman is capable of in terms of her own nature, woman mu st be left to judge for herself. If it is true that women are usef ul only in those occupations they occupy at present, then they will hardly have it in themselves to atta in anything else. But they must be allowed to decide for themselves what is in accordance with their nature. The reply to him who fears an upheaval of our social cond itions as a result of accepting woman, not as an example of her species but as an individua l, would be that social conditions, in which the status of one-half of humanity is below the dignity of man, are ind eed in great need of improvement. [footnote: Immediately upon the pu blication of this book (1894) I met with the objections to the above arguments that, already now, w ithin the character of her sex, a woman is able to shape her life as indi vidually as she likes, and far more freely than a man who is already de-individualized, first by school, and later by war and profession. I am aware that this objection will be urged today, perh aps even more strongly. Nonetheless, I feel bound to let my sentences stand, and must hope that there are readers who also recognize how utterly such an objection goes against the concept of freedom de veloped in this book and will judge my sentences above by anothe r standard than that of man’s loss of individuality through sc hool and profession.] One judging human beings according to their gene ric qualities stops short just at the very frontier beyond which they begin to be be ings whose activity depends on free self- assessment. What lies below this frontier can naturally be the object of scientific study. Thus the characteristics of race, tribe, nati on and sex are subjects of special sciences. Only men who wanted to live simply as exam ples of the species could possibly fit the general picture of man these sc ientific studies produce. All these sciences are unable to reach the particular content of the individua l. Where the sphere of freedom (in thinking and doing) begins, there the possibility of determining the individual according to the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"laws of the species ceases. The conceptual content which man, through thinking, must bring into connection with perception in orde r to take hold of full reality (cp. p. 105 ff.), no one can fix once for all and hand over to mankind ready-made. The individual must gain his concepts through hi s own intuition. How the indivi dual has to think, cannot be deduced from any concept of a species; this depends singly and solely on the individual himself. Just as little is it possible from general human qualities to decide what concrete aims an individual will set himself. One wi shing to understand a particular individual must broaden his understanding to encompass th e essential nature of the other, and not stop short at those qualities which are typical. In this sense every single human being is a problem. And every science which deals with ab stract thoughts and concepts of species is only a preparation for that insight which becomes ours when a human individuality shares with us his way of looking at the world, and that other insight which we obtain from the content of his will. Whenever we feel: here we have to do with that in a man which is free from the typical way of thinking and free from a will based on the species, there we must cease to make use of any concep ts that apply to our own I if we want to understand him. Cognition consists in comb ining the concept with the perception by means of thinking. In the case of all other ob jects the observer must gain his concepts through his own intuition; when it is a case of understand ing a free individuality, the essential thing is to receive into our own I those concepts by which the free individuality determines himself, in their pure form (w ithout mixing them with our own conceptual content). People who immediately mingle thei r own concepts with every judgment of another, can never reach an understanding of an individuality. Just as a free individuality frees himself from the characteristics of th e species, so our cognition must become free from the means by which all that belongs to species is understood. Only to the degree that a man has made hi mself free from the characteristics of the species in the way indicated, can he be cons idered to be a free spirit within a human community. No man is all spec ies, none is all individua lity. But every human being gradually frees a greater or lesser part of his being from the animal-like life of the species, as well as from the commands of human authorities ruling him. With that part of his being for which a man is unable to achieve such freedom, he is a member of the natural and spiritual organism of the world in general. In this respect he does what he sees others do, or as they co mmand. Only that part of his activity which springs from his intuitions has ethical value in the true sense. A nd those moral instincts that he has in him through the inheritance of social instincts become something ethical through his taking them over into his intui tions. All moral activity of mankind has its source in individual ethical intuitions and their acceptance by human communities. One could also say: The moral life of mankind is the sum-total of the products of the moral imagination of free human individuals. This is the conclusion of monism. THE CONSEQUENCES OF MONISM"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"What is here called monism, this unitary e xplanation of the world, derives from human experience62 the principles it uses for explai ning the world. The source of activity also is sought within the world to be observed, that is, in human nature accessible to self- knowledge, more particularly in moral imaginat ion. Monism refuses to seek the origin of the world accessible to perceiving and thi nking, outside of that world, by means of abstract conclusions. For monism, the unity that thinking observation - which can be experienced - brings to the manifold plurality of perceptions is, at the same time, just what the human need for knowledge demands, and by means of which entry into physical and spiritual realms is sought. One looking for another unity behind the one sought by thinking observation, thereby shows only th at he does not recognize the agreement between what is found by thinking and what the urge for knowledge demands. The single human individual actually is not separated from the universe. He is part of it, and the connection of this part with th e rest of the cosmos is presen t in reality; it is broken only for our perception. At first we see this part as a being existing by itself because we do not see the cords and ropes by whic h the fundamental forces of the cosmos sustain our life. One remaining at this standpoi nt sees the part of the w hole as a truly independently existing being, as a monad, who somehow receives information about the rest of the world from outside. But monism, as meant he re, shows that one can believe in this independence only so long as what is perc eived is not woven by thinking into the network of the world of concepts. When this happens, separate existence of parts is revealed as a mere appearance due to perc eiving. Man can find hi s self-enclosed total existence within the universe only through th e intuitive experience of thinking. Thinking destroys the appearance due to perceiving, inserting our indi vidual existence into the life of the cosmos. The unity of the world of concepts, which contains the objective perceptions, also embraces the content of our subjective personality. Thinking shows us reality in its true characte r as a self-enclosed unity, whereas the manifoldness of perceptions is only its appearance dete rmined by our organization. (cp. p. 105 ff.). Recognition of the reality in contrast to the appearance resulting from perceiving has always been the goal of human thinking. Scie nce has striven to r ecognize perceptions as realities by discovering the laws that connect them. But where the view was held that connections ascertained by huma n thinking had only a subject ive significance, the real reason for the unity of things was sought in some entity existing beyond the world to be experienced (an inferred God, will, absolute Spir it, etc.). And on this basis, in addition to knowledge of the connections that are recognizable through experience, one strove to attain a second kind of knowledge which w ould go beyond experience and would reveal the connection between experience and the ultimate entities exis ting beyond experience (metaphysics arrived at by drawing conclu sions and not by expe rience). From this standpoint, it was thought that the reason we can grasp the co nnection of things through strictly applied thinking is that an original creator built up the world according to logical laws, and the source of our deeds was thought to be contained in the will of the creator. It was not realized that thinking encompasse s both subjective and objective in one grasp, and that in the union of percep tion with concept full reality is mediated. Only as long as we consider in the abstract form of c oncepts the laws pervading and determining perceptions, do we deal in act ual fact with something purel y subjective. But the content of the concept, which is attained - with th e help of thinking - in order to add it to perception, is not subjective. This content is not derived from the s ubject but from reality."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"It is that part of reality that our perc eiving cannot reach. It is experience, but not experience mediated through perceiving. One unable to recognize that the concept is something real, thinks of it only in that ab stract form in which he grasps it in his consciousness. But this separation is due to our organization, just as the separateness of perceptions is due to our organization. The tr ee that one perceives, has no existence by itself. It is only a part of the great organism of nature, and its existence is possible only in a real connection with nature. An abstract con cept has no reality in it self, any more than a perception, taken by itself, has any reality. The perception is the part of reality that is given objectively, the concept is the part that is given subj ectively (through intuition, cp. p. 113 ff.). Our spiritual organization tears re ality into these two factors. One factor appears to perception, the other to intuiti on. Only the union of the two, that is, the perception fitted systematically into the univers e, is full reality. If we consider the mere perception by itself, we do not have reality, but a disconnected chaos; if we consider by itself the law that connects perceptions, we ar e dealing with mere ab stract concepts. The abstract concept does not contain realit y, but thinking observa tion which considers neither concept nor perception one-s idedly, but the union of both, does. Not even the most subjective orthodox idealist will deny that we live w ithin a reality (that we are rooted in it with our real existence) . He only questions whether we also reach ideally, i.e., in our cognition, what we actua lly experience. By contrast, monism shows that thinking is neither subj ective nor objective, but is a pr inciple embracing both sides of reality. When we observe with thinking, we carry out a process that in itself belongs in the sequence of real occurrences. By means of thinking we overcome - within experience itself - the one-sidedness of mere perceiving. We are not able through abstract conceptual hypotheses (through pure conceptual reflection) to devise the na ture of reality, but when we find the ideas that belong to the percepti ons we live within r eality. The monist does not try to add something to our experience th at cannot be experienced (a Beyond), but in concept and perception sees th e real. He does not spin meta physics out of mere abstract concepts; he sees in the concept, as such, onl y one side of reality, namely, that side which remains hidden from perceiving but having meaning only in union with perceptions. Monism calls forth in man the conviction that he lives in a world of reality and does not have to go beyond this world for a higher real ity that cannot be experienced. The monist does not look for Absolute Reality anywhere but in experience, because he recognizes that the content of experience is the reality. And he is satisfi ed by this reality, because he knows that thinking has the power to guarant ee it. What dualism looks for only behind the world of observation, monism finds within it. Monism shows that in our cognition we grasp reality, not in a subjective image which slips in between man and reality, but in its true nature. For monism the c onceptual content of the world is the same for every human individual (cp. p. 128 ff.). According to m onistic principles, the reason one human individual regards another as akin to himself is because it is the same world content that expresses itself in the other also. In the unitary world of concepts there are not as many concepts of lions as there are individuals who think of a lion, but only one concept, lion. And the concept which “A” adds to his percep tion of a lion is the same concept as “B” adds to his, only apprehended by a different perceiving subject (cp. p. 107)· Thinking leads all perceiving subjects to the common id eal unity of all multiplicity. The one world of ideas expresses itself in them as in a multiplicity of individuals. As long as man"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"apprehends himself merely by means of se lf-perception, he regards himself as this particular human being; as soon as he looks toward the idea-world that lights up within him and embraces all particulars, he sees abso lute reality living and shining forth within him. Dualism defines the divine primordial Be ing as pervading and living in all men. Monism sees this common divine life in realit y itself. The ideal content of another human being is also my content, and I regard it as a different conten t only so long as I perceive, but no longer when I think. In his thinking each man embraces only a part of the total idea-world, and to that extent individuals differ one from anot her by the actual content of their thinking. But these contents are within one self-enclosed whole, which encompasses the content of all men’s thinking. In his th inking therefore, man takes hold of the universal primordial Being pervading all humanity. A life within reality filled with the content of thought is at the same time a life within God. The merely inferred, not to be experienced Beyond is based on a misunderstandi ng on the part of those who believe that the world in which we live does not contai n within itself the cause and reason for its existence. They do not recognize that thr ough thinking they find what they need to explain the perceptions. This is also why no speculation has ever brought to light any content that has not been borrowed from the reality that is given us. The God that is assumed through abstract conclusions is nothi ng but a human being tr ansplanted into the Beyond; Schopenhauer’s will is the power of human will made absolute. Hartmann’s unconscious primordial Being, composed of idea and will, is a combination of two abstractions drawn from experi ence. Exactly the same is true of all other transcendent principles that are not based on thinking which is experienced. In truth, the human spirit never goes beyond the r eality in which we live, nor is there any need to do so, since everything we require in order to expl ain the world is within the world. If philosophers eventually declare that they are satisfi ed when they have deduced the world from principles they borrow from experience and transplant into an hypothetical Beyond, then the same satisfaction must also be possible, if the borrowed content is allowed to remain in this worl d where, for thinking to be experienced, it belongs. All attempts to transcend the wo rld are purely illusory, and the principles transplanted from this world into the Be yond do not explain the world any better than those within it. And thinking, properl y understood, does not demand any such transcendence at all, because a thought-content can seek a pe rceptual content, together with which it forms a reality only within the world, not outside it. The objects of imagination, too, are contents which are valid only if they become representations that refer to a perceptual content. Through this pe rceptual content they become part of reality. A concept that is supposed to be filled with a content from beyond the world given us, is an abstraction to which no reality corresponds . We can think out only concepts of reality; in order actually to find reality itself, we must also perceive . An absolute Being for which a content is devised is an impossible assu mption when thinking is properly understood. The monist does not deny the ideal; in fact he considers a perceptual content, lacking its ideal counterpart, not to be a complete rea lity; but in the whole sphere of thinking he finds nothing that could make it necessary to deny the objective spiritual reality of thinking and therefore leave the realm whic h thinking can experience. Monism regards science that limits itself to a description of perceptions without penetrating to their ideal complements, as being incomplete. But it re gards as equally incomplete all abstract"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"concepts that do not find their complement s in perceptions and nowhere fit into the network of concepts embracing the world to be observed. Theref ore it can acknowledge no ideas that refer to objec tive factors lying beyond our experience, which are supposed to form the content of pure ly hypothetical metaphysics. A ll ideas of this kind which humanity has produced, monism recognizes as abstractions borrowed from experience; it is simply that the fact of the borrowing has been overlooked. Just as little, according to monistic principl es, could the aims of our action be derived from a Beyond outside mankind. Insofar as they are thought, they must originate from human intuition. Man does not make the purposes of an objective (existing beyond) primordial Being into his ow n individual purposes; he pursu es his own, given him by his moral imagination. The idea that realizes itsel f in a deed, man detaches from the unitary idea-world, making it the foundation of his will. Consequently, what come to expression in his action are not commands projected from a Beyond into the world, but human intuitions that are within the world. For monism acknowledges no world ruler who sets our aims and directs our activity from out side. Man will find no such foundation of existence, whose decisions he must fathom in order to discover the aims toward which he is to guide his activity. He is referred back to himself. He himself mu st give content to his activity. If he seeks for the determining causes of his will outside the world in which he lives, then his search will be in vain. When he goes beyond the satisf action of his natural instincts, for which Mother Nature has provide d, then he must seek these causes in his own moral imagination, unless he finds it more convenient to let himself be determined by the moral imagination of others. This means: either he must give up being active altogether, or must act according to determin ations he gives himself out of his world of ideas, or which others give him from that world. When he gets beyond his bodily life of instincts, and beyond carrying ou t the commands of others, then he is determined by nothing but himself. He must act according to an impul se produced by himself and determined by nothing else. This impulse is inde ed determined ideally in the unitary idea world, but in actual fact it is only through man that it can be taken from that world and translated into reality. The reason for the actu al translation of an idea into reality through man, monism finds only in man himself. For idea to become deed, man must first will before it can happen. Such will then has its foundation only in man himself. Therefore ultimately it is man who determines his own deed. He is free. 1st Addition to the Revised Edition, 1918. In th e second part of this book the attempt has been made to give proof that freedom (spiritu al activity) is to be found in the reality of human deeds. To do this it was necessary to separate from the total sphere of human deeds those actions that can be deemed free by unbiased self-obser vation. They are the deeds which prove to be the realization of ideal intuitions. No other deeds, if considered without prejudice, can be regarded as free. But unbiased self-observation will lead man to recognize that it is inherent in his nature to progress along the path toward ethical intuitions and their re alization. Yet this unpr ejudiced observation of man’s ethical nature cannot arrive at an ultimate conclusion about freedom by itself. For if intuitive thinking had its source in some other being, if its bei ng were not such as had its origin in itself, then the consciousness of freedom, which spri ngs from morality, would prove to be an illusion. But the second part of this book finds its natural support in the first part, where"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"intuitive thinking is presented as an inner, spiritual activit y of man, which is experienced. To understand this nature of th inking in living expe rience is at the same time to recognize the freedom of intuitive thinking. And if one knows that this thinking is free, then one also recognizes that sphere of the will to which freedom can be ascribed. Acting human beings will consider that will as free to which the intuitive life in thinking, on the basis of inner experience, can attribute a self-sustain ing essence. One unable to do this cannot discover any altogether indisputable ar gument for the acceptance of freedom. The experience which is referred to here finds in tuitive thinking in consciousness, which has reality not only in consciousness. And ther eby it is discovered that freedom is the characteristic feature of all deeds that have their source in the intuitions of consciousness. 2nd Addition to the Revised Edition, 1918. The content of this book is built upon intuitive thinking, of which th e experience is purely spir itual, and through which, in cognition, every single perception is placed w ithin reality. This book intends to present no more than can be surveyed through the experience of intuitive thinking. But it also intends to present the kind of thought whic h this experienced th inking requires. It requires that in the process of knowledge thin king is not denied as a self-dependent experience. It requires that one does not de ny its ability to experience reality in union with perceptions, instead of looking for real ity only in a world lying outside this experience, an inferred world in relation to which the human activity of thinking would be something merely subjective. - This characterizes thinking as the element th rough which man gradually enters spiritually into reality. (It ought not to be possible to confuse this world view, based on experienced thinking, with a mere rationalism.) On the other hand, it should be evident from the whole spirit of this presentation that fo r human knowledge, the perceptual element contains a reality-content only if it is grasped by thinking. Wh at characterizes reality as reality cannot lie outside thin king. Therefore it must not be imagined that the physical kind of perceiving guarantees th e only reality. What comes to meet us as perception is something man must simply expect on his life journey. All he can ask is: Is one justified in expecting, from the point of view resul ting from the intuitively experienced thinking, that it is possible for man to perceive not only physically but also spiritually? This can be expected. For even though on the one hand intu itively experienced thinking is an active process taking place in the human spirit, on the other hand it is also spiritual perception grasped without a physical organ. It is a pe rception in which the perceiver is himself active, and it is an activity of the self which is also perceived. In intuitively experienced thinking man is transferred into a spiritual wo rld as perceiver. What comes to meet him as perceptions within this world in the sa me way as the spiritu al world of his own thinking comes to meet him, man recognizes as a world of spiritual perception. This world of perception has the same relations hip to thinking as the world of physical perception has on the physical side. When man experiences the world of spiritual perception it will not appear foreign to him, because in intuitive thinking he already has an experience which is of a purely spiritua l character. A number of my writings which have been published since this book first appe ared, deal with such a world of spiritual perception. The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity lays th e philosophical foundation for these later writings. For here th e aim is to show that a properly understood experience of"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"thinking is already an experience of spirit. For this reason it a ppears to the author that one able in all earnestness to en ter into the point of view of The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity will not come to a sta ndstill at the entry into the wo rld of spiritual perception. It is true that by drawing conclusions from th e content of this book it is not possible to derive logically what is pres ented in my later books. But fr om a living grasp of what in this book is meant by intuitive thinking, the fu rther step will result quite naturally: the actual entry into the world of spiritual perception. FIRST APPENDIX (Addition to the Revised Edition of 1918) Various objections brought forward by philoso phers immediately after this book was first published induce me to add the following brie f statement to this revised edition. I can well understand that there are readers for whom the rest of the book is of interest, but who will regard the following as superfluous , as a remote and abstract spinning of thoughts. They may well leave this short description unread. However, problems arise within philosophical world views which originate in certain prej udices on the part of the philosophers, rather than in th e natural sequence of human th inking in general. What has so far been dealt with here appears to me to be a task that confronts every human being who is striving for clarity about man’s bei ng and his relationship to the world. What follows, however, is rather a problem wh ich certain philosophers demand should be considered when such questions are under di scussion as those dealt with here, because through their whole way of thinking, they have created difficulties which do not otherwise exist. If one simply ignores su ch problems, certain people will soon come forward with accusations of dilettantism and so on. And the opinion arises that the author of a discussion such as this book contains ha s not thought out his position in regard to those views he does not mention in the book. The problem to which I refer is this: There are thinkers who are of the opinion that a particular difficulty exists when it is a que stion of understanding how the soul life of another person can affect one’s own (the so ul life of the observer). They say: My conscious world is enclosed within me; the c onscious world of another person likewise is enclosed within him. I cannot see into the world of another’s cons ciousness. How, then, do I come to know that we share the same world? A world view which considers that from a conscious sphere it is possible to dr aw conclusions about an unconscious sphere that can never become conscious, attempts to solve this difficulty in the following way. This world view says: The content of my cons ciousness is only a representative of a real world which I cannot consciously reach. In th at real world lies th e unknown cause of the content of my consciousness. In that world is also my real being, of which likewise I have in my consciousness only a representative. And in it exists also th e being of the other person who confronts me. What is experienced consciously by him has its corresponding reality in his real being, i ndependent of his consciousness. This reality reacts on my fundamental but unconscious being in the sphe re that cannot become conscious, and in this way a representative that is quite independent of my conscious experience is produced in my consciousness. One sees here that to the sphere accessible to my"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"consciousness, hypothetically is added anothe r sphere, inaccessible to my consciousness, and this is done because it is believed that we would otherwise be forced to maintain that the whole external world which seems to confront me is only a world of my consciousness, and this would result in the – so lipsistic -absurdity that the other persons also exist only in my consciousness. It is possible to attain clarity about this problem, which has been created by several of the more recent approaches to a theory of knowle dge, if one endeavors to survey the matter from the point of view that observes facts in accordance with their spiritual aspect, as presented in this book. To begin with, what do I have before me when I confront another personality? Let us consider what the very first impression is. The first impression is the physical, bodily appearance of the other pers on, given me as perception, then the audible perception of what he is saying, and so on. I do not merely stare at all this; it sets my thinking activity in motion. To the extent that I confront the other personality with my thinking, the perceptions become transparent to my soul. To the extent that I grasp the perceptions in thinking, I am oblig ed to say that they are not at all what they appear to be to the external senses. Within the perceptions as they appear directly to the senses something else is revealed, namely what they are indirectly. The f act that I bring them before me means at the same time their extin ction as mere appearances to the senses. But what, in their extinction, they bring to revela tion, this, for the duration of its effect on me, forces me - as a thinking being - to extinguish my own thinking and to put in its place the thinking of what is revealed. And this thinki ng I grasp as an experience that is like the experience of my own thinking. I have really perceived the thinking of the other. For the direct perceptions, which extinguish themselves as appearances to the senses, are grasped by my thinking, and this is a process th at takes place completely within my consciousness; it consists in th e fact that the thinking of th e other takes the place of my thinking. The division between the two spheres of consciousness is ac tually cancelled out through the extinction of the appearances to the senses. In my consciousness this expresses itself in the fact that in experien cing the content of the other’s consciousness I am aware of my own consciousness as little as I am aware of it in dreamless sleep. Just as my day-consciousness is excluded in dreamless sleep, so in the perceiving of the foreign content of consciousness, the content of my own is exclude d. There are two reasons why one tends to be deluded about these facts; one is that in perceiving the other person, the extinction of the content of one’s own cons ciousness is replaced not by unconsciousness as in sleep, but by the content of the other’ s consciousness; the othe r reason is that the alternation between extinction and re-app earance of self-consci ousness occurs too quickly to be noticed in ordinary life. - This whole problem cannot be solved by an artificial construction of c oncepts which draws conclusions from what is conscious to what can never become conscious, but by actua l experience of what occurs in the union of thinking with perception. Instances like the ab ove often occur in regard to many problems which appear in philo sophical literature. Thinkers should seek the path to unprejudiced observation in accordance with facts, both physical and spiritual, but instead they erect an artificial construction of concepts, inserting this between themselves and reality."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Eduard von Hartmann, in an essay63 include s my Philosophy of Spiritual Activity among philosophical works which are based on “episte mological monism.” And this theory is rejected by him as one that cannot even be c onsidered. The reason for this is as follows. According to the viewpoint expressed in th e essay mentioned above, only three possible epistemological standpoints ex ist. The first is when a person remains at the naive standpoint and takes perceived phenomena to be realities existi ng outside of human consciousness. In this case crit ical insight is lacking. It is not recognized that after all one remains with the content of one’s consciousness merely within one’s own consciousness. It is not realized that one is not dealing with a “table-in-it self” but only with the object of one’s own consciousness. One remaining at th is standpoint, or returning to it for any reason, is a naive realist. However, this sta ndpoint is impossible, fo r it overlooks the fact that consciousness has no other object than its elf. The second standpoint is when all this is recognized and is taken into account fully. Then to begin with, one becomes a transcendental idealist. As tr anscendental idealist one has to give up hope that anything from a “thing-in-itself” could ever reach human consciousness . And if one is consistent, then it is impossible not to b ecome an absolute illusionist. For the world one confronts is transformed into a mere sum of objects of consciousness, and indeed only objects of one’s own consciousness. One is forced to thi nk of other people too - absurd though it is - as being present only as the content of one’s own consciousness. According to von Hartmann the only possible standpoi nt is the third one, transce ndental realism. This view assumes that “things-in-themselves” exist, but our consciousness cannot have direct experience of them in any way. Beyond human consciousness - in a way that remains unconscious - they are said to cause object s of consciousness to appear in human consciousness. All we can do is to draw conc lusions about these “things-in-themselves’ ‘ from the merely represented content of our consciousness which we experience. In the essay mentioned above, Eduard von Hartmann maintains that “epistemological monism” - and this he considers my standpoint to be - w ould in reality have to confess to one of the three standpoints just mentioned; this is not done, because the epistemological monist does not draw the actual conclusion of his presuppositions. The essay goes on to say: “If one wants to find out what position a supposed monist occupies in regard to a theory of knowledge, it is only necessary to ask him cer tain questions and compel him to answer them. Voluntarily he will not give any opini on on these points, and he will go to any length to avoid answering direct questions on them, because each answer will show that as a monist his claim to belong to some othe r standpoint than one of the above three, in relation to a theory of knowledge , is out of the question. Thes e questions are as follows: 1) Are things continuous or intermittent in th eir existence? If the answer is: They are continuous, then we are dealing with one form or another of naive realism. If the answer is: They are intermittent, then we have trans cendental idealism. But if the answer is: They are on the one hand continuous (as cont ent of the absolute consciousness, or as unconscious representations, or existing as possi bilities of perceptions), on the other hand they are intermittent (as content of limited consciousness), then we recognize transcendental realism. - 2) If three persons sit at a table, how many examples of the table are present? He who answers: One, is a na ive realist; he who answers: Three, is a transcendental idealist; but he who answers: Fo ur, is a transcendental realist. This last answer does indeed presuppose that it is legitimate to put under the one heading,"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"’examples of the table’ something so dissimilar as the one table as thing-in-itself, and the three tables as perceptual obj ects in the three consciousne sses. Whoever finds this too much will have to answer ‘one and three’ inst ead of ‘four.’ - 3) If two persons are in a room by themselves, how many examples of th ese persons are present? One answering: Two, is a naive realist; one answering: Four (namely, one ‘I’ and one ‘other’ in each of the two consciousnesses), is a transcendental idealist; but one an swering: Six (namely, two persons as ‘things-in-themselves’ and four objects of representati on of persons in the two consciousnesses), is a transcendental realist. One wish ing to prove that epistemological monism is a different standpoin t from any of these th ree, would have to answer each of the above questions differen tly, and I cannot imagine what such answers could be.” The answers of The Philosophy of Spiritual Acti vity would be: 1) He who only grasps the perceptual content: and takes this to be the r eality, is a naive realist; he does not make it clear to himself that he can actually regard the perceptual content as enduring only so long as he is looking at it and he must, ther efore, think of what he has before him as intermittent. However, as soon as he reali zes that reality is present only when the perceptual content is permeated by thought, he reaches the insight that the perceptual content that comes to meet him as intermitte nt, is revealed as continuous when it is permeated with what thinking elaborates. Ther efore: the perceptual content, grasped by a thinking that is also experienced, is continuous , whereas what is only perceived must be thought of as intermittent - that is, if it were real, which is not the case. - 2) When three persons are sitting at a table, how many exampl es of the table are present? One table only is present; but as long as the three persons remain at their perceptual pictures they will have to say: These perceptual pictures are no reality at all. And as soon as they pass over to the table as grasped in their thinking, there is revealed to them the one reality of the table; with their three contents of consciousness they are uni ted in this one reality. - 3) When two persons are in a room by themselv es, how many examples of these persons are present? There are most definitely not six ex amples present - not even in the sense of transcendental realism - there are two. Only to begin with, each of the two persons has merely the unreal perceptual-pic ture of himself as well as that of the other person. Of these pictures there are four, and the result of their presence in the th inking-activity of the two persons is that reality is grasped. In their thinking-activity eac h of the persons goes beyond the sphere of his own consciousness; wi thin each of them lives the sphere of the other person’s consciousness, as well as hi s own. At moments when this merging takes place, the persons are as little confined within their own consciousness as they are in sleep. But the next moment, consciousness of the merging with the other person returns, so that the consciousness of each person - in his experience of thinking - grasps himself and the other. I know that the transcendental re alist describes this as a relapse into naive realism. But then I have already pointed out in this book that naiv e realism retains its justification when applied to a thinking that is experienced. The transcendental realist does not enter into the actual facts concerne d in the process of knowledge; he excludes himself from them by the network of thought s in which he gets entangled. Also, the monism which is presented in the Philosophy of Spiritual Activity should not be called “epistemological,” but rather, if a name is wa nted, a monism of thought. All this has been misunderstood by Eduard von Hartmann. He did not enter into the spec ific points raised"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"in the Philosophy of Spiritual Activity, but ma intained that I had made an attempt to combine Hegel’s universalistic panlogi sm64 with Hume’s65 individualistic phenomenalism66 whereas in actual fact the Philosophy of Spiritual Activity has no similarity with these two view s it is supposed to combine. (This is also the reason I did not feel inclined to compare my view with the “epistemological monism” of Johannes Rehmke,67 for example. In fact, the viewpoint of the Philosophy of Spiritual Activity is utterly different from what Eduard von Hartmann and ot hers call epistemological monism.) SECOND APPENDIX In this Appendix is repeated, in all essentials , what served as a kind of “Foreword” to the first edition of this book (1894). In this ed ition I place it as an appendix because it conveys the kind of thoughts that occupied me when I wrote the book twenty-five years ago, rather than having any direct bearing on the content. It is not possible to omit it altogether, since the opinion crops up, again and again, that because of my writings on the science of the spirit, I have to suppress some of my earlier writings. [footnote: Only the very first opening sentences (i n the first edition) are left out here, because to-day they seem to me to be quite irrelevant; whereas to say the rest seems to me as necessary to-day as it did then, despite the preval ent scientific trend of thought, and in fact just because of it.] Our age is one in which truth must be sought in the depths of human nature. Of Schiller’s two well-known paths, it will be the sec ond that most appeals to modern man: “Truth seek we both - Thou in th e life without thee and around; I in the heart within. By both can Truth alike be found. The healthy eye can through the wo rld the great Creator track; The healthy heart is but the gl ass which gives Creation back.” “Wahrheit suchen wir beide, du aussen im Leben, ich innen In dem Herren, und so findet sie jeder gewiss. Ist das Auge gesund, so bege gnet es aussen dam Schöpfer; Ist es das Herz, dann gewiss sp iegelt es innen die Welt.”"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"(transl. by E. Bulwer Lytton) A truth which comes to us from outside always bears the stamp of un certainty. Only that truth which appears to us as coming fr om within ourselves do we trust. Only truth can bring us security in deve loping our individual powers. In someone tormented by doubts, the powers are weakene d. He can find no goal for his creative powers in a world that app ears to him as an enigma. No longer do we merely want to be lieve; we want to know. Belief demands acknowledgement of truths which are not quite clear to us. But what is not clearly recognized goes against what is individual in us , which wants to experience everything in the depth of its being. Only that kind of know ing satisfies us which is not subjected to any external standard, but springs from the inner experience of our personality. Nor do we want a kind of knowledge which has become hardened into formulas and is stored away, valid for all time. Each of us considers himself justified in proceeding from his immediate experience, from the facts he knows, and from there going forward to gain knowledge of the whole universe. We strive for certainty in knowledge, but each in his own way. Our scientific teachings, too, should no longer ta ke a form that implies their acceptance to be a compulsion. Today no one should give a scie ntific work a title like that Fichte once gave a book: “A Pellucid Report for the Broade r Public concerning the Essential Nature of Recent Philosophies. An Attempt to Comp el the Reader to Understand.” To-day no one is to be compelled to understand. We demand neither acceptance nor agreement from anyone unless his own particular, individual need urges him to the view in question. Today even the still immature human bei ng, the child, should not have knowledge crammed into him; rather we should seek to develop his faculties so that he no longer needs to be compelled to understand, but understands. I am under no illusion concerning these charact eristics of the present age. I know how much of a stereotypical attit ude, lacking all individuality, is prevalent everywhere. But I also know that many of my cont emporaries strive to order th eir lives in the direction I have indicated. To them I would dedicate th is book. It is not meant to be the “only possible” way that leads to tr uth, but it describes a path ta ken by one whose heart is set upon truth. This book at first leads the reader into abst ract regions, where t hought must have sharp outlines if it is to reach secure conclusions. Bu t the reader is also led out of these arid concepts into concrete life. I am convinced that one must raise oneself up into the ethereal realm of concepts if one wants to experience existence in all its aspects. One understanding only the pleasures of the senses , misses the essential enjoyments of life. Oriental sages make their disciples live a life of resignation a nd asceticism for years before they impart their own wisdom to them. The Western world no longer demands pious exercises and ascetic practices as a prepar ation for science, but it does require that"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"one should have the good will to withdraw o ccasionally from the immediate impressions of life and enter the realm of pure thought. The spheres of life are many, and for each of th em special sciences develop. But life itself is a whole, and the more the sciences strive to penetrate into the depths of the separate spheres, the more they withdraw themselv es from seeing the world as a living unity. There must be a knowledge which seeks in the separate sciences the principle that leads man back to the fulness of life once more . Through his knowledge the researcher in a special branch of science wants to become conscious of the world and how it works; in this book the aim is a philos ophical one: science itself must become a living, organic entity. The various branches of science are pr eliminary stages of the science striven for here. A similar relation is to be found in art. The composer’s work is based on the theory of composition. This latter is a knowledge which is a necessary prerequisite for composing. In composing, the law of composition se rves life, that is, it serves true reality. In exactly the same sense philosophy is an ar t. All genuine philosophe rs have truly been artists in concepts. For them, human ideas beco me the material for art, and the scientific method becomes artistic techni que. Abstract thinking thereb y gains concrete, individual life. Ideas become life-forces. We then have not just a knowledge of things, but we have made knowledge into a real organism, rule d by its own laws; the reality of our active consciousness has risen beyond a mere passive reception of truths. How philosophy as an art is related to human freedom (spiritual activity), what freedom is, and whether we do or can pa rticipate in it, is the princi pal problem dealt with in my book. All other scientific discus sions are included solely because they ultimately throw light on this question which, in my opinion, is man’s most immediate concern. These pages offer a “Philosophy of Freedom.” All science would be nothing but the satisfaction of idle curios ity if it did not strive to elevate the value of existence of the human personality. The sciences attain their true value only through presenting the significance of their results in relation to man. The ultimate goal of the individual cannot be th e ennoblement of one single soul-faculty only, but a development of all the capacities that slumber within us. All knowledge has value only insofar as it is a contribution to the all-round unfolding of man’s entire nature. Therefore, in this book the relation between scie nce and life is not regarded in the sense that man must bow down to ideas and let them enslave him; rather the relation should be that man conquers the world of ideas in order to make use of it for his human aims, which go beyond the aims of mere science. One must be able to confront the idea in living expe rience, or else fall into bondage to it. "}]
