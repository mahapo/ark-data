It was among the first books to confront the crisis of the evidence about Christianity that had been uncovered by the biblical criticism of the last century, and even more the questioning of the uniqueness 1.

It is a great book, perhaps because it combines the personal authenticity of that moment when its author, as he put it in The Course of My Life , “stood before the Mystery of Golgotha in a solemn festival of knowledge,” and the awareness of those larger questions that are still dealt with, on the whole, so inade- quately today, and to which Rudolf Steiner proposed some exciting and thorough-going answers. Traditional Christians were already disconcerted by the growing evidence that the “historical” figure of Christ was in fact a complex creation, molded by biblical and extra-biblical ideas, expectations, and hopes. Scholarship had turned up parallels to the Redeemer’s life and death in Eastern religions, and in the paganism contemporary with Christian origins. Was Christ perhaps just another dying-and-rising god such as Adonis or Attis, or the oth- ers surveyed in James Frazer’s monumental study, The Golden Bough ? Not at all, declared others, hastily disso- ciating Jesus from anything of the sort by turning him into “the simple man of Nazareth,” an image equally inappro- priate as an interpretation of the New Testament sources. Closer to our own day, these issues have been sharpened still further by the discovery of Essene and Gnostic texts from the early Christian time and milieu. In many of these, too, Christ (or the Messiah of the “Dead Sea Scrolls”) seems often to be a “cosmic” figure rather than a historical individual. Despite all the interest in them, desperate special pleading has frequently been the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"intro xi Tue Mar 25 15:12:10 1997 Introduction xi response today also. This reflects a desire to keep trea- sured items of belief safe from the restless questioning of the modern world, even at the cost of a debilitating split between head and heart. If early Christian texts present Jesus in “cosmic” terms, relating stories that are less his- tory than myths like those about the pagan savior-gods, or like the apocalyptic figures anticipated by the Essenes, these must be seen as unfortunate vestiges in the Christian message of former “superstitious” and unrealistic times. The response of Christian theologians must be to demy- thologize Christianity—a program relentlessly pursued by Bultmann and his many followers in particular, but tacitly followed by many more. 2 And what has the result been? Stripped bare of its cosmic imagery, of its relation- ship to the forces that early Christians imagined were going to bring about the imminent transformation of the world, Christianity has turned in upon itself, lost the ini- tiative, lost its sense of direction. Rudolf Steiner had the advantage of approaching the whole question from a profounder viewpoint. In other cir- cles the rediscovery of myth, of cosmic symbolism and mystery, was taking a more positive course. Theologians and academics may have felt the threat to conventional ideas; Theosophists saw the need for a new synthesis that took seriously the insights both of Buddhism and the evo- lutionary science of the West, the evidence of recurring 2.

H. P. Blavatsky’s idea of a unity behind it all touched a nerve of the age, and an attempt to explain the extraordinary and undeniable unity of religious phenom- ena has remained a central strand in twentieth-century thought, persisting far outside the theosophical circles where it was first nurtured. 3 But from the beginning Steiner followed his own critical line. It seemed as though the Theosophists wanted to manufacture a new synthetic religion that would replace the parochialism of local faiths. Steiner knew that any real spiritual life needed something more organic; that the universal pat- terns of religion had adapted themselves in subtle and complex ways through history to the changing needs of humanity, different cultures, different times. Above all Steiner was concerned that the attempt to deepen the impoverished spiritual life of the West was turning all too easily into a rivalry between West and East. Sometimes it appears that he takes sides in this struggle too, but his claim for the uniqueness of Christianity, it should be remembered, is a claim for the unique contribution of all religions in the evolution of the human spirit. Without any one of them our spiritual life would be incalculably 3. The idea of finding the unity behind religious phenomena all over the world has inspired such researchers as Mircea Eliade, Joseph Campbell, and others into modern times. Eliade in particular has stressed the universality of initiation practices and the presence of their influence in all the great religions. H. P. Blavatsky’s notion of a “secret doctrine” is a specific version of the idea that is actually less close to Steiner, and despite his early connection with the theosophical move- ment, there is no evidence that Steiner ever believed in it literally."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introduction xiii the poorer. Christianity, however, is specifically adapted to deal with the sense of history, of individual responsi- bility, of individual consciousness, which had evolved in the West. It was history with its relativism, not just the individ- ual’s questioning attitude that had brought the crisis to a head by the end of the nineteenth century. There no longer seemed to be a place for belief in a timeless truth we could all accept, and the questioning of everything led either to scientific reductionism or to a Nietzschean nihil- ism. But Steiner saw that the sort of inward migration to Eastern culture, one that had not experienced these prob- lems, which was attractive to many, could never resolve the situation—though it might provide a temporary respite for some. By ignoring Christianity, the esotericists were bypassing the spiritual stream intimately connected with the problems facing modern civilization, which must either solve them or perish with them. Conversely, if Christianity were really sure of the truth it asserted it could lose nothing from the comparison with other reli- gions. If its central symbols of a dying god and regenera- tion were held in common with other beliefs, that did not mean it must inevitably lose its identity in a mish-mash of faiths. On the contrary, such an encounter would bring it to understand itself more thoroughly. Steiner saw that what was needed was an evolutionary approach. Chris- tianity did grow out of previously existing beliefs but developed them in a special way, a way that was linked with the emergence of the individual, and of historical, time-oriented understanding. That could not mean it"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiv C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT should strive to leave behind all that bound it to the older Mysteries, which had given people the sense of belonging to a meaningful cosmic order, spiritual as well as physi- cal. Indeed, to do so would simply be throwing one’s lot in with the alienation and isolation that is the besetting disease of modern culture: the shadow side of our individ- ualism and freedom to shape our future by detaching our- selves from the past. Rather, by understanding the spiritual pattern of regeneration in the Mysteries, in which people felt they shared in the death and return-to- life of a god, Christianity could also see how it had evolved—and still needed to evolve—in order to convey that experience to the individualistic and highly self-con- scious humanity, which could never go back to the collec- tive values and way of life of ancient humanity. If Christianity were true to its conviction of God work- ing in history, it could understand itself as part of the spir- itual evolution of humanity and as a guide to human spiritual transformation still to come. Steiner therefore welcomed the comparative perspective that has seemed such a necessary yet bitter pill to Bultmann and the demy- thologizers of Christianity. His “esoteric Christianity” opened the way for deeper knowledge, not by detaching us from our history, and asking us to believe in a general- ized and schematic “universal truth,” but rather, by asking us to find our roots and to understand the need for similar roots in other cultures, other faiths.

(It was from Steiner’s pupil Edouard Schuré, for example, that the concept reached Teilhard de Chardin, with whom it is most often associ- ated.) But finding the cosmic vision once more was only one side of Steiner’s attempt to give the new impetus Christianity needed for contemporary humanity. It needed to be matched by understanding for the real work- ing of the Christian spirit in individuals—the “Christ- impulse,” which has helped to make us what we are, and which can redeem and transform us if we consciously open ourselves to it. Awareness of Christ’s presence in the world, the parousia, or so-called “second coming,” would be realized according to Steiner in the awakening of individuals through the Christ within them. It would be the new consciousness he saw about to dawn, and not the literal return expected by many, even in the Theosophical Society, of a Messiah in the flesh. Steiner unfolded his vision in kaleidoscopic richness through lectures and books in the decades that followed Christianity As Mystical Fact . I have attempted at least to hint at the place held by certain discussions in his devel- oped views, or to refer to subsequent elaborations of a theme, by means of “forward references” and an occa- sional substantive footnote. All in all, it is remarkable how much is present in embryo in his first short treatment of this vast subject, but it is as well to be aware too of the larger context he himself subsequently established for many of its ideas. The early work certainly has its peculiar- ities. In parts the book is an odd mixture of sketchiness and profundity, while other sections like those on Heraclitus,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"intro xvi Tue Mar 25 15:12:41 1997 xvi C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT Philo, or Augustine blossom into short monographs that could almost stand alone. Furthermore, much discussion elsewhere of Christianity and the Mysteries has focused on Paul, about whom Steiner chose to say virtually noth- ing in his book. It is worth realizing that this does not beto- ken any hostility toward Paul and his message, such as one occasionally and misguidedly finds in “spiritual” circles. Despite the “undeniable awkwardness” of the language, Steiner was later to comment: The Pauline letters are definitive statements of the whole direction taken by Christian evolution. . . . In them are announced the fundamental truths of Christianity: the resurrection, the “faith” that stands in opposition to the “Law,” the working of grace, the living presence of Christ in the soul or in human consciousness, and much more. One finds increas- ingly that the presentation of Christianity has to take as its starting-point these letters of Paul. 4 Or again, it might have been expected that an attempt to establish the evolutionary and cosmic purport of Chris- tianity would have gravitated toward the brilliant and wide-ranging thought of an Origen, 5 rather than leading up to the highly personal yet Church-oriented Augustine. But here too Steiner has deeper purposes in view; for with 4. The Bhagavad Gita and the Epistles of Paul , Anthroposophic Press, Hudson, NY, 1971, pp.60–61. 5.

And it is in the working of that crisis of the individual through to the end, and not in turning back, that Steiner’s understanding of the meaning of Christianity lies. Christianity as Mystical Fact sets out to explore a pat- tern of spiritual life that Steiner regarded as crucial to the archaic religions and the Mysteries central to them. Before leaving the book to make its case, it is worth sur- veying briefly the state of the ongoing discussion to which Steiner can still, I suggest, decisively contribute. The argument has inevitably swung different ways. Early efforts to substantiate the direct derivation of Christian- ity from Mysteries of the East, such as The Iranian Mys- tery of Redemption —a book by the great comparative religionist Richard Reitzenstein—were later subjected to devastating criticism. (Certainly by comparison with Reitzenstein, it should be noted, Steiner’s emphasis on an Iranian-Zoroastrian thread in the Mysteries and, indeed in Christianity, is more subtle and restrained.) But the arguments against showed, in turn, a failure to exor- cise the specter that had been raised. Hugo Rahner’s fas- cinating Greek Myth and Christian Mystery tried to limit the influence of the Mysteries to later phases, to the fourth century and after, when the Church took over the pagan establishment.

The situation has only really been clarified by the notable discoveries of new texts in 1945 and 1947. The Gnostic texts from Nag Hammadi showed that Christianity had been involved with Mysteries at a much earlier stage, leading to the complex situation of the second-century crisis. The “Dead Sea Scrolls” from Qumran showed that the Juda- ism of the type that influenced Christianity was itself “cosmic religion,” centered on initiation into Mysteries like those of the Essenes. The discovery of other Gnostic texts from the semi-Jewish sect of the Mandaeans unleashed a further set of studies, of which the more valuable are perhaps those of A.Loisy, such as his Birth of the Christian Religion . 6 Many of these studies suffered from the unfortunate but unavoidable lack of sources—and even more per- haps from the attempt to derive the inner significance of the process they described from the external evidence, which involved them in all sorts of excesses.

He knew that the connection must therefore have been there. “Historical research,” he once said, “will one day vindicate completely the evidence drawn from purely spiritual sources, which forms the basis of my Christianity as Mystical Fact .” 7 In the mean- time he appealed to evidences where he found them—for instance, in the Mystery-oriented Judaism of Philo of Alexandria or, in the absence of documents relating to the Greek Mysteries, in the reflection of Mystery processes in the pre-Socratics and Plato. (Again I have tried in the footnotes to refer to discoveries that now prove his case.) Part of the roundaboutness of the book is thus explained; but he also clearly wanted to establish a larger perspective than the shortsighted historical approach. Later, espe- cially in his lectures, he was to extend his treatment into the details of the Gospels and the Apocalypse, only touched on here. His “evolutionary” idea that in Chris- tianity the processes of the Mysteries, hitherto experi- enced in vision and expressed in myth, had to become an individual life, already opens the way however for his intimate and deeply moving account of the founder’s role. In obedience to his Father, the God of history, Christ had to be willing to translate that pattern of death and resur- rection into personal destiny, thereby opening a new dimension of humanity’s relationship to God.

It is precisely the intimacy of this account that furnishes the assurance for Steiner’s crit- ical yet creative role within the Christian historical tradi- tion that is so impressive and remarkable. Anyone who ignores it has failed to discern the man with whom they are dealing. In rendering Steiner’s book into English I have used a number of terms that may seem slightly technical. The spe- cial wisdom of the Mysteries, only understood by those who have been through their processes, is “mysterioso- phy” ( Mysterienweisheit ), a term now in use among schol- ars and not at all alien to Steiner’s usage. The one-to-be- initiated is an “initiand.” One who has been through the process becomes a mystes (plural, mystai ), the term retained by Steiner ( der Myste ), but not identical with the related and more familiar “mystic” ( der Mystiker ). The goal of the Mysteries is “divinization” ( Vergöttung , equiv- alent to apotheosis , theothenai , or “becoming God”). Nineteenth-century conventions of long paragraphs and undivided chapters do not help modern readers to find their way through Steiner’s many-sided approach. I have provided subtitles for the sections of each chapter, and tried to articulate the divisions of Steiner’s thought rather than follow the stylistic habits of his day.

An inquiry into how those needs were met leads us immediately into the obscurity of the secret cults. 1 The individual seeker disappears there for the moment from our view. We see that the public forms of religion cannot give what the seeker’s heart desires. He or she acknowledges the gods, but knows that the customary ideas about the gods do not resolve the great enigmas of life, and seeks a wisdom that is carefully guarded by a community of priest-sages. The struggling soul seeks a refuge in their community. If the sages find one who is ready, they will lead that indi- vidual stage by stage, in a manner concealed from the outsider’s gaze, to a higher insight. But the process is not disclosed to the uninitiated.

We see one for whom no words can be sublime enough to express the meaning of what has been experienced. It seems that not just symbolically but in some existential sense he or she has passed through death and awakened to a new and higher life. And there is a conviction that no one who has not undergone a similar experience can understand what such a one has to say. Such was the case of those who, in the Mysteries, were initiated into the content of that secret wisdom which was withheld from the people, and which illuminated the pro- founder questions of life. Alongside the public religion, there existed a “secret religion” of the elect. Its historical beginnings are lost to sight in the obscurity of the begin- nings of civilization. It is encountered everywhere among the peoples of antiquity so far discovered, and their sages spoke of the Mysteries with the greatest reverence. 2 What was it they concealed, and what were the secrets they laid bare to the initiated? The enigma is intensified still further by what we know of the dangers which are repeatedly asserted by ancient sources to be characteristic of the Mysteries. The path conducting to the secret truths of life lay through a world of terrors. Woe to anyone unworthy to attain them! No transgression could be greater than the “betrayal” of the Mysteries to the uninitiated; the betrayer would be punished not just with the confisca- tion of property but with death.

He escaped death only by"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Mysteries and Mysteriosophy 3 taking refuge at the altar of Dionysus and legally proving that he was not an initiate. 3 The ancient testimonies to the Mysteries are at once revealing yet full of ambiguity. The initiates were con- vinced that to tell what they knew would be sinful, and indeed that it would be sinful for the uninitiated to hear it. Plutarch mentions the terror of the initiand, and com- pares his position to a preparation for death. 4 A special mode of life was one of the requirements for a subse- quent initiation. The senses were to be brought under the control of the spirit; fasting, isolation, ordeals, and cer- tain meditative techniques were employed to that end. The stable realities of ordinary life were to lose all their value, and the whole orientation of perception and feel- ing to be completely altered. The implication of such exercises and ordeals cannot be in doubt; the wisdom to be presented to the initiand could work upon the psyche in the proper way only if one had already worked trans- formingly upon the world of the lower senses. The initi- and was to be conducted into the life of the spirit, and behold a higher world order. Without the preparatory exercises and ordeals he or she would be able to form no connection with that world—and on that connection everything depended. Real understanding here is possible only if we have an awareness of the subtle phenomena of living knowl- edge.

Our think- ing about them uncovers them further and clarifies the relations between them. From this point of view, what rises up in answer from within the soul is not real in the same sense, being “only” thoughts and ideas. At best these are regarded as after-images of perceptible reality; they have no validity of their own, since we can neither touch, see, nor hear them. But there is another way of relating to the world, incomprehensible though it must remain for those who cling to the “reality” we have just described. It comes to certain people at some moment in their lives, overturning their whole way of looking at the world. What they call “real” are the images that surface from the spiritual life of the psyche, and they ascribe a lesser degree of actuality to the sense-impressions of hearing, touching, and seeing. They are aware that their assertions cannot be proved. All they can do is to tell of their new experiences, knowing that they are then in the position of someone with eyesight addressing the blind. If they nevertheless try to communicate their inner experiences, it is in the conviction that around them may be others who, though their spiritual eyes are yet unopened, may be able to understand through the very power of what they have to convey. For they have a faith in humanity and wish to open the eyes of others. They can only offer the fruits that their own spirit has gath- ered.

Human beings have as yet nothing in their own nature that enables them to do so: the human being is at the outset a product of sense-experi- ences, and the mind is as yet nothing more than the inter- preter and judge of the senses. The senses would be poor instruments if they did not insist upon their own truth and credibility; an eye would be a bad eye if it did not impress upon us the unconditional reality of what it sees. That is right for the eye. Nor is it deprived of its due by the spir- itual eye. It is only that the spiritual eye permits us to see the things of sense in a higher light. Nothing perceived by the physical eye is thereby denied; and yet a new glory radiates from what is seen, showing that the former per- ception was only of a lower reality. What is seen remains exactly the same as before, but now it is merged into something higher—into the spirit. The question then is how to realize and feel the truth of what is seen. Those who deny living response and feeling to everything except what the senses tell them will dis- miss the higher vision as a fata morgana , mere fantasy. When such people try to grasp the spiritual images, they are left groping in the void, since they have feeling only for the outwardly perceptible. Spiritual images shrink from their touch. They remain “mere” ideas that pass through the mind; such a person is not vitally present in them. As images, they seem less real than restless dreams.

Not that one’s senses and feelings are stunted, but their authority has become less absolute, so that room is left for some- thing else. The world of the spirit begins to animate the space that is thus left open. At this point a terrible possibility lies in wait. It may happen that someone loses that unreflecting confidence in perceptions and feelings, and yet no new world rises. Such a person is left suspended in the void as if dead. The previous values have deserted that individual, but no new ones have arisen. For such a one the universe and fellow human beings have ceased to exist. This is in fact not merely a possibility, but a stage that every seeker for higher knowledge must experience. One comes to a point in understanding where the spirit reveals all of life to be death. One is then no longer in the world, but under it, in the Underworld. One has descended into Hades. 5 It will be well for such a person not to go under, and if a new world comes into being either the seeker vanishes from sight, or emerges once more, transfigured, and looks out upon a new Sun and a new Earth.

We hear that the mystai were struck with terror by a drawn sword, that blood was caused to flow. Such words are made intelligible by a knowledge of the stages leading from lower to higher cognition. It does indeed feel as though everything solidly material and perceptible has dis- solved into water. The ground is taken from beneath us. Everything that seemed to be living before has been put to death. The spirit has cut through the life of the senses like a sword through the living flesh; we have seen the blood of sensuality flow. But life springs up anew. The initiate reascends from the Underworld. The ancient orator Aristides asserts: I thought I could touch the god, and feel his very presence. I was then in a condition between sleep- ing and waking. My spirit was so light that no one except an initiate could comprehend or speak of it. 7 This new existence is no longer subjected to the laws of lower life. It is untouched by growth and decay. Dis- cussions about “the eternal” are endless, but unless the words draw their meaning from those who have actually descended into Hades, they are mere sound and fury, sig- nifying nothing.

It is not just the conviction that life at its core is eternal that the mystai seek. Such a conviction would be quite value- less from the standpoint of the Mysteries. From the Mys- tery-standpoint the eternal has no living presence in one who is not a mystes , so when speaking of the eternal such a person would speak of precisely nothing. Rather it is the “eternal” itself that the mystai seek to possess; they have first to awaken the eternal to existence within them, and then they can speak of it. Plato’s hard saying is abso- lutely true for them, that the uninitiated sink into the mire, and only those who have passed through the Mys- teries enter into eternity. 8 That is the meaning too of Sophocles’ fragment: Thrice blessed when they come to the realm of shades who have seen these rites! They alone have life, for the rest there is only pain and toil. 9 That is why to speak of the Mysteries is at the same time to tell of dangers. For is not to lead someone to the door of the Underworld to rob that person of happiness, of the very meaning of life? A terrible responsibility is incurred by such an act.

For indeed what could be the result if the mystai betrayed their secret? Their words would have been just that— empty words. The experiences and emotions needed to evoke the shock of the spirit out of the words would have been lacking without the preparation, the exercises, and ordeals, the total transformation of perceptual life. Lack- ing this, anyone who heard would be thrown into empti- ness, nothingness, deprived of happiness but receiving nothing in return. In reality, of course, nothing could be taken away. After all, empty words have no power to alter our experience of life. Actual experience would still be limited to feeling, mediated by the senses. Nothing could come to such a person except a terrifying, paralyzing uncertainty—which it would be criminal to impart. The mysteriosophy of the ancient world resembles a hot-house plant, which requires seclusion in which to grow and flourish. Bring it into the atmosphere of mun- dane ideas and it cannot thrive; before the sharp judgment of modern scientific logic it evaporates utterly. It is nec- essary therefore to put aside for a time our scientific edu- cation based on the microscope and telescope, purify our hands that have grown clumsy with all the business of dis- section and the search for proof. Then, free of all presup- positions, we may enter the pure temple of the Mysteries. Of primary importance is the frame of mind in which the mystai approach what they consider to be the highest truth, the answer to all the riddles of life.

That makes of knowledge something personal and inti- mate. For the mystes it is such. Go and give someone the answer to the enigma of the world! Present the conclu- sion ready-made! The mystes would find that utterly hol- low; a person must reach the answer in the right way, otherwise it will be nothing. Without the feeling which kindles the essential fire, it will mean little. 10 A god comes to meet you—either it is everything, or nothing; nothing, if you make the encounter in the spirit of the humdrum tasks of life; everything if you are duly pre- pared and attuned to the experience. As to what it may be in itself, that does not concern you—what matters is whether it leaves you as it found you or makes you a dif- ferent human being. And that depends entirely on you. A training and development both intimate and intensive must have prepared the personality in order that the encounter with the god may kindle and release the pow- ers within. What you receive in the encounter depends upon what you bring to meet it. Plutarch has described the intensive preparation, and recounted the “greeting” addressed by the mystes to the god when he approaches him: The god, as it were, addresses each of us as he enters with his “Know Thyself,” which is at least as good as “Hail.” We answer the god in return with “ EI ” (Thou Art), rendering him that designation which is true and has no lie in it, and alone belongs to him and to no other, that of Being."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Mysteries and Mysteriosophy 11 For we really have no part in real being; all mortal nature is in a middle state between becoming and passing-away, and presents but an appearance, a faint unstable image, of itself. If you strain the intel- lect and wish to grasp this, it is as with water—com- press it too much and force it violently into one space as it tries to flow through, and you destroy the enveloping substance. Even so when the reason tries to follow too closely the clear truth about each par- ticular thing in the world of phase and change, it is foiled and rests either on the becoming of that thing or on its passing-away. It cannot apprehend anything that abides or really is. “It is impossible to go into the same river twice,” said Heraclitus. No more can you hold mortal being twice, so as to grasp it; so sharp and so swift is change, it scatters and brings together again—nay, not again, no, nor afterward: even while it is being formed it fails, it approaches, and it is gone. Hence becoming never ends in being, for the process never leaves off, or is stayed. From seed it produces, in its constant changes, an embryo, then an infant, then a child; in due order a boy, a young man; then a man, an elderly man, and an old man; it undoes former becomings and that age which has been to make those which come after. Yet we fear (how absurdly!) a single death—we who have died so many deaths, and yet are dying. For it is not only that, as Heraclitus would say, “Death of fire is the birth of air,” and “Death of air is"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"12 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT the birth of water.” The thing is much clearer in our own selves. The man in his strength is destroyed when the old man comes into being, the young man was destroyed for the man in his strength to be, so the boy for the young man, the babe for the boy. He of yesterday has died into him of today; he of today is dying into him of tomorrow. No one abides, no one is. We who come into being are many, while matter is driven around, and then glides away about some one appearance and a common mold. Else how is it, if we remain the same, that the things in which we find pleasure now are different from those of a former time; that we love, hate, admire, and censure different things? How is it that our look, our bodily form, our intel- lect are not the same as then? If a man does not change, these various conditions are unnatural; if he does change, he is not the same man. But if he is not the same man, he is not at all. His so-called being is simply change and new birth of man out of man. In our ignorance of what being is, sense falsely tells us that what appears is. 11 Plutarch repeatedly characterizes himself as an initiate and what he describes here is an absolute requirement for the life of the mystes : the attainment of a wisdom in which the spirit sees through the delusions of the senses.

Birth and death lose their distinctive meanings, and refer to moments of becoming and passing-away that are like all the other events in nature. The highest cannot be found, however, in becoming and passing away, but only in the truly enduring that looks both back to the past and forward into the future. To gaze at once into the past and future is a stage of higher knowledge. It is the discovery of the spirit. The spirit lies behind the manifestations of the senses, but has nothing to do with becoming and passing away, which characterizes all appearances to the senses. Everyone who lives only in the world of the senses bears this spirit occultly, deep within. Everyone who has pierced through the illusion of the sense-world bears the spirit within as a manifest truth. To attain insight is to unfold a new organ, an event com- parable to a plant unfolding the color of its blossom out of its former green and leafy state. The ability to produce flowers was always there in the plant, but it was hidden, and became manifest only with the blooming of the flower. Even so, the divine spiritual forces lie hidden within sense-dominated human beings, and become man- ifest truth for the first time in the mystes. That is the nature of the Mystery “transformation.” Through inner development, the mystai bring to the world, as it formerly existed, something radically new.

But the forces in humanity are not themselves exhausted. They lie as though spellbound in the natural human being and await their release. Unable to release themselves, they ebb away unless human beings take hold of them and transform them—unless they awaken to real existence their hidden potentiality. Nature brings forms from the rudimentary to the completed state, in a long series of stages from the inanimate, the variety of living forms, to physical human- ity. Looking around them, human beings perceive them- selves to be subject to change. But they detect also within their own being the powers that brought the natural human being into existence. These powers are not subject to the law of change. Rather they are the source from which everything changeable has sprung. They are a sign to them that the human being is greater than can be known by means of the senses. These powers constitute as yet a nothing, a sheer pos- sibility. Yet people are illuminated from within by the power that fashioned all things, including themselves. They also feel something urging them on to higher cre- ative life. There lies within them something that pre- existed their natural being and will outlive it. It brought them into existence; nevertheless they can seize hold of it and share in its creative force. Such feelings pervaded the life of the ancient mystai as a result of their initiation. It was the felt presence of the eternal, the divine. Human action became an integral part of divine creativ- ity. A higher Self had been discovered, a Self extending"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Mysteries and Mysteriosophy 15 beyond the bounds of perceptual process, prior to physical birth and existing after death. It is an eternally creative Self, spanning time past and time to come. The empirical personality is a product of the Self; but that is henceforth only a subordinate part of its creative life within. Now is created something higher than the senses can grasp, something for which the personality is a mere instrument of its creative power, something in humanity that is divine. This is the “divinization” experienced in the Mysteries. 12 The Hidden God For the mystai that power which illuminated them from within was what they called their true spirit, the spirit of which they themselves were the product. It was as though a new being had penetrated them and taken possession of their faculties. Such a being stood between them, in their ordinary identities, and the supreme cosmic power or Godhead. It was the true Self or daimon that the mystai were seeking. 13 They had come into existence in the great realm of nature, but nature’s work was incomplete, and its fulfillment had to be undertaken by human beings them- selves. To accomplish that within the gross conditions of nature, however, which included even the empirical per- sonality, was impossible. For in that realm the limit of development had already been reached. One therefore had to leave nature behind, and thus to construct further within the condition of the spirits ( daimons ) at the point where nature left off."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"16 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT An atmosphere had to be created that did not exist any- where in the outer world.

Their transformation was a delicate process, unfitted to the harsh light of com- mon day. But if they stood the test, they became a rock founded on the eternal, defying all life’s storms. They had simply to accept, however, that they could not com- municate directly to others what they had been through on the way. According to Plutarch, it was in the Mysteries that he found “the truest information and explanation about the nature of the daimons .” 14 Cicero also adds that the Mysteries, when they are explained and traced back to their original meaning, are concerned more with the nature of things than with the nature of the gods. 15 Their evidence shows that the mystai acquired a higher knowledge about the nature of things than that obtainable in the public cults of the gods. Indeed the daimons or spir- itual existences, and even the gods, were felt to need explaining. And so we come to still higher beings than the daimons and the gods: this belonged to the essential con- tent of mysteriosophy.

Can Zeus as he was publicly represented be an eternal god, bearing as he does all the features of perishable existence? It was clear to the mystai that a person’s idea of the gods did not come in the manner of other ideas, like those of things around one, which constrain one to represent them in a particular way. By contrast, people’s ideas of divinity are uncon- strained, even willful. Attention reveals an absence of control from the outer world on the idea of the gods. This brings us to a logical quandary. There is a suggestion that human beings create their own gods. Then the question arises of how ideas can be in a position to transcend phys- ical reality at all. The mystai grappled seriously with these issues, and quite legitimately adopted a skeptical posi- tion. They scrutinized the public representations of the gods, and noted that in fact they resemble things encoun- tered in the sense-world. Is it not the case that they are made by someone who selects and brings together fea- tures from the natural world? The primitive hunter makes a heaven where the gods engage in marvelous hunting. The Greeks populated their Olympus with divine person- alities, but the originals belong to the real world of Greek cultural life. The early Greek philosopher Xenophanes (575–480 B . C .) exposed this situation with rude logic. The early phi- losophers were entirely dependent upon mysteriosophy. (We shall presently demonstrate this in detail, beginning with Heraclitus.)

The epic accounts of the gods would then be rejected. A person might acknowledge as real and com- pelling only the results of sense-perception. But the mys- tai did not give in to mere doubt. The skeptics, they realized, resembled a plant rejecting its own colorful flower because it felt complete with its green leaves, and therefore regarding anything more as “illusory appear- ance!” Yet it was no longer possible for them to rest con- tent with the fabricated gods of the public cults.

Thus did the mystai look upon the public divinities, not denying them, not declaring them redundant, but understanding nonetheless that they were the product of human beings. It is the forces of nature—the gods working in nature that are at the same time the creative forces in the mystes . And it is these, working internally, that engender the images of the gods. The mystes ’ aim is to grasp the god- making power, 18 which is something higher than the pub- lic divinities, and on a different plane. Xenophanes alludes to it as follows: One God is greater than all, whether gods, whether Earth-dwelling mortals; Unlike whatever can die is his form, and unlike theirs his thinking. 19 And this was also the God of the Mysteries. He might be called a “hidden god.” For nowhere, the teaching asserted, could this God be found by one who trusted the senses alone. One’s gaze could be turned toward the wide world, but find there nothing divine; exert one’s intelligence to grasp the laws of coming-to-be and passing-away, and yet find no proof of the divine; intoxicate one’s imagination with religious fervor to make images taken to be gods, only to under- mine them once more with the realization that they are manufactured by human beings from the material of the sense-perceptible world.

God lies spellbound in the world. To find God requires a power from God himself. That power must actually be awakened in the candidate for initiation, it was stated in the ancient teaching. So began the great cosmic drama in which the initiand’s life was engulfed. The drama consisted of nothing less than the deliverance of the spellbound God. Where is God? Such was the root-question of the soul of the mystes . God is not existence; but nature exists. In nature he must be discovered, where he lies in his enchanted grave. The mystai understood that “God is love” in a special higher sense. For God has gone to the utmost lengths of love. He has sacrificed himself in infinite love, poured himself out, dismembered himself into the mani- fold things of nature. They live, but he is not alive in them; he slumbers in them, but comes alive in human beings who are able to experience the life of God within themselves. But if human beings are to attain this gnosis , they must cre- atively release it within themselves. Looking into their own being, they find the divine as a hidden creative power, not yet released into existence. Within the soul lies the place where the spellbound God may return to life. The soul is the mother who can receive the divine seed from nature. If the soul allows herself to be impregnated by nature she will give birth to the divine.

He is not the great God who was, and is, and shall be, yet he may in a certain sense be taken as a revelation of him. The Father remains at rest in the unseen. The Son is born to human beings out of their own souls. Initiatory knowledge is thus an actual event in the cos- mic process. It is the birth of a divine child—a process just as real as any natural process. The great secret of the mystai was precisely this, that they creatively release the divine child in themselves. First of all, however, they must be prepared so as to recognize it. The uninitiated know nothing of the Father of this divine child. The Father slumbers under a spell. The child seems to be born of a virgin, the soul giving birth to him without impregna- tion.

With what veneration does Plato speak of the “secret teachings” in the Phaedo: Perhaps these people who direct the religious initia- tions are close to the mark, and all the time there has been an allegorical meaning beneath their doctrine that he who enters the next world uninitiated and unenlightened shall lie in the mire, but he who arrives there purified and enlightened shall dwell among the gods. You know how the initiation practi- tioners say, “There are many who bear the sacred wands, but the Bacchoi are few.” Well, in my opin- ion these latter are simply those who have lived the philosophic life in the right way; I myself have done my best in every way to join that company, leaving nothing undone which I could do to attain this end. 21"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Mysteries and Pre-Socratic Philosophy 23 One who speaks about initiation in this way must indeed have dedicated his search for wisdom to the way of thinking that was begotten by the Mysteries. And there is no doubt that a brilliant light is shed on the words of eminent Greek philosophers when that illumination comes from the Mysteries. The relationship of Heraclitus of Ephesus (c. 535–475 B . C .) to the Mysteries is immediately clear from a saying that is handed down about him, to the effect that his thoughts were “an impassable road.” Anyone who was not an initiate would find in them nothing but “obscurity and darkness,” but they were “brighter than the Sun” to those who approached them in the company of the mys- tai . It is said that he deposited his book in the temple of Artemis—indicating that he could be understood only by the initiated. 22 Heraclitus was called “the Obscure,” because the key of the Mysteries alone cast light on his views. In Heraclitus we witness a figure of the utmost earnest- ness in his approach to life. It is evident, when we recon- struct his thought in its essentials, that for him knowledge bore an inner meaning that words could ges- ture toward rather than directly express. It was out of some such realization that there arose his celebrated utterance “Everything is in flux.” Plutarch explains its meaning as follows: Heraclitus holds it impossible to go into the same river twice; no more can you grasp mortal being twice so as to hold it. So sharp and swift is change; it"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"24 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT scatters and brings together again, not again, no nor afterward; even while it is being formed it fails, it approaches, and it is gone. 23 Heraclitus’ thought sees through the nature of transi- tory things, and he is constrained to lay bare the essence of transitoriness in the sharpest terms conceivable. Such a characterization can only have come about because he was contrasting the transitory with the eternal. Nor could the characterization have been extended to include human beings unless Heraclitus had seen into their inner nature. Yet he does include humanity under this characterization: Life and death, waking and sleeping, youth and age are the same. This changes into that, and that into this. 24 The saying connotes full cognition of the illusory nature of the lower personality. Still more radical is his saying: Both life and death are to be found in our living, and in our dying. 25 What does this signify if not that a preference for life over death shows that we are only judging from the standpoint of the transitory? Death is a passing away in order to make way for new life. The Eternal lives in the new life, however, just as it did in the old. Whether in the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Mysteries and Pre-Socratic Philosophy 25 passing life or in death it is the same eternal reality. The knowledge of this enables people to face death or life with the same emotion. It is only when they have not been able to awaken the Eternal within them that they attribute to life any special significance. The saying “All is in flux” can be repeated a thousand times, but it is vacuous unless it evokes this content of feeling. The acknowledgment of eternal becoming is worthless if it does not lift us above our attachment to transitoriness. Heraclitus indicates a renunciation of the sensual urge toward transitory enjoyments when he says: How can we claim that in ordinary life “we are?” We know that from the vantage point of the Eternal “we are yet we are not.” Or according to another fragment: Hades and Dionysus are one. 26 Dionysus, god of the joy of life, of sprouting and growing, celebrated in the Dionysiac festivals, is for Herclitus the same as Hades, god of death and destruc- tion. The right perspective on the deficiencies and excel- lences of existence is granted only to those who see death in life and life in death, and in both the Eternal that transcends both life and death. The deficiencies then become justified, since in them too the Eternal is present.

For fish it is drinkable and salutary, but for men it is undrink- able and harmful. 28 The primary thrust of Heraclitus’ thought here is not the perishability of earthly things, but rather the splendor and sublimity of the Eternal. Heraclitus denounces Homer, Hesiod, and the learned men of his time. His aim was to demonstrate the depen- dence of their thought on transitory things. He wanted nothing to do with gods whose qualities derived from the perishable world; nor could he exalt a form of knowl- edge that sought for laws in the flux of becoming and passing away. For him, there is something eternal that announces itself from the midst of the perishable. For this eternal he has a profound metaphor: The connectedness of things is a tension between opposites, just as in a bow or a lyre. 29 How much lies concealed in this metaphor! Tension in one direction is exactly balanced by that in the other, resulting in a unity and harmonization of forces.

Life became a danger to human beings, for all that happens to them comes from life. The sting of this danger is removed, however, once people cease to set an uncritical value on life. They regain their inno- cence. It is as though they abandon their serious attitude toward life and regain their childhood. The child plays with many things taken seriously by the adult. The Hera- clitean thinker resembles the child. “Serious” issues lose their value when viewed from the eternal standpoint; life seems like play. “Eternity,” says Heraclitus, “is a child at play. It is the reign of a child.” 31 The beginning of error lies in taking too seriously a great deal that does not deserve it. God has poured himself out into the world of things. To treat things seriously, apart from God, is to make them into “tombs of the divine.” To disport ourselves with them like a child is to turn our serious intent toward rediscovering the underlying divinity, the God who sleeps spellbound in things. There is a “burning” process, a consuming fire, in the vision of the Eternal when it acts upon our customary notions about the world. The spirit dissolves thoughts that derive from the senses, evaporates them, as a destructive fire. It is in this higher sense that Heraclitus considers fire to be the first principle of all things. Of"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"28 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT course, it is primarily a straightforward explanation of physical phenomena. But it is easy to misunderstand Heraclitus if we debate his concept of fire, asking whether he meant by it sense-perceptible fire or whether it was not rather a metaphor for that eternal spirit which dissolves and reconstitutes all things. For that is to mis- construe his thought. He meant both, yet neither of these things. 32 For him, the spirit was vitally active in ordinary fire. The energy of physical fire works in a higher mode in the human soul, and in its crucible melts sense-percep- tions down to draw forth from them the vision of the Eternal. It is all too easy to misunderstand Heraclitus, for example when he makes war the father of things—but only of things, not of the Eternal. If there were not con- tradictions in the world, if there were not the most diverse conflicting tendencies, there would indeed be no becoming, no transitory things. Yet diffused through this contradictoriness and revealing itself there is not war, but connectedness. For though there is war in all things, for that very reason the mind of the wise should flame up over things and bring them into connectedness. Here we come upon one of Heraclitus’ great insights. It is from such a viewpoint that he develops his answer to the question of individual identity. For the human being is composed of the warring elements, into which the Divinity is poured out. In that divided state human beings find themselves. In addition, they become aware of the spirit, the Logos , which stems from the Eternal. For such people, however, the spirit comes to birth out"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Mysteries and Pre-Socratic Philosophy 29 of the clash of the elements. Indeed it is the spirit that brings the elements into equilibrium. Thus, in human beings nature transcends herself: all things are one, and it is the same power that made conflict and opposition that now, in its wisdom, reconciles them once again. Humanity lives in an eternal duality, in the contradiction between the flux of time and eternity. Through the eter- nal Logos human beings attain to individual existence, and must henceforward fashion their higher being. They live in a state of dependence, but also independence. They behold the Logos , but they can only participate in it according to the proportion of the mixture that the eternal Logos brought about in their case. Hence human beings derive their unique calling: to fashion the eternal out of the temporal. It is the spirit, the Logos , that works in human beings. But it does so in a special way: out of the temporal. The uniqueness of the human soul consists in this: a temporal being is active and powerful in the same way as an eter- nal being, and can be likened both to a god and to a worm. Human beings are placed between god and ani- mal. The active, powerful component of them is their daimonic part. It is what reaches out beyond their own self. As Heraclitus strikingly puts it, “A man’s daimon is his destiny.” 33 Thus for Heraclitus something far more extensive than personality is to be found in humanity; personality is the vehicle of the “daimonic” self, which is not limited by the bounds of individual existence, for which personal dying and being-born have no significance."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"30 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT What has the “daimonic” self to do with the transient form of the personality? The personality is no more than a mode of appearance for the daimon . The one who attains this insight is able to look forward and backward, beyond the individual self. The presence of the daimon within is a sign of one’s own eternal self, and this one can no longer be limited to the role of informing one’s own particular personality; the personality as such is simply one mode of appearance for the daimon, which cannot in principle be confined to a single personal man- ifestation. It has the power to inhabit many personalities and may shift from personality to personality. The important idea of reincarnation arises self-evidently from the premises of Heraclitus’ thought. Or rather, not just the idea but the experience of reincarnation. The idea merely goes before the experience; for when one becomes aware of the “daimonic” self within, one does not find something guiltless and simple. The daimon pos- sesses particular characteristics. Where do they origi- nate? Why do I possess such predispositions? It is because my daimon has been shaped by other per- sonalities. And unless I am to assume that the task I have to accomplish in the daimon is fulfilled with my own personality, I am preparing another, future personality. Thus there is something that intervenes between myself and the cosmic “One-and-All,” something that reaches out beyond myself, but which is not yet the Godhead as such; it is my d aimon that occupies this intermediary position. Today is simply the outcome of yesterday, and likewise this life is the outcome of a previous one—and"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Mysteries and Pre-Socratic Philosophy 31 the foundation for the next. Earthly humanity looks back over numerous yesterdays and forward to many tomor- rows, and the wise soul upon many former lives and lives to come. The ideas and abilities I developed in the past, I make use of now—and does not life show us that people rise over the horizon of existence already with the most varied capacities? Surely this diversity of gifts does not come from nowhere. Natural science currently congratulates itself on expel- ling from the domain of biology any notion of the mirac- ulous. David Friedrich Strauss mentions it as one of the great achievements of the modern age that a whole liv- ing being is no longer regarded as springing into being out of nothing by an act of creation. Its wholeness and completeness is understood as a result of evolution from more primitive forms. The developed form of an ape no longer seems miraculous when we realize that it has arisen through the gradual modification of ancestral forms, going back originally to primeval fishes. Is it not reasonable to assume the same conditions of evolution for the spirit as we know to prevail in nature? Does a more highly developed spirit emerge from the same con- ditions as a primitive one—say, Goethe and a Hottentot? It is no more possible for a fish to develop from the ancestors of an ape than for Goethe’s spirit to issue from the same spiritual conditions as a savage; the spiritual ancestry is simply quite different. Spirit as well as a body are in a process of evolving. Goethe’s spirit has more stages of development behind it than that of the savage. If we understand the idea of reincarnation in this"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"32 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT evolutionary sense it need no longer be pronounced unscientific. 34 It is a matter of knowing how to interpret the content of the soul and of not leaping to the idea of the miracu- lous. I am able to write because I learned how to do so; no one is able to sit down, having never held a pen, and write. What then of those with the spark of “genius?” In some cases, talent seems to border on the miraculous. Even here, the spark of “genius” is something that has emerged, that has been learned. When it shows itself in a personality, we may call it something “spiritual,” with the proviso that we understand that this “spiritual” was also originally something learned, something acquired through former lives before it appears as a spontaneous ability in a later one. It was in this form alone that the concept of everlasting life hovered before the inner eye of Heraclitus and the early Greek philosophers: they never spoke of the sur- vival of the empirical personality. Take, for example, the poem of Empedocles where he speaks of those who appeal to a “miraculous” creation: Childish and ignorant they—they do not reach far with their thinking Who suppose that what has not existed can ever come into being, Or that something may die away and wholly vanish forever! 35 It never can happen that being should arise from what never existed,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Mysteries and Pre-Socratic Philosophy 33 Impossible also that being should ever fade into nothing. For wherever being is shifted, it still will continue to be. 36 Never will any believe who are wise and interpret their thinking That only as long as they live what is called by the name here of living Do men continue existing, receiving their joys and their sorrows, Or that before they were born or when they are dead they are nothing. 37 In the case of Empedocles, no question concerning the existence of an eternal part in human nature is raised, but only the question concerning its nature and how it can be cherished and cultivated. It is assumed from the outset that humanity occupies a mediating position between the earthly and the divine. Empedocles’ thought knows nothing of a God outside and transcending the world. Divinity lives in human beings—though in a human way. It is the force in them which makes them strive to become more and more divine. Thinking in this way, one can say with Empe- docles: When, set free from the body, released you rise to the ether, You become divine, an immortal, escaped from the power of death. 38"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"34 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT Looking at human life from this perspective, the pros- pect of initiation into the magic circle of the Eternal becomes a real possibility. Forces that would not unfold under purely natural conditions of life must certainly be present in human beings, and if they remain untapped their life will pass away unfructified. It was the role of the Mysteries, as it was the task set for themselves by the Greek philosophers, to release those forces and thereby to make humanity akin to the divine. Thus we can understand Plato’s assertion that those who enter the next world uninitiated and unenlightened shall lie in the mire, but those who arrive there purified and enlightened shall dwell among the gods. There is a concept of immortality here whose meaning lies within the cosmic order; everything whereby one strives to rouse the Eternal to life within oneself is done to increase the existential value of the world—and emphat- ically not to turn oneself into an inessential onlooker at things, one who merely images in cognitive life an objective order that is wholly independent of the mind. One’s power of knowledge is a higher creative force in nature. What flashes like spiritual lightning within one is a divinity, hitherto subdued by magic spells; without one’s act of cognition, the god would lie fallow and have to await another deliverer. Hence human personality has a living meaning not just for itself and in itself, but for the world. From the Mystery point of view, life far tran- scends the limits of individual existence, making intelli- gible that glimpse of the Eternal conveyed by the verses of Pindar:"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Mysteries and Pre-Socratic Philosophy 35 Blessed is he who has seen these things, and then is laid in the hollow Earth. He knows life’s end; he knows the beginning ordained by Zeus. 39 We understand too those characteristic proud gestures of the philosophers such as Heraclitus, who could justly say that much had been revealed to them, since they attributed their knowledge not to the transitory self but to the immortal daimon within them. It was a pride necessarily impressed also with the seal of humility and modesty. That is shown by the words: All knowledge of transistory things is as changeable as those things themselves. For Heraclitus, Eternity is a game. It could be called the most serious matter, were it not that the word “serious” has been worn out by its application to mundane experiences. “Eternal play” gives us a freedom from anxieties in life, which human beings could not have if they took transitory conditions “seriously.” Pythagoras of Samos On the ground of the Mysteries there also came into being an understanding of the world that was neverthe- less different from that of Heraclitus. It sprang up in the communities founded in southern Italy by Pythagoras (sixth century B . C .). 40 The Pythagoreans regarded num- bers and geometrical forms, understood mathemati- cally, as the foundation of reality. Aristotle says of the Pythagoreans:"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"36 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT The so-called Pythagoreans led the field in mathe- matics and their studies convinced them that the principles of that science were of universal applica- tion. Numbers, of course, are by their very nature (i.e., as the simplest of mathematical objects) the first of those principles; and the Pythagoreans thought they saw in numbers, rather than in fire or earth or water, many resemblances to things that exist or that come into being. Thus they identified with certain properties of number justice, soul or mind, opportunity, and indeed, almost everything. They also realized that the properties and ratios of musical scales depend on numbers. In a word, they saw that other things, in respect of the whole of their nature, resemble numbers, and that numbers are the primary elements of the whole of nature. 41 The study of natural phenomena by means of the mathematical sciences must always lead to a kind of Pythagoreanism. If a string of a specific length is struck, it generates a particular note (a pitch). Shorten the string in accordance with certain numerical ratios, and other notes will be pro- duced. Thus pitch can be expressed in terms of numerical proportions. Physics likewise expresses relationships of color in numerical terms. And when two substances combine in a compound, it happens always in certain specific quantities that can be numerically expressed that the two substances come together. The Pythagoreans paid special attention to such instances of measure and"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Mysteries and Pre-Socratic Philosophy 37 proportion in nature. Geometrical figures play a similar role in nature, for instance in astronomy, in the applica- tion of mathematics to the heavenly bodies. Central to the way of thinking developed by the Pythagoreans is the fact that one discovers numerical and geometrical laws purely through autonomous mental activity. And when one’s gaze is turned toward the natural world, things obey the same laws that have been ascer- tained in one’s own soul. If one grasps the idea of an ellipse, one knows the laws of the ellipse. The heavenly bodies are found to move according to such laws, which have been so ascertained. 42 A direct corollary of this is that the operations of the human soul are not an activity set apart from the rest of the world. What is expressed in those operations is the pervasive cosmic order. In the Pythagorean view, the senses reveal sense-perceptible phenomena, but not the harmonious ordering principles that regulate them. These harmonizing and ordering prin- ciples must rather be discovered in the human mind, if one wishes to see them at work in outer nature. The deeper meaning of the world, which is expressed as an eternal law of necessity, appears in the human soul and first achieves immediacy and actuality there. The meaning of the cosmos is revealed in the soul. That meaning is not to be found in what we perceive by sight, hearing or touch; it must be brought up from the hidden depths of the soul, for it is there that the eternal laws lie hidden. To find the Eternal, one must go down into the psychic depths. In those depths is God—the eter- nal harmony of the cosmos."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"38 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT Thus, the human psyche is not limited to the confines of the body, enclosed within the skin; for what come to birth in the human soul are the laws which govern the stars in their courses. The soul is not confined by our per- sonal consciousness. In fact the personality is no more than the instrument through which the cosmic order manifests itself. The spirit of Pythagoras is caught by one of the Church Fathers, Gregory of Nyssa, who declared: We are told that human nature is a paltry thing, con- fined and small, whereas God is infinitely great. How then can what is paltry embrace the infinite? Yet who says this? Was the infinite God shut up within the flesh as in a vessel? Even in our own life, our own spiritual part is not shut in by the bound- aries of the flesh. The physical substance of the body is subject to limitation in space, but the soul reaches out in thought to move freely through the whole creation. 43 The soul does not coincide with the personality; its home is with infinity. From the Pythagorean point of view, it could only be foolishness to suppose that the power of the soul is exhausted in its personal expression. For the Pythagoreans as for Heraclitus, the point was the awakening within the personality of the Eternal. Knowledge to them meant an encounter with the Eter- nal. They valued people exactly to the degree that they brought the Eternal to manifestation. Life in a Pythag- orean community consisted of fostering in people that"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Mysteries and Pre-Socratic Philosophy 39 sense of an encounter with the Eternal, and their educa- tion was designed to bring the members to such an experience. Their education was thus a philosophical initiation; the Pythagoreans could well say that in their mode of life they were striving for a goal similar to that of the Mystery cults."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"40 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT CHAPTER 3 PLATONIC MYSTERIES The Mystery of Immortality The significance of the Mysteries for the intellectual life of the ancient Greeks can be appreciated when we exam- ine the case of Plato’s idea of the world. There is in fact only one way of making Plato fully intelligible, and that is to place him in the light that streams from the Myster- ies. According to his later followers, the Neoplatonists, he taught an esoteric doctrine to those he admitted as worthy to receive it, and placed them under a “seal of secrecy.” His teaching was regarded as secret in the same way that mysteriosophy was secret. 44 For our purposes it matters little whether or not the Sev- enth Letter attributed to Plato is genuine; it has been dis- puted—he, or someone else, expressed in the Letter the essentials of Plato’s attitude to the world. Take the follow- ing passage from the Letter: But this much at any rate I can affirm about any present or future writers who pretend to knowledge of the matters with which I concern myself, whether they claim to have been taught by me or by a third party or to have discovered the truth for themselves;"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Platonic Mysteries 41 in my judgment it is impossible that they should have any understanding of the subject. No treatise by me concerning it exists or ever will exist. It is not some- thing that can be put into words like other branches of learning; only after long partnership in a common life devoted to this very thing does truth flash upon the soul like a flame kindled by a leaping spark, and once it is born there it nourishes itself thereafter. 45 The words might be taken to signify merely the inade- quacy of verbal expression, a personal failing on the part of the writer, if we did not detect in them a Mystery-sense. Something that cannot and never will be put into words by Plato must refer to a matter about which all writing would be futile. It must mean a feeling, a sense of experi- ence that cannot readily be communicated, but can be gained only by “long partnership in a common life.” This indicates a special process of education given by Plato to the elect, who caught the fire that flashed from his words, whereas others received only ideas. Interpreting Plato’s dialogues depends very much on the manner of approach we adopt. Everyone, according to his or her spiritual condition, will find in them either more or less significance. What took place between Plato and his pupils was much more than the imparting of the words in their literal meaning. Studying with him meant living in the atmosphere of a Mystery. The words possessed overtones and resonances that could only be heard, how- ever, in the atmosphere of the Mystery; outside it, they died away unheard."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"42 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT The personality who stands at the center of the world we encounter in Plato’s dialogues is Socrates. We need not concern ourselves here with the actual, historical Socrates, only with the figure as he is presented by Plato. Through his death, as a martyr to truth, Socrates assumes a kind of saintliness. He died in the unique manner of an initiate, for whom death is simply another phase of life. He encoun- tered death just as he would any other circumstance, and such was his bearing that even among his friends the usual feelings connected with death were not stirred up. In the dialogue on the immortality of the soul, Phaedo says: My own feelings at the time were quite extraordi- nary. It never occurred to me to feel sorry for him, as you might have expected me to feel at the deathbed of a very dear friend. The Master seemed quite happy, Echecrates, both in his manner and in what he said; he met his death so fearlessly and nobly. I could not help feeling that even on his way to the other world he would be under the providence of God, and that when he arrived there all would be well with him, if it ever has been so with anybody. So I felt no sorrow at all, as you might have expected on such a solemn occasion. At the same time I felt no pleasure at being occupied in our usual philosophical discussions—that was the form our conversation took; I felt an absolutely incomprehen- sible emotion, a sort of curious blend of pleasure and pain combined, as my mind took it in that in a little while my friend was going to die. 46"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Platonic Mysteries 43 The dying Socrates discourses to his pupils on the theme of immortality. As one who has realized the worth- lessness of life, he furnishes a kind of proof utterly dis- tinct from any logical, rational arguments. It seems as if it were not a man speaking—the man who is passing away—but eternal truth itself which had taken up its abode in a transitory personality. The atmosphere where truth can resound seems to be found where temporal real- ity dissolves into nothingness. We hear nothing in the way of logical proofs of immor- tality. The entire discourse is designed to conduct his friends to a vision of the eternal. At that point they will require no proofs. What would be the point of proving that a rose is red to someone who can see it? What would be the point of proving the eternity of spirit to one whose eyes are open to the spirit? Socrates directs our attention to concrete events, actual experiences—above all to the experience of wisdom, and the fundamental quality of the struggle for wisdom: the struggle to free oneself from the superficial impressions of the senses, and to find the spirit within the world of the senses. Is that not in fact something equivalent to a kind of death? So at any rate thinks Socrates: Those who really apply themselves in the right way to philosophy are directly and of their own accord preparing themselves for dying and death, even if ordinary people seem not to realize it. If this is true, and they have actually been looking forward to death all their lives, it would of course be absurd to"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"44 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT be troubled when the thing comes for which they have so long been preparing and looking forward. 47 And he reinforces this by asking one of his friends: Do you think that it is right for a philosopher to con- cern himself with the so-called pleasures connected with food and drink?. . . What about sexual pleasures?. . . And what about the other attentions that we pay to our bodies? Do you think that a phi- losopher attaches any importance to them? I mean things like providing himself with smart clothes and shoes and other bodily ornaments; do you think that he values them or despises them—insofar as there is no real necessity for him to go in for that sort of thing? . . . Is it not your opinion in general that a man of this kind is not concerned with the body, but keeps his attention directed as much as he can away from it and toward the soul?. . . In this, then—in despising the body and avoiding it, and endeavoring to become independent—the philosopher’s soul is ahead of all the rest. 48 In conclusion, says Socrates, the pursuit of wisdom has this much in common with dying, that it leads a person away from the body. But to what does it lead? To the spiritual. Socrates takes up the theme: Now take the acquisition of knowledge; is the body a hindrance or not, if one takes it into partnership to"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Platonic Mysteries 45 share an investigation? What I mean is this: is there any certainty in human sight and hearing, or is it true, as the poets are always dinning into our ears, that we neither hear nor see anything accurately?... Then when is it that the soul attains to truth? When it tries to investigate anything with the help of the body, it is obviously led astray. 49 Everything we perceive with the help of bodily organs is subject to generation and decay: that is the very reason we are deluded. It is only the deeper insight into things furnished by reason that enables us to participate in their timeless truth. Hence the senses do not show the eternal to us in its real Form, and if we trust them uncritically they become delusive. They cease to be so when we con- front them with the evidences of rational insight, and put their results to the test of insight derived from thought. Now, how would it be possible for reason to pass judg- ment on the things of sense if there were not within it something that transcended sense perception? If that is so, then, our faculty of distinguishing true things from false must be set in opposition to our bodily senses and is not subject to the conditions that bind them. In particular it cannot be subject to the law of coming-to-be and passing- away, for it contains in it the True, which has no yesterday or today, and unlike the things of sense cannot fluctuate from one day to another. The True must itself be eternal. And insofar as the philosopher turns away from the per- ishable objects of sense and turns toward the True, he or she enters the domain of the eternal. And if we immerse"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"46 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT ourselves totally in the spirit, we are living totally in the True. The sense-world is simply no longer there for us in its merely sensible form. Socrates says: Don’t you think that the person who is likely to suc- ceed in this attempt most perfectly is the one who approaches each object, as far as possible, with the unaided intellect, without taking account of any sense of sight in his thinking, or dragging any other sense into his reckoning—the man who pursues truth by applying his pure and unadulterated thought to the pure and unadulterated object, cutting himself off as much as possible from his eyes and ears and virtually all the rest of his body, as an impediment which by its presence prevents the soul from attain- ing to truth and clear thinking? 50 And a little later: Is not what we call death a freeing and separation of soul from body?... And the desire to free the soul is found chiefly, or rather only, in the true philosopher; in fact the philosopher’s occupation consists pre- cisely in the freeing and separation of soul from body.... Well then, as I said at the beginning, if a man has trained himself throughout his life to life in a state as close as possible to death, would it not be ridiculous for him to be distressed when death comes to him?... Then it is a fact, Simmias, that true philosophers make dying their profession, and that to them of all men, death is least alarming. 51"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Platonic Mysteries 47 All higher moral action springs also, according to Socrates, from the liberation of the soul from the body. Anyone who just follows the promptings of the body is not behaving morally. Socrates asks: Who is that we call valiant? The man who, rather than following the body, follows the dictates of the spirit, even when these imperil the body. And who shows self-control? Is it not called self-control when we see someone not being carried away by the desires, but preserving a decent indifference toward them; is not this appropriate only to those who regard the body with the greatest indifference and spend their lives in philosophy? 52 And Socrates treats all the other virtues in like manner. He then goes on to characterize intellectual insight itself. What is it that we call “knowing” as such? Without doubt, knowing is attained by the forming of judgments: I form a judgment about some object before me, for example, that the thing in front of me is a tree. Now, how do I reach that assertion? Only by knowing already what a tree is, and recollecting my idea of a tree. A tree is a per- ceptible thing; thus when I recollect a tree, I am recalling at the same time a perceptible object, and in saying that something is a tree I am likening it to other things that have formerly been objects of my perception and that I know are trees. In this sense knowledge is dependent on the power of recollection. Recollection permits me to compare with one another the multiplicity of perceptible things; but this does not"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"48 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT explain the sum total of my knowledge. Suppose I see two things that are alike, and form the judgment “These things are alike.” But in actuality no two things are exactly alike, only alike in certain particular ways. The idea of likeness therefore cannot arise from perceived actuality, but is independent of it. It comes to my aid in forming a judgment, just as recollection helps toward judgment, toward knowledge when, in the case of a tree, I recall other trees. In the case of two things related in particular ways, I recollect the idea of likeness. Ideas thus come before me in the same way as recollections but without being dependent on perceived actuality. All kinds of knowledge that are not derived from sense-per- ception rely on such ideas. The field of mathematics con- sists entirely of such ideas. It would be a poor geometrician who could only deal mathematically with things one can see or touch! In this way we have thoughts that are not derived from transitory outer nature but arise purely in a spiritual way. And it is these very ideas that show all the marks of timeless truth. The con- tent of mathematics will be eternally valid, even if the universe were to go to pieces tomorrow and a completely new world arise. The conditions of a new world order might be such as to render current mathematical ideas inapplicable; but they would remain intrinsically valid in themselves. When the soul withdraws into itself, only then is it able to bring forth such eternal ideas. 53 Therefore the soul is akin to the True, the Eternal, not to the transitoriness and appearance of the sense-world. Hence Socrates asserts:"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Platonic Mysteries 49 But when the soul investigates by itself, it passes into the realm of the pure and everlasting and immortal and changeless; and being of a kindred nature, when it is once independent and free from interference, consorts with it always and strays no longer, but remains, in that realm of the absolute, constant and invariable, through contact with beings of the same nature. And this condition of the soul we call Wisdom. . . . Now, see whether this is our conclusion from all that we have said. The soul is most like that which is divine, immortal, intelli- gible, uniform, indissoluble, and ever self-consis- tent and invariable; whereas body is most like that which is human, mortal, multiform, unintelligible, dissoluble, and never self-consistent. . . . Very well, if this is the soul’s condition, then it departs at death to that place which is, like itself, invisible, divine, immortal, and wise; where, on its arrival, happiness awaits it, and release from uncertainty and folly, from fears and uncontrolled desires, and all other human evils; and where (as they say of the initiates in the Mysteries) it really spends the rest of time with God. 54 It is not the aim here to summarize all the ways in which Socrates leads his friends to the Eternal. For the spirit of all of them is the same: all point to the difference between the path of the changeable impressions of the senses and that of the mind alone with itself. It is to the inherent character of the spiritual that Socrates points his"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"50 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT hearers. If they can find this out, they will see for them- selves with the inner eye that it is eternal. The dying Socrates does not give a proof of immortal- ity. He simply lays bare the nature of the soul. And then it transpires that coming-to-be and passing-away, birth and death, have nothing to do with the essential soul. This has its being in the True; and the True cannot come into exist- ence nor pass away. The soul and becoming can have no more to do with one another than an odd number with an even number. But death belongs to the process of becom- ing. Hence the soul can have nothing to do with death. How can we do other than admit that the immortal can as little participate in mortality as the even in the odd? And, continues Socrates: If what is immortal is also imperishable, it is impos- sible that at the approach of death soul should cease to be. It follows from what we have already said that it cannot admit death, or be dead; just as we said that three cannot be even, or any odd number. 55 Surveying the whole course of the dialogue conducted by Socrates, which leads to a perception of the Eternal in human individual existence, his hearers take up his ideas; they search within themselves for something that will answer in the affirmative to those ideas from their own experience; they make objections as these occur to them. But what has happened by the end of the dialogue? They have discovered something within themselves that they"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Platonic Mysteries 51 did not formerly possess. They have not just acquired abstract knowledge, but have gone through a process, and something has stirred to life in them that was not previ- ously there. Is that not comparable to an initiation? Is that not the reason why Plato chooses to set forth his philoso- phy in dialogue form? It is a literary Mystery, exactly analogous to the processes that took place at the centers of initiation. There are many places in his writings where Plato tes- tifies to this in his own words. Plato’s aim as a teacher of philosophy was to be a hierophant, insofar as this was possible in the philosophical medium. Clearly Plato real- ized the agreement of his methods with those of the Mys- teries, and regards them as successful precisely when they lead to the goals that the mystai too would reach. Thus he says in the Timaeus: Of course everyone with the least sense always calls on God at the beginning of any undertaking, small or great. So surely, if we are not quite crazy, as we embark on our account of how the universe began, or perhaps had no beginning, we must pray to all the gods and goddesses that what we say will be pleasing to them first, and then to ourselves. 56 Plato promises those who follow such a course that “some protecting deity will see us safely through a strange and unusual argument and bring us to a likely conclusion.” 57"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"52 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT The Mystery of Creation It is in the Timaeus above all that the Platonic world- view stands revealed in its character of a Mystery. From the very beginning of the dialogue the conversation con- cerns an “initiation”; Solon is “initiated” into the Mys- teries of creation and into the mythological traditions which use pictures to symbolize eternal truth by an Egyptian priest. “There have been, and will be many dif- ferent calamities to destroy mankind,” the priest tells Solon: The greatest of them by fire and water, lesser ones by countless other means. Your own story of how Phaethon, child of the Sun, harnessed his father’s chariot, but was unable to guide it along his father’s course, and so burnt up things on the Earth, and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt, is a mythical version of the truth that there is at long intervals a variation in the course of the heavenly bodies and a consequent widespread destruction by fire of things on the Earth. 58 This passage in the Timaeus demonstrates the attitude of the initiates toward the well-known myths. They see through to the truth that is veiled behind their imagery. As the cosmogonic drama unfolds in the Timaeus , we are led by following the traces that point back to the origin of the world to an intimation of the primordial power, out of which everything came into existence:"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Platonic Mysteries 53 For to discover the maker and Father of this universe is indeed a hard task, and having found him it would be impossible to tell everyone about him. 59 The mystai understand the force of that word “impos- sible.” It points toward the inner drama of the Godhead. For them, God is not revealed in the materially compre- hensible world where he is manifest only as nature, in which he lies under a spell. He can be apprehended, as was taught in the Mysteries, only by one who awakens the divine within. That is why he cannot be made intelligible to everyone. But even to one who draws near to him, he does not appear in his own nature. This too is explained in the Timaeus. The Father made the universe out of the world-body and world-soul. He mixed the elements, in harmony and perfect proportion—elements that he himself brought into being by pouring himself out, giving up his separate existence. Thus he produced the world-body. And stretched out upon it, in the form of a cross, is the world- soul, the divine presence in the world. It suffers death on this cross so that the world can exist. And Plato therefore calls nature the “tomb” of the divine—not however a tomb in which lies something dead, but the tomb where lies the Eternal, for which death is nothing but the oppor- tunity to demonstrate the omnipotence of life!

And where can this happen except in the soul of an initiate? Thus wisdom takes on its proper meaning in a cosmic setting: knowledge is the resurrection, the libera- tion of God. In the Timaeus the world is presented developing out of the imperfect into the perfect. The concept is one of pro- gressive process, of beings developing; and in this process God reveals himself. Coming-into-being is the resurrec- tion of God from the “tomb.” And within this develop- ment the human being appears. Plato demonstrates that with the appearance of the human being something unique enters in. Now of course for Plato the whole world is itself a divine being, and humanity is not more divine than other beings. But in other beings God is present only in a hidden manner, in humanity God is manifest. The Timaeus con- cludes with the words: We can now claim that our account of the universe is complete. For our world has now received its full complement of living creatures, mortal and immor- tal; it is a visible living creature; it contains all crea- tures that are visible and is itself an image of the intelligible; and it has thus become a visible god, supreme in greatness and excellence, beauty, and perfection, a single, uniquely created heaven. 60 But this single and uniquely created world would not be perfect if it did not contain among its images the image of its Creator himself. And that image can arise only from the human soul; it is not the Father himself, but the Son,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Platonic Mysteries 55 the living child of God in the soul who is of like nature with the Father, to whom humanity can give birth. The expression “Son of God” is used in this context by Philo of Alexandria, who was called a Plato redivivus . It designates the Wisdom that lives in the soul and is born of human beings, having as its content the reason immanent in the world; while this world-reason, Logos , figures as the book in which “every permanent characteristic of the world is recorded and inscribed.” 61 Or elsewhere it is the “Son of God”: Following the ways of the Father, he fashions mate- rial objects after his contemplation of their eternal Forms. 62 Philo anticipates the language applied to Christ when he speaks of this Logos from a platonizing viewpoint: As God is the first and only king of the universe, the way to him is rightly called the “royal road.” Con- sider this road as philosophy. . . the road taken by the ancient company of ascetics, who turned away from the entangling fascination of pleasure and devoted themselves to a noble and earnest cultivation of the beautiful. The Law names this royal road, which we call true philosophy, the Word and Spirit of God. 63 To travel this road is for Philo equivalent to an initiation in the Mysteries. On it he will encounter the Logos , which is for him the “Son of God”:"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"56 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT I do not shrink from relating what has happened to me innumerable times. Often when I wished to put my philosophical thoughts in writing in my accus- tomed way, and saw quite clearly what was to be set down, I found my mind barren and rigid, so that I was obliged to give up without having accomplished anything, and seemed to be beset with idle fancies. At the same time I marveled at the power of the real- ity of thought, with which it rests to open and close the womb of the human soul. At other times, how- ever, I would begin empty and arrive, without any trouble, at fullness. Thoughts came flying like snow- flakes or grains of corn invisibly from above, and it was as though divine power took hold of me and inspired me, so that I did not know where I was, who was with me, who I was, or what I was saying or writing; for then a flow of ideas was given me, a delightful clearness, keen insight, and lucid mastery of material, as if the inner eye were now able to see everything with the greatest clarity. 64 Anyone can see from the mode of presentation of this “road” that it leads to the consciousness, when the Logos is vitally active within, of flowing in one current with the divine. That is clear too in the following passage: When the spirit, moved by love, takes its flight into the holy of holies, soaring joyfully on divine wings, it forgets everything else and itself. It holds to and is filled only with the Power of which it is the follower"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Platonic Mysteries 57 and servant, and to this it offers the incense of the most sacred and chaste virtue. 65 For Philo there are only two alternatives—to follow the way of the senses (perception and intellect), in which case one is confined in the limits of oneself and draws back from the cosmos; or to become aware of the universal Power and so, within one’s own self, experience the Eternal: He who wishes to escape from God falls into his own hands. For there are two things to be consid- ered: the universal spirit, which is God, and one’s own spirit. The latter flees to and takes refuge in the universal spirit, for one who goes out beyond his own spirit says to himself that it is nothing, and relates everything to God; but one who turns away from God discards him as First Cause, and makes himself the cause of everything that happens. 66 In the platonic world-view, knowledge possesses an intrinsically religious character. It serves to bring the act of knowing into connection with the highest aspirations of human feeling—and only when it fulfills human desire completely does it rank, for Plato, as certain knowledge. It is then no longer representational or picture-making knowledge: it is an achieved reality of life. Knowledge according to Plato is a higher humanity within the external human form, the essence, of whom the personal self is nothing more than a secondary image. Within human beings themselves is born the transcendent,"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"58 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT “macrocosmic Man.” And this brings us once more into the terrain of the Mystery-cults and their secret teach- ings, given a new form of expression in the platonic phi- losophy. We know of this secret doctrine from the report of Hippolytus, one of the Church Fathers. “This is the great and ineffable Mystery of the Samothracians,” he says, referring to the guardians of a particular Mystery- cult: Only the initiates are permitted to know it. For in their Mysteries the Samothracians have the explicit tradi- tion of a primordial, macrocosmic Man (Adam). 67 The Mystery of Love It is also as an “initiation” that we have to interpret the Symposium —the platonic “Dialogue on Love.” Love figures here as the herald of wisdom. We have seen that wisdom is the eternal Logos , the “Son” of the eternal world-Father. To this Logos love stands in the position of a Mother. Before even so much as a spark of the light of wisdom can be struck in the human soul, there must be present in it an obscure urge or longing for the divine. Unconsciously it must draw one in the direction of what will subsequently, when it is raised into conscious- ness, constitute one’s highest bliss. Heraclitus appre- hended the daimon in human beings; in Plato this is connected with the idea of love. The Symposium comprises speeches on love from men of the most diverse social standing and attitudes to life:"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Platonic Mysteries 59 ordinary people, politicians, and intellectuals are repre- sented, from the comic poet Aristophanes to the tragic poet Agathon. In keeping with their different places in life, they all have different experiences and views of love. And from the way they express themselves, the level at which their daimon stands is made manifest. The role of love is to draw one being to another. The diversity of “the many” into which the unified Godhead has poured itself out strives through love to return to unity and connected- ness. Thus love is tinged with divinity. To understand it, one must also participate in the divine. After people of several stages of maturity have expounded their notions of love, Socrates takes up the thread of the discourse and treats of love from the view- point of the knower. Love he denies to be a god, though it is something that leads humanity toward God. But love— eros —is not a divinity; for God is perfection, and con- tains the idea of the Beautiful and the Good, whereas eros is only a longing for the Beautiful and the Good. It occu- pies an intermediate position between humanity and God. It is a daimon , a being whose nature stands between the earthly and the heavenly. It is a significant point that Socrates does not purport to give his own ideas on the subject of love, but only claims to recount what he received as a revelation from a woman; it is from the mantic art (divination) that he derives his conception of love. The priestess Diotima woke within Socrates the daimonic power that will lead him to the world of the divine. It was she who “initiated” him, as we are told in a highly revealing passage of the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"60 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT Symposium. And now the question cannot be avoided: Who is this “wise woman” who woke the daimon in Socrates? She must certainly be more than a poetic fic- tion. No actual “wise woman” on the perceptible plane could have woken the daimon in his soul, however, since the power of awakening lies in the soul itself. It is in Socrates’ own soul in fact that we must look for this “wise woman.” At the same time there must be some reason why the one who raises the daimon in the soul into full reality should take on external, actual existence. It is because this power does not work as do the forces that are inherent in and native to the life of the soul itself. Evi- dently it is the soul-force that precedes the coming of wis- dom that Socrates represents with the figure of a “wise woman”: the Mother-principle, which gives birth to Wis- dom, the “Son of God,” the Logos. The “Woman” stands for the power that is active unconsciously in the soul, that brings about the raising into consciousness of the divine element in humanity. The soul, which has not yet found wisdom, is the “mother” of that experience of divinization. Here we come to one of the central conceptions of Mystery-teaching, which acknowledges the human soul as the mother of the god, leading human beings unconsciously and with the inevi- tability of a natural force to their union with the divine. 68 All this casts light on the Mystery-interpretation of Greek myths. According to this, as we have seen, the world of the gods is something generated in the human soul, and the gods we behold are images we have our- selves created. But then we must win through to a further"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Platonic Mysteries 61 understanding. We must be able to take the divine cre- ative power that is present in ourselves—from which the images of the gods are derived—and form that power itself into divine images, so that behind the world of the gods we shape an image of the divine Mother. This is none other than the archetypal power of the human soul. Thus mythology places the goddesses alongside the male gods. Our interpretation of this may be exemplified in a study of the myths about Dionysus. Dionysus is the son of Zeus and a mortal mother, Semele. But the mother is killed by lightning. Zeus, how- ever, snatches the still unformed child and allows it to grow within his own thigh where it lies concealed. Hera, the mother of the gods, stirs up the enmity of the Titans against Dionysus, and they tear the child limb from limb. But Pal- las Athene rescues the still-beating heart and brings it to Zeus. Out of it he engenders his son for a second time. 69 The myth can be seen as representing a psychological process of an extremely inward character. Let us interpret it after the fashion of the Egyptian priest who instructed Solon in the nature of myths. It is related that Dionysus was born as the son of God and a mortal mother, was dismembered and then reborn. This has a fantastic ring to it, but the truth contained in the story is the birth of the divine and its subsequent destiny in individual human souls. The divine is united with the soul, which is still subject to time and earthly conditions; and as soon as the god, the Dionysiac spirit, stirs within the soul, it experiences a longing for its real spiritual form. How- ever, consciousness—again imaged as a female deity,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"62 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT Hera—appears and becomes jealous of the offspring from a qualitatively higher consciousness. She rouses the lower aspects of human nature—the Titans—and the unformed divine child is dismembered. The divine knowledge exists in humanity, but “dismembered” by the under- standing that is bound to the senses. If on the other hand there is within the individual sufficient higher wisdom, this latter nurses and cherishes the unformed child until it is born again as a second son of God—Dionysus. And thus sense-derived understanding, the dismembered divine force in human beings, is reborn as the undivided wisdom that is identical with the Logos . It is the son of God and a mortal mother, who is the transitory human soul aspiring unconsciously after the divine. We are still far removed from the spiritual reality that is played out in the myth if we recognize in it only psycho- logical processes, and pictures of psychological events, at that. This spiritual reality is not something that the soul experiences as confined to itself. It is rather released from itself to take part in a cosmic event. The reality of the myths is enacted not within but outside the soul. Platonic philosophy is closely related to Greek myth, just as mysteriosophy is close to myth. Once begotten, the gods were the objects of external religious devotion. The story of their genesis was kept as a secret belonging to the Mysteries. We can hardly be surprised that it was consid- ered dangerous to betray the Mysteries, for it meant betraying the way the public divinities came into being. To those who understand it rightly this is salutary knowl- edge, but destructive to those who do not."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Myth and Mysteriosophy 63 CHAPTER 4 MYTH AND MYSTERIOSOPHY The Structures of Myth The powers and beings that the initiates in the ancient Mysteries sought to find within themselves remain unknown to anyone whose horizon is bounded by received ideas. For the mystai did not hold back from the great question. They inquired into their own spiritual nature and into powers and laws beyond those of lower, natural existence. In our ordinary life of thought based on the senses and what may be inferred from them, we worship gods of our own making, or—when we find this out, are driven to disclaim them. The mystai , however are aware of their god-making, and they understand the reasons why they do so. They have won through, as we should say, to the underlying laws that govern the process of making gods. 70 It is rather as if a plant were suddenly to become aware of the laws that determine its own growth and development. Up to now it has developed in serene unconsciousness, but once it knows the laws of its own being, it necessarily changes fundamentally its whole relationship to itself. The poet’s celebration of the plant- world, the scientist’s investigation of botanical principles"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"64 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT would now come before it as a conscious ideal. Such is the case of the mystai in their own sphere with regard to the laws and the forces active within them. They have attained a gnosis , and consciously create something divine, something beyond themselves. The initiates looked upon the well-known gods and myths, created by the people in an activity transcending the given world of nature, in the same way. They aspired to understand the laws governing the world of gods and myths. Where they found the figure of some divinity worshipped by the people, or a myth being told, they looked for a higher truth. 71 Let us take an example. The Athenians had been forced by King Minos of Crete to deliver up to him every eight years seven boys and seven maidens. These were thrown to the Minotaur, a horrible monster, to be devoured. When it came to the third time for the mournful tribute to be paid, Theseus, the King’s son, went with it to Crete. On his arrival in Crete, King Minos’ daughter Ariadne came to his aid. The Minotaur was kept in the Labyrinth, a maze from which no one who entered it could ever find the way out. Now Theseus wished to deliver his native city from such a shameful tribute, and so had to be cast into the Laby- rinth, as if to become the monster’s prey, and then kill the Minotaur. This task he undertook, overcame the formida- ble enemy, and then regained the open air; for Ariadne had given him a ball of thread to help him. The mystai wanted to understand how the creative human mind came to invent such a story. They studied the creative spirit in order to understand it, rather as a"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Myth and Mysteriosophy 65 botanist studies plants. They were looking for a truth, an implicit wisdom, in what the myth expressed in popular form. Sallust adopts the standpoint of the Mysteries when he characterizes “myth” in such terms: The universe itself can be called a myth, since bod- ies and material objects are apparent in it, while souls and intellects are concealed. Furthermore, to wish to teach all men the truth about the gods causes the foolish to despise—because they cannot learn— and the good to be slothful; whereas to conceal the truth by myths prevents the former from despising philosophy and compels the latter to study it. 72 The mystai were aware of adding something to the myth that did not exist in the consciousness of the ordi- nary people when they sought for its “implicit truth.” They placed themselves in the position of a scientist studying a plant. They were putting into words some- thing totally foreign to the mythological consciousness, yet they looked upon it as the deeper truth, expressed in symbols through the myth; thus we confront our own sensual nature as though it were a fierce monster. The fruits of our personal development fall as sacrifices to it, and it continues to devour us until the hero, the con- queror (Theseus) awakens in us. And it is through knowledge that we are able to slay the enemy—spinning the thread by means of which we find the way out of the labyrinth of our sensual nature. Human knowledge itself is the mystery expressed in this story of the conquering of sensuality. This is the “secret” known to the mystai."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"66 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT The Mystery-interpretation points to a psychological power in us. It is not a power of which we are normally aware; nevertheless it is active within us, generating the myth. And the myth has the same structure as the truth of the Mysteries. It is in this way that the truth finds its symbol in the myth. What, then, do we find in myths? They are the expres- sion of a creative spirit, of the unconscious activity of the soul. The soul’s creative work is determined by specific laws; it must be active in a particular way if it is to create something with a meaning beyond itself. On the mytho- logical level it works with images. But the way these images are structured follows psychological laws. Hence one could add that when the soul develops beyond the mythological stage of consciousness to deeper forms of truth, these nevertheless bear the imprint of the same power that generated the myths. 73 The relationship between mythical imagery as a form of representation and higher, philosophical knowledge is thus stated by Plotinus from the standpoint of the Neo- platonic school, in connection with the guardians of priestly wisdom in Egypt: Whether as a result of rigorous investigations, or instinctively, in imparting their wisdom, the wise men of the Egyptians do not expound their teaching and precepts by means of written signs, which are imitations of voice and speech. Instead they draw pictures; and in their temple engravings they illus- trate the thought that goes with each particular thing,"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Myth and Mysteriosophy 67 so that every picture is an object which embodies knowledge and wisdom as a totality, without any analysis or discussion. Only afterwards is the con- tent of the picture elicited verbally, and it is explained why it is so and not otherwise. 74 The best place to examine the relation of mythical nar- ratives to the nature of the Mysteries is in the outlook of those thinkers who acknowledge a harmony between their way of representing the world and the Mystery-pro- cess. That harmony is most fully documented in the case of Plato. From Myth to Philosophy Plato’s interpretation of myths, and use of them in his teaching, may be regarded as a model case. Thus in the Phaedrus , or dialogue on the nature of the soul, we are introduced to the myth of Boreas. This is the god whose presence was felt in the blustering north wind. He caught sight one day of the beautiful Oreithyia, who was the daughter of Erechtheus, king of Attica, as she was out plucking flowers with her playmates. He was seized with love for her, carried her off, and brought her to his cave. Through his mouthpiece in the dialogue, Socrates, Plato rejects the purely rationalistic interpretation of the myth, according to which the story is a poetic expression of purely natural, physical happenings—the stormwind caught the princess and blew her over the edge of the cliff. Socrates comments:"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"68 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT Such explanations are too ingenious and labored, it seems to me, and I don’t altogether envy the man who devotes himself to this sort of work, if only because when he has finished with Oreithyia, he must go on to put into proper shape . . . all the other such monsters of mythology .... A skeptic who pro- poses to force each one of them into a plausible shape with the aid of a sort of rough ingenuity will need a great deal of leisure. . . . So I let these things alone and acquiesce in the popular attitude toward them; as I’ve already said, I make myself, rather than them, the object of my investigations, and I try to discover whether I am a more complicated and puffed-up sort of creature than Typhon, or whether I am a more gentle and simpler creature, endowed by heaven with a nature altogether less typhonic. 75 Thus we see that Plato is no enthusiast for the intellec- tual and rationalistic interpretation of myth, and this must be taken into account when we examine his own use of myths to express his own views. Plato has recourse to myth when he comes to speak of the life of the soul. At that juncture, where he leaves the transitory world to seek after the eternal core of the soul, concepts deriving from the senses and from the thinking based upon them no longer apply. The Phaedrus is devoted to the theme of the eternal in the soul, and the soul is described as a chariot with two horses, each many-winged, and a charioteer. One of the horses is doc- ile and intelligent, the other headstrong and wild. When"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Myth and Mysteriosophy 69 the chariot meets with an obstacle on its path, the head- strong beast seizes the chance of impeding the reliable one and defying the charioteer. And when the chariot reaches the point of ascending in the wake of the gods up the celestial steep, the intractable horse throws it into confusion. Whether the chariot can surmount these diffi- culties and attain to the realm of the supersensible depends on their relative strengths and so whether the good horse can gain the mastery. But the soul can never raise itself to the divine without some sort of a struggle. Some souls rise higher in their pursuit of the eternal vision, others less high. Those souls that have attained the transcendent vision are kept safe until the next cycle, while those who have seen nothing but were thwarted by the unruly horse must enter upon a new cycle and try again. The cycles here des- ignate the several incarnations of the soul—one cycle standing for its life as a particular personality. The unruly horse and the intelligent horse stand for the lower and the higher aspects of human nature; the charioteer for the soul, which aspires to “divinization” as in the Mysteries. Plato appeals to the power of myth when he wants to describe the course of the eternal soul through its mani- fold transformations. And elsewhere in the platonic canon myth is used to render intelligible through symbolic sto- ries the non-sensory, inner reality of human existence. 76 In the light of this principle it is worth considering the Egyptian Mystery of Osiris. In Osiris we have a figure who gradually became one of the most important gods of the country. A significant"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"70 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT cycle of myths grew up concerning Osiris and his consort Isis. According to the story, Osiris was the son of the Sun- god; he had a brother, Typhon (Set), and a sister, Isis. Osiris married his sister and with her reigned over Egypt. But his wicked brother Typhon plotted to overthrow Osiris and prepared a chest that was exactly the length of Osiris’ body. The chest was presented as a gift at a ban- quet to whatever person it fitted exactly; this turned out to be none other than Osiris, who lay down in the chest. Immediately Typhon and his confederates seized upon Osiris, closed the chest, and threw it into the river. When Isis heard the terrible news, she wandered in despair searching for her husband’s body. But when she found it, Typhon again managed to take possession of it; he tore it into fourteen pieces, which were dispersed in different locations; several “tombs of Osiris” were shown in Egypt. The limbs of the god were thus to be found scattered here and there in widely separated places. Osiris himself, how- ever, came forth from the netherworld and vanquished Typhon. A ray from him fell upon Isis, who in conse- quence bore his son, Harpocrates (Horus). 77 And now compare with the myth the world-view pre- sented by the fifth century B . C . Greek philosopher Empedocles. He asserted that an original unity was torn apart into the four elements (fire, water, earth, and air) or into the multiplicity of existent beings. He posited two opposing powers, which bring about within the world of existing things the processes of becoming and passing-away, namely Love and Strife. Empedocles says of the elements:"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Myth and Mysteriosophy 71 They remain forever the same, yet mingling each with the others Become transformed into men and numberless crea- tures besides them. Now they are joined into one, Love binding the many together, Now they are scattered once more, dispersed through hatred and Strife. 78 From the Empedoclean standpoint, everything in the universe is simply the elements in different combina- tions. Things could only come into existence because the primal unity was torn apart into four natures, dispersed into the elements of the cosmos. Hence if we encounter something, it is a constituent part of the scattered divin- ity. But the divinity is hidden in things as we see them; it had to perish in order for things to come into existence. For what are things but combinations of the members of God, organized into wholes by Love and Strife? In the words of Empedocles: See, for a clear demonstration, how the limbs of a man are constructed, All that the body possesses, in beauty and pride of existence, Brought together by Love, the elements forming a union. Then come hatred and Strife, and fatally tear them asunder, Once more they wander alone, on the desolate con- fines of life."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"72 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT So is it with the bushes and trees and the water-inhabit- ing fishes, Animals roaming the mountains, sea-birds borne by their wings. 79 Empedocles clearly implies that the philosopher is one who rediscovers the divine original unity in things, hid- den under a spell, whirled about by Love and Strife. But if we find the divinity who is hidden there, we must our- selves be divine beings. For Empedocles adheres to the view that “like can only be known by like.” 80 These ideas about the nature of humanity and the cos- mos transcend considerations of sense experience. They are ideas that the mystai found in their myth of Osiris: the god, the creative power is poured out into the world. This appears in Empedocles’ four elements. God—Osiris—is slain. Human beings, with their knowledge (which is divine in nature) will restore him to life. We are to redis- cover him in the form of Horus (Son of God, Logos , wis- dom) in the opposition between Strife (Typhon) and Love (Isis). In a Greek way, Empedocles expresses his basic ideas in terms that still have a mythical ring; his Love is the goddess Aphrodite, his Strife is Neikos, divine beings who bind and loose the elements. Myths of Initiation The style in which the content of myth has been described here should not be equated with a “symbolic” or “allegorical” approach to myth. Nothing of that kind is"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Myth and Mysteriosophy 73 intended. The images that form the content of the myth are not invented symbols for abstract truths. They are actual experiences in the soul of the initiates. The initiates in the Mysteries experienced these images with spiritual organs of perception, as ordinary people experienced the impressions of their eyes and ears. Just as such impressions are nothing in themselves but must be evoked in perception through contact with an external object, so are the mythological images nothing unless they are activated by spiritual facts; the difference is only that in sense-perception a person is outside the objects, whereas the mythological images can only be a real expe- rience when a person stands within the spiritual processes to which they correspond. And that means, as the ancient mystai knew, going through an initiation. The spiritual happenings that the initiate perceives are then given pictorial form by the images of the myth. It is impossible to understand the workings of myth unless we realize that it clothed in pictures actual spiritual expe- riences. The spiritual processes themselves are supersen- sible. The images, whose content is a reminiscence of the sense-perceptible world, are not themselves spiritual but only clothe the spiritual in pictures. To live merely in the images would be to dream. The spiritual experience is only accessible to those who are able to sense the reality behind the images, just as we sense the real rose through the impressions of our senses. This is the reason [also] why mythological images are never unambiguous. Their character as pictorial illustra- tions means that the same myths may give expression to"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"74 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT a variety of spiritual events. Hence it is not a contradic- tion when interpreters of myth relate a particular story now to one and now to another spiritual fact. From this point of view we can follow a thread through the multiplicity of the Greek myths. To begin with we may consider the saga of Heracles. A new light is thrown upon the “twelve labors” imposed on the hero, deepening their significance, when we notice that before the culmi- nating, most difficult labor he has himself initiated in the Mysteries of Eleusis. In the service of Eurystheus, king of Mycenae, he has to descend into the underworld and bring back with him the hell-hound Cerberus. To enable him to descend into hell, Heracles has to be initiated; the role of the Mysteries was to lead a person through the death of the perishable nature, that is, into the under- world. And through initiation, his eternal part was redeemed from the power of death. Thus it was that the mystes overcame death, and it is as an initiate that Hera- cles overcomes the dangers of the underworld. 81 The voyage of the Argonauts can be similarly inter- preted. Phrixus and his sister Helle, children of a Boeo- tian king, suffered badly at the hands of their stepmother. The gods sent them a ram with a golden fleece, which carried them away through the air. As they flew over the strait between Europe and Asia, Helle fell in and was drowned—which gives the strait its name, Hellespont. Phrixus however reached the king of Colchis on the east- ern shore of the Black Sea, where he sacrificed the ram to the gods and gave its fleece to King Aeetes. He caused it to be hung up in a grove and guarded by a terrible"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Myth and Mysteriosophy 75 dragon. It was the Greek hero Jason, in company with the other heroes Heracles, Theseus, Orpheus, and so on, who undertook to fetch the fleece from Colchis. Aeetes laid upon Jason severe conditions for the attainment of the fleece; but Medea, the King’s daughter, was skilled in magic and came to his aid. He harnessed two fire-breath- ing bulls and ploughed a field, sowing it with dragon’s teeth. When these sprang up into armed men, on Medea’s advice he threw a stone amongst them, whereupon they turned and killed one another. It is by Medea’s magic that Jason lulls the dragon to sleep and so wins the fleece. He then returns with it to Greece, taking Medea as his wife. The king pursues the fugitives, and in order to delay him, Medea kills her little brother Apsyrtus and scatters his limbs in the sea. Aeetes pauses to collect them and so the pair reach Jason’s homeland with the fleece. Every detail of the story requires elucidation in depth. The fleece is something pertaining to humanity that is infinitely precious, something lost since the time of the beginning, and which can be recovered only by the overcoming of terrible powers; such is the situation with regard to the eternal in the human soul. The eternal belongs to human beings, yet we find ourselves divided from it by our own lower nature, and we can attain to it only when we conquer and lull to sleep our lower self. That is made possible when the magic power of our own consciousness (Medea) comes to our aid. Medea becomes for Jason what Diotima was for Socrates when she instructed him in the Mysteries of love. Humanity’s own wisdom possesses the magic power of conquering"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"76 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT the transitory and attaining to divinity. From our lower nature, on the other hand, only a debased humanity—the armed men—can spring; this is overcome by spiritual and intellectual means, the advice of Medea. But even when the hero has found the eternal—the fleece—he is not yet safe. A part of his consciousness—Apsyrtus— must be offered up as a sacrifice. This is demanded by the nature of the sense-perceptible world, which is only to be comprehended by us as a manifold, “dismem- bered” domain. We might go still further into the spiri- tual processes underlying these images, but the intention here is only to indicate the principle underlying the for- mation of myths. Special interest attaches from this point of view to the saga of Prometheus. Prometheus and Epimetheus are sons of the Titan Iapetus. The Titans are the children of the oldest generation of the gods, Uranus (Heaven) and Gaia (Earth). Kronos, the youngest of the Titans, usurped his father’s throne and seized the rulership of the world. He was overthrown in his turn by his son, Zeus, along with the other Titans; Zeus then became the supreme among the gods. In the Titanomachy, Prometheus sided with Zeus, and it was on his advice that Zeus banished the Titans to the underworld. Nevertheless the Titan dis- position still lived on in Prometheus—he was only half a friend to Zeus. When Zeus was about to destroy human- kind on account of their hubris , Prometheus took up their cause and taught them numbers, writing, and that other prerequisite of culture, the use of fire. 82 This provoked Zeus’ rage against Prometheus. Hephaestus, a son of"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Myth and Mysteriosophy 77 Zeus, was commissioned to make a female form of great beauty, which all the gods adorned with every possible gift. She was named Pandora (“all-gifted”). The messen- ger of the gods, Hermes, brought her to Prometheus’ brother, Epimetheus, to whom she gave a casket as a gift from the gods. Epimetheus accepted the gift, despite the fact that Prometheus had warned him on no account to accept a gift from the gods. When the casket was opened, out flew every possible human affliction. Only Hope remained inside, because Pandora quickly shut the lid, and Hope exists still as a dubious gift from heaven. As for Prometheus, on account of his relationship to human- ity he was chained at Zeus’ command to a crag in the Caucasus mountains. An eagle continually gnaws his liver, which perpetually grows again. He is to pass his days in agonizing loneliness, until one of the gods freely sacrifices himself, that is, dedicates himself to death. Prometheus meanwhile bears his suffering with unflinch- ing patience, for he knows that Zeus will be dethroned by the son of a mortal woman unless he himself becomes her husband. It was important for Zeus to know this mys- tery; he sent the messenger-god Hermes to Prometheus to inquire about it, but Prometheus refused to say any- thing. At this point the sagas of Heracles and of Prometheus are connected: in the course of his wander- ings, Heracles reaches the Caucasus. He slays the eagle that gnawed at Prometheus’ liver. And the centaur Chi- ron, who cannot die, though he suffers from an incurable wound, sacrifices himself for Prometheus.

They are not an abstraction personified as “forces of will,” but actual beings of will. Prometheus is one of them, which indicates his nature, but he is not wholly a Titan; he belongs in some ways on the side of Zeus, that is, the spiritual power that assumed cosmic rule when the unbridled force—Kronos—had been quelled. Prometheus is a representative of those worlds from which humanity draws its forward-striving will, which is half nature-force, and half spiritual force. The will inclines toward both good and evil. Indeed its destiny is fixed by its tendency either toward the spiritual or toward the perishable; and this destiny is the destiny of human beings themselves: chained to the perishable, gnawed by the eagle, we must suffer. Our ultimate goal can be reached only when we withdraw into solitude to seek our destiny. But we have a secret. It consists in this: the divine power—Zeus—must be married to a mortal, that is, a consciousness bound to a physical human body, so as to beget a son—human wisdom, the Logos , who will set free the god. In this way consciousness achieves immortality. But the secret must not be betrayed until the coming of a mystes —Heracles—who overcomes the power that threatens him constantly with death. The centaur, a crea- ture that is half animal, half human, has to sacrifice itself to redeem him: this is human nature itself, half animal and half spirit, which must die in order that the purely spiritual human being may be released."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Myth and Mysteriosophy 79 The gifts spurned by Prometheus, the human will, are taken up by Epimetheus—cleverness or shrewdness. But he gains nothing from them except troubles and sorrows. The rational mind clings to the inessential and perish- able. Only one thing remains behind: the hope that even from the perishable the eternal may one day be born. The thread that runs through the sagas of the Argo- nauts, Heracles, and Prometheus can also be traced through Homer’s Odyssey. The use of such a method of interpretation may seem forced, but on closer consider- ation of all that has been said, even the strongest doubts must be dispelled. In the first place, it is a surprise to hear it said of Odys- seus that he made a “descent into the underworld” ( nekyia , Book XI). Whatever theories we may hold about the author of the Odyssey , it is impossible to accept that he portrayed the descent of a mortal into the underworld without thereby relating him to the meaning of the descent in Greek thought—namely the conquest of tran- sitoriness and the awakening of the eternal in the soul. Odysseus’ feat must be presumed to achieve this, and his experiences thus take on a profounder significance, just as did those of Heracles; they become a description of something that does not belong to the world of sense per- ception, but rather to the inner development of the soul.

This is a man seeking for the soul—the divine in humanity—and it is his wanderings on that quest that the poet will relate. He comes to the land of the Cyclopes, uncouth giants with one eye in their forehead. Polyphemus, the most horrifying of them, devours several of the travelers, but Odysseus saves himself by blinding the Cyclops. This refers to the first stage of life’s pilgrimage: physical strength, the lower nature, has to be broken, for if its power is not broken, if it is not blinded, it will devour you. Then Odysseus reaches the island of the enchantress Circe, who transforms some of his companions into grunting swine, but he manages to subdue her.

Odysseus grasps the spirit in its free creative activity, but he is not yet an initiate— he is still chasing illusions, from whose power he must break loose. Odysseus has to accomplish the passage between Scylla and Charybdis—the novice vacillates between spirit and sense, not yet able to realize the full value of the spiritual, though the sense-world has lost its former meaning. A shipwreck ends the lives of all Odys- seus’ companions; he alone escapes, being befriended by the nymph Calypso who cares for him for seven years.

She evades keeping her promise by unraveling every night what she has woven during the day. Before he can rest, united again with his wife, Odysseus therefore has to overcome the suitors. The goddess Athene changes him into a beg- gar, so that he can enter unrecognized, and in this way the suitors are conquered. What Odysseus is seeking is his own deeper con- sciousness, the divine powers in the soul. It is with these that he wishes to be united. But before the mystai can discover them, they must conquer everything that comes as a suitor for the favor of their consciousness—that is, the world of mundane reality, transient nature, from which the horde of suitors stems. The logic that pertains to them is a weaving that unravels itself when it has been spun. Wisdom—the goddess Athene—is a sure guide to the deepest powers that the soul possesses.

At Eleusis itself there were mysterious temple-complexes, 83 under the direction of a priestly dynasty. The wisdom which quali- fied them for this task was handed down from genera- tion to generation in the priestly families; it was the wisdom which enabled them to perform their ritual ser- vice at Eleusis, the wisdom of the Greek Mysteries, mysteriosophy. 84 The festivals were celebrated twice in the course of each year, and dramatized the cosmic events governing the fate of the divine in the world and of the human soul. The Lesser Mysteries took place in February, the Greater Mysteries in September. Initiation into the Mysteries took place in connection with these festivals. The climax of the initiatory proceedings was a symbolic enactment of the human and cosmic drama on the site. The temples at Eleusis were dedicated to the goddess Demeter. She is a daughter of Kronos, and before his marriage to Hera, Zeus had by her a daughter, Perse- phone. Once while Persephone was out playing, Pluto, the god of the underworld, carried her off. Demeter went wandering through the world lamenting and seeking for her. At Eleusis she sat down on a stone, and there she was found by the daughters of Celeus, a governor of Eleusis. In the form of an old woman, she was taken into the service of the family of Celeus, as nurse to the Queen’s son. She wished to endow the son with immor- tality, and to this end she hid him every night in the fire.

It was then that Celeus built the temple. The grief of Demeter for Perse- phone was boundless, and spread sterility over the Earth. To avert total disaster, the gods had to find a way of appeasing her, so Zeus induced Pluto to let Persephone return to the upper world. However, before he let her go he gave her a pomegranate to eat, and because of this she was compelled to return to the underworld ever after at regular intervals; for a third of the year she dwelled in the underworld, and for two thirds in the upper world. Comforted, Demeter returned to Olympus. But at Eleu- sis, where she had undergone her grief, Demeter founded the cult-festivals in which her fate was ever afterward commemorated. The mythology of Demeter and Persephone is not hard to interpret. It is the soul that lives alternately in the underworld and in the upper regions; the myth clothes in a picture the eternal nature of the soul that persists throughout its endless transformations, its births and deaths. The soul has an immortal mother—Demeter— but is carried away into the realms of transitoriness, and even induced to share in the destiny of the perishable world. It has eaten the fruit of the underworld—that is to say, the human soul has found satisfaction in perishable things, and therefore cannot live always in the heights where the gods abide. It has to return ever and again to the kingdom of transience. Demeter stands for the essential source out of which human consciousness arises.

Human beings, however, cannot bear the pure energy of fire (or spirit) and Demeter has to cease her attempt. All she can do is to institute the temple cult. Through this, so far as they are able, human beings can participate in the divine nature. The festivals at Eleusis were an eloquent confession of the belief in the immortality of the human soul. The con- viction was expressed in the imagery of the myth about Persephone. But alongside Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis, the god Dionysus was honored. If Demeter stood for the divine origin of the eternal within humanity, Dionysus was worshipped as the divine presence in the world, which assumes an endless variety of forms. He is the god poured out into cosmic existence, torn apart in order to be reborn spiritually.

It contains, in fact, all kinds of teachings and invoca- tions, which were put into the grave along with the deceased in order to furnish guidance when they were released from the mortal state. By means of this literary work we can explore the most intimate ideas of the Egyp- tians concerning the eternal world and cosmogony. The ideas of the gods that we find there remind us con- stantly of those familiar from the Greek Mysteries. Osiris is a god who gradually came to be popular and was uni- versally worshipped in Egypt, eclipsing the other local"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Egyptian and Other Eastern Mysteries 87 divinities and subsuming the attributes of the other gods into himself. But whatever the ordinary people of Egypt thought about the nature of Osiris, in the “Book of the Dead” we have evidence of a priestly doctrine, according to which Osiris was to be found within the human soul. That emerges from everything said there about death and about the dead. When the body is given over to the Earth, preserved under earthly conditions, humanity’s eternal part enters into the eternal condition that was in the beginning. It appears before Osiris. It stands before him for judgment, surrounded by the forty-two Judges of the Dead. The des- tiny of one’s eternal being depends upon their verdict. If the soul has confessed its sins, it is deemed to be recon- ciled with the eternal Justice. Invisible powers then draw near and speak to it: Osiris N. has been purified in the pool which lies south of the Field of Hotep and north of the Field of Locusts, where the gods of verdure purify them- selves at the fourth hour of the night and the eighth hour of the day, with the image of the heart of the gods, coming forth from the night into day. 87 This shows that in the world of eternal order, one’s eter- nal nature becomes Osiris; after the name Osiris stands the personal name of the deceased. Moreover, the one being united with eternity designates himself Osiris: I am the Osiris N. Growing under the blossoms of the fig tree is the name of Osiris N. 88"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"88 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT He has “become an Osiris.” Yet being an Osiris is nothing but the final, perfected stage of human life and development. It is clear in this context that even Osiris in his cosmic role as a judge is no more than a man who has attained to the stage of per- fected existence. The difference between human exist- ence and divine existence is one of degree—and also of number. Behind this mystery of the “one and the many” lies the framework of ideas that belongs to the Mysteries. Osiris in his cosmic form is a unitary being; hence he exists undivided in each human soul. Everyone is an Osiris; yet the unitary Osiris has to be represented as a separate entity. Humanity is looked upon as a being still in process of development, and at the end of the process comes existence as a God. We should speak of a divinized condition of being, rather than of the independent exist- ence of a Godhead, in the framework of Egyptian thought. Now it can hardly be doubted that in that frame- work of ideas no one could be considered to attain Osirian existence after crossing the threshold of eternity, unless they had already evolved to that level of being. Thus we must conclude that the highest mode of life that someone can lead is the transforming of oneself into an Osiris. To be truly human, one must already live the most perfect life of an Osiris that is possible under transitory condi- tions. Human perfection means living like an Osiris—it means undergoing all that Osiris underwent. 89 It is in this way that the Osiris myth takes on its deeper dimensions of meaning, becoming the paradigm of life for someone who wants to awaken eternal being within"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Egyptian and Other Eastern Mysteries 89 him- or herself. Osiris is torn to pieces by Typhon; he is killed. The members of his body are cherished and cared for by his consort Isis. After his death, he caused a ray of light to fall upon her and she bore his son Horus, who then takes over the earthly tasks of Osiris; he is the second, still immature Osiris, but he is in process of becoming an Osiris in the full sense. This true Osiris is to be found in the human soul. For although the soul is to begin with connected to the transitory realm, it is destined to give birth to the eternal. Humanity may therefore be termed the tomb of Osiris; it is our lower nature—Typhon, or Set—that has killed him. The love that is present in his soul—Isis—must cherish and care for the members of his corpse, and then the higher nature or eternal soul— Horus—can be born, and in due course rise to the state of “being an Osiris.” This then is the “initiation” practiced in Egypt. It taught that whoever aspires to the highest stage of being must recapitulate, inwardly microcosmically, the universal and macrocosmic events connected with Osiris. Plato has described such a cosmic process: the Creator had stretched out the World-Soul on the World-Body in the form of a cross, and the subsequent organization of the cosmos constitutes a redemption of the crucified World- Soul. 90 If someone is to “become an Osiris” the same pro- cess must take place in miniature. The initiand must allow the inner experience of “becoming an Osiris” to unfold and fuse with the events of the cosmic Osirian myth. If we were able to look inside the temples where the ini- tiatory “transformation into Osiris” took place, we would"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"90 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT see that the events enacted there on the human scale were a representation of the cosmogony. Humanity originates from the “Father” and is to bear within it the Son; the actual presence within human beings of the divinity, held captive by a spell, is to be brought to manifestation. The god within is held down by the power of earthly nature; that lower nature must become a grave, from which the higher nature can rise to new life. The information we possess about the scenarios of initiation makes sense when we understand this. People were subjected to proce- dures whose character was mysterious, but which were intended to “kill” the earthly and awaken something higher. Further detail is not needed here, for we compre- hend the intention behind these procedures. The intention was that everyone who had undergone initiation would be able to make a “confession.” All the initiates could declare that they had seen hovering before them the prospect of infinity, reaching up to the divine, that they had felt within them also the power of the divine, and had laid to rest in the tomb all that held down that power. The initiate had died to earthly things, and was indeed dead, having died as a lower being and having been in the underworld among the dead—that is, with those who are already united with eternity. After a sojourn in the other world, the initiate had risen again from the dead, but as another, no longer as one belonging to transitory nature. All that is transitory was absorbed into the all-permeating Logos , and the initiate belonged henceforth among those who live forever at the right hand of Osiris.

The initiand had to undergo whatever experience was necessary in order to be able to make such a “confession”—an experience of a most exalted kind. If these experiences came to the attention of the unini- tiated, however, it is easy to see that they would compre- hend nothing of what actually took place in the soul of the neophyte. They would take the latter’s death, burial, and resurrection as a physical occurrence, and the spiritual realities of a higher existential plane would take on the appearance of an event contradicting the whole natural order of things: a miracle. And in that sense, a miracle is what initiation was. The Life of an Initiate: Buddha and Christ Those who wished to comprehend what initiation meant had to awaken in themselves the powers enabling them to adopt a higher stance, on a new existential plane. It required a premeditated course of life, leading to such a higher experience. And though in each individual case these experiences might come about in various ways, it always happens that we can point to specific, typical forms. The life of an initiate has a typical character, which can be described without reference to the particular per- sonality concerned. To put it another way: an individual could be described as treading the path to divinization only after having undergone the particular typical experiences of an initiate."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"92 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT One example is the Buddha as seen by his disciples, and as such a one did Jesus first appear in his own society. We know today of the parallelism between the biographies of the Buddha and Jesus. One has only to observe the detailed correspondences between them to realize that any attempt at denial would be vain. 91 There is an annunciation of Buddha’s birth to Queen Maya by a white elephant, which overshadows her and tells her that she is to bring forth a “divine man.” “And he will attune all beings to love and friendship, and will unite them in a bond of religious fervor.” Compare with this the passage from the Gospel of Luke where an angel is sent: to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. The angel went to her and said, “Greet- ings, you who are highly favored!... You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Brahmans (Indian priests) understand the meaning of the birth of a Buddha. They interpret Maya’s dream according to a totally schematic concept of what a Bud- dha is: the individual’s life must correspond to this con- cept exactly. Similarly we find in the Gospel of Matthew that Herod: called together all the people’s chief priests and teachers of the law, and asked them where the Christ was to be born."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Egyptian and Other Eastern Mysteries 93 One of the Brahmans, Asita, says of the Buddha: This child is the one who will become a Buddha, the savior, the leader to immortality, freedom, and the light. Compare with this what happens in the Gospel of Luke: Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.... When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying: Lord, as you have promised you now dismiss your servant in peace. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all people, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel. Tradition reports of the Buddha that when he was a child of twelve he went missing, and was found again under a tree, surrounded by the poets and sages of the time. Correspondingly we find in the Gospel of Luke: Every year his parents went up to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the cus- tom. After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"94 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their rela- tives and friends. When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days they found him in the Temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. The Buddha withdrew into solitude, and when he returned a virgin greeted him with words of benediction: “Blessed are the mother, the father, and the wife to whom you belong.” But he answered: “Only those are blessed who have reached nirvana. ” The reference is to those who have entered the world of the eternal order of things. Compare in the Gospel of Luke: As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out: “Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and the breasts that fed you!” He replied, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.” At one point in his life, the Tempter (Mara) comes to the Buddha and promises him all the kingdoms of the Earth. The Buddha rejects it all with the words: “I know well that I am destined to have a kingdom, but I do not desire an earthly one; I will achieve enlightenment and make all the world rejoice.” Mara has to admit, “My"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Egyptian and Other Eastern Mysteries 95 power is at an end.” Jesus responds to the same tempta- tion, saying: Away from me, Satan! For it is written: “Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.” Then the devil left him. . . . The parallels could be documented at considerably greater length, all pointing in the same direction. The Buddha’s life comes to a sublime ending. Whilst on a journey, he fell ill. He came to the river Hiranya, near Kusinagara, and there he lay down on a rug spread for him by his beloved disciple Ananda. His body began to shine from within. He died transfigured, as a body of light, saying “Nothing is permanent.” This death of the Buddha corresponds to the Transfiguration of Jesus: About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John, and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. As he was praying, the appear- ance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. The Buddha’s earthly life ends at this juncture. But in the life of Jesus this is just the beginning of the most important part—his suffering, death, and resurrection. The difference between the Buddha and Christ is shown in the necessity for the life of Christ Jesus to continue beyond the furthest point of the Buddha’s life. 92 Buddha and Christ cannot be comprehended simply by lumping everything together."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"96 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT The correspondence between these two redemptive lives leads unambiguously to the conclusion, already indicated by the narratives themselves, that when the priests or sages hear what kind of birth has occurred they know already what is involved. They have to do with a “divine man,” and they know what course of life the per- sonality must adopt so that it shall correspond to what they know of such a “divine man.” Mysteriosophy con- tains the eternal prototype for such a course of life, which only he must and can fulfill. It is like a law of nature, and as the properties of a chemical are exactly determined, a Buddha or Christ must live a precisely determined life. Their lives are not narrated to reveal the accidents of biography, but rather to show the typical features, defined by mysteriosophy for all ages to come. The legend of the Buddha is no more a biography in the ordinary sense than the Gospels are supposed to be such a biography of Christ Jesus. Neither is concerned with contingent events, but rather with the prototypical life of a world-redeemer. The model for both accounts is not external, physical happenings but the traditional teach- ings of the Mysteries. For those who recognize their divine nature, the Buddha and Jesus are essentially “ini- tiates”; 93 their lives are raised above everything transi- tory, and what is known about the nature of the initiated must be applicable to them.

The Buddha’s life ends with his transfiguration, whereas the most significant part of Jesus’ life begins after the Transfiguration. Translated into the terms of initiation, the Buddha reached the point at which the divine light begins to shine in human nature, standing on the verge of earthly life and becoming one with the light of the world. Jesus goes further: he does not physically die at the moment when the light of the world shines through him. At that moment he is a Buddha; but at that moment he enters upon a higher stage of initiation, that of suffering and death. And when his earthly part is lost to view, the spiritual light, the light of the world, does not go out but leads on to his res- urrection. To his followers he is revealed to be the Christ. As soon as he achieves his “transfiguration,” the Bud- dha is lost in the all-pervading blissful life of the spirit. Christ Jesus, however, rekindles the all-pervading spirit once more to life in the form of present human existence. Something like this had been achieved by the initiates in the higher stages of the Mysteries. But there it had a mythical image-character. The initiates of Osiris experi- enced a “resurrection” on the level of image-conscious- ness. In the life of Christ, initiation in the “Great Mysteries” was added to the stage of Buddha-initiation, not however on the plane of mythological images but as a real event. The life of the Buddha demonstrated that the human being is in essence the divine Logos (Word); when our earthly part perishes, we return to the Logos , to the light.

The fact that he had lived, and that those who acknowledge him are “his own” now constituted a belief that was able to take the place of the Mysteries and their practices.

The Mysteries handed down the techniques of coming to the truth. The Christian ecclesia propagates this truth in itself. The Mysteries had fostered a trust in the spir- itual powers that were awakened inwardly through initi- ation. To this was added the trust in the Founder, the Initiator as such. The Mysteries had been a process of divinization, an actual experience of being made God. Jesus attained oneness with God; therefore one must cling to him, so as to share in his divinization as part of the community that he founded. That is the Christian claim. The divinization of Jesus has a universal significance, in which the community of his faithful can share: “See, I am with you always, to the very end of the world.” 96 So the birth in Bethlehem bears the stamp of an eter- nal reality. Hence when the birth of Jesus is mentioned in the Christmas antiphon, it is said to happen every Christmas:"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"100 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT Hodie Christus natus est, hodie Salvator apparuit , Hodie in Terra canunt Angeli, Laetantur Arch- angeli, etc .

In pre-Christian times the mystai attained to this stage of Christ-initiation, but they were then in a state of spiritual vision in the higher worlds, to which there was nothing equivalent among the facts of the sense-world. The inner meaning of the Mystery of Golgotha was expe- rienced spiritually. When the Christian initiates achieve this stage of initiation, however, they behold at that very moment the historical event on Golgotha. And they know that in the event that took place in the sense-perceptible world is contained the spiritual content, which had been enacted supersensibly in the Mysteries. In the Mystery-places the spirit had been poured out upon the mystai of old. Through the “Mystery of Golgotha” it was poured out upon the whole Christian community. There was still a place for initiation. For whereas faith allows a person to participate uncon- sciously in the content of the Mystery of Golgotha, initi- ation leads to a fully conscious connection with the power that streams invisibly from the events depicted in the New Testament, and which ever since then has pervaded spir- itually the life of humanity."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Evidence of the Gospels 101 CHAPTER 6 THE EVIDENCE OF THE GOSPELS The materials we have for a historical investigation into “the life of Jesus” are furnished by the Gospels.

But the question is, what sort of documents are the Gospels? The fourth, or Gospel of John, is so utterly different from the others that those who feel themselves committed to strictly historical research conclude: If John possesses the authentic tradition of the life of Jesus, that of the Synoptics (the first three Gospels) is untenable. Or, if the Synoptics are right, the writer of the fourth Gospel must be dismissed as an histori- cal authority. 97 Such is the historian’s point of view.

For none of these writings asks to be taken as a straightforward account of mere historical events. Parables and Signs The Gospels are not put forward as historical biography. What they advance had always existed as the typical life of a “son of God” in the traditions of the Mysteries. They were not created out of historical events but out of Mys- tery-traditions. Now it is naturally the case that among the several dis- tinct cults of the Mysteries the traditions would not be in complete verbal agreement. (Nevertheless there was such close agreement that the Buddhists relate the life of their “divine man” in almost identical terms to those of the evangelists when they relate the life of Christ.) 99 There would naturally be discrepancies. It is clear that we must assume the Gospel writers based themselves upon four different Mystery-traditions. It is a sign of the personal greatness of Jesus that he could awaken among the writers who stemmed from four"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Evidence of the Gospels 103 different traditions the belief that he was the one who so perfectly fulfilled their ideal of an initiate, that they could accept him as the one who lived the archetypal life ascribed in their Mystery-teachings to such a personality. When they described his life, it was in terms of their own particular Mystery-traditions. If the Synoptics (the first three Gospels) describe it in similar ways, that proves nothing except that they were working out of similar tradi- tions from the Mysteries. The writer of the fourth Gospel steeps his narrative with ideas that recall the thought of the philosopher of religion, Philo of Alexandria; again, that proves nothing except the proximity of the tradition out of which he wrote to that of Philo. 100 In the Gospels we meet with several sorts of material. There are in the first place reports of events, which appar- ently lay claim to historicity. Secondly, there are the para- bles, where the story only serves to present a deeper truth in imaginative terms. And thirdly, there are teachings, intended to form the content of a Christian view of life. In the Gospel of John there is no parable as such; it came from a Mystery school in which the use of parables was not considered necessary. Much light is shed on the role of actual historical events and imaginative parable in the Synoptic Gospels by the narrative of the cursing of the fig tree. This appears in Mark where we read: Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the Temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. The"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"104 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” (11:11ff.) Luke gives this same episode in the form of a parable: Then he told this parable: A man had a fig tree, planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any. So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, “For three years now I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why should it encumber the ground?” (13:6f.) The parable indicates symbolically the uselessness of the old teachings, under the image of the barren fig tree. The same meaning is conveyed by Mark, who narrates it as if it had taken place as a fact of history. The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the Gos- pels should not be read primarily as historical accounts, based upon occurrences in the perceptible world. They have a Mystery-meaning; they relate experiences percep- tible to the spiritual faculties alone, drawing upon several Mystery-traditions. Hence there is no real difference between the Gospel of John and the Synoptics. Historicity is not the issue. One may also date this Gospel or that a decade earlier or later.

Coming now to the “signs” (miracles): their elucidation poses no problems for a Mystery-interpretation. They are supposed to overturn the laws of nature; but they only do so for as long as we consider them happenings in the physical, perishable world, which could have been appre- hended by our unaided sense perception. However, they are really experiences that can only be grasped by percep- tion of a higher, spiritual type. Their character makes it clear that they cannot be understood in terms of the natu- ral, physical order. It is imperative, then, that we read the Gospels in the right way. We shall then understand what they have to tell us about the Founder of Christianity. The style of the Gospels is that used to communicate a Mystery, and they speak in the way the mystai spoke of an initiated one. The only difference is that they ascribe the initiation to a unique personality, a single being. And they make the sal- vation of humanity depend upon a connection with this uniquely initiated being. For the initiates this was the coming of “the Kingdom of God.” 101 The unique one had brought this Kingdom to all people who made a connection with him. The separate concern of each individual gave way to a shared concern of all those who were prepared to acknowledge Jesus as their Lord. To understand how this could be so, we need to see how mysteriosophy had found its way into the national religion of Israel. For it was out of Judaism that Christianity arose."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"106 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT The Mysteries and the Jews It need cause no astonishment that with Christianity we should find grafted onto the stock of Judaism those ideas from the Mysteries that, as we have seen, were the com- mon heritage of Greek and of Egyptian spiritual life. In the religions of the several peoples, conceptions of the spiritual assumed various forms. But at the heart of them all, when we go back to the more profound priestly wis- dom, there is overriding agreement. Plato knew of his agreement with the Egyptian priestly authorities when he put the core of Greek wisdom into the form of a philo- sophical world-picture. It was said of Pythagoras that he had traveled to Egypt and India and was instructed by the wise men there. At the period of Christian origins we know of people who found so much agreement between platonic doctrines and the deeper meaning of the books of Moses, that they called Plato “a Moses speaking the lan- guage of Athens.” 102 Mysteriosophy was a universal phenomenon. What it drew from Judaism was a form which it had to take in order to become an actual world-religion. Judaism expected the coming of a Messiah. No wonder that the figure of the uniquely initiated one could only be identi- fied by the Jews with their Messiah. And this connection helps explain the shift from concern with individual initi- ation in the Mysteries to a concern for the whole people.

The existence of Mysteries within Judaism, which could be brought out of the obscurity of secret rites into the reli- gion of the people, is also certain. A fully developed mys- ticism existed in Pharisaism, alongside the priestly wisdom that had there become outer formalism. A Mys- tery-wisdom is described here, just as it is elsewhere. 103 It is said that an initiate discoursed on wisdom, and his hearers realized the hidden sense of his words. They cried: Old man, what have you done? Would that you had been silent! You think that you can sail the bound- less ocean without sail or mast. What are you attempting? To ascend upward? You cannot. To descend into the depths? An immeasurable abyss opens before you! 104 This comes from the Kabbala (mystical “tradition”). We also hear of the four rabbis who sought the way to the divine realm (Paradise). The first died, the second went mad, the third caused great destruction; only the fourth, Rabbi Akiba, entered in peace and returned. 105 Jesus and the Preaching of the Kingdom Thus we see that within Judaism there was a foundation for the emergence of a uniquely initiated figure.

Someone had then to spread through the world what had formerly been the experience of the chosen ones in the temples of the Mys- teries. That would mean being willing to take upon him- self the spiritual role, as a personality, that had been formerly played in the community by the Mystery cult. Now it is true that the community was not able to enter into the actual experiences of the Mysteries without more ado; nor could that be his intention. But he did wish to impart the conviction of the truth contained in the visions of the Mysteries. By a further step forward in the spir- itual development of humanity, the life of the Mysteries would flow out into the world. He would bring people to a higher existential plane: “Blessed are those who believe, and have not seen.” 106 The conviction that there is a divine reality would be rooted in human hearts in the form of faith. One who “stands outside,” yet has this faith, will cer- tainly go further than one who does not have it. The thought that many were standing outside, uncertain of the way, must have weighed upon the mind of Jesus with nightmare heaviness. He had to close the gulf that sepa- rated the initiates from the ordinary people. Christianity presents itself as the means by which everyone can find the way.

Everything conspires to give it a unique importance within the New Testament. In fact, it is given only in the account of one evangelist, namely John. The Gospel of John opens with such pro- found introductory words that we must take everything it communicates as charged with special meaning. It begins: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a God. . . . And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we saw his glory as of an only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth. 110 To begin a work in this way is quite obviously to claim that it has to be interpreted in a specially deep sense. Any- one who wants to explain it away intellectually, or to approach it superficially, is left in the position of someone investigating the “murder” of Desdemona by Othello on the stage."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The “Miracle” of Lazarus 111 What, then, is the meaning of the opening words of John? He speaks explicitly of the Eternal, of what was “in the beginning.” He also narrates factual events. Yet they are plainly not events simply known through sight or hearing, or understood by the thinking mind. Behind the events is the Word ( Logos ), an aspect of the cosmic Spirit. For him these events are actually the manifestation of some higher meaning. It is safe to suppose that in the instance of a man being raised from the dead—a case that poses the greatest chal- lenge to the eye and ear and to the reasoning mind—the very deepest meaning lies concealed. Moreover, as Renan has pointed out in his Life of Jesus , the raising of Lazarus was undoubtedly an event of decisive significance influ- encing the end of the life of Jesus. At the same time, Renan’s own standpoint seems untenable. For why should the idea that Jesus had raised someone from the dead, when it circulated among the populace, have appeared so dangerous to his opponents as to threaten the very exist- ence of Judaism? It is all very well for Renan to assert: The other miracles of Jesus were passing events, repeated in good faith and exaggerated by popular report, and they were thought of no more after they had happened. But this one was a real event, pub- licly known, and by means of which it was sought to silence the Pharisees. All the enemies of Jesus were exasperated by the sensation it caused. It is related that they sought to kill Lazarus."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"112 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT But this renders incomprehensible Renan’s own view that what happened at Bethany was merely the staging of a piece of mummery, designed to strengthen belief in Jesus: Perhaps Lazarus, still pale from his illness, had him- self wrapped in a shroud and laid in the family grave. These tombs were large rooms hewn out of the rock, entered by a square opening closed by an immense stone slab. Martha and Mary hastened to meet Jesus, and brought him to the grave before he had entered Bethany. The painful emotion felt by Jesus at the grave of the friend he believed to be dead (John 11:33–38) might be taken by those present for the agitation and tremors which were wont to accompany miracles. According to popular belief, divine power in a man was like an epileptic, convulsive force. To continue our hypothesis, Jesus wished to see once more the man he had loved, and when the slab had been moved away, Lazarus came forth in his grave-clothes, his head bound with a napkin. This apparition was naturally looked upon by everyone as a resurrection. Faith accepts what- ever is true for it, and knows no other law. Renan’s exegesis seems excessively naive; but he joins to it an additional comment: Everything seems to suggest that the miracle of Bethany contributed essentially to hasten the death of Jesus. 111"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The “Miracle” of Lazarus 113 Renan’s perception here is undoubtedly acute. But with the means at his disposal he is not able to explain or jus- tify his opinion. Certainly Jesus must have performed something of significance at Bethany, as we gather from passages such as this: Then the chief priests and the Pharisees summoned a meeting of the Sanhedrin. “What are we to do?” they asked. “This man is performing many miraculous signs. . . .” 112 Renan too grasps intuitively that something out of the ordinary had occurred. “It must be acknowledged,” he says, that John’s narrative is of an essentially different kind from the accounts of miracles of which the Synoptics are full, and which are the outcome of popular imagination. Let us add that John is the only evangelist with accurate knowledge of the relations of Jesus with the family at Bethany, and that it would be incomprehensible how a creation of the popular mind could have been inserted in the frame of such personal reminiscences. It is probable, there- fore, that the miracle in question was not among the wholly legendary ones, for which no individual was responsible. In other words, I think that something took place at Bethany which was looked upon as a resurrection."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"114 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT This amounts to an admission from Renan that some- thing took place in Bethany that he is not in a position to explain. He is clearly on the defensive when he says: At this distance of time, and with only one text bear- ing obvious traces of subsequent additions, it is impossible to decide whether, in the present case, all is fiction, or whether a real event which took place at Bethany served as the basis of the report that was spread abroad. 113 Maybe what is really needed in this case is to read the text in the right way. We might then no longer wish to speak of “fiction.” It is as well to admit that much in this whole Johannine narrative is shrouded in mystery. To take only one point: if the narrative is to be understood literally, what are we to make of Jesus’ words, “This sickness does not lead to death but to the glory of God, to the glorification of the Son of God?” 114 Such is the usual rendering of the words, though we come closer to the content of the Greek if we understand it to mean revelation, manifestation of God, so that the Son of God may be revealed by means of it. And then what of the other words Jesus speaks? I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live even though he dies. 115 It would be trivial to take Jesus to mean that Lazarus’ sickness gives him the opportunity to show off his skill;"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The “Miracle” of Lazarus 115 still more so to assume that Jesus claimed that faith in him would literally revive the dead. Where would be the point in bringing someone back from the dead if after his resur- rection he were just as he was before? It is inconceivable that such a life could be meant by the words, “I am the resurrection and the life.” It is only when we understand them in reference to a real spiritual event that Jesus’ words take on living signif- icance. They can resume even the literal sense they have in the text. Jesus asserts that he is the resurrection that has occurred in the case of Lazarus; he is the life that Laz- arus is now living. Let us take literally what Jesus is. According to the Gospel of John he is “the Word made flesh.” He is the eternal, that “which was in the begin- ning.” Therefore, if he is actually the resurrection, it is the eternal and primordial Being that has risen to new life in Lazarus. The underlying pattern is that of the bringing to life of the eternal “Word,” the “Word” that is the life to which Lazarus awakens. There is sickness, but a sickness that does not lead to death but to the glory of God, since it serves to bring about a divine revelation. It is the “eternal Word” that is raised in Lazarus; thus the whole process serves to bring about the manifestation of God in Lazarus. Through the process Lazarus is completely trans- formed. Previously the Word, the spirit, was not alive in him. Now it lives in him. The spirit has been born within him. Every birth has an element of sickness, the birth pangs of the mother. It is a sickness, however, that does"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"116 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT not lead to death but to new life. That part of Lazarus becomes ill that is to give birth to the “new man”—the one who is united with the eternal “Word.” How are we to understand the “grave” out of which the “Word” is born? We need only recall the expression of Plato, who calls the body the “grave” of the soul. We may remember, too, that Plato speaks of a sort of resurrection, in that the spiritual world stirs to life in the body. The spir- itual reality of the “soul,” in Plato’s terms, corresponds to the Logos in the Gospel of John—the “Word” that for him is Christ. Whereas Plato asserts that to become a spiritual being is to raise the divine in human beings from the grave of the body, for John this actually took place through the life of Jesus. It is not surprising that he makes Jesus say, “I am the resurrection.” All this puts it beyond doubt that the events at Bethany constituted a “raising from the dead” in a spiritual sense. Lazarus is transformed from what he formerly was; he rises to a life of which the “eternal Word” can say, “I am the life.” What has happened to Lazarus is that the spirit has come to life within him, so that now he participates in “eternal life.” Transposed into the terminology of the Mysteries and initiation, the meaning immediately becomes clear. In Plutarch’s formulation of the goal of the Mysteries, they aimed to liberate the soul from corporeal existence and to unite it with the gods. The feelings of an initiate have been characterized in the writings of F. W. J. Schelling: “The initiate receives a consecration, making him a link in the magic chain, himself a Kabeiros, indissolubly"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The “Miracle” of Lazarus 117 bound in relationship, joining the ranks (as an ancient inscription puts it) of the upper gods.” 116 As for the rev- olution in the life of an initiate into the Mysteries, noth- ing expresses its meaning better than the words of Aedesius to his imperial pupil: If you were ever to take part in the Mysteries, you would feel ashamed at having been born a mere man. 117 It is by filling our souls with such feelings that we shall gain a proper attitude to the events at Bethany. John’s nar- rative is indeed extraordinary. We glimpse a reality behind it which no rationalistic exegesis, no amount of critical reconstruction can provide. What stands before us is in the truest sense a mystery. Into Lazarus the “eternal Word” entered, making him in Mystery terms one of the “initiated.” The process described is one of initiation. 118 Let us survey the entire process from this point of view. Lazarus was “loved” by Jesus. But this cannot mean ordi- nary personal affection—that would conflict with the per- spective of the Gospel of John, according to which Jesus is “the Word.” Rather Jesus loved Lazarus because he found him sufficiently ripe that he could awaken “the Word” within him. There were already links between Jesus and the family at Bethany; that simply indicates that Jesus had made everything ready in that family for the final act of the drama, the raising of Lazarus. Lazarus was a pupil of Jesus."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"118 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT He was a pupil of whom Jesus could be absolutely confident that his “raising from the dead” could be achieved. The final act of the initiatory drama consisted in a symbolic enactment, through which the spirit was revealed. It was not just a matter of grasping the prin- ciple expressed in the words “Die and become!”; it had to be consummated through an inward act. The earthly part, of which in the Mysteries the “higher self” learned to feel ashamed, had to be put off. The earthly self had to “die”—that was the reality behind the outer symbol. The body lay for three days in a comatose state. But that was only the outward expression of the immense changes going on within the life of the initiate. It corre- sponded to a still more radical crisis on the level of the spirit. This act divides the life of the initiate into two separate parts. Without direct experience of such things it is impossible to understand their deeper meaning. To use a comparison, Shakespeare’s Hamlet can be summarized in a few words, and anyone who mastered this summary might correctly claim to know “what happens in Ham- let .” But a very different kind of knowledge would be the outcome of a rich involvement in Shakespeare’s treat- ment of the theme. No mere description could compare with such a living content in the soul, for which the idea of Hamlet has become a personal artistic realization. And on a higher level, something similar happens in a person who lives through the magically charged events of the initiatory process. Such a one experiences in sym- bolic enactments what is achieved in the spirit."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The “Miracle” of Lazarus 119 “Symbol” here denotes an outwardly perceptible act, which in itself, however, is only an image—not an unreal image, but one behind which stands a real event. The earthly body, then, has lain dead for three days. New life rises out of death. Life has overcome death, and there can be henceforth a sense of trust in the new life. Lazarus has experienced this, for Jesus prepared him to be raised from the dead. His illness was quite real, yet at the same time symbolic. His illness was in fact an initi- ation, and leads after three days to the reality of a new life. 119 Lazarus had reached a stage of development suited to the fulfillment of these processes. He had put on the ves- ture of a mystes , and lapsed into the condition of lifeless- ness, the image of death. By the time Jesus came, three days had passed: Then they took away the stone from where the dead man was lying. And Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me.” 120 The Father had heard Jesus; Lazarus had reached the final act in the great drama of the achievement of knowl- edge. He had attained the knowledge of resurrection; his initiation into the Mysteries was complete. Initiation of this kind was understood everywhere in the ancient world.

Here is the link between Christianity and the Mysteries. Lazarus was made an initiate by Christ Jesus himself. Hence he could raise himself to higher worlds. But he was also the first Christian initiate, initiated by Christ Jesus: hence he was in a position to recognize that the “Word,” which had risen to life in him, had taken on personal existence in Christ Jesus. The figure who stood visibly before him as his awakener was identical with the spiri- tual power that had manifested itself within him. Thus the further words of Jesus are important: I knew that you always hear me; but I spoke for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me. 121 That means that Jesus is revealed as the one in whom is present “the Son of the Father.” And so when he awakens his own being within another, that person becomes an ini- tiate. In this way Jesus declares that the meaning of life was concealed in the Mysteries. They led to the knowledge of its meaning. He is the Word of life. What was formerly archaic tradition had become in him an actual person. The evangelist expresses this in the verse where he says that in him “the Word became flesh.” For him Jesus is an incarnate Mystery. For the same reason, the Gospel of John is also itself a Mystery.

If it had been written by a priest in former ages it would have taken the form of ritual pre- scriptions. But for John the ritual has taken the form of a person. Hence it is written as a “life of Jesus.” A modern investigator and great expert on the Myster- ies pronounced that they “will never be cleared up!”— the words of Jacob Burckhardt. 122 But then, he failed to recognize the path toward understanding them. Let us take the Gospel of John. Let us look upon its drama of the achievement of knowledge. In terms both symbolic and physically real we see it enacting before our gaze what the ancient world performed as the Mystery itself. The words “Lazarus, came forth” recall the cry with which the initiator in the priestly Mysteries of the Egyp- tians summoned back to everyday life those who had undergone initiation; they had “died” to the earthly world and become witnesses of eternal life; the events of initi- ation had transported them for a time from the world. By speaking them, Jesus had revealed the secret of the Mys- teries. That is why the Jews felt that they could not allow such an act to go unpunished, as we may now understand. No more could the Greeks have permitted Aeschylus to escape punishment if he had betrayed their Mystery teachings. Jesus had performed the initiation of Lazarus before all “the people standing by,” in a deliberate act revealing the process, that, in the ancient priestly world of the Myster- ies, had been enacted only in secret.

Therefore we are to look for the hidden meaning of the Apocalypse in the teaching of Christ, so that the revela- tion it contains stands in the same relation to mainstream Christianity as the Mysteries in pre-Christian times stood to the public religion. This would seem to justify us in approaching the Apocalypse as a Mystery. What then does the Apocalypse mean by addressing the Seven Communities? To understand it, we must take a specific instance from the seven messages, and we may begin with the first one: Write to the angel of the community in Ephesus: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, and who walks among the seven golden lights, “I know your deeds, and what you have suffered and also your patient endurance, and that you will not support those who are evil; also, that you have called to account those who call"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Apocalypse of John 125 themselves apostles and are not, and that you have recognized them as false.

Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your light from its place—unless you change your way of thinking. But this you have, that you despise the ways of the Nicolaitans, which I too despise. He who has ears to hear what the Spirit says to the Communities, let him hear: “To the victor I will give food from the Tree of Life, which stands in the Para- dise of God.” 125 Such is the message to the angel of the first Community. The “angel” is to be understood as the spirit of the com- munity. The angel has entered in the direction indicated by Christianity, and is able to distinguish between the true and false professors of Christian belief. The angel wishes to work in a Christian way, founded upon “the name of Christ.” But the angel is urged not to fall short of the “highest love” through lapsing into any sort of error, and is shown the possibility of going astray through such errors. The way to the divine has been revealed through Christ Jesus: perseverance is needed in order to press forward in the"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"126 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT original spirit of the movement. Otherwise it is possible to rest content with one’s understanding of Christ too soon, as is the case if one is led a certain way but then abandons this guidance for erroneous fixed ideas about it; one then falls back upon the lower self in human nature. This is the failure to attain to one’s “highest love.” The knowledge derived from the senses and the intellect is to be exalted, spiritualized and made divine by becoming wisdom, on a higher plane; if it is not, it remains on the level of the transitory. Christ Jesus has pointed out the path to the Eternal. Knowledge must be tirelessly led along the path which leads to its becoming “divine knowledge.” In the spirit of love it must pursue the traces that will lead to its becom- ing “wisdom.” The Nicolaitans were a sect that did not fully grasp the meaning of Christianity. They say only that Christ is the divine Word, the eternal Wisdom that comes to birth in human beings. They therefore identified human wisdom and divine Word, supposing that the pursuit of human knowledge was the realization of the divine in the world. But Christian wisdom cannot be construed in this way. Knowledge, or human wisdom, is as perishable as every- thing else if it does not undergo that transformation into “divine wisdom.” You, however, says the Spirit to the angel at Ephesus, have not relied in this way upon mere human wisdom. You have persevered in the path of Chris- tianity. Yet to reach the goal you need nothing short of the first and highest love. You need a love greater than all other loves, because only then can it be the “first love.”"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Apocalypse of John 127 The road to the divine reaches endlessly before you and the first step, once gained, is the starting point for an ascent that leads ever higher. So must we understand the message to the first of the Communities, and it must serve as an example for the rest. 126 The Son of Man John turns round, and he sees “seven golden lights.” And: Among the lights was one like a Son of Man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash round his chest. His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. 127 Subsequently we are told that “the seven lights are the Seven Communities.” 128 Hence we must understand them as seven different ways to the divine, each in itself more or less imperfect. But the Son of Man also “had in his right hand seven stars,” 129 and “the seven stars are the angels of the Seven Communities.” 130 The guiding spirits or daimons of mysteriosophy have here become the guid- ing angels of the Seven Communities, which are thus pre- sented as the bodies of spiritual entities of which the angels are the soul, on the analogy of the human soul as the guiding power over the body.

And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as if dead. He laid his right hand on me and said, “Do not be afraid.” 132 The experiences that must be undergone by the initiand are ones otherwise undergone only when someone dies. The one who guides John through them has to take him into realms where birth and death no longer have any meaning. The initiated one therefore enters on a “new life”: And I was dead, but see! I am alive throughout all the cycles of time. And I hold the keys of Death and the underworld. 133 Thus John is brought to the stage of beholding the mys- teries of existence."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Apocalypse of John 129 And after this I looked, and saw the door of heaven open.

What he now sees “in the spirit” leads him to a vision of the spiritual sources of reality. These are things still hidden behind the physical pro- cesses, but after further physical development they will be manifested in a future, spiritualized condition of the world. The initiate experiences spiritually in the present what will be realized in the course of time to come: And immediately I was in the spirit. And I saw in heaven a Throne. And there was one sitting upon the Throne, whose appearance was like jasper and car- nelian. And there was a rainbow like emerald encir- cling the Throne. . . . Also before the Throne was what looked like a sea of glass, clear like crystal. 135 The images in which the vision is clothed by the seer depict the sources or archetypes of perceptible reality.

The fourth was like a flying eagle. And each of the Four Living Creatures had six wings and was full of eyes around and within. And they cry without ceasing, both day and night, “Holy, Holy, Holy, is God, the Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.” 137 It is easy to understand the Living Creatures; they rep- resent the supersensible life that underlies the forms of all living beings. Later they raise their voices in response to the sound of the Trumpets—that is, when the life contained in physical forms is transformed and spir- itualized. The Book with Seven Seals The one who sits enthroned holds in his right hand a book, which marks out the path to the summit of wisdom.

Once again we encounter the holiness of the number seven. Seals, in the mystical philosophy of Philo Judaeus, are the eternal cosmic Ideas that come to expression in things. 139 Human wisdom is the quest for these creative Ideas. Only in the book sealed by them can divine Wisdom be found. The archetypal Ideas behind the created world must be unveiled—the seals opened—and the contents of the book will be revealed. Jesus is the Lion who can break open the seals; He has given a meaning to the Ideas of cre- ation so as to point the way to Wisdom. The Lamb that was slain, which God has dearly bought with the price of his own blood, is Jesus who, as the bearer of the Christ, has passed in the profoundest sense through the mystery of life and death; it is he who opens the book. 140 Each time one of the seals is opened, the Living Crea- tures declare what they know. When the First Seal is bro- ken, John sees a White Horse on which sits a rider with a bow. The first universal power, or embodiment, of the Idea of creation becomes visible. It has a new rider, Chris- tianity, who sets it on the right track. And through the new faith, strife is allayed. With the opening of the Second Seal, a Red Horse appears. Again it has a rider.

Thus the rider carries a pair of scales. 142 When the Fourth Seal is opened, the rider who appears is called “Death, and Hell was following close behind him”; the rider stands for righteousness in Religion. When the Fifth Seal is opened, the souls of those who have already taken up Christianity appear: the creative Idea behind Christianity itself is manifested.

Then comes the opening of the Seventh Seal. This reveals what true Christianity ought really to be for the world. The seven angels “who stand before God” appear. These angels are once again spiritual Beings known in the ancient Mysteries translated into Christian terms. They stand for the true Christian path to the divine vision. The next stage is thus a leading into the presence of God. It is an initiation that John will undergo. The Seven Trumpets The proclamations of the angels are accompanied by the necessary features of all initiation. When the first angel blew upon his Trumpet: There followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was hurled down upon the earth. A third part of the earth was burned up, together with a third part of the trees, and all of the green grass. 144"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"134 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT Similar portents occur when the other angels blow upon their Trumpets. However, we also notice that this is not simply an initia- tion of the kind known in ancient times, but a new form of initiation which is to replace the old. Unlike the ancient Mysteries, Christianity does not exist only for the sake of a chosen few individuals: it is addressed to all humanity, and aspires to the religion of all people. The truth of Christian- ity is accessible to everyone who “has ears to hear.” The mysta i of the ancient world were singled out from the mul- titude; but the Christian Trumpets sound for all who are willing to hear them. How to respond is matter for every- one to decide. That is the reason why the terrors in this “ini- tiation of all humanity” are also so enormously enhanced. Through his initiation, John sees the condition of the earth and its inhabitants in the far future. The underlying idea behind this is that the seer in the higher worlds already beholds what still lies in the future for the world below, The Seven Letters present the meaning of Chris- tianity for the present age; the Seven Seals show what is being prepared now for the future through Christianity. The future remains as yet unveiled, under seal, for the uninitiated. In the process of initiation the seals are opened. At the end of the time covered by the Seven Let- ters, the earthly age begins to pass over into a more spir- itual condition.

Still further ahead in the future the earth will take on the form intimated to the initiates by the sounding of the Trumpets. In this way the initiate has a “prophetic” experience of future conditions. The initiate into the Christian Mystery experiences the impetus given to life on Earth by the entering and onward working of the Christ. Meanwhile everything that remains bound up with the transitory and falls short of true Christianity is shown as meeting death. Then a powerful angel appears, with a little book open in his hand which he gives to John: He said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will be bitter in your stomach, but sweet like honey in your mouth.” 145 John is instructed not just to peruse the little book, but to absorb it completely, to make its contents part of himself. Of what value is knowledge if it not a living power in a person’s life. Wisdom must be such a living power. The goal is not mere knowledge of the devine: it is actual divinization. But knowledge of the kind contained in the little book is painful to the transitory nature in human beings, and is “bitter in the stomach.” To the same extent however it is bliss to the eternal nature and so “sweet in the mouth like honey.” If Christianity is to become a real force upon earth it can only be in this way—through an initiation of human- ity.

The “City, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt” is the symbol for the life that remains confined to externals and does not take into itself the transforming impetus of the Christ. Christ is crucified everywhere in the lower nature. Where the lower nature triumphs, everything remains dead: the streets of the City are strewn with corpses. But those who overcome their lower nature and awaken the crucified Christ to new life hear the proclama- tion of the angel with the Seventh Trumpet: The kingdoms of the world have become those of the Lord and of his Anointed, who will reign from eternity to eternity. 147 Upon which, “the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant became visible there.” 148 666: The Beast and the Abyss The initiate’s experience brings back in a new form the primaeval struggle between the higher and lower natures."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Apocalypse of John 137 On the Christian path, everything that the initiates in the older Mysteries had to undergo must be recapitulated.

The Snake—knowl- edge—may be a seductive force, however, unless human beings bring to life within themselves the “Son of God.” He it is who crushes the serpent’s head: The great Dragon was hurled down—that ancient Snake who is called the Devil and Satan and seduces all the world—he was hurled down upon the Earth, together with his angels. 149 The Mystery-Temple The Christian Mystery was to replace the many Myster- ies of the ancient world with its unique, archetypal Mys- tery-event.

For now, “Blessed are those who have not seen, but who have believed.” 150 Even if at first they wander in darkness, the light may yet reach them. There is no secrecy; the way opens out for all. There is much more in the Apocalypse concerning the threat to Christianity from anti-Christian powers and the eventual triumph of Christianity. All other gods are taken up into the higher unity of the Christian divinity: I did not see a temple in the City, because the Lord, the all-ruling God, and the Lamb are its temple. The City had no need of the Sun nor of the Moon to shine upon it, because the revelation of the divine presence is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb. 151 The Mystery at the heart of the “Revelation of Saint John” is precisely this: the Mysteries are no longer secret.

In the Apoca- lypse, Christian wisdom was a Mystery reborn—but a Mystery which breaks out of the framework of the ancient Mysteries. The Mystery of a unique, single event was to become the Mystery with a significance for all. There is an apparent contradiction in saying that the secrets of the Mysteries became manifest in Christianity but that in the spiritual visions of the Apocalyptist we nevertheless observe a “Christian Mystery.” To solve the enigma, we must reflect how it was that the secrets of the ancient Mysteries were revealed. It was through the historical events in Palestine, which drew back the veil from what had previously been kept hidden in the Mysteries. Something was introduced into the his- tory of the world through the appearance of Christ, and it is this which constitutes the new Mystery.

Such a conviction was actually widespread, as we can gather from reports about the way of life prac- ticed among the Essenes and the Therapeutae—groups that were in existence well before the time of Christian origins. 153 The Essenes were one of the sects active in Palestine. They were of a closed nature and with an estimated membership at the time of Christ of around four thou- sand. They formed a Community, whose members were directed to lead a life suited to the development of the higher self within their souls, and so to achieve “rebirth.” 154 The aspirant was subjected to stringent tests in order to establish whether or not he was suffi- ciently mature to make himself ready for the higher life.

This exercised authority, not by compulsion, but as a source of the Community’s fundamental convictions. 155 A related group were the Therapeutae, who were to be found in Egypt. All our reliable information about their organization is contained in the work by the philosopher Philo, On the Contemplative Life . 156 A few passages from Philo’s book will be sufficient to convey an idea of its contents: The houses of those thus banded together are quite simple, affording protection against the two things requiring it most, the blazing heat of the sun and the frostiness of the air. They are neither contiguous as in towns, since close proximity is troublesome and displeasing to those assiduously striving for soli- tude, nor yet far apart, because of the fellowship to which they cleave, and in order to render each other aid in the event of a piratical attack.

The communities of the Essenes and Therapeutae form a natural transition from the Mysteries to Christianity. But Christianity extended the process further, transforming the aims of such sectarian groups into the wider concerns of humanity as such, though naturally weakening their Mystery-character still further. From the existence of those Communities, however, we can appreciate the readiness of the period for an understanding of the “Christ-Mystery.” The techniques of the Mysteries pre- pared people for the dawning of a higher spiritual reality within their souls at the appropriate stage. The Communi- ties of the Essenes and Therapeutae translated these into a corresponding way of life that would lead to the awak- ening of the “higher self.” 160 The next step would be the concept of the reincarnating human individuality, evolving to ever higher stages of perfection. 161 Those who could begin to grasp that idea would be able to recognize in Jesus the presence of a very advanced spiritual individuality.

Henceforth to speak of the Logos was at the same time to think of Jesus, an actual historical person. That was the profoundest factor that must have affected the adherents of Christianity. Pre- viously the Logos had been expressed within reality sim- ply in the various stages of human perfection; the level of spiritual development in a particular person could be subtly and delicately investigated when someone sought initiation, so as to establish the exact degree to which the Logos had been brought to life within such a person. A higher stage of maturation was considered to be a step higher in spiritual development, with its roots in a pre- existing spiritual life. Likewise the present life was seen as the stage of preparation for a spiritual phase of devel- opment in the future.

Everything has its place and its destined part to play. 163 A particular personality was only one possible manifes- tation of the soul, which transformed its identity again and again. The life of a person was linked organically in a chain of development reaching into the past and forward into the future. But in Christianity, this Logos manifesting itself in various ways through manifold personalities becomes focused on a unique personality—that of Jesus. Formerly the Logos pervaded the entire world, but now it is concentrated in the single figure of Jesus, who is a “divine man” in a unique way. For the highest human ideal of all future lives, to which one should approach ever closer, was on one occasion actually present in Jesus. The “divinization” of all humanity was what Jesus took upon himself. What had been sought in the depths of one’s own soul could henceforth be sought in him. The eternal, divine kernel of the soul was wrested away from the personality; this eternal part was now to be seen in its fullness in Jesus. It was no longer a case of the eternal nature of the soul triumphing over death and awakening to divine life, but rather of the one God who was present in Jesus and who will appear in order to raise up human souls.

And so, rather than denying eter- nal life, it became necessary to ascribe immortality to this very personality. Belief in the cosmic transformation of the soul gave way to belief in personal immortality. Per- sonality took on infinite significance because it was all that humanity could cling to. From this point onward nothing stands between person- ality and the infinite God. Its relationship to him is an immediate one. It is no longer a case of various levels, higher and lower, reaching up to the possibility of divin- ization. A human being is simply human, and stands in a relationship to God that is direct—but at the same time external. This was felt by those who knew the perspective of the Mysteries to be a new note in their attitude to the world. Many individuals found themselves in this situa- tion during the first centuries of Christianity. They were aware of the character of the Mysteries, and if they wished to become Christians they had somehow to come to terms with their former outlook. That could lead to severe psychic struggles. In all sorts of ways they sought to find an accommodation between the two divergent ways of looking at the world. The writings of the first Christian centuries mirror this struggle—not least the writings of those pagans attracted by the exalted nature of Christianity, as well as those of Christians who neverthe- less found it hard to relinquish the ways of the Mysteries. Christianity emerged only slowly out of the Mysteries. Christian convictions might be expressed in the form of Mystery-truths. Christian language might clothe the wis- dom belonging to the Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Essence of Christianity 147 One example is Clement of Alexandria (died A . D . 217), a Christian author who had been educated as a pagan. He wrote: Thus the Lord did not hinder from doing good on the sabbath, but allowed us to communicate those divine Mysteries and that holy light to those who are able to receive them. He certainly did not disclose to the many what did not belong to the many, but to the few to whom he knew that they belonged, and who were capable of receiving and being molded accord- ing to them. But secret things are entrusted to speech, not to writing, as is the case with God.... “God gave to the church some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors, and teachers for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the Body of Christ.” 164 Individuals sought by the most varied routes to find their way from the ancient ideas to Christian ones.

The concept of “heresy” became increasingly rigid. The Church took it upon her- self to decide who had deviated too far from her carefully guarded sacred truths.

It was, however, through the several Gnostic sects and writers that the struggle between the way of the Mysteries and that of Christianity took on its specific coloring. The term Gnostics is applied to all those writers from the first centuries of Christianity who sought for a deeper, spiritual meaning in its teachings. 166 They are to be understood as thinkers steeped in the ancient mysterioso- phy and striving to comprehend Christianity from the viewpoint of the Mysteries. From their perspective Christ is above all a spiritual being, the Logos . In this his primal form he cannot have an external relationship to humanity, but must be awakened to life in the soul. At the same time, there must be a connection between the spiritual Logos and the Jesus of history, and here we come to the crux of the Gnostic controversy.

The Esoteric Tradition A special interest attaches to the teachings that we find in the books attributed to Dionysus the Areopagite. 167 It is admittedly the case that these books are never men- tioned prior to the sixth century A . D ., but the place and date of their composition is not the relevant question here. What interests us is that they present Christianity, through the medium of ideas of Neoplatonic philosophy, entirely as a spiritual vision of the supersensible world. And this is a form of presentation that actually belongs specifically to the early centuries of Christianity. In the early period this presentation of Christianity was handed down orally—in earlier times it was the most important things that were definitely not entrusted to written form. We see this Christianity as it were reflected in the mir- ror of Neoplatonism: the perceptions of the senses darken human vision of the spirit; human beings must raise them- selves above the senses. Yet all human thought derives its meaning in the first instance from the observations of the senses.

God in this sense neither exists nor does not exist. He transcends existence. God cannot be approached therefore through the medium of ordinary cognition, which is concerned with things that exist. We have to be raised above ourselves, above our sensory observation, above our rational think- ing-processes, and cross over to purely spiritual appre- hension. Then we can begin to grasp, in mystical intuition, the perspective of the divine. However, the superexistent God has brought forth from himself the Logos , the wisdom-filled foundation of the universe. And the Logos is accessible to the weaker human faculties. He is present in the structure of the world and mediates between God and humanity. The Logos may be present in humanity in various degrees, and may be actualized in the world through an institution, whose hierarchy expresses the different levels to which he fills its members. The Logos is active in a perceptible way within such a “Church.” And the same power that enlivens it had once lived in Christ who became flesh, in Jesus. 168 Gnosticism had made one thing clear: there was a need to come to terms with Jesus as a personality. Christ and Jesus had somehow to be related. Human personality had been deprived of its share in the divine nature, which had in some manner to be rediscovered. It had to be possible to find it again in Jesus."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Essence of Christianity 151 The mystai had been concerned with levels of divinity within themselves, and with the personality known to the earthly senses. The Christian was concerned with this, but also with an exalted God, perfect beyond anything attain- able by human beings. If we can grasp this, we will see how a Christian “mysticism”—the attitude of the soul when it finds a higher spiritual nature within itself—is possible only when the inner eye is opened to the light that streams from the Christ in the person of Jesus. Union of the soul with its own inner energy is simultaneously union with the historical Christ. Mysticism is the unmedi- ated feeling or perception of God within one’s own soul. Yet a God who transcends utterly everything merely human cannot in the strict sense of the word be said to indwell the human soul. Gnosticism and the Christian mysticism which succeeded it represent an effort to par- ticipate somehow in that divinity with one’s soul, without any intermediary. Conflict here was inevitable. For in reality it was possible to find only one’s own divine nature—and that is of course the divine at a certain stage of development, while the God of the Christians is a being complete and perfect in himself. It was possible to find the strength to aspire heaven- ward, but nothing was to be found within the soul, at any stage of its development, that could be declared identical with God. A gulf begins to yawn between the experience of the soul and the God asserted by Christianity. It is the gulf between conviction and belief, between knowledge and religious feeling.

They accepted that God"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"152 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT could be known only according to one’s own degree, and understood why this must be so. And they knew that the God whom they knew in this gradually unfolding way was the true, the living God. They would have found it difficult to speak about a Godhead perfect and closed in his own nature. The mystai were not interested in knowl- edge of a perfect God, but in an experience of the divine life. They wished to “become God,” not to establish a relationship to a Godhead outside of themselves. It is inherent in Christianity, then, that its mystical striv- ing is not without presuppositions. The Christian mystic seeks the Godhead within, but to do so must look to the historical Christ as the physical eye looks to the Sun. The physical eye tells us that what it can see, it sees by the light of the Sun, and the Christian initiate tells us that one ascends in one’s own inner nature to the vision of God, but the light by which one sees is the light of Christ- made-manifest. It is through him that the mystic ascends to the highest point within. So does the mysticism of medieval Christianity differ from the experiences of the mystai in the ancient Mysteries. 169"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Christian and Pagan Wisdom 153 CHAPTER 11 CHRISTIAN AND PAGAN WISDOM Philo Judaeus: The Mystery of the Logos At the time of Christian origins we also find the develop- ment within the ancient pagan culture of certain world conceptions that constitute a continuation of platonic thought, but which also have roots in a mysteriosophy that has been refined, made inward and spiritual. They appear first with Philo of Alexandria (c. 25 B . C .– A . D . 50). The path to divinization, according to his view, is an entirely inward one taking place in the soul. One might aptly say that for Philo the “Temple of the Mysteries” where he seeks initiation is nothing other than his own inner being and the experiences that it undergoes. 170 He translates the Mystery-rites used in their enactments into processes of a purely psychological and conceptual nature. He does not see any possibility of reaching the divine through the impressions of the senses or through rational understanding. These are concerned only with temporal things. But there is a path of the soul that enables it to transcend these modes of knowledge, and to step outside its ordinary identity, abandoning in ecstatic trance all that it called “I.” It is then in a state of spiritual"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"154 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT exaltation, or “illumination.” It no longer has thought, ideas, or knowledge in the usual sense, but is merged into and united with God. The divine is an experience that cannot be put into the form of thoughts or ideas that express what it is like. It must be experienced. And any- one who has experienced the divine has to admit that it can be conveyed only indirectly, through the living qual- ity of one’s words. The cosmos is an image of this Mystery-Being whose reality is experienced in the deepest strata of the soul. It originated from the invisible and inconceivable God, and the wise ordering of the cosmos directly reflects the divine nature, harmonizing the phenomena of sense perception. In its wisdom and harmony it mirrors spiritually the Godhead, the divine spirit or mind that has been poured out into the world; this is the cosmic Reason or Logos , the “offspring” or Son of God. The Logos mediates between the percep- tible world and the imageless God. Human beings are united with the Logos insofar as they really possess knowl- edge. In them the Logos is embodied; a spiritually devel- oped person is a representative of the Logos. Above and beyond the Logos is God. Beneath it is the transient world. Our human vocation is to link them in one. The spirit we encounter in our own inner nature is at the same time the spirit of the cosmos. Much in this way of thinking is reminiscent of the Pythagoreans—that the heart of reality must be looked for in the inner life. At the same time, the inner life includes an awareness of cosmic significance. Augustine speaks in essentially Philonic terms when he says:"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Christian and Pagan Wisdom 155 We therefore behold these things which you [God] have created, because they are; but they are, because you see them. And his further comment on what and how we see them is also striking: And we see externally that they are; but inwardly that they are good. 171 All this has its origins in Plato. Like Plato, Philo inter- prets the destiny of the human soul as the denouement in a cosmic drama, when the hidden God awakens from the spell. 172 He describes inner events in which the soul is active by saying that Wisdom follows within human beings the ways of her Father, looking upon the archetypes and shap- ing forms in accordance with them. 173 Thus it is not of merely personal significance for someone to give expres- sion to these forms; rather they are the eternal Wisdom— the life of the world. His view accords with the Mystery- attitude toward the familiar myths. The mystai looked for the deeper reality behind the myths, and what they did in the case of the pagan mythology, Philo does with the tale of origins contained in the books attributed to Moses. The Old Testament narratives he treats as images of internal, psychic processes. Take the creation of the world recounted in the Bible. To read it as expressing things that happened in an external way is to grasp only one half of its meaning. It does indeed say:"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"156 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth. Now the Earth was formless and empty, dark- ness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. 174 But the inner truth that lies behind such words has to be experienced in one’s own inner depths. God must first be found within, and then he will be rec- ognized as “the archetypal essence, sending forth myriads of rays, none of them visible to sense, but all grasped by the mind.” 175 That is how Philo describes God. And something almost identical can be recognized in Plato’s Timaeus : When the Father who had begotten it perceived that the universe was alive and in motion, a shrine for the eternal gods [that is, the stars], he was well pleased. 176 Compare the Bible’s “And God saw everything, that it was good.” In this platonizing way, Philo assimilates the meaning of the Bible to the experiences of the Mysteries, making the knowledge of the divine arise from the cre- ation-process, which takes place in one’s own soul as the working-out of its destiny. The story of creation and that of the soul’s divinization are one and the same. Philo acts on the assumption that the narratives in the Mosaic primordial history can be used to tell the story of the soul in its search for God. Everything in the Bible thus becomes profoundly symbolic, and Philo is the interpreter of its symbolism, reading the Bible as the story of the soul. It may rightly be said that Philo’s method of exegesis"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Christian and Pagan Wisdom 157 corresponds to contemporary techniques pioneered by mysteriosophy. He himself draws attention to the same approach to the ancient scriptures among the Therapeutae: They have also writings of men of old, who were the founders of their sect, and had left behind many memorials of the type of treatment employed in allegory .... Their interpretations of the Holy Scrip- tures are made in accordance with the deeper mean- ings conveyed in allegory. Philo’s aim was likewise to uncover the deeper mean- ing hidden in the Old Testament “allegories.” It is worth considering where such exegesis could lead. Reading the creation story, one comes upon something that refers not merely to outer events but furnishes an image for the path of the soul toward divinization. The soul, then, must undertake on the microcosmic level to fol- low in the footsteps of God; that is the only way of describing its Mystery-striving after wisdom. It is the cos- mic drama itself that is played out in every soul. The pri- mal image expressed in the account of the creation finds its fulfillment in the inner life of the Mystery-adept. Moses wrote, not just to recount historical occurrences, but to provide images of the course that will lead the soul to God. Philo’s conception renders everything a spiritual reality within a person’s own being. The human experience is a subjective echo of God’s cosmic experience. God’s Word, the Logos , becomes a reality within the soul. God brought the Jews out of Egypt and led them to the Promised Land, subjecting them to trials and privations before giving"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"158 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT them the land as their reward—these were outward events. But one has to go through them as an inner expe- rience, departing from the land of Egypt (the perishable world), going through privations (the suppression of the sense-nature) until the promised land of the soul (the Eternal) is attained. Philo turns it all into a sequence of inner happenings. The Mystery-God who has poured himself out into the world celebrates his return to life in the soul, which has grasped his creative Word, and in which it becomes real- ity once more. A person then has God within, having inwardly given birth to the divine Spirit, which has taken on human form: the Logos (Christ). Philo and those who took up his ideas were able to conceive of spiritual knowl- edge as the birth of Christ on the level of inner truth. Plotinus and Neoplatonism Developing alongside Christianity, the Neoplatonic view of the world also constituted a continuation of the Philonic mode of thought. Let us examine the way Ploti- nus ( A . D . 204–269) describes his inner experience: It has happened often. Roused into myself from my body—outside everything else and inside myself—my gaze has met a beauty wondrous and great. At such moments I have been certain that mine was the better part, mine the best of lives lived to the fullest, mine identity with the divine. Fixed there firmly, poised above everything in the intellectual that is less than the highest, utter actuality was mine."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Christian and Pagan Wisdom 159 But then there has come the descent, down from intellection to the discourse of reason. And it leaves me puzzled. Why this descent? Indeed, why did my soul ever enter my body since even when in the body it remains what it has shown itself to be when by itself? 177 And elsewhere: How is it then that souls forget the divinity that begot them so that—divine by nature, divine by ori- gin—they now know neither divinity nor self? This evil has befallen them having its source in willful self-assertion, in being born, in becoming different, in desiring to be independent. Once having tasted the pleasures of independence, they use their freedom to go in a direction that leads away from their origin. And when they have gone a great dis- tance, they even forget that they came from it. Like children separated from their family since birth and educated away from home, they are ignorant now of their parentage and therefore of their identity. 178 He continues by describing the way of life and devel- opment which the soul should seek: It must be quiet. Let us assume that quiet too is the body that wraps it round—quiet the Earth, quiet the air and the sea, quiet the high heavens.

The community of the followers of Jesus proclaimed: That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched—this we announce concerning the Word of Life. 180 A Neoplatonic paraphrase might be: That which was from the beginning, which cannot be perceived with the eyes or ears—this is what must be grasped spiritually as the Word of Life. Mysticism and Fact The development of ancient thought thus comes to a head with a sharp polarization. In Neoplatonism and world-views belonging to the same family, we come to an idea of Christ that is purely spiritual. Elsewhere, we find the identification of this idea of Christ with a historical figure in whom it is manifested, namely Jesus. But one might say that the author of the Gospel of John spans both these views. He says: “In the beginning was the Word.” Here he is at one with the Neoplatonic line: The Word is spiritually begotten within the soul as the Neoplatonists hold. And then: The Word became flesh in the person of Jesus. This is the view he holds in common with the whole body of Christians."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Christian and Pagan Wisdom 161 The precise sense in which it could be said that the Word became flesh can only be grasped on the basis of ancient thought in the whole sweep of its development. Plato gives us the cosmic side when he describes how God stretched out the anima mundi in the form of a cross. This universal soul is the Logos , and if the Logos is to become flesh it must be through the repetition in fleshly existence of the macrocosmic events, being nailed to the cross and rising to new life. The profoundest idea in Christianity had long before been sketched out, in spiritual terms, by the ancient cosmogonies. The cosmogony was experienced anew by the mystai in the rites of initiation. But the one who was “the Word made flesh” had to go through it in historical actuality, so that it should have meaning for all humanity. The content of the archaic mysteriosophy emerged, through Christianity, to become a historical event; and in this sense Christianity is not only the fulfillment of the hopes expressed by the prophets of Jewish tradition, but also of what had been prefigured in the Mysteries. The cross on Golgotha is the Mystery-cult of antiquity epito- mized in a historical fact. Encountered first in the ancient cosmologies, the cross reappears in the context of a unique historical event, accessible to all humanity. There it forms the point of departure for Christianity. Understood in this way, Christianity has its mystical aspect. As simultaneously mysticism and fact, Christianity is a breakthrough in the historical development of humanity for which the pro- cesses of the Mysteries, with the results that they brought about, form a prior evolutionary stage."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"162 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT CHAPTER 12 AUGUSTINE AND THE CHURCH The violence of the struggle played out in the souls of those who wrenched themselves free from paganism and made the transition to the new religion of Christian belief can be witnessed in its full force only in the figure of Augustine ( A . D . 354–430). 181 To understand the convul- sions of his spiritual life is at the same time to participate behind the scenes in those that rocked the souls of an Ori- gen, a Clement of Alexandria, a Gregory of Nazianzus, a Jerome, and the others. And it is in Augustine that their struggles are laid to rest. Augustine is the sort of person whose spiritual needs arise out of a passionate nature, and so are of the deepest kind. He passed through pagan and semi-Christian ideas, suffered intense doubts when his various ideas seemed impotent in the face of his spiritual crises, was laid low by the feeling of desperation, which asks “Can anything really be known?” When his striving began, he found his ideas bounded by perishable and sense-perceptible things, and was able to conceive of the spirit only in pic- torial terms. Getting above this stage was like being set free, as he records in his Confessions :"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Augustine and the Church 163 When I tried to think of my God, I could think of him only as a bodily substance, because I could not conceive of the existence of anything else. This was the principal and almost the only cause of the error from which I could not escape. 182 Every quest for the spirit must pass through this stage if it is a living search. Despite the fact that many thinkers (and not just a few!) deny the possibility of reaching a thinking utterly purged of sense-perceptible content, they actually confuse their own limitations with what is possible in general. The point is precisely that a thinking purified of all sensory content is the prerequisite of “higher knowledge,” whose psychic content does not cease when it is no longer shored up by impressions from the senses. Augustine achieved the ascent to spiritual vision, as he himself relates. He tells how he sought everywhere for “God”: I put my question to the Earth. It answered, “I am not God,” and all things on Earth declared the same. I asked the sea and the chasms of the deep and the living things that creep in them, but they answered, “We are not your God. Seek what is above us.” I spoke to the winds that blow, and the whole air and all that lives in it replied to me, “Anaximenes is wrong. I am not your God.” I asked the sky, the Sun, the Moon and the stars, but they, too, told me, “Neither are we the God whom you seek.” 183"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"164 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT And Augustine realized that the answer to his question about how to find God could come only from one source—his own soul. His soul said that the eyes and ears could not tell what lay within it, but that it speaks in an immediate, and more- over in an indubitable fashion: Men may doubt whether vital force resides in air or in fire, but who can doubt that he himself lives, remembers, understands, wills, thinks, knows, and judges? If he doubts, it is a proof that he is alive, he remembers why he doubted, he understands that he doubts, he will assure himself of something, he thinks, he knows that he knows nothing, he judges that he must not accept anything hastily. 184 Unlike external objects, which do not react against attempts to deny their existence, the soul leaps to its own defense. Even the fact that it doubted itself presumes its existence, and in its act of doubt affirms its reality: We exist; we know that we exist, and we are glad of this existence and this knowledge. In those three things there is no plausible deception to trouble us. For we do not apprehend those truths by the bodily senses by which we are in contact with the world outside us. 185 A person’s experience of God begins when the soul is able to grasp its own inherently spiritual nature, and"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Augustine and the Church 165 thence the path into the spiritual world. It was August- ine’s achievement that he understood this. In pagan culture, a similar mood had given rise to the wish among those who sought for knowledge to approach the portals of the Mysteries. In Augustine’s time one might instead become a convert to Christianity. The Word that had become man, Jesus, had shown the path by which the soul could come once more to be at peace with itself. In A . D . 385 Augustine submitted to the instruction of Ambrose in Milan. All his previous reservations about the Old and New Testaments evaporated when his instructor interpreted the major portions not just according to the lit- eral sense but “lifting the veil that concealed their spiri- tual meaning.” 186 The content of what the Mysteries had guarded was thereby incorporated for him into the histor- ical tradition preserved in the Gospels and the Church. He came to accept it as a “reasonable ordinance, that within the bounds of moderation and honesty things for which there was no proof should simply be believed.” 187 His conclusion was: Who could be so blind as to say that the Church of the apostles deserves to have no faith placed in it, when it is so loyal and is supported by the conformity of so many brethren; when these have handed down their writings to posterity so conscientiously and when the Church has so strictly maintained the succession of teachers down to our present bishops? 188 Augustine’s mode of thought gave him the assurance that since the Event of Christ the conditions for those souls"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"166 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT who seek the spirit have changed from what they were. He is certain that in Christ Jesus everything has been revealed, in the external and historical world, which the mystai had sought for through the discipline of the Mysteries. Among his profoundest utterances is his declaration: What is now called the Christian religion existed already among the ancients, and was not lacking at the very beginnings of the human race. When Christ appeared in the flesh, the true religion already in existence received the name of Christian. 189 Two courses lie open for one who thinks in such a way. One would be to assume that the soul, by unfolding the powers that lead it to a knowledge of one’s true self, could attain, by extension, to a knowledge of Christ and all that it means. That would have been an enriching of Mystery- knowledge through Christ. But it is the other path that Augustine actually took, and which made him the great exemplar to many who came after him. It amounts to this: at a certain stage of development one arrests the forces of the soul and adopts instead the idea of the Christ Event contained in the written documents and oral tradition of the Church. The first way Augustine rejected because he felt it sprang from the vanity of the soul, whereas the second was correspondingly full of humility. To those who wished to follow the first course, he said: You may find peace in the truth, but for this humility is needed, which does not suit your proud neck."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Augustine and the Church 167 But it filled him with boundless inner joy to think that since the “appearance of Christ in the flesh” every soul can have an experience of spiritual reality. Every soul must seek to the very limits of its endeavor, and then in order to touch the very heights it must entrust itself to faith in what the texts and traditions of the Christian ecclesia have to tell of Christ and his revelation. As he put it: What bliss, what abiding enjoyment of supreme and true good is offered to us, what serenity, what a breath of eternity! How shall I describe it? It has been expressed, as far as it could be, by those great incomparable souls who we admit have beheld and still behold. . . . We reach a point at which we acknowledge how true is what we have been com- manded to believe and how well and beneficently we have been brought up by our mother the Church, and of what benefit was the milk given by the apostle Paul to the little ones. 190 This is not the place to explore what might be made of the other path of developing a mode of thinking from the knowledge of the Mysteries enriched by the Event of Christ. 191 In pre-Christian times, the search for the spiritual foun- dations of life led inevitably to the path represented by the Mysteries.

Note : It was but one step further to assert that by its nature the human soul could only attain to a certain degree of knowledge by its own unaided powers, and that thereafter further progress was dependent upon faith—on belief in the written and oral tradition of Christianity. This direc- tion in spiritual life was taken when “natural knowledge” was assigned a specific domain that the human soul was declared to be unable to transcend. Everything beyond that domain, it was said, was an object of faith and the representatives of this direction of thought demanded a trust in what rested upon the foundations of the written and oral tradition. This is the viewpoint expressed in his writings in the most manifold ways by the greatest teacher known to the Church, Thomas Aquinas (1225– 1274). His works express the view that human knowledge is simply unable to progress beyond the point reached by Augustine: knowledge of self and a certainty of the divine. As to the nature of God and his relationship to the world—that is inaccessible to human cognitive powers. It forms the content of revealed religion, and as such is exalted above all knowledge. 192 We witness these ideas crystallizing in the world- view of John Scotus Erigena, who lived in the ninth cen- tury at the court of Charles the Bald.

Everything is to be reintegrated into God, who has gone forth into the cosmic process and in due course arrives once more at perfection. For this to hap- pen, however, humanity must find the way to the Logos that was made flesh. Erigena takes up and extends this idea; for it is in the scriptures that we learn about the Logos , and therefore it is belief in what they contain that leads to salvation.

Christianity was a continuation of the perspective of the Mysteries. But there were also changes. A share in the truth was no longer to be reserved for the few but was opened to all—in such a way, however, that one had to concede a point at which further knowledge became impossible, and further progress had to be based on faith.

Yet those with deeper natures feel, with painful dissatisfac- tion, the contradiction between what Rosa Mayreder calls, in illuminating words, “the life of nature according to Darwinian theory, and the goal of the furtherance of human development.” 1 Anyone who looks beneath the surface of modern ideas cannot fail to see the gulf that yawns between two com- ponents in contemporary life. The head of modern humanity can only be satisfied by the naturalism of scien- tific thinking; but the heart is still steeped in the feelings that religious training and a tradition that has remained vital over thousands of years have implanted there. No reconciliation seems possible between intellect and feel- ing. “Science,” says Rosa Mayreder in her essay, “appeals to rational insight; religion sets the goal of com- mitting oneself through faith to the indefinable.” One has to ask whether such a contradiction is inevita- ble—or is it, perhaps, that the cultured people of today have not yet reached the point where they can affirm in their hearts as progressive and positive what the mind 1.

To this the only possible answer seems to be: we may have learned how to understand our relationship to nature scientifically, but not how to live it. No, we do not actually live our scientific theories. See how many there are who are delighted when Harnack, for example, says in his The Essence of Christianity : “How doubtful would mankind’s situation be if the deeper peace for which it longs, and the clarity, conviction and power for which it strives, were dependent upon the degree of its enlightenment and education!” They may admit the truth of natural science with their heads, but with their hearts they long for quite different sources of satisfaction. For those with eyes to see, it is quite clear that even those who take their stand on the grounds of natural sci- ence cannot translate this knowledge into the reality of life. Not even the great scientists can do so. I would not be misunderstood—devout enthusiast for Ernst Haeckel’s work as I am—when I say that the polemics Haeckel heaps against Christianity often betray the feelings that have been planted in the heart by distorted versions of Christianity. For how can a protagonist of evolutionary theory look upon Christianity otherwise than as itself the product of an evolution in accord with the laws of nature? Would such a proponent not have to understand that we now live in the presence of a truth that is related to prior conceptions of the world in exactly the same way as, within the order of nature, human beings are related to their animal predecessors?

Those who accept the arguments of natural science, however, but in their hearts (without knowing how strongly!) hold to the traditional ideas of religion, are like creatures descended far back from fishes that even now refuse to come out of the water. Such is the approach I have adopted in tracing one aspect of the emergence of Christianity in this book.

It was meant to indicate the special approach adopted in the book. Its theme is not just the mystical side of Christianity in a historical presen- tation. It was meant to show how Christianity came into being, from the standpoint of a mystical awareness. Behind this lay the idea that spiritual happenings were fac- tors in its emergence, which could only be observed from such a point of view. It is for the book itself to demonstrate that by “mystical” I intend nothing in the way of vague intuition rather than strict scientific argument. In many cir- cles mysticism is understood to be just that, and therefore to be distinguished from the concerns of all “genuine sci- ence.” But in this book I use the term to mean a presenta- tion of spiritual reality—a reality only accessible to a knowledge drawn from the sources of spiritual life itself. Anyone who denies the possibility of such knowledge in principle will find its contents hard to relate to; a reader who accepts that mysticism may coexist with the clarity of the natural sciences, however, may admit that the mystical aspect of Christianity has to be mystically described.

Hostility toward such an approach, on the grounds that it is inimical to the scientific spirit, is widespread today. And the same must be said of those who come to investigate the nature of Christianity as believers as of those who will hear only of what they call “real scientific knowledge.” I have based my work, how- ever, on the idea that the achievements of modern science lead over into a genuine mystical viewpoint. To deny such a possibility, from this point of view, is actually a contradiction of the scientific attitude that underlies those achievements. The epistemological conclusions, claimed by so many to be the only ones grounded in the facts of science, are in reality quite unable to explain the scope of that natural science itself. This book will not be rejected, then, by those who see that mysticism may properly be combined with an appre- ciation of our up-to-date understanding of nature. The “mystical knowledge” described here will lead me to show, in this book, how the creative power at work in Christianity was preparing the grounds for its own appearance in the pre-Christian Mystery-cults. The pre- Christian “mysticism” of these cults was the soil in which the seed of Christianity was able to grow and become independent—enabling us to understand Chris- tianity in its own right, while tracing it back to the pre- Christian mystical experience from which it evolved.

In the pages that follow, I emphasize that Christianity presupposes earlier mysticism as a seed presupposes a place to grow. The study of Christian origins will serve to bring out, rather than to obscure, the unique nature of Christianity. It is a deep source of satisfaction to me that this view of “the essence of Christianity” has been embraced by a writer whose works on the spiritual life of humanity have profoundly enriched our culture: Edouard Schuré, author of The Great Initiates 2 . He was so far in agreement as to undertake a translation into French under the title Le mystère chrétien et les mystères antiques . As a sign of the longing for the kind of approach to Christianity this book contains, it may be mentioned that the first edition was translated into a number of other European languages besides French. While preparing this second edition, I have found little to alter in essentials. Some passages from the first edition of eight years ago have been expanded. Sometimes I have been able to add greater detail or to clarify what was then said. It is a source of regret to me that, owing to pressure of work, so long a period has elapsed between the first edition being no longer available and the appearance of this one. 2.

More and more it has become impossible to discuss the spiritual needs or the soul’s inner life without taking into account the scientific context. (True, many people find spiritual satisfaction quite undisturbed by the influence of science. But those who are in touch with the pulse of their time cannot do so.) Our heads are filled, with increasing rapidity, by the ideas stemming from our knowledge of nature and our hearts are drawn unwillingly after, often in despondency and dismay. What concerns us is not just the numbers of people who succumb to the power that lies in scientific ways of thinking, but the fact itself. That is what convinces the observer that here we have something that cannot be ignored if we are to form a modern conception of the world. Many of the by-products of such thinking admit- tedly require us to reject its assumptions. Nevertheless, it is clearly not enough just to reject them, given that many people are attracted to them—indeed, drawn to them as by a magic power.

Then we must consider the other group, whose hearts have not kept pace with their heads. These have accepted the scientific outlook as inevitable; the weight of evi- dence seems decisive. But the religious needs of their souls remain unsatisfied, and the vista that opens before them appears too dreary. What then? Is the soul of humanity to rise, aspiring to the pinnacles of beauty, truth, and goodness, while in each individual case it turns out to be only a bubble, rising from the material brain and ending in nothingness? Such is the nightmare feeling that affects many people, and the ideas of science seem oppressive to them also because of the huge weight of authority behind them. People contrive to remain blind for as long as possible to the contradiction within their own soul. In fact, they console themselves by saying that such matters are inscrutable. While sense-experience and logical reasoning require it, they think in a scientific way; but they hold on to the religious feelings from their upbringing.

Beyond doubt too is the fact that as an immediate solution to spiritual needs, science is shallow and simplistic. Despair would be unavoidable if its way were the right one. Would it not be insupportable if we had to think along the lines of these sentences from a pamphlet by R. G. Ingersoll: Thought is a form of force. We walk and we think by means of the same form of force. Man’s organ- ism transforms certain forces in thought-force, which is sustained by the intake of what we call “food” and turned into what we call “thoughts.” What wonderful chemistry that can produce the divine tragedy of Hamlet by means of digestion! Of course, not everyone accepts what is put forward by the proponents of these ideas; but that is not the point, which is that countless people are compelled by the atti- tude of science to think in this way about the world around them, even if they will not admit it to themselves. The modern prophets of science try to thrust upon us a dreary prospect—dreariest of all for those who have real- ized that the results of natural science show that in its own terms it is unassailable. They recognize that however much the details may be challenged, however many books are written or researches compiled about the strug- gle for existence and its random nature, about the decisive character of “natural selection” or its irrelevance, the direction in which science is moving will find (within limits) ever increasing acceptance."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"182 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT So are the implications of science really what these pro- ponents make them out to be? Their own behavior shows that they are not. For in their own work they do not follow the path shown by the pioneers in other fields. Would Darwin and Haeckel have made their great discoveries in evolution if they had spent their time, not out observing life and the structure of living organisms, but incarcerated in the laboratory experimenting on specimens of tissue? Could Lyell have explained the formation of the Earth’s crust if he had examined, not the composition of the var- ious strata as they occur but just the chemical classifica- tion of numberless rocks? If we were really to follow in the footsteps of the great figures, the towering geniuses of modern science, we would apply to spiritual life the same approach they brought to bear on nature. That would not bring us to the idea of creating the “divine” tragedy of Hamlet by chemical processes of digestion, any more than a natural scientist would claim to have understood the role of heat in the formation of the Earth after having studied a piece of sulfur warmed in a retort, or the struc- ture of the brain after subjecting an extract to the effects of acid rather than investigating how it has evolved out of the organs belonging to lower forms of life. It is true, then: the investigation of spiritual things can indeed learn from the example of natural science—only it must be a real imitation of scientific discovery, and not be misled by the views of certain proponents of science. There should be research in the spiritual domain as there has been in the physical domain. But that is a different matter from the opinions scientists have formed about the"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Appendix 183 spiritual world, confused by their narrow application to physical phenomena alone. To act in the spirit of natural science would be to study the spiritual evolution of humanity impartially, as the naturalist observes the sense- world. That would lead in the domain of spiritual life to a method of investigation as different from purely natural science as is geology from theoretical physics, or evolu- tionary theory from advanced chemical research. It would lead to higher methodological principles, which would certainly not be identical with those of natural science, but would be in agreement with all that we really mean by scientific inquiry. Thus we can modify or correct the one-sided views deriving from scientific research by means of an added perspective. In doing so we are not betraying science, but advancing it. Such advances are necessary if we are to be able to get inside the spiritual processes that shape the inner realities of Christianity or other world religions. To apply these methods may stir up opposition from the sci- entific establishment, but they are justifiable and in accord with the scientific way of thinking. This kind of research must go beyond the philological investigation of religious documents. The analogy from natural scientific research still holds: to explain a law of chemistry, it is of no use to characterize the retorts, ves- sels, or tweezers used in the experiment that led to its dis- covery!

Nowadays it is quite possible for there to be people who experience the spiritual world directly, and people who grasp what they have experi- enced in ideas. But that would not have been the case in the ancient world. What is said about the impossibility of communicating the teachings of the Mysteries really refers to the kind of experience the initiate has, which certainly cannot be shared by those who have not under- gone preparation.

Hindes With the publication of Christianity As Mystical Fact in 1902, Rudolf Steiner, at the age of 40, appears to have taken a radical turn in his work. Until then he was known for philosophical and literary publications in which he stressed the autonomy of human knowledge, rejecting completely any dogmatic worldview, especially the dog- matic Christianity of the Church. Here for the first time he himself is speaking about the substance of Christianity, which until then he had completely rejected in its form as ecclesiastical dogma. It would be easy to assume that he gave a spiritual-sci- entific commentary on various aspects of traditional teachings, and supplemented what was already “known” from Christian tradition with profound insights for even deeper knowledge. Rudolf Steiner has been misunder- stood again and again in this regard, as, for example, when his lecture cycles are seen simply as anthroposoph- ical commentaries on the Bible. This is precisely what he never intended. In Mysticism at the Dawn of the Modern Age, which appeared one year earlier in 1901, he discussed among other things the figure of Nicholas Cusanus, who was a"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"190 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT modern, “scientific” man. 1 As such Cusanus could have followed his own path of knowledge, unrestrained, developing the deepest, purely-human forces. He then would have presented “self-discovered” ideas and opened a new path to an understanding of the world. But those who assume such a task leave behind the inner foundation that carries them. “Their strength easily fades” and then they take “refuge in a revelation that comes from outside of them.” They then present teach- ings, such as was the case with Nicholas Cusanus, that are “brilliant” and are “brought in a way that is in keep- ing with dogmatic Christianity.” This particular characterization of Nicholas Cusanus contains an autobiographical element; for the path that Cusanus could not take is precisely Rudolf Steiner’s own path, on which he clearly rejected any sort of “refuge in a revelation that comes from outside” himself. When Rudolf Steiner speaks concerning Christianity, he does not refer to tradition. Traditional ideas are not his source but rather ideas that he himself has discovered. Only inas- much as he finds such self-discovered ideas within tradi- tional sources can they have any significance for him and thus be incorporated into his descriptions. To understand the sources he drew upon to speak in such an independent way about Christianity, we must consider Rudolf Steiner’s own path. 1.

Or: Is the “thing- in-itself” (in Kant’s sense) inaccessible to the human spirit? Such a conclusion would mean that the human spirit is held captive in its own subjective ideas concern- ing the world? This is the question of the essence of human knowledge and therefore the question concerning what role the human being should play in the world pro- cess. Kant’s understanding is, in principle, also extremely common today. Our understanding of the world takes place, aided by models of thought created by the various sciences accord- ing to their specific questions. Such models help us to bet- ter master the world, but they are not expected to actually describe reality. It is astonishing to realize that Rudolf Steiner, already on his own path at the age of twenty-one, had philosophically overcome Kant’s limiting philoso- phy. The improbable result of this struggle is a short essay that remained unpublished during his lifetime. 2 The rest of his life is a step-by-step unfolding of an understanding and epistemology of the world that proceeds from the thinking that can comprehend reality. Rudolf Steiner opposed the current view that reality is located somewhere outside our knowing, and that the human thought image that repro- duces this reality occurs through knowing, or perhaps specifically not; he held that this reality cannot be found 2. “ Einzig mögliche Kritik der atomistischen Begriffe ” (“The only possible critique of the concept of atomism”), in “ Beiträge zur Rudolf Steiner Gesamtausgabe ,” Nr. 63, Rudolf Steiner-Nachlaßverwaltung, Dornach, Switzerland, 1978."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"192 C HRISTIANITY A S M YSTICAL F ACT through knowing, because it is only created as reality through the act of our knowing. 3 Rudolf Steiner’s path to knowledge has absolutely no presuppositions. It is grounded in the experience of real- ity that is possible for every human being. Any assump- tions that arise from a particular world view, such as faith in a spiritual world or in reincarnation, would be just as problematic as the materialistic superstition of natural science. For this reason, when Steiner developed a path of knowledge in his basic philosophical writings, the dog- matism of “revealed religion” was rejected just as sharply as the dogmatism of natural science. Such truth can illu- minate the path of knowledge only as a goal; it is dogma when placed at the beginning. Even as a young man Steiner had pointed out that the “ dogma of revelation . . . passes down to people, one way or another, truths about things withheld from their view. People have no insight into the world from which the pos- tulates arise. They must believe in such truth, because they have no access to its basis.” 4 Steiner objected to such dogmatic faith in the philosophical formulation of his epistemology with increasingly sharp words, and he often mentioned Christianity in this connection. In his autobi- ography, he described in retrospect what he had in mind: 3.

The reason is that, in those days, the doctrine of a world beyond permeated all Christian teachings, and it was these teachings I had in mind when I used the word Christianity . All religious experiences pointed to a world of spirit, supposedly unattainable for human intellect. The substance of religion, its precepts for moral life, supposedly stemmed from revelations bestowed upon humanity from a world external to the human being and beyond the reach of human consciousness. For me this was disproved by my direct inner perception of spirit. I had to main- tain that both the sense-world and the spiritual world are experienced through what is perceptible in human beings and in nature. 5 It is indeed surprising when Rudolf Steiner, in looking back at his path, describes so concisely the spiritual experience he had at the turn of the century: “This expe- rience culminated in my standing in the spiritual pres- ence of the Mystery of Golgotha in a most profound and solemn festival of knowledge.” 6 The path of knowledge, which began with absolutely no assumptions of any kind, had led him to knowledge of Christ. 5.

In the little essay already mentioned, the twenty-one-year-old spoke of the “essential being [ Wesen ] of an object.” In a similar sense, Steiner says in his epistemology, “In thinking, the ground of being shows itself in its most perfect form.” This ulti- mately leads to: “When thinking therefore makes a con- nection, forms a judgment, it is the very substance of the ground of the world itself, having flowed into thinking— that is, connected.” 7 The “ground of being” is here intended in its philosophical sense, but it can also be thought of in a very concrete way, as the being or the essential existence of a thing. Thus the sentences quoted here as examples contain a surprising perspective, because the essential being of thinking (that is, the world’s essence) has an immediate and direct relationship to the world. The closeness of this essential connection goes so far that Steiner can say, “The I is to be found within thinking.” 8 Following Steiner’s descriptions, however, if the mys- tery of the I is so intimately connected with the essential being of thinking—the thinking that is at the same time the essential being of the world—then this points to the hidden role (not yet fully revealed) that Christ plays in the act of knowing. Discussing in his autobiography the time just before the turn of the century, Rudolf Steiner reaches back to a concept from Greek philosophy to describe this 7. The Science of Knowing , pp. 72–73. 8.

Indeed, this is the primary word used in John’s Gospel to characterize Christ. “Thus for me this truth became direct inner experience: In the world and all its processes, the Logos , the Wisdom , the Word holds sway.” 9 We can, of course, understand the three words, logos , wisdom , and world purely in a philosophical way. But we can also see in them the beginning of the experience of Christ in knowing, the goal toward which Rudolf Steiner forged a path. Those who seek the essential being of the world through thinking will become increasingly aware that they cannot reach the goal alone or merely through their own strength. The essential being of what is known must come to meet them. Rudolf Steiner describes the activity of thinking as twofold. To begin with, through our active and independent efforts to think, we create a free space . This first activity of thought “prepares the appearance of thinking”—that is, the essential being of the world. 10 Hence, true knowledge is never one’s own achievement alone; it always requires, as well, a response from this essential being , which appears, as we have seen, only in “relation to the human being” as the Logos incar- nated. This response is always an act of grace. Knowl- edge, understood in this way, is an encounter between our own activity and the world’s essential being. The deepest 9. An Autobiography , p. 292. 10.

This path to knowledge of Christ can also be under- stood as a path of awakening. It begins with the state- ment: “Hence, the first observation that we make about thinking is that it is the unobserved element in our normal spiritual life.” 11 Later, as we have seen, we read, “The I is to be found within thinking.” This statement can be seen as the result of a growing ability to observe think- ing—that is, to wake up to one’s own being. It is like an awakening within the activity of knowing, which un- leashes both knowledge of Christ and knowledge of the true I in thinking; it is a step on the path toward the birth of the I. Rudolf Steiner says of one who experiences such an awakening: “In this moment, one has become a philos- opher.” 12 He does not say: In this moment one has become a Christian. Later, however, he calls this path of awakening that leads to the birth of the I “Pauline thoughts in the realm of epistemology,” because, just as Paul awoke on the way to Damascus to the creative reality of Christ, so does anyone who has become a “philosopher” awaken to the creative power that belongs to the essential being of thinking. 13 11.

In 1912, when Rudolf Steiner published an anthroposophical “Calendar,” he simultaneously produced a surprising way of reckoning years. 14 For the year 1912 it says, “In the 1879th year after the birth of the I.” He is referring to the year 33 and thus to the “Mystery of Golgotha” as the moment when the human I was born. The essence of the Pauline theory of knowledge is an awareness that the Mystery of Golgotha is the authentic source of those pow- ers of insight and knowledge that lead the human being to the true birth of the I. In the first Goetheanum, for which the foundation stone was laid in 1913, this path of knowledge was expressed architecturally in the double-domed hall from west to east. The path began in the west under the red window of knowledge. In the east, before the background 14.

Rudolf Steiner’s path toward this noble goal of knowledge was an inner path through deserts and abysses, through lone- liness of the soul, and through the experience of hell, as described in terms of the Mysteries in Christianity As Mystical Fact. 15 He could follow this path only by ignor- ing consistently all traditional Christianity and all ideal- istic dogma. He had to follow his own path unperturbed by any external influence. And yet he would not have arrived at his goal had he not gone beyond what appeared in Intuitive Thinking As a Spiritual Path as the fruit of the germinal writing of the twenty-one-year-old. He knew the spiritual law: “Knowledge is not gained by asserting only one’s own point of view, but through immersion in streams of thought foreign to one’s own.” 16 Steiner wrote about Nietzsche, and he was con- sidered an absolute “Nietzschean.” 17 In Haeckel’s work Steiner recognized “the most significant accomplish- ment of the German spiritual-cultural life of the second half of the nineteenth century,” and he was seen as a fol- lower of Haeckel. Steiner wrote, however, “Culture is 15. See page 6. 16.

However, he experienced entirely the opposite from others. On his path he remained misunderstood. “Thus at every turn I met the problem: How can I find the way to express in terms understandable to my contemporaries what I inwardly perceive directly as the truth?” And the question became pressing: “Must I remain silent?” 21 His immersion in spiritual streams foreign to himself and his decision not to want his own viewpoint to prevail, led him into a crisis—the loneliness of being misunderstood.

His thinking was transformed by what finally appeared in written form in his World and Life Views in the Nineteenth Century ; he could then follow a path he later called “the path of thought” to Christ. On this path the following holds true: The more we develop a social interest in the opin- ions of other people, even when we consider them false, the more we illuminate our thoughts with the opinions of others, the more we place next to our own thoughts (which we consider true) those devel- oped by others (which we may consider to be in error, but are nevertheless interested in), the more we can feel within our soul the words of Christ, which must be understood today in the new lan- guage of Christ: What you find as opinion, as world view in one of the least of your fellow human beings, therein seek me myself.” 22 In this way Steiner’s method of immersion in spiritual streams foreign to himself became a path of knowledge, a path to Christ through thinking. During this time until the turn of the century there was one “foreign” spiritual stream in which it appears he could not immerse himself, and he differentiated himself 22.

Apparently, after the turn of the century Rudolf Steiner found himself in an entirely new situation. He had devoted himself with complete selflessness to the meth- ods of thought of other people. This became for him a path of thought leading to knowledge of Christ, to Christ himself. Solemnly standing before the Mystery of Golgotha as foundation, Steiner could now immerse him- self also in the ecclesiastical, the “Church” stream, with understanding. This is an entirely new element in his biography, and it opens unusual and wonderful perspec- tives through which the Church can understand how it was born from pre-Christian Mystery religions. Such an understanding is new and unprecedented in the history of Christianity. Immersion in this stream signified a com- plete turn-around for Rudolf Steiner.

This path is therefore not without presuppositions; it is based instead on a pre-existing relationship to, and experience of, Christ himself, who becomes the leader of whoever follows him. Steiner speaks of this for the first time in Christianity As Mysti- cal Fact . It was not yet possible in 1902 to present everything in a fully developed form. The second edi- tion in 1910 is a further development and clarification, and also, in part, a supplement to what was said in 1902. 24 The new understanding results from the perspective of the pre-Christian Mysteries. They are the ground upon which Christianity has developed. Nevertheless, it can- not simply be derived from the Mysteries; it is the “seed of an independent species.” Indeed, we must reverse the causality and say that “the creative power at work in Christianity was preparing the grounds for its own appearance in the pre-Christian Mystery cults.” 25 The Mysteries are the dawning light of the rising Sun of Christianity. 24.

Expressed in modern terms they were educational establishments for the cultural and political elite, the leaders of that time. In contrast to today, inner development and external profes- sional training were intimately connected. Because of this, the inner training and the experiences associated with the Mysteries were essential. In general, admission into the Mysteries was not open to the public; one could be called to them only when the preconditions had been met. These were people whose personalities and gifts were far too developed for them to be simple, ordinary members of a group—that is, regular folk, and “who sought a deeper religious life and knowledge than could be found in the popular religions.” 26 They then under- went an intensive training and experienced profound soul transformations, passing through “death and resurrec- tion.” It was a development that took place in the seclu- sion of the temple and led to creative independence. There was a protected space where the air was prepared for these processes. The initiates were those called to lead others and, at the same time, to guide cultural life. They were born ahead of their time, and they brought to birth the I (the ego, or self) in a particular way that anticipated the development of the general population. “Initiatory knowledge is thus an actual event in the cosmic process. It is the birth of a divine child—a process just as real as any natural process.” 27 26. See page 1. 27.

Has everything been said when we view the human being as creature, perhaps as the crown of creation? Or does “image and likeness of God” per- haps not also mean responsible creativity? What is the path we must travel in order to be transformed from mere creatures to increasingly creative beings? What hap- pened in the Mysteries can convey an impression of this process. Yet people are illuminated from within by the power that fashioned all things, including themselves. They also feel something urging them on to higher cre- ative life. There lies within them something that pre- existed their natural being and will outlive it. It brought them into existence; nevertheless they can seize hold of it and share in its creative force. Such feelings pervaded the life of the ancient mystai as a result of their initiation. 28 Christianity took over from the Mysteries, “when the time was fulfilled” (Galations 4:4). This assumption of the role formerly played by the Mysteries meant that the Mysteries were now to be proclaimed. The veil of the 28.

Previously only the “invited guests” were admitted to the “wedding feast” (Matthew 22). They had been carefully chosen through training and trials. Now all are invited, “both good and evil.” Now the pre- requisite for entrance into the wedding hall is no longer one’s individual training alone. The extent to which one has developed one’s consciousness is no longer the only factor deciding whether or not one can participate in the fruits of initiation. Christianity presents itself as the means by which everyone can find the way. Even those who are not inwardly ripe need not forgo the possibility of par- ticipating, albeit unconsciously, in the current of the Mysteries. . . .

The essential change is the elimi- nation of the sharp separation between the initiate and the folk. “The thought that many were standing outside, uncertain of the way, must have weighed upon the mind of Jesus with nightmare heaviness.” 31 For those standing outside, those who were not yet ripe for initiation, a pos- sibility had to be created so they could find a connection to the Mysteries and acquire at least “part of what had for- merly been attainable only through the techniques of the Mysteries” 32 but now “to a certain degree uncon- sciously.” This appears to be in direct contradiction to the ancient Mystery religions’ principle that spiritual devel- opment is based on the development and expansion of consciousness. How then could an unconscious initiation possibly take place? What would be involved? Two new principles are responsible for making this possible: The role of the proxy in initiation and the principle of community initia- tion . The role of a proxy here means that the initiation of one is also a living reality for all those who “cling to him.” 33 Paul accordingly says that a Christian should suf- fer with Christ, be crucified, resurrect, live, and be glori- fied with Christ. 34 This “clinging to Christ” happens 31.

Through the ‘Mystery of Golgotha’ it was poured out upon the whole Christian community.” 36 One man brings the community along with him so that it can receive there the “fruits of the Mysteries.” The consciousness of the angel of the community (Apocalypse 1:20–2:1) carries the consciousness of the individual who is only more or less awakened. This new principle of an “unconscious” initiation belongs to the Christianity of following Christ , whose substance we receive through tradition. It is not without presuppositions and requires the traditional images upon which faith is based and through which faith is given direction.

Christianity As Mystical Fact is essentially dedicated to this theme.

They are ways of fol- lowing Christ, and therefore they are not without pre- suppositions, based as they are on what was passed down by tradition.

For this reason he can point to the moment when the Church lost its connection to the Mysteries. The decisive moment came in the fourth century at the end of the Early Church. Two paths were thus possible. One path allows that, if the human soul develops inwardly the forces that lead it to true self-cognition, if indeed it goes far enough, it will come to cognition also of the Christ and everything con- nected with him. This would have been a Mystery knowl- edge enriched through the Christ event. The other path is the one actually taken by Augustine, through which he became the great example for his successors. It involves cutting off the development of soul-forces at a certain point and the receiving of ideas connected with the Christ event from written accounts and oral traditions. 38 The ecclesiastical stream of Christianity is united with the “following of Christ,” but it has lost its connection with the Mysteries. Christian mysticism, which contains the principle of initiation, is also connected with the stream of the Church. In his later lectures, Steiner describes this form of mysticism as the “Christian-Gnostic path” with its seven steps. This path of esoteric training is based entirely on the substance of Christianity, primarily on the Gospel of John. It was not Rudolf Steiner’s path to 38.

Steiner later called it the “Christian-Rosicrucian path.” Although it is not based on any presuppositions it is called “Christian,” because the knowledge acquired through it can become knowledge of Christ. In his book How to Know Higher Worlds, Steiner made this path accessible to anyone who seeks it. It is the appropriate path for modern human con- sciousness. Beginning with Christianity As Mystical Fact , what Rudolf Steiner said after the turn of the cen- tury concerning the matter of Christianity shows that the Rosicrucian initiation can produce the substance of Chris- tianity, free of any tradition, and thereby confirm, and even supplement, existing Christian texts. Access to the substance of Christianity, independent of any documents, is the decisive consequence of Steiner’s experience of Christ at the turn of the century. With this event the path of following Christ, the path based on the substance of Christianity, begins to merge with the path of encountering Christ, which is based on knowledge acquired without presuppositions. Thus a union of the two paths is created, which can be called anthroposophy . For this reason, depending on the direction from which one approaches it, anthroposophy is either the working toward knowledge without any presuppositions, or it is compre- hensive knowledge of Christ.

Rudolf Steiner connects the Mysteries with the great cultural developments of the ancient civiliza- tions: India, Iran, Egypt, and Babylonia, as well as Greece. They provided the knowledge in practical as well as spiritual matters that underlay the myths, religious symbols, festival calendars, and so on, by which life was shaped and given meaning. But the ordinary people received only the results— they did not know the source directly. That was reserved for special leaders: initiate-heroes, priests, prophets, or similar persons. Steiner points to the division in ancient Greece between the popular or public religion based on the epics of “Homer, Hesiod, and learned men” who expounded them (below, p. 50), and the Mysteries (whose name derives from the term for “initiation”), which led back directly to the sources of inspiration. Steiner spoke of new forms of Mystery- teaching for our own age and the future. Nowadays, however, the Mysteries cannot have the same “exclusive” character they had in ancient times, but must keep pace with the evolution of modern humanity’s individual self-consciousness. Christian- ity, Steiner demonstrates, is connected both with the archaic Mysteries and with a transformation of the old forms whose further elaboration still lies in the future.

The new evidence has shown him right. In particular, M. L. West has argued that the Greek Mys- teries were part of a diffusion of significant ideas over the ancient Near East concerning “Eternity” ( Aion ) and the origins of the world. These form the basis for the rational development of the views of Parmenides, Empedocles and Pherecydes of Syros as well as Heraclitus and Pythagoras; see West, Early Greek Philosophy and the Orient (Oxford University Press, 1971). Steiner also later came to regard Pherecydes as a crucial figure; see The Riddles of Philosophy (Anthroposophic Press, Spring Valley, NY, 1973), pp. 16ff. For Steiner the emergence of rational thought is an evolu- tionary development—that is to say, it is not to be regarded as sweeping away the “superstition” of more primitive notions, but as rooted in human nature and potential for transformation. The Mysteries accompany this development, and integrate the new sense of independent judgment into the deeper, emotional, and less conscious aspects of human life. The false supposition that the Mysteries should be opposed to rational thought leads, for Steiner, to the tragic dividedness of so much in modern life—and also to a wrong evaluation of ancient myths, and so on, as primitive and irrational, whereas they are in fact a stage on the trajectory that includes philosophical and later scientific thought. 21.

Nevertheless, there has been in general great resistance to con- sidering Plato in the way Steiner recommends. As a result, it might be argued, there has been too much stress on Plato’s philosophical doctrines, and no understanding of the kind of thinking, the intellectual process, which he believed brought enlightenment in philosophy.

Mor- gan, Platonic Piety: Philosophy and Ritual in Fourth-Century Athens (Yale University Press, New Haven, CT, 1990) has explored the question from a much more sympathetic angle, in which he sees philosophical dialogue as a transposition into logical, rational terms of “ecstatic” Mystery-ritual.

Cf. above, ch. 1 and nl 8. 71. On the kinds of explanation developed in the ancient Mysteries, which might be allegorical, “physical” (that is, including cos- mic, natural or seasonal events), “mystic,” and so on, see W. Burkert, Ancient Mystery Cults (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1987), pp. 78ff. 72. Sallust, On the Gods and the World III, 3-4. 73. Steiner develops such a “structural” approach, for example, in relation to the Adonis Mysteries in The Easter Festival in the Evolution of the Mysteries (Anthroposophic Press, 1987), pp.6ff. Thus one might say that for Steiner, as for a modern structural interpreter of myths such as Lévi-Strauss, study must proceed “from the study of conscious content to that of uncon- scious forms”: Claude Lévi-Strauss, Structural Anthropology (Harmondsworth, 1972), p. 24. Steiner’s interpretation points at once to the origins of the myths on a psychological level in the experience of the initiates, and to their cognitive value for the culture they sustain. The actualization of their unconscious forms (structures) is not opposed to rational thought, as we might think if we merely studied the contents of mythical imag- ery, but complements and evolves alongside it. Thus Steiner was led to develop an account of the evolution of consciousness from an archaic “clairvoyant” picture-consciousness to the modern sense of personality, in which the transformation pro- cesses of the Mysteries played a continuing role; cf. Steiner, The Evolution of Consciousness (Rudolf Steiner Press, Lon- don, 1991). As individuality evolves, the unconscious creative potential within the members of a culture is unfolded in chang- ing ways. Such a “democratization” is actually inherent in the evolution of the Mysteries. 74. Plotinus, Enneads V, 8, 6. 75. Plato, Phaedrus 229 D–230 A. 76. This use of myth and parable in Plato can be paralleled in other contexts. For example, in the literature of ancient India there is a parable attributed to Buddha: There was a man who was pas- sionately attached to life, and was on no account willing to die, who found himself pursued by four serpents. He heard a voice"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Notes 219 warning him to feed and bathe the serpents from time to time, but the man ran away in fear of the serpents. Again he heard a voice, warning him that he was being chased by five murderers; again he ran away. A voice told him of a sixth murderer who was about to cut off his head with a sword; once more he took to flight. He came to a deserted village. He heard a voice telling him that thieves were about to raid the village, and again he took to flight. He came to a great river. Feeling unsafe on this side of it, he made a basket out of straw, twigs, and leaves and in it crossed to the far shore. Now he is safe—now he is a Brah- man. The parable is interpreted as follows: an individual must pass through various states on the way to the divine. The four serpents signify the four elements (fire, water, earth, and air); the five murderers are the five senses. The deserted village stands for a soul that has freed itself from the impressions of the senses, but is not yet secure within itself. If it takes hold inwardly of the lower nature alone, it will inevitably be destroyed. The man must assemble a boat that will take him from the shore of sense-perceptible nature across the river of transience to the other shore, that of eternity and the divine. (R.St.) 77. For more on the background of the mythology of Osiris, see Steiner, Egyptian Myths and Mysteries (Anthroposophic Press, Hudson, NY, 1990); also Mysteries of the East and Christianity (Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1972), which relates it to the stages of initiation-experience which are hinted at in the account of his “voluntary death” and new birth by Apuleius, The Golden Ass or, Metamorphoses XI. The latter text is trans- lated in Meyer, The Ancient Mysteries, pp. 176ff. At the cli- mactic moment he says: “I crossed the threshold of Persephone; I was caught rapt through all the elements; I saw the Sun shining at midnight with a radiant light; I stood before the upper and the lower gods, drew near and adored.” (XI, 23) 78.

If God’s own power were not at work in us, how could divine things delight us?” ( Zahme Xenien ). (R.St.) Cf. Empedocles, fragment 109. 81. The other labors may, therefore, justifiably be interpreted as corresponding to stages in the soul’s development. The con- quest of the Nemean lion and his bringing it to Mycenae shows the hero mastering the purely physical power in human nature and taming it. Then his killing of the nine-headed Hydra, con- quering it with firebrands and dipping his arrows in its gall, which made them unerring, shows him overcoming the lower, sense-derived knowledge by means of the fire of the spirit: by conquering it he gains the power of seeing lower things in the light of spiritual vision. Heracles captures the hind of Artemis, the divine huntress: he hunts down all that wild nature can offer to the human soul. The other labors may be similarly inter- preted—the aim here was only to establish the general principle that they point to a process of inner development.

There were no Mysteries of Heracles, but he was regarded as in some sense the archetypal initiate at Eleusis: Burkert, Ancient Mys- tery Cults, p. 76. 82.

Steiner was far ahead of his time in recognizing the initiatory significance of “becoming Osiris.” A fine study of the Pharaoh from an anthro- posophical point of view is furnished by F.Teichmann, Die Kultur der Empfindungsseele (Stuttgart n.d.). The Pharaoh, who “becomes Osiris” and mystically begets his successor from the other world as Horus, the living power of the Sun on Earth, is the prototype of all Egyptian initiates.

He rejected, how- ever, the Church’s rather belated claim that this John was the same as the apostle John, son of Zebedee.

The Apocalypse is important to Steiner here because it represents a new form of the ancient Mystery- teachings and esoteric cosmology, now centered on Christ. However, it is addressed to a number of different representative Communities that preserve certain historical characteristics or reveal already qualities to be developed more widely in the future. It embodies therefore the new principle that Mystery- wisdom cannot just remain a “primordial revelation,” but must be modified to meet the changing conditions of evolution in the"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Notes 225 cosmic rhythms of history. According to Steiner, the defeat of the rebel angels does not refer to a once-and-for-all event, but to the recurring need to renew Mystery-wisdom in its Christian form at the turning-points of new human potential unfolding. The Apocalypse remains our profoundest guide to this form of cultural and spiritual renewal. 124. Apocalypse 1:10–11. 125. Apocalypse 2:1–7. 126.

However, the point is not that each should be left behind in history: rather, the quality developed in each can attain a new form, relevant to evolving humanity, through find- ing a relationship to the divine through Christ—as Steiner describes in an exemplary way for the first Community.

Its principle that “the racking birth-pains come upon all that bear in the womb the seeds of the new life” seems to refer to a personal initiation-experience, but also to the strug- gles of the Community, and a turning-point at which the “man- child long foretold” will be born. 155. The structure of the Community and the principle of consent are spelled out in the Essene Community Rule —I QS V, 1-3. 156. Any dispute as to the authenticity of this work may now be regarded as settled. Philo undoubtedly describes from experi- ence a Community of pre-Christian origin. Cf. G. R. S. Mead, Fragments of a Faith Forgotten: Gnostics and Mysticism (Gor- don, Newark,1992), pp. 62ff. (R.St.) 157. Philo, On the Contemplative Life III, 24-25. 158. Philo, op.cit. III, 2 9. 159. Philo, op.cit. X, 78. 160. This structuring of Communities was the specifically Jewish contribution to the further development of the Mysteries (above, pp. 76ff). The democratization of their character led consistently to a narrowing and a broadening: a concentrating on the unique individual (in its most intense form, the uniquely initiated one, the Messiah) and looking outward to a wider, ultimately world- wide, sense of collective destiny. On the striking absence of such organization in the older Mysteries, cf. Burkert, Ancient Mystery Cults, pp. 45-46. Later, Christianity was to fuse the Mystery- idea with the Jewish inheritance of the “people of God” and extend it to universal community: and the Christ-spirit is active wherever that process is being carried forward. Steiner often referred in this context to the “Christ-Impulse” as a spiritual and evolutionary power, at work in humanity. 161. Cf. Steiner, The Gospel of St. Matthew, pp. 79-83; exactly this idea underlies the extraordinary Apocalypse of Adam , found in the Gnostic discovery at Nag Hammadi in Egypt, but having Jewish (probably Essene) connections.

Steiner here challenges the Church’s own highly influential myth about its origins, namely that there had been original agreement and “orthodoxy,” only later “degenerating” into conflicting views. Steiner is remarkably emancipated from this perspective. The diversity of early Christianity was first exten- sively argued by Walter Bauer, Orthodoxy and Heresy in Ear- liest Christianity (London, 1972)—a book still often regarded as controversial. 166. We have already mentioned the brilliant presentation of Gnos- ticism in its historical development by G. R. S. Mead, in his book, Fragments of a Faith Forgotten . (R.St.) More recent dis- coveries, notably the Nag Hammadi Library of Gnostic writ- ings, have filled in the historical picture more fully. See K. Rudolph, Gnosticism (Edinburgh, 1984). There is much to con- firm Steiner’s basic contention that Gnosticism, based on gno- sis (“divine knowledge”) was a continuation of the ancient Mystery techniques; as such it was prior to Christianity, and distinct from the new esoteric teaching that emerged there. Nevertheless, it was part of the background of ideas taken up and transformed in Christianity, from the earliest phases, for example, in the Gospel of Mark, which Steiner related to an Alexandrian and Gnostic milieu: see Steiner, The Gospel of St. Mark (Anthroposophic Press, Hudson, NY, 1986), pp. 187ff. The discovery of the “secret Mark” fragment (cf. note 118) has again strikingly confirmed his insight. Steiner discussed the basic myth of Gnosticism, concerning the divine Sophia and the pre-earthly existence of spiritual worlds (“aeons”) in his lectures Christ and the Spiritual World (London, n.d.). 167. These include Mystical Theology , On the Divine Names , and On the Celestial Hierarchies . Dionysius “the Areopagite” was the pupil of Paul in Athens (Acts 17:34) by whom these works claim to be written. Steiner described Dionysius as a teacher of esoteric Christianity in the tradition of Paul (Steiner, The Gos- pel of St. John, New York, 1962, pp. 34–5). His teachings were presumably given written form much later by his pupils. (The"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Notes 229 present texts use late philosophical language and even include a quotation from the fifth-century A . D . Neoplatonist Proclus.) 168. The theme is dealt with in Dionysius’ Ecclesiastical Hierar- chies (which echo those in heaven). He says explicitly that the incarnate Son of God is “the source and perfection of all hier- archies”—see Andrew Louth, Denys the Areopagite (More- house, Harrisburg, PA, 1989), p. 42. 169.

The last sentence is altered in the 1910 edition to: “One line of development within Christianity, as we have seen, came to the conclusion that the Mystery had to be preserved as an object of faith.” The other line of development arises out of the evolving human individuality itself. It is, says Steiner, an approach to spiritual knowledge “that can be achieved by individuals them- selves, where the Initiator merely gives indications about what ought to be done, and one then gradually learns to find one’s own way onward. No considerable progress has yet been made along this path; but little by little there will unfold in humanity a faculty making it possible for a person both to ascend into the macrocosm and to descend into the microcosm without assis- tance and to pass through these forms of initiation as a free being.” (Steiner, The Gospel of St. Matthew, p. 125.)
