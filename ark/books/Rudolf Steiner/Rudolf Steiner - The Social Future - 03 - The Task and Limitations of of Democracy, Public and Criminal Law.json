THE TASK AND THE LIMITATIONS OF DEMOCRACY. PUBLIC LAW. CRIMINAL LAW. THE acquisition of right views on social life depen ds to a large extent on a clear understanding of the relations existing between hum an beings who, in their life together, organize the social conditions and the institutions under which they live. An unprejudiced onlooker will discover that all the institutions in social life originate in the first place from measures dictated by the will of man. And he who ha s won his way to this view will come to the conclusion that the factor of decisive importan ce in social life is the conduct of human beings towards each other, the employment of their forces, their capacities and their feelings towards others in a social or unsocial man ner. People imbued with social sentiments and views will mold their institutions s o as to make them work socially. And it is true to a very great extent that the ability or ina bility of any individual to provide himself with the necessities of life out of his income will depend on the manner in which his fellow- creatures furnish him with the means of a livelihoo d, upon whether they work for him in such a way that he can support himself out of his o wn means. To put this in the most practical form: the ability of man to procure enoug h bread for his wants will depend upon the fact that society has taken the needful steps t o enable everyone who works, or who performs a service, to have a corresponding quantit y of bread in return for his work. The opportunity of really turning his work to account, of bringing it to that point at which he can earn what he needs for his existence, is again determined by the presence of social institutions in his environment, by the aid of whic h he can find his proper place. Now it really requires only a small amount of unpre judiced insight into social life in order to recognize what has just been said as an ax iom, a fundamental principle of the social question. And whoever does not recognize it will hardly acknowledge the truth of the principle, because he has no inclination to look at life with an unprejudiced mind in order to convince himself, as he might from every occurre nce in life, that it is so. It is true that this way of viewing life is particularly unpleasant for the average man. For it is a matter of great importance to him that he should be left undi sturbed. He is very willing to hear of institutions being improved and transformed into so mething better, but he regards it as an infringement of his dignity as a man if it is found necessary to tell him that he ought to change his own outlook on life and his own manner o f living. He gladly agrees that institutions should be modeled on social lines. He is not at all pleased, however, with the proposal that he should model his own conduct on th ese lines. Hence, something most remarkable has entered into the modern history of e volution. In the course of the last few centuries, as I have already shown in the first lec ture, economic life has developed far"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"beyond all the conceptions which have been formed o f it, especially in the spheres of law and of cultural life. I pointed out in the first le cture that the social criticism of Woodrow Wilson himself amounted to nothing more or less tha n the statement that the economic system has laid down the law: ‘Economic life has ma de its demands; it has been advancing, and has assumed certain distinct forms. The legal s ystem and cultural life, through which we seek to govern the economic system, have remaine d stationary at their old points of view. They have not kept pace.’ In these sentiments Woodrow Wilson has undoubtedly expressed a deeply significant fact of modern evolu tion. With the rise of the complicated conditions of tech nical industry and of the equally complicated capitalist conditions entailed by the f ormer, with the era of big industrial enterprises, economic life has simultaneously put f orward its demands. The facts of economic life have gradually eluded us. They go the ir own way more or less. We have not found the force within ourselves to govern economic life by our thoughts and ideas. Modern thought regarding the demands of economic li fe, the consideration of economic matters, as these come under direct observation, ha ve led more and more to adaptation of legal and intellectual conceptions to these immedia te facts. Thus we may say that the chief characteristic in the evolution of humanity for cen turies has been that the conceptions of law, according to which men strive to live at peace with one another, as well as those of intellectual or spiritual life, according to which they develop and form their capacities, have become to a great extent dependent on economic life . The extent to which in modern times human thought, and the attitude of human beings tow ards one another, have become dependent on economic matters passes quite unnotice d. Of course, the institutions of the last centuries have been created by human beings th emselves, but for the most part they are not based upon new thoughts and ideas; they are , rather, the outcome of unconscious impulses and unconscious instincts. In this way som ething which we may truly call an element of anarchy has arisen in the structure of t he social organism. In the first two lectures of this series, I have described from diff erent points of view this element of anarchy in the social organism. But within this soc ial edifice of modern times, those conditions have arisen which have led to the modern form of the proletarian question. To the workman, called away from his handicraft and pl aced at the machine, shut up in the factory, what was the most obvious fact as he looke d at life around him? Looking at his own life he saw chiefly that all his thoughts, all his rights with regard to other men, in fact, everything is determined by powerful economic condi tions, by those economic conditions which he must accept because he is economically wea k as against the economically strong. Thus it may be said: In the leading circles, among the governing classes, there is an unconscious denial of the fundamental principle tha t human institutions should grow out of the conscious life of men themselves. People hav e forgotten to apply this truth in social life. Gradually these leading, governing classes ha ve given themselves up instinctively to a life in which culture and law are subject to the po wer of the economic system, even though they may not believe this. This has given rise to a dogmatic conception of life among socialist thinkers and their followers. The concept ion of life which has resulted from this thought is that such conditions are inevitable in h uman evolution, that there is no possibility for the individual person to organize l egal conditions or a system of culture suitable to himself. They believe that culture and law result naturally as appendages to economic realities, to branches of production and s o on."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Thus among large numbers of people the social quest ion has adopted as its starting-point a positive demand. Their fundamental belief was that the economic system conditions the life of rights, conditions too, the cultural life of the people. Therefore the economic life must be reformed so as to bring forth a system of laws and culture corresponding to the needs and demands of the masse s. The proletariat has learnt from the life and habits of the leading classes to believe c onsciously that which the latter had carried out instinctively in their lives; it made this a do gma. Today the social question faces us in the following aspect: Among great masses of people there is a widespread conviction that, if only the economic life and institutions were rev olutionized, everything else, law and culture, would evolve of themselves; that economica lly just, good, socially organized legal and cultural institutions would result. Under the i nfluence of this opinion they have failed to recognize the real crux of the modern social pro blem . The point on which the whole social question turns has been hidden by this dogma through a great deception, a mighty illusion. The fact is that precisely these conditio ns — the dependence of law and culture on the economic life — are a historical result of evol ution. This must be overcome. While in wide socialist circles the belief is current that t he economic system must first be changed and everything else will follow of itself, the trut h is that each one must ask himself the question: What conditions within the sphere of equity and of culture must first be created in order that a new cultural and a net legal system may give birth to economic conditions which will satisfy the demands of an existence wort hy of human beings? Not the question: How can we bring law and culture more and more into dependence on the economic life? But rather: How can we escape from that dependence? That is the question to be asked before any other . This is a very important consideration; for it show s us the obstacle barring an unprejudiced understanding of the present social qu estion. It shows us that one of the chief obstacles is a dogma which has grown up in the cour se of centuries. And this dogma has become so firmly fixed that at present countless ed ucated and uneducated persons of proletarian and other classes ridicule the idea tha t the system of equity and of culture could be purified in any other way than by the reformatio n of the economic system itself. It is my task today to speak of the equity state; t he day after tomorrow I will speak of the cultural life. The equity state, due to its par ticular nature and significance, has often presented to us the question: What is really the or igin of rights? What is the origin of that feeling which prompts men to say in their dealings with one another that a thing is just or unjust? This question has always been a very, very important one. Yet it is a strange fact that many social thinkers have entirely last sight of the actual question of rights. It exists no longer for them. There are certainly many academic- theoretical treatises extant regarding the nature and meaning of law, but what is generall y characteristic in the study of social matters is that the question of equity is more or l ess neglected. In dealing with this subject, I must call your atte ntion to something which at the present time is becoming more and more evident, although a short time ago it was quite unobserved. People have become aware of the approac h of untenable social conditions Even those whose own lives have remained more or le ss untouched by the present unsocial conditions have attempted to find a solution. And t hough a comparatively short time ago people laughed at the idea of legal and cultural sp heres influencing economic affairs, today"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"we encounter more and more frequently the assertion which seems to come from the obscure depths of consciousness: It is quite true t hat in the relationships of human beings in social life, questions affecting the feelings, a nd relating to equity, must also be taken into account. Much of the confusion in social conditions has been caused by the want of consideration given to moral and psychic relationsh ips and to conditions of equity on their own ground. Thus there is now a slight indication — so obvious that it can no longer be overlooked — that an improvement in the present con ditions must come from a quarter different from that of purely economic interests. B ut this has as yet little influence on the practical discussion of the question. Like a crimson thread running through all the senti ments of the later socialist thinkers is the belief that a social structure must be built up in which human beings can live in accordance with their capacities and needs. Whether these sentiments are developed in the direction of extreme radicalism, or incline more to conservative thought, is not the point. We hear on all sides that the evils of the existing social order are due, in large measure, to the fact that within that order a man is not in a p osition to use his full capacities. On the other hand we hear that the social order must be so constituted that he can satisfy his wants within its limits. Here we are brought back to two fundamental element s of human life. Capacities belong to the human power of imagination; for since a man must act consciously, his capacities in the first instance arise out of his p ower of imagination, his thought-will. Of course, the power of imagination must be continuall y fired and filled with enthusiasm, by feeling; but feeling alone is powerless, if the fun damental imagination is absent. Therefore, the question of a man's efficiency or practical ski ll brings us in the last instance to the life of imagination. It became evident to many persons that care must be taken. to enable a man to realize in social life his power of imagination. Th e other element which has to be allowed free play has more to do with the will in man. Will power, which is connected with desire, the craving for something or other, is a fundamenta l force in the human being. When it is said that the human being must live within a social structure that can satisfy his wants, it is the will which is under consideration. Thus, unknown to themselves, even the Marxists, in advancing their social theories, consider human beings while they profess to speak o nly of institutions. They speak of institutions, but they would like to make their ins titutions such that human ideas and human faculties find scope within them, and that hu man needs can be satisfied for all alike as they arise. Now there is something very peculiar in this view. It leaves quite out of account one element of human life, and that is the life of feel ing. If we put forward a claim to build up a social edifice in which people can live in accordan ce with their capacities, their feelings, and their needs, then we are taking into considerat ion the whole man. But curiously enough, although the Marxist theory enters into det ails as to social aims, it very characteristically omits the life of feeling altoge ther. And to omit feeling in the study of human nature is to leave out all consideration of t he actual conditions of equity in the social organism. For conditions of equity can only develop in a community of human beings in accordance with the feelings which have been tra ined and refined. As people feel towards each other in their mutual intercourse, so will be the system of public law . And"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"because of the omission of this vital element of fe eling in the consideration of the social question the problem of equity was necessarily lost sight of. It is, however, essential that this matter of law should be placed in the proper l ight. Of course we know that law exists, but the desire exists also to represent it as a mer e dependent of the economic system. In what manner is law developed in a community? Att empts have often been made to give a definition of law; but a satisfactory one ha s not yet been found. Just as little has resulted from the attempt to trace the origin of la w, to discover whence it comes. A solution of this problem has been sought in vain. Why is thi s so? It resembles what would result from an effort to develop language out of human nat ure alone. It has often been said, and rightly, that a person who grew up on a desert isla nd would never learn to speak; for speech is acquired through communion with other bei ngs within the whole human family. Likewise, out of the interchange of human feelings in public life the desire for law is kindled. We cannot say that the feeling for justice suddenly awakens in some particular part of the human being, or of the human race. We m ay say that the feelings which human beings mutually develop in their intercourse with o ne another bring them into certain relationships, and as these relationships express t hemselves, laws are established. Thus we discover law as a development within, and out of, h uman society. Herewith we come right up against what has developed in modern history as the demands of democracy. We cannot understand the nature of the democratic demands unl ess we look at human evolution itself as a kind of organism. But the modern method of stu dy is very, very far removed from this manner of considering the question. No one would de ny that it is reasonable to ask: What is the cause of those forces in human nature which bri ng about the change of teeth in the child about the seventh year? It is not reasonable to look for the cause of this process in the kind of nourishment the child is fed — whether it b e beef or cabbage. In like manner we must ask: What is the cause of the development in t he human organism which is manifested at the age of puberty? We must look at t he inner nature of that which develops. Search as you may among the present-day modes of th ought, you will find none which can apply this method to the history of human evolution . None, for instance, is clear on this point, namely, that in the course of the developmen t of humanity on earth certain powers and capacities, certain attributes developed in the succeeding epochs of time out of the inner nature of the human being himself. He who lea rns to study Nature in accordance with her own laws can transfer this method of obser vation to the study of history. If this method be followed, it will be found that since the middle of the fifteenth century the longing for democracy, more or less fulfilled in th e various regions of the earth, has been growing out of the depths of human nature. This longing is expressed in the demand that in social life the human being can recognize as val id for others only what he feels to be right and best for himself . In modern times the democratic principle has beco me the sign and seal of human social endeavor and has grown out of the depths of human nature. The demand of modern humanity for this principle of dem ocracy is an elemental force. He who has an insight into these matters must treat them w ith the greatest seriousness. He must ask himself: What is the significance and what are the limitations of the democratic principle? I have just defined this principle. It c onsists in the fact that the persons forming a definite social organism adopt resolutions approv ed by every individual within the community. These resolutions, of course, can only b e binding if they are adopted by a majority. The content of such majority resolutions is democra tic only if every single individual is on an equal basis with every other si ngle individual . And these resolutions"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"can only be adopted on any matter when every single individual is in reality the equal of every other. That is, democratic resolutions can only be passed when every adult is entitled to vote because he is an adult and therefo re capable of judging . Herewith we have defined the limitations of democra cy as clearly as possible. On the basis of democracy only such things can be determin ed as are capable of determination through the fact that a person has reached the year s of discretion. All such things as are related to the development of human capacity in pub lic life are excluded from democratic measures. Everything in the nature of education and instruction, of cultural life in general, requires the devotion of the individual hu man being — in the next lecture this will be more fully dealt with — it demands, above all things, real individual under standing of the human being, special individual capacities in t he teacher, in the educator, which by no means belong to a person merely because he is an ad ult . We must either not take democracy seriously, in which case we submit to its decisions regarding human capacities, or we do take democracy seriously, and then we must exclude from it the administration of the cultural life and the economic life . Everything that I described yesterday in regard t o the economic sphere is based on the assumption that individuals actively engaged in one or another special branch are possessed of expert know ledge and efficiency. For instance, mere maturity in age, the mere capacity of judgment possessed by every adult, can never be sufficient qualification for a good farmer or a goo d industrial worker. Hence, majority resolutions must be kept out of the realm of econom ic life. And the same applies to the cultural life. Thus there arises between these two realms the actual democratic state-life in which every individual confronts every other as com petent to form a judgment, because he is of full age and all are equal as human beings; b ut in which majority resolutions can be carried only on matters dependent on the same capac ity of judgment in all adult persons. If we take the trouble to test the truth of these thin gs by the facts of life and not regard them as mere abstractions, we shall see that people dece ive themselves, because these are difficult thoughts and because they have not the co urage actually to follow up these ideas to their logical conclusion. But the unwillingness to do so and the substitution of very different things for the universal demand of democr acy have had, in the evolution of modern humanity, a very concrete significance. I wi ll exemplify these matters from the historical evolution of mankind itself rather than from abstract principles. During recent years we have witnessed the collapse of a State. We have seen it fall to pieces of itself, we might say, and this State may really serve as an object of experiment in regard to the question of rights and law. It is the old Austria-Hungary, which no longer exists. Anyone who has followed the events of recen t war-years knows that at the end the downfall of Austria was brought about by purely mil itary events. But the dissolution of the Austrian State, which followed in the second place, was the result of its inner conditions. This State collapsed and would probably have done s o even had the military events in Austria been more creditable. This may be said of t he events in Austria by one who has had the opportunity (I have spent thirty years of my li fe in that country) of following consecutively for decades the conditions there. It was in the ‘sixties’ of last century that the demand for democracy, that is, for a representative Government, arose in Austria. Now how was this representation of the people composed? The representatives of the people in the Austrian Imperial Parliament were recruited fro m four purely economic sections: 1. The great landowners; 2. The towns, market and indu strial centers; 3. Chambers of Commerce; 4. Provincial Councils. But in these last only economic interests were actually"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"represented. Therefore, according to the section to which one belonged, province, or Chamber of Commerce, one voted for the representati ves in the Austrian Imperial Parliament. Thus representatives of purely economic interests sat in that Parliament. The resolutions adopted by them were, of course, arrive d at by a majority of individual men, but these individuals represented interests which arose out of their identification with the great land-owning class, with the towns, markets and indu strial centers, with the Chambers of Commerce or the Provincial Councils. What kind of p ublic measures were adopted by the decisions of a majority? They were legal measures, the result of deliberations by nothing but economic interests in disguise; for when, for i nstance, the Chambers of Commerce were unanimous with the great landowners about anything that benefited them economically, a majority could be found to vote against the interes ts of the minority, who were, perhaps, just those most concerned in the matter. When parli aments are composed of representatives of economic interests, majorities c an always be found to pass resolutions affecting those interests and to make laws which ha ve nothing whatever to do with that feeling for justice which exists between one man an d another. Or let us call to mind that in the old German Imper ial Parliament there is a great party, calling itself the Center, representing purely cult ural interests, that is, Roman Catholic cultural interests. This party can join with any ot her in order to gain a majority, and the result is that purely cultural needs are satisfied by the enactment of public laws. It happened countless numbers of times. This peculiari ty of the modern Parliament, which passes for a democratic institution, has often been commented on; but no one has discovered how it might be altered, namely, by a cl ear separation of political interests from all that is concerned with the representation, the administration, of economic interests. The impulse for the organization of the Threefold Order must, therefore, demand in the most emphatic manner, the separation of politics, and th e groundwork of the law, from the administration of economic affairs, of the economic circuit. Within the economic circuit, as I explained yesterday, associations must be formed. Representatives of the different occupations should meet; producer and consumer shou ld come together. The purely business operations and measures which take place s hould be based upon contracts entered into by the association. In the economic wo rld everything should rest on contracts, everything should depend upon mutual service render ed. Corporations should carry on business with other corporations; expert knowledge and efficiency in particular branches should have the decisive voice. My opinion as a man ufacturer, let us say, as to the importance of my particular branch of industry in p olitical life will have no weight when the economic department is independent. I shall hav e to be productive in my own branch, to enter into contracts with the associations of ot her branches of industry and they will render me reciprocal services. If I am able to get a return of services for mine, I shall be in a position to carry on my work. An association of eff iciency will be formed by means of contract. These are the facts of the case. In the sphere of law and equity, affairs will be di fferently arranged. In that domain of life where one man meets another on equal terms, th e only thing to be considered is the making of laws which shall regulate the rights of t he public by the decisions of a majority. Of course, many will say: ‘What is really meant by public rights? It is neither more nor less than the spirit, expressed in the words and put int o the form of laws, which animates the economic conditions.’ In many respects this is true . But the idea of the Threefold Social Organism does not leave this out of consideration; in fact, it leaves no reality out of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"consideration. That which results as just and equit able from the resolutions taken on the basis of the democratic State is introduced into th e economic sphere by those who are occupied in industry. But it is not their work to i nitiate this spirit and to make laws. They receive the law and carry it into operation in the economic life. Abstract thinkers raise objections to this Threefol d Order. They say that in public life, when one man does business with another, gives a dr aft to another according to the law of exchange, the whole operation is carried on within the limits of the economic sphere. They ask: ‘Is that not a complete unity?’ and say: ‘The idea of the Threefold Order tries to break up what is already a complete unity, as if there we re not many spheres in life in which public opinion is not allowed to function lest it w ork destructively, many spheres in which forces from all sides meet and form a unity.’ Take the case of a young man. He has various hereditary qualities which cling to him. Then he ha s other qualities which he has acquired by education. His characteristics come to him from two sides, inheritance and education. Now suppose he does something at fifteen years of a ge; it cannot be said that such an action is isolated. His action is a unity composed of the result of heredity and education. There is unity in the action just because the forces come to gether from two sides. Out of the realities of life arises the idea of the Threefold Social Org anism. Real unity comes into an economic transaction only in proportion to the conceptions o f justice it may contain, through the independent administration of economic measures fro m an economic standpoint, and through the making of laws by an independent democr atic equity state. These two elements are then brought together into one whole. The two w ork as one. If, however, laws are allowed to arise out of the interests of economic l ife itself, the laws are turned into a caricature of justice. Law is then like a photograp h or an impression of economic interests. There is no equity present. Only when laws are allo wed to arise naturally, and from the very beginning on their own independent democratic basis, can they be introduced into economic life. One might think that this must be so obvious to all , that explanation were quite unnecessary. But it is a peculiarity of this age th at the most transparent truths are overshadowed by modern life, and that it is just th ose clearest facts that are most distorted. Many of the socialist views advanced at the present time make the continuation of the dependence of law on the economic life their basic principle. I alluded yesterday to the idea of founding a kind of hierarchy on political lines, according to which the economic life should be governed and administered. In this scheme it is thought that those who administer economic affairs will also, at the same time, develop the laws. This assertion proves an absolute lack of understanding of real li fe is not the economic system, in which efficiency above all things is necessary to promote production, that can bring forth suitable legal conditions; legal conditions must arise from their own source, side by side with the economic life. Laws can never the outcome merely of thought. Side by side with the economic circuit exists a political element in whic h every single individual meets another on equal terms. The essential point is not that out of f some vague primitive consciousness a business man can evolve just laws, but that the s oil itself should be first prepared, so that human beings might find themselves, through their f eelings, in circumstances which they would transform into circumstances governed by law. The essential is to create a reality side by side with the economic life. Law will then no longer be a mere superstructure above the economic life; law will then take its place in a self-molding, independent existence. Then the fundamental error of the social question, the belief that the economic life need"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"only be transformed in order to attain to new conce ptions of law, will no longer be met by a theoretic answer. Then reality will be created in t he Threefold Social Organism by the preparation of an independent basis for political l ife, reality by which, through human intercourse and human relationship, the strong impe tus towards a system of law and equity arises, capable of keeping the economic life within its proper limits. Finally, a consideration of our age from the histor ical point of view reveals from another side in what manner all that I have said above can be proved. Look back to the period before the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and think of the incentive given to the men of that period in their handicraft and in all other work. Modern socialist thinkers often emphasize the fact that the worker is separated fro m his means of production. That this is so to such a high degree at present is caused by mo dern economic conditions. Most of all he is separated from his products. What part has the f actory worker in all that the manufacturer sells? What does he know about it? Oft en not even to what part of the world it goes. His work is a small part of a great comple x, which perhaps he never sees as a whole. Think of the tremendous difference between present conditions and the old handicraft, when each man worked at his own product and took pl easure in his work! Anyone who has studied history can testify to this. Think of the p ersonal relation between a workman and his handiwork, such as a door-key, a lock, and so f orth. In primitive regions of the country we can still find this feeling of a man towards his work. Where the customs are less simple, this is no longer possible. Forgive me if I mention a personal experience, it is very characteristic of what I mean. I once entered a bar ber's shop in an out-of-the-way place and was truly happy to see the real pleasure taken by t he barber's assistant in cutting a customer's hair nicely. His work was a real pleasur e to him. There is, of course, always less and less of this personal tie between the worker an d his work. Its absence is a condition of modern economic life, and it cannot be otherwise in the complicated circumstances arising out of the distribution of labor. If we had not the division of labor, however, neither should we have our modern life with all that is necessary to us. There would be no progress. The old connection between the workman and his work is no longer possible. But man needs a relationship to his work; it is necessary that he s hould feel joy in his work, that he should feel a certain devotion to it. The old devotion, th e immediate companionship with the thing he has made, exists no longer; yet it must be repla ced by something else. What can this be? It can only be replaced by enlarging men's horizon, by raising them to a level on which they can come together with their fellow-men in one grea t circle, eventually with all their fellow-men within the same social organism as thems elves, in which they can develop an interest in man as man. It must come to pass that e ven the man who is working in the most remote corner at a single screw for some great mach ine need not put his whole self into the contemplation of the screw, but it must come about that he can carry into his workshop the feelings which he entertains for his fellow-men, th at when he leaves his workshop he finds the same feelings, that he has a living insight int o his connection with human society, that he can work even without actual pleasure in his pro duction, because he feels he is a worthy member in the circle of his fellow-men. Out of this impulse has sprung the modern demand for democracy and the new way of establishing publi c law on democratic lines. These things are related by their inner nature to the evolution of man. Only he who has the will to look deeply into the realities of human evolution in its progress in social life can really understand such things. The feeling must arise with in us that the horizon of human beings must be enlarged, that men ought to be able to expr ess their feelings with regard to their"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"work in words somewhat like these: ‘It is true, I h ave no idea how my work in making this screw will affect my fellow-men; but I do know that , through the living ties which bind me to them by a common law, I am a worthy member in th e social order, and have equal rights with other men.’ This is the principle which must lie at the root of modern democracy, and it must work in the feelings of one man towards another as the f undamental principle of the modern public legal code. Only by understanding the inner nature of the human being can we arrive at really modern conceptions of that common law which must now be developed everywhere. Details will be given on this head in t he fifth lecture. In conclusion, I will now show how the sphere of justice passes over from the actual department of equity into that of cultural life. We can see how laws arise on the basis of the democ ratic state by the refining of feelings among individuals with equal rights; while in the e conomic sphere of life, contracts are entered into between societies or between individua ls. From the moment in which the individual finds himself in a position to seek just ice under either civil or penal law, or in a private, or in any other manner, in that moment the decision passes from the purely legal to the cultural domain. Here is another point, simi lar to that discussed yesterday in dealing with taxation, which will present difficulties. It will take long for modern thinkers to accustom themselves to ideas which would demonstrat e their self-evidence, if only their underlying conditions were examined. Now when a case arises in which it has to he decide d how an existing law can be applied to a particular person, we have to do with the exer cise of an individual judgment. It must be determined whether the elected judge is really q ualified by his mental and spiritual capacities to understand the person in question. Ad ministration of punishment, civil justice, cannot rest on the general basis of law. I t must be removed to another sphere, the special characteristics of which I will explain in my next lecture on the cultural life. Justice can only he administered when the judge is really a ble, by virtue of his own capacities, and out of the relationship between himself and the per son whom he is trying, to give a verdict out of his own independent capacity of judging. One might perhaps think that this objective could be gained in various ways. In my book, The Threefold Commonwealth , I have pointed out one way in which it might be attained. In the Threefold Social Organism there is (a) the independent economic organization descri bed yesterday; (b) the democratic political foundation which I have sketched today, a nd which I will develop more fully in my fifth lecture in regard to its interplay with the o ther members of the organism. But there is also (c) the independent cultural life which contro ls, above all things, teaching and education as I pointed out yesterday and which I wi ll amplify in my next lecture. Those who control the cultural sphere will be called upon at the same time to appoint the judges; and every human being will be entitled and able to elect from time to time his own judge, should he find himself accused of an offence agains t civil or penal law. Thus the accused will be able, out of actual specific conditions, to appoint his own judge, and the judge, who will be no bureaucratic lawyer, but a man chosen ou t of the cultural sphere, through the circumstances in which he is placed in the social e nvironment will be able out of his environment to determine what judgment he must form of the man whom he is to try. It will be important that no judge shall be nominated for political reasons . The reasons for his nomination will be like those which determine t he nomination of the best teacher to a"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"particular post. Becoming a judge will be something like becoming a teacher or an educator. Of course, in this way the judicial findi ng will differ from that laid down by the law which arises from a democratic foundation. By t he example of penal law already cited, we see how the personal disposition of the individu al human being is outside the sphere of democracy and can only be judged in an individual w ay. The framing of laws is eminently a social matter. The moment we apply to a judge it is probably because we are concerned, either in a super-social or an anti-social matter, in. a matter which has fallen out of the social life. All individual interests are of this n ature. Such cases fall under the administrative branches of the cultural body. The d ecisions of justice grow beyond and above the limits of democracy . (See: Appendix VI ) So we see that what we have to do is to establish i n reality conditions under which a genuine system of law can exist among men. Justice will then be no mere superstructure of the economic body; but equity will control economic life. We shall never succeed in doing what is necessary in this domain of life by a merel y theoretical examination of the circumstances. It can be done in no other way than by a practical observation of life. This will give us the knowledge that a true system of ju stice with the necessary impetus can only arise on an independent foundation of law. This fou ndation has disappeared beneath the inundating flood of economic life. Politics and law have become dependent on the economic life, but they must regain their independe nce, just as cultural life must also be emancipated from the economic system. In order to s ee clearly in the social question, the great error must be overcome — the great error: tha t we need only revolutionize economic conditions and then everything will follow automati cally. That error has arisen in consequence of the all-powerful modern development of economic life alone. It is as if people were under the influence of an idea, as if t hey were under the suggestion that the economic life is the only power. As long as this su ggestion holds sway they will never find the solution of the social problem. They will give themselves up to illusions, especially in proletarian circles. They will try to extract from the economic system what they call a just distribution of property. But this will only be eff ected when there are men in the social organism possessing the ability to promote institut ions through which the economic needs can be satisfied. That can only happen when it is understood that the revolutionizing of the economic system is not the only thing necessary to satisfy the requirements of social life . People must first answer the question: Must not s omething else be there alongside the economic body in order that the economic life may b e built up continuously in a social manner by men who have grown social in political an d in cultural life? This is the truth which we must oppose to error and dogma; and those who look to the economic life for the means of restoring health to the social organism mu st look instead to the spirit and to justice . There must be no vague dreams of justice growing out of the economic system; we must cultivate right thought in accordance with rea lities, and we must do so because justice and the consciousness of justice have retreated in later times before the advancing economic flood. For a social construction of societ y, we need the creation of a genuine political organism with the social impetus necessar y for it."}]
