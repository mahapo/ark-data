[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Younger Generation Younger Generation: Lecture I I FIRST of all I want to say a few words of greeting to express the feelings which your gathering have aroused in me. Your speaker describe d in a pleasing way the impulses that have brought you together here. Much of what I shal l have to say in the coming days will inevitably be a kind of interpretation of what is p resent within you, more or less strongly as inner experiences which you wish to be brought to c larity of soul. I say clarity of soul rather than merely of an intellectual nature. You have been brought together by that which lives in the depths of your souls. These depths are taken hold of by forces which, in the sp ecific way in which they are working at the present time, are of recent date. These forces — in the way they are working in you — are scarcely older than this century. They are forc es which even today reveal themselves very clearly to him who can see them, but in the ne ar future they will become ever more apparent. In the next few days we shall describe th ese forces in their most intimate nature, as well as the opposite tendencies which preceded a nd had become “out of date” by the last third of the nineteenth century. But today, I shall speak about these forces in their more external aspect. I think, my dear friends, that you feel you can no longer find yourselves in accord with what an older generation has to say to the world to day. You see, as early as the seventies, eighties and nineties of the last century, people w ere stressing, both in art and in philosophy, the deep gulf between the older and you nger generations. But all that was said then by poets and others about this gulf, this abys s, is pale in comparison with what has to be considered today. Today the younger and the olde r generation speak entirely different languages of the soul. This is so to a far greater extent than is realized. It attaches no blame to an older generation as regards the younger. To s peak of blame would be to use a form of thought belonging to the older generation — one of their philistine forms of thought. We shall not speak of blame, neither shall we accuse. But we shall consider how fundamentally souls belonging to evolution in the West have chang ed since the last two to three decades. In our present time, many things clash. A little while ago I gave a series of lectures in E ngland, at Oxford. As a university town, Oxford occupies a unique position in the cultural l ife of the West. One feels that in Oxford — a town very closely connected with spiritual evol ution in the West — a relic of the Middle Ages is surviving on into the present time. It is b y no means an unpleasing relic, quite the contrary, and in many respects worthy of admiration . We were taken round by a friend who is a graduate of Oxford University, and it is the c ustom there, when in their capacity as graduates, always to wear cap and gown. After we ha d gone round with him, I met him again in the street. The next morning I could not h elp describing to the English audience the impression I had when this friend appeared in c ap and gown. It seemed to me thoroughly symptomatic. This, together with other e xperiences, induced me to form a picture and to say why a new social structure, reac hing to the depths of modern spiritual"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"life, is necessary. When this friend met me in the street, I said to myself that if I had to write a letter now, under the immediate impression of this meeting, I should not know what date to put on the letter. I should have been tempted to date it about the twelfth or thirteenth century, in order to adhere to the style where such a thing was possible. Something that is not of the present has been prese rved there. We find nothing like it in Middle Europe. But what we find in Middle Europe, i n influential centers of culture, is nevertheless an evolutionary product of what I have just described. Here, in Middle Europe, the gown has practically be en discarded, except on festive occasions, when Directors and other officials are e xpected to wear it, often to their great annoyance. Our friend, who was also a barrister, said to me: “ If I were taking you round the Law Courts in London, I should, as a barrister, have to put on a wig, not a cap.” There you see a survival of something that has become out of date, and yet was still alive in the last century. So there we have the Middle Ages in the present. In Middle Europe people have, after all, outgrown a custom which belonged to the former gene ration and had become old. First they discarded the costume; then, with a sudden jum p, they adopted a kind of thinking, rather different in character, which headed straigh t into materialism. These contrasts between Western and Middle Europe are extraordinari ly great. And now there is a very symptomatic phenomenon which I prefer to describe t hrough facts rather than by abstract words. In Middle Europe we have forgotten Goethe and accep ted Darwin, although Goethe grasped at its roots the knowledge which Darwin onl y indicates superficially. Many similar things might be quoted. Perhaps you will say that G oethe has not been forgotten, for there exists a Goethe Society, for example. I don't belie ve you will say it, so I will not pursue it further. Goethe himself and what he brought to ligh t — the Middle European spiritual impulse — were, in fact, forgotten in the second ha lf of the nineteenth century. But these things are mere symptoms. The point is, that along the path taken by Middle Europe and its cultural life, the leading centers of culture emanc ipated themselves in the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries from the spirit which still remained in the West. Since that time, Middle Europe lost the spiritual, lost t he element that storms and pulsates through the soul, from consciousness. That is why i t was possible, too, for Goethe to be forgotten. In the West this element has been preserved in trad itions and in external life. In Middle Europe, especially in the German-speaking regions, it has been pushed down, as it were, into the depths of the life of soul, and consciousn ess has not been filled with it. This was particularly marked in the last third of the ninete enth century. Close historical study will reveal something strang e in the last third of the nineteenth century. If we study the literature and the writing s which were read by those who played a part in shaping the cultural life, we find during t he last third of the nineteenth century, up to the middle of the eighties and nineties, in Germ an-speaking districts, quite a different style in the journals and even in the newspapers fr om the style that is current today. Thoughts were finely chiseled and elaborated; impor tance was attached to sequence in the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"thoughts, and to beauty as well. In comparison with the style current in the last third of the nineteenth century, our modern style is raw and cru de. We need only pick up writings — no matter what they may be — of men in the sixties and seventies, not deeply learned or scholarly but possessing an average degree of cultu re, and we shall find this great difference. The forms of the thoughts have changed. But what is raw and crude today has proceeded from what, even in scholarly literature d uring the last third of the nineteenth century, was finely chiseled and full of spirituali ty. But those who lived through it, who, without necessarily growing old, have reached more advanced years in the present-day world of thought — we notice what has insinuated it self in a dreadful way into every domain of thought and spiritual life: symbolically, I will call it the “empty phrase,” the “cliché.” With the vogue of the “cliché” there began to devel op lack of thought, lack of sound sentiments, lack of will, which are now on the upgr ade. These characteristics were the immediate outcome of the “empty phrase,” the “clich é.” The outstanding development of the “empty phrase” took place in the last third of the nineteenth century. You can follow this externally, my dear friends. Things that crop up in a certain epoch need not necessarily appeal to you. And although in one form or another they may definitely not appeal, you can still study them from the point of view of their si gnificance for the whole of mankind. Think of the rich tones of inner beauty which are t o be found in the German romantic poets in the first third of the nineteenth century. Think of the words of a man like Jacob Grimm when he touches on things spiritual, how thes e words seem to be full of the fresh, health-giving air of the woods, and you will say: “ In those days the ‘cliché’ did not yet dominate Middle Europe.” It did not make its way in to Middle Europe until the last third of the nineteenth century. Those who are sensitive to such matters are aware of the gradual entrance of what inevitably accompanies the “empty phrase.” When the empty phrase begins to dominate, truth, as experienced inwardly by the soul, dies away. And something else goes hand in hand with the empty phrase: in so cial life man cannot really find his fellow-men any longer. My dear friends, when words sound forth without sou l from the mouth — as they do in the empty phrase, the cliché — then we pass by othe r human beings and cannot understand them. This too reached its culmination in the last third of the nineteenth century, not in the soul's depths but in the field of consciousness. Me n became more and more alienated from one another. The louder the call for social reforms , the more is it a symptom of the fact that men have become unsocial. Because they no longer ha ve any feeling for what is truly social, they cry out for social reform. A hungry animal doe s not howl for food because it has food in its stomach, but because it has none. Similarly, the soul that cries out for social life, cries, not because it is permeated with social feeling, bu t because this feeling is lacking. And so man was gradually turned into a being whose nature is not understood today, and yet it is clear enough that everywhere in the relations betwe en man and man no need is felt to grow near, in soul, to other human beings. Everyone pass es the other by. The individual's greatest interest is only in himself. What then has come into the twentieth century from the last third of the nineteenth as the customary social feeling between man and man? N owadays you continually hear: “That is my standpoint.” This is how people talk: “That i s my standpoint.” Everyone has a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"standpoint. — as if the standpoint matters! The sta ndpoint in spiritual life is just as fleeting as it is in the physical. Yesterday I stood in Dorn ach, today I am standing here. These are two different standpoints in physical life. What ma tters is that a man should have a sound will and a sound heart so that he can look at the w orld from every standpoint. But people today do not want what they can glean from differen t standpoints; the egoistic assertion of their own particular standpoint is more important t o them. But thus a man shuts himself off in the most rigorous way from his fellow-men. I f somebody says something, the other person does not really enter into it, for he has hi s own standpoint. But people do not get any nearer to each other by such means. We can only come nearer to each other when we know how to place our different standpoints in a wo rld that is common to us all. But this world is simply not there today. Only in the spirit is there a world that is common to all — and the spirit is lacking. That is the second point . And the third is this. In the course of the ninetee nth century the humanity of Middle Europe has really become very weak-willed — weak-wi lled in the sense that thought no longer unfolds the power to steel the will in such a way as to make man, who is a thought- being, capable of shaping the world out of his thou ghts. And now, my dear friends, when it is said that thou ghts have become “pale” this must not be twisted into the assertion that no thoughts are needed in order to live as men. Thoughts, however, must not be so feeble that they stick up there in the head. They must be so strong that they stream down through the heart a nd through the whole being of man, right down to the feet. For really it is better if, besides red and white blood corpuscles, thoughts, too, pulse through our blood. It is a goo d thing, certainly, when a man has a heart too, and not merely thoughts. Best of all is for th oughts to have a heart. And that has been lost altogether. We cannot cast off the thoughts th at have followed in the wake of the last four or five centuries. But these thoughts must get a heart as well! And now I will tell you, from an external point of view, what is living in your souls. You have grown up and have come to know the older gener ation. This older generation expressed itself in words; you could only hear clic hés. An unsocial element presented itself to you in this older generation. Men passed each ot her by. And in this older generation there also presented itself the impotence of though t to pulse through the will and the heart. You see, people could live with the “cliché,” with antisocial conventionality, with mere routine instead of warm community of life, so long as the heritage from earlier generations was still there. But this heritage was exhausted by the close of the nineteenth century. And so what presented itself could not speak to your ow n souls. And now, precisely in Middle Europe, you felt that in the depths below there is something that stands in the direst need of rediscovering what once lived beyond the empty p hrase, beyond convention, beyond routine. You wanted again to have a living experien ce of truth, a living experience of human community, of stout-heartedness in cultural l ife. Where is it then? — so asks a voice within you. And often, at the dawn of the twentieth century — e ven if not clearly expressed, it could be seen — on the one side there were the young, and on the other, the old. The old man said: “That is my standpoint.” Ah! as the nineteent h century drew to its close, everyone began to have his own particular standpoint. One wa s a materialist, the second an idealist,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the third a realist, the fourth a sensualist, and s o on. They all had their standpoints. But gradually under the domination of empty phrase, con vention, and routine, the standpoint had become a crust of ice. The spiritual Ice-Age ha d dawned. The ice-crust was thin, but as men's “standpoints” had lost the sense of their own weight, they did not break through it. Besides, being cold in heart they did not thaw the ice. The younger people stood side by side with the old, the young with their warm hearts not articulate yet, but warm. This warmth broke through the ice-crust. The younger man did not feel: “That is my standpoint,” but he felt: “I am losing the ground f rom under my feet. The warmth of my heart is breaking this ice that has congealed out o f empty phrase, convention, and routine.” Although not clearly expressed — for today nothing is clearly expressed — this state of thing[s] had existed for a long time and still exis ts at the present day. It is hardest of all for those who with a scholarly education try to fit in with the times. They are confronted by thoughts that are void of he art-quality and are quite consciously striven for just because of this. Now in speaking o ut of the spirit it is often necessary to shape words differently from what is customary when telling people something highly logical, philosophical or scientific. This approach is quite out of place in face of the spiritual, and altogether out of place in face of t he spiritual is the following, which we will take as an example. People say today: He is not a true scientist who do es not interpret observation and experiment quite logically; who does not pass from thought to thought in strict conformity with the correct methods that have been evolved. If he does not do this he is no genuine thinker. But, my dear friends, what if reality happ ens to be an artist and scorns our elaborate dialectical and experimental methods? Wha t if Nature herself works according to artistic impulses? If it were so, human science, ac cording to Nature, would have to become an artist, for otherwise there would be no possibil ity of understanding Nature. That, however, is certainly not the standpoint of the mod ern scientist. His standpoint is: Nature may be an artist or a dreamer; it makes no differen ce to us, for we decree how we propose to cultivate science. What does it matter to us if Nature is an artist? It matters not at all, for that is not our standpoint At the outset I can only describe a few impressions to illustrate what was working together in chaotic interplay with the approach of the twentieth century — the century that has placed you before such hard trials of the soul. We have had to face outer events, including the grim and terrible world-war; these ar e only the outward expression of what is reigning in the innermost soul of the modern civili zed world. It is simply so, and we must be conscious of it. Primarily we have to seek for s omething which the deepest soul of Germany is yearning for — as your speaker truly sai d — but which precisely within Germany was denied by men's consciousness the neare r the modern age approached. We lost not only Goethe but also a great deal of what was there in the Middle Ages and out of which Goethe grew, and we must find it again. And i f it is asked today quite from the external aspect: Why have you come here today? — I shall answer: In order to find this. For you are really seeking for something that is there. Goethe answered the question: Which secret is of the highest value? — The revealed secr et. (From the Fairy Tale of the Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily.) But it has to be rev ealed through eyes being opened to perceive it. What concerns you are mainly longings of the inner life — if you understand yourselves aright. Whether one has to become a teac her or adopt some other profession —"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"that is not the point. Everything which those who w ant again to become whole men are seeking today shall be found out of the common cent er of true manhood. That is why we find ourselves together here. After all, it is quite a different matter if in ear lier centuries — to take a radical example — people burnt a Giordano Bruno. In those times thi s was the customary way of refuting truths. But now — to compare this with the followin g symptom drawn from the realm of science — when the Swabian doctor Julius Robert Mai er was making a voyage round the world, the peculiar constitution of the blood in So uthern Asia brought him to the conception of what is known as the heat equivalent, the conservation of energy. In 1844 he wrote a treatise on this subject which was rejected as amateurish and unsuitable by the most famous scientific periodical of the time, the Poggendorf Annals. Julius Robert Maier was so enthusiastic about his discovery that whenev er anyone met him in the street he began at once to talk about it, until finally conte mporary experts decided that as he was always talking about the same thing, he was sufferi ng from fixed ideas. As you know, he was declared insane and put into an asylum. Today y ou can go to Heilbronn and see the Robert Maier Memorial. It is said that the law of t he conservation of energy is the most important law of physics that has been discovered i n the modern age. Well, of course, such things happen! Mankind may, naturally, lapse into e rror, but the point I want to make is that this can be judged out of mere phrases, mere c onvention, mere routine. Think of the way such a terrible tragedy, such a te rrible mockery, was described in the nineteenth century, and compare it with the account given today of the same case. What has actually happened cannot be undone by abstract writings. Anyone who has a heart within him and reads the descriptions that are give n of such a case, feels as if robbed of all inner support and a terrible turmoil is set going i n his soul. Human beings must again be capable of feeling, not weakly, but strongly: beaut iful — ugly, good — evil, true — false. They must be capable of feeling things not weakly b ut strongly, so that they live in them with their whole being, that their very heart's blo od flows into their words. Then the empty phrase will dissipate and they will feel not only t hemselves but other men within their own being; convention will dissipate, and the heart's b lood will pulse through what they have in their heads; then sheer routine will dissipate and life will become human once again. Young people in the twentieth century feel these th ings; they have been seeking but found only chaos. These things cannot be portrayed by writing up external history. At the end of the nineteenth century there was a crucial p oint in the inner development of mankind. Souls who were born shortly before or shor tly after the turn of the century are of quite a different inner make-up from those who were born even during the last third of the nineteenth century. One can speak about this if, in spite of the years piling up, one has not allowed oneself to get old. So we shall see tomorrow, my dear friends, how the new generation has not linked up with the old but is divided from it by an abyss. It is not a question of finding fault but only of trying to understand. I am not finding fault whe n I speak of the tragedy which befell Julius Robert Maier. The same kind of thing happene d to many people. It is not a matter of finding fault, but of the need for understanding. F or the most important thing is to understand what is experienced deeply and inwardly; an unclear seeking cannot be allowed to continue. A light must come that will fl ood this unclear seeking without making"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"it dry or cold. We must find this light, while pres erving the heart's blood. I do not wish to impose upon you anything that savo rs of the mystical, but to point to the truth, the truth in the spirit. You know that a mong the many clichés which became current in the nineteenth century, it was said that the great pioneer of the nineteenth century closed his life by calling out to posterity : “More light!” As a matter of fact Goethe did not say “More light!” He lay on his couch breat hing with difficulty and said: “Open the shutters!” That is the truth. The other is the clic hé that has connected itself with it. The words Goethe really spoke are perhaps far more apt than the mere phrase “More light”. The state of things at the end of the nineteenth ce ntury does indeed arouse the feeling that our predecessors have closed the shutters. Then cam e the younger generation; they felt cramped; they felt that the shutters which the olde r generation had closed so tightly must be opened. Yes, my dear friends, I assure you that although I am old, I shall tell you more of how we can now attempt to open the shutters agai n."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Younger Generation Younger Generation: Lecture II II I N SPEAKING of a movement among the youth, a clear d istinction can be made between the youth movement in the wider sense and those you ng people who are particularly concerned with schools, with the sphere of educatio n in general. I do not wish to accentuate either the one or the other, but our aim will be most readily attained if we consider the main difficulties of the inner life am ong the youth at Universities and Colleges. We shall often have to start from details and then quickly soar to a wider outlook. Allow me to say a few words about the inner experiences u ndergone by young people at Universities. As a matter of fact, this situation h as been preparing for many decades, but recently it has reached a climax making it more cle arly perceptible. Young people at the Universities are seeking for so mething. This is not surprising, for their purpose in going to college is to seek for so mething. They have been looking in those who taught them, for real leaders, for those who we re both teachers and leaders or — as would be equally correct — teachers endowed with le adership, and they did not find them. And this was the really terrible thing clothed in a ll kinds of different words — one man speaking conservatively, the other radically, one s aying something very wise and another something very stupid. What was said amounted to th is: We can no longer find any teachers. What, then, did youth find when they came to the Un iversities? Well, they met men in whom they did not find what they were looking for. These men prided themselves on not being teachers any longer, but investigators, resea rchers. The Universities established themselves as institutes for research. They were no longer there for human beings, but only for science. And science led an existence among men which it defined as “objective.” It drummed into people, in every possible key, that it was to be respected as “objective” science. It is sometimes necessary to express such things pictorially. And so this objective science was now going about among human beings but it most certainly was not a human being! Something non-human was going about among me n, calling itself “Objective Science.” This could be perceived in detail, over and over ag ain. How often is it not said: This or that has been discovered; it already belongs to sci ence. And then other things are added to science and these so-called treasures of science be come an accumulation, something which has acquired, step by step, this dreadful objective existence among mankind. But human beings do not really fit in with this objective cre ature who is strutting around in their midst, for true and genuine manhood has no kinship with th is cold, objective, bolstered-up creature. True, as time has gone on, libraries and research institutes have been established. But the young, especially, are not looking for libr aries or research institutes. They are looking in libraries for — it is almost beyond one to say the word — they are looking for human beings — and they find, well, they find libra rians! They are looking in the scientific"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"institutes for men filled with enthusiasm for wisdo m, for real knowledge, and they find, well, those who are usually to be found in laborato ries, scientific institutes, hospitals and the like. The old have accustomed themselves to bei ng so easy-going and phlegmatic that they really do not want to be there at all in perso n — only their institutes and libraries must be there. But the human being cannot bring this abo ut. Even if he tries not to be there, he is there nevertheless, working not through the reality that lives in him as a human being, but through a leaden heaviness in him. One could express this in other ways too: Human bei ngs strive toward Nature. But — to take a significant point — you cannot help saying: Nature is round the young child too, for example. But in its life of soul-and-spirit the lit tle child derives nothing from Nature. The little child has to get something from Nature by co ming into relation with human beings with whom it can experience Nature in common. In a certain respect this holds good right up to very late years of youth. We must come togeth er with human beings with whom we can experience Nature in common. This was not possi ble during the last decades because there was no language in which people, both young a nd old, could come to an understanding with one another about Nature. When t he old speak of Nature it is as though they were darkening her, as though the names they g ive to the plants no longer fit them. Nothing fits! On the one side there is the riddle “ plant” and we hear the names from the old, but they do not tally because the human realit y is expelled; “objective” science is wandering about on the earth. This state of things came gradually but it reached a climax during recent decades. In the nineteenth century it showed itself through a particular phenomenon in a significant way. When anyone with a little imaginat ion cast an eye over the higher forms of culture in recent centuries, he made acquaintance a t every turn with this objective creature “Science,” which came upon the scene in many differ ent guises but claimed always to be the one and only genuine, objective science. And ha ving made its acquaintance, having this objective science continually introduced to one, on e perceived that another being had stolen away bashfully, because she felt that she wa s no longer tolerated. And if one were spurred on to speak with this being, secretly in th e corner, she said: “I have a name which may not be uttered in the presence of objective sci ence. I am called Philosophy, Sophia — Wisdom. But having the ignominious prefix ‘love’ I have attached to me something that through its very name is connected with human inwar dness, with love. I no longer dare to show myself. I have to go about bashfully. Objectiv e science prides itself on having nothing of the ‘philo’ in its makeup. It has also lost, as a token, the real Sophia. But I go about nevertheless, for I still bear something of the sub lime within me, connected with feeling and with a genuinely human quality.” This is a picture that often came before the soul, and it expressed an undefined feeling in countless young people during the last twenty or thirty years. People have been trying to find forms of expression — for as there are forms of expression for the life of thought, so too for the life of feeling — they have always been trying to find expressions for what they were seeki ng. Possibly the most zealous, who felt the greatest warmth of youth, broke out into the va guest expressions because all they really knew was: We are seeking for something. But when th ey came to express what it was that they were seeking, it was nothing, a Nothingness. I n reality, the Nothingness was, as in the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"words of Faust, the “All,” but it presented itself as a Nothingness. It was a question of crossing an abyss. Such was the feeling, and it sti ll is the feeling today. It can only be understood as part of history, but history in a new , not old sense. And now I want to speak of something quite differen t, but gradually things will link themselves together. Human beings who lived at the beginning of our era were able to feel quite differently from the human being of today. Th is was so because in the life of feeling and human perception there still lived a great deal of what was old. Human beings had a heritage in their souls. Heritage was not there onl y at the beginning of our era; it continued far into the Middle Ages. But nowadays souls are pl aced into the world without it. The fact that souls come into the world without this heritag e is very noticeable in the new century. That is one aspect. The other — well, my dear frien ds, suppose you were to ask anybody who lived at the beginning of our era if they spoke much about “education”. The farther back we go, the less we find that education is spok en about. Education, of course, may be spoken about in different ways, for instance: Throu gh education the young should gradually be brought up to be what they want to be when they are old. For after all we must grow old in earthly life — however young we may sti ll be. In olden times human beings were young and grew old in a more natural way. Today people cannot be old and young in a way that is tru e to nature. People do not know any longer what it means to be young and what it means to be old. Nothing is known about it and that is why there is such endless talk about ed ucation, because there is a longing to know how to teach young people to be young in order that they may grow old respectably. But nobody knows how to direct things so that human beings should be truly young and how, in youth, they can decently assimilate what wi ll enable them to become old in a worthy manner. Centuries ago all this was quite a matter of course . Today a great deal is said about education. Mostly we do not realize the absurdity o f what is said on this subject. Nowadays almost everyone is talking about education. And why ? Usually he has but the vaguest realization of having been badly educated and yet d ifficulties in life are attributed to this cause. People talk about it because they find that they are uneducated. This they admit. But they do not experience anything real in this domain . Nonetheless conclusions are formed. The usual cry is: “We should have this program in e ducation” — merely because people feel so insecure in themselves. One could also show that a strong will is present on all sides, but without any real content. And that is exactly what the young are feeling, that there is no content in this will. Why is there no content? Beca use only lately something genuinely new has arisen in earth-evolution. The following can only be indicated in broad outlin e, but if you care to look at my book, Occult Science, it will be brought home to you. The re you will find that the earth is shown as a heritage of other world-existences. The names are immaterial. I have called them the Saturn, Sun and Moon existences. But the first eart h-epoch was only the repetition of earlier world-existences. On the earth there have b een three periods of repetition: a Saturn, a Sun, and a Moon period. Then came the earth perio d proper. But this earth period proper, this Atlantean epoch, was again only a repe tition at a higher level of earlier conditions."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"And then came the post-Atlantean epoch — a still hi gher stage. But this again was a repetition. The post-Atlantean epoch was a repetiti on of a repetition. Until the fifteenth century A.D. mankind actually lived on nothing but repetitions, on nothing but a heritage. Up to the fifteenth century the human being, in his soul, was by no means an unwritten page. Before then, many things rose up of themselve s in the soul. But from the fifteenth century onwards souls were really unwritten pages. Now the earth was new — new for the first time. Since the fifteenth century the earth h as been new. Before then human beings lived on the earth with much they inherited. As a r ule no heed is paid to the fact that since the fifteenth century the earth has become new for the first time. Before then human beings were fed on the past. Since the fifteenth ce ntury they have been standing face to face with Nothingness. The soul is an unwritten page. An d how have human beings been living since the fifteenth century? Since then, the son ha s inherited from the father rough tradition what had once been inherited in a differe nt way, so that from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century tradition was still always there . But as you can see, tradition has fared worse and worse. Think for example of the Sphere of Rights. It would never have occurred to a man like Scotus Erigena to speak of Rights as modern people speak, because at that time there was still something in the souls which led human beings to speak as man to man. This is no longer so, because there is nothing in the soul tha t leads to the human reality; man has found nothing yet that leads out of the Nothingness . At one time the father could at least speak to the son. But at the end of the eighteenth century things had gone so far that the father had really nothing to say to his son any mor e. Then people began to seek, convulsively to begin with, for the so-called “Righ ts of Reason.” Ideas and feelings on the subject of Rights were supposed to be pressed out o f reason. Then Savigny and others discovered that nothing more could be pressed out o f reason. People began to establish Rights according to history, where it was a questio n of studying earlier conditions and cramming themselves with the feelings of men long s ince dead, because there was nothing left in themselves. Rights of reason were a convuls ive clinging to what had already been lost. Rights according to history were a confession that nothing more was to be got out of the men of the day. Such was the situation at the o nset of the nineteenth century: The feeling grew keener and keener that mankind was fac ing a Nothingness and that something must be got out of the human being himself. In ancient Greece nobody would have known how to sp eak about objective science. How did man express his relation to the world? By r eference to spiritual vision he spoke of Melpomene, of Urania, and so on; of the “Liberal Ar ts”. These Liberal Arts were not beings who went about on the earth, but for all that they were real. Even in the age of philosophy, the Greek's experience of his connection with the s piritual world was concrete. The Muses were genuinely loved; they were real beings with wh om man was related and had intercourse. Homer's words: “Sing, O Muse, of the w rath of Peleus' son, Achilles” were not the mere phraseology they are thought to be by mode rn scholars. Homer felt himself a kind of chalice and the Muse spoke out of him as a highe r manhood enfilled him. Klopstock was unwilling to speak in the phrases whi ch were already prevalent in the world into which he was born; he said: “Sing, immor tal Soul, of sinful man's redemption.” But this “immortal soul” too has disappeared little by little. It was a slow and gradual"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"process. In the first centuries of Christendom we f ind that the once concrete Muses had become dreadfully withered ladies! Grammar, Dialect ic, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, Geometry, Astrology, Music — they had lost all concrete reali ty. Boethius makes them appear almost without distinct features. It is impossible to love them any longer. But even so they are buxom figures in comparison with the objective scie nce that goes about as a being among men today. Little by little the human being has los t the connection he had in olden times with the spiritual world. This was inevitable becau se he had to develop to full freedom in order to shape all that is human out of himself. Th is has been the challenge since the fifteenth century, but it was not really felt until the end of the nineteenth and particularly in the twentieth century. For now, not only was the inheritance lost but the traditions too. Fathers had nothing to tell their sons. And now the feeling was: We are facing a Nothingness. People began to sense: The earth has i n fact become new. What I have said here can be put in another way, by considering what would have become of the earth without the Christ Event. — Sup pose there had been no Christ Event. The earth as it lives in man's life of soul and spi rit would gradually have withered. The Christ Event could not have been delayed until the modern age. It had to occur somewhat earlier than the time when the old inheritance had gone, in order that the Christ Event could at least be experienced through the old inher ited qualities of soul. Just imagine what it would have been like if the Christ Event at the beginning of our era had come about at the end of the nineteenth or in the twentieth centu ry. How our contemporaries would laugh to scorn the pretension that an event could b e of such significance! Quite a different kind of feeling was necessary. The feeling of stand ing before a Nothingness could not, at the time of that Event, have been there. The Christ Eve nt came during the first third of the fourth Post-Atlantean epoch of civilization. And in the same epoch, in the first third of which there fell the Christ Event, the old era came to an end. A new era begins in the fifteenth century, with the fifth Post-Atlantean epoch of civilization in which we are now living. In this ep och there were only traditions. They have gradually faded out. In this epoch, as regards the Christ Event, as regards the deeper, more intimate religious questions, men are clearly facin g a Nothingness. It has even become impossible for theologians to understand the Christ Event. Try to get from contemporary theology an intelligible conception of the Christ E vent. Those who argue the Christ away from Jesus pass as the greatest theologians today. Quite obviously, people are facing the Abyss. I am only describing symptoms. For these things tak e place in the deeper layers of man's life of soul. These layers of soul conjure in to those who were born on earth to become the young of recent decades, something that makes them feel cut off from the stream of world happenings. It is as though a terri ble jerk had been given to the evolution of the soul. Suppose my hand were capable of feeling and were ch opped off. What would it feel? It would feel cut off, dried up; it would no longer fe el itself to be what it actually is. This is what the human soul has been feeling since the last third of the nineteenth century in regard to the stream of world happenings. The soul feels cut off, chopped off, and the anxious question is: How can I once again become al ive in my soul?"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"But then, when one strives to speak out of what can bring this life back again, those who want to muddle along on the lines of the old spirit ual life simply show no understanding. Just think how little is understood about the essen ce of the founding of the Waldorf School, for example. For the most part people hear about th e Waldorf School something quite different from what they ought to hear. They hear t hings that were also said decades ago. The mere words that are spoken today about the Wald orf School can be found by them in books. They find every single word in earlier books . But when one wants to use different words, or perhaps only different ways of putting th e sentences together, then people say: That is bad style. They have not the remotest notio n of what must be done now, when human beings who still have a soul in their bodies must inevitably face the Nothingness. Waldorf School education must be listened to with o ther ears than those with which one hears about other kinds of education or educational reform. For the Waldorf School gives no answer to the questions people want to have answ ered today and which are ostensibly answered by other systems of education. What is the aim of such questions? Their usual aim is intelligence, much intelligence — and of int elligence the present time has an incalculable amount. Intelligence, intellect, cleve rness — these are widespread commodities at the present time. One can give terri bly intelligent answers to questions like: What should we make out of the child? How should we inculcate this or that into him? The ultimate result is that people answer for themselve s the question: What pleases me in the child, and how can I get the child to be what I lik e? But such questions have no significance in the deeper evolutionary course of humanity. And to such questions Waldorf pedagogy gives no reply at all. To give a picture of what Waldorf Education is, we must say that it speaks quite differently from the way in which people speak else where in the sphere of education: Waldorf School Education is not a pedagogical syste m but an Art — the Art of awakening what is actually there within the human being. Fund amentally, the Waldorf School does not want to educate, but to awaken. For an awakening is needed today. First of all, the teachers must be awakened, and then the teachers must awaken the children and the young people. An awakening is needed, now that mankind has been c ut off from the stream of world- evolution in general. In this moment humanity fell asleep — you will not be surprised that I use this expression. They fell asleep, just as a ha nd goes to sleep when it is cut off from the circulation of the body. But you might say: But hum an beings have made such progress since the fifteenth century, they have developed su ch colossal cleverness, and, moreover, are aware of the colossal cleverness they have deve loped If the War had not come — which, by the way, was not the experience that it might ha ve been, although people did realize to a slight extent that they were not so very clever aft er all — heaven knows to what point the phrase, “We have made such splendid progress” would have got. It would have been unendurable! Certainly in the sphere of the intelle ct tremendous progress has been made since the fifteenth century. But this intellect has something dreadfully deceptive about it. You see, people think that in their intellects they are awake. But the intellect tells us nothing about the world. It is really nothing but a dream of the world. In the intellect, more emphatically than anywhere else, man dreams and bec ause objective science works mostly with the intellect that is applied to observation a nd experiment, it too dreams about the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"world. It all remains a dreaming. Through the intel lect man no longer has an objective relation with the world. The intellect is the autom atic momentum of thinking which continues long after man has been cut off from the world. That is why human beings of the present day, when they feel a soul within them, are seeking again for a real link with the world, a re-entrance into the world. If up till the fifteenth century men had positive inheritances, so now they are confronting a “revers ed” inheritance, a negative inheritance. And here a strange discovery can be made. Up to the fifteenth century, men could welcome with joy what they had inherited from the evolution of the world. The world had not been unrolled and human beings were not altogether cut off from it. Today, after the switch ing off has occurred, one can again ponder what is to be got from the world without personal a ctivity. But then a strange discovery is made, like a man who is left a legacy and forgets t o inform himself about it accurately. A calculation is made and it is discovered that the d ebits exceed the assets. The opportunity of refusing the legacy has been missed. But this me ans a definite amount of debts which have to be paid. It is a negative inheritance. Ther e are such cases. And so a negative inheritance comes to the soul, even concerning the greatest Event that has ever happened in evolution. Before the time of Golgotha it was not necessary fo r human beings to understand the Mystery of Golgotha, because it had not taken place . Then it happened, and with the remains of ancient inheritance it could still be di mly understood in the age that followed. Then came the fifteenth century when these inherite d remains were no longer there, although it was still possible for father to pass o n to son the story of what took place in the Mystery of Golgotha. None of this helps any longer. People are dreadfull y clever. But even in the seventh and eighth centuries they would have been clever enough to perceive the contradictions in the four Gospels. The contradictions were, after all, v ery easy to discover. They began to be investigated for the first time in the nineteenth c entury. And so it is in every domain of life. The value of the intellect was too highly assessed and a consciousness, a feeling, for the Event of Golgotha was lost. Religious consciousness was lost in the deepest sense. But in its innermost essence the soul has not lost this consci ousness, and the young are asking: “What was the Mystery of Golgotha in reality?” The elders were unable to say anything about it. I am not implying that the young are capable of this either, or that anything is known at the Universities. What I am saying is that something ou ght to be known about it. To sum up, what is taking place chaotically in the depths of human souls: a striving to understand once again the Mystery of Golgotha. What must be sought for is a new experience of Christ. We are standing inevitably be fore a new experience of the Christ Event. In its first form it was experienced with th e remains of old inherited qualities of soul; they have vanished since the fifteenth centur y, and the experiences have been carried on simply by tradition. For the first time, in the last third of the nineteenth century it became evident that the darkness was now complete. There was no heritage any longer. Out of the darkness in the human soul, a light must be found once again. The spiritual world must be experienced in a new way. This is the significant experience that is living i n the souls of profounder natures in the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"modern youth movement. By no means superficially bu t in a deeper sense, it is clear that for the first time in the historical evolution of m ankind there must be an experience which comes wholly from out of the human being himself. A s long as this is not realized it is impossible to speak of education. The fundamental q uestion is: How can original, firsthand experience, spiritual experience, be generated in t he soul? Original spiritual experience in man's soul is some thing that is standing before the awakening of human beings in the new century as the all-embracing, unexpressed riddle of man and of the world. The real question is: How is man to awaken the deepest nature within him, how can he awaken himself? Zealous spir its among growing humanity — I can only express it in a picture — are like one who onl y half wakes in the morning with his limbs heavy, unable to come fully out of sleep. Tha t is how the human being feels today — as if he cannot completely emerge from the state of sleep. This lies at the root of a striving in many differe nt forms during the last twenty or thirty years and is still shining with a positive light to day into the souls of the young. It expresses itself in the striving for community among young pe ople. People are looking for something. I said yesterday: Man has lost man, and is seeking him again. Until the fifteenth century, human beings had not lost one another. Naturally ev olution cannot be turned back to an earlier condition and it would be dreadful to attem pt it. We do not wish to become reactionaries. Nevertheless it is a fact that up to the fifteenth century man could still find man. Since that century dim thought-pictures were t o be found in tradition and in what the father was still able to hand on, saying: “The othe r person over there is really a human being.” Dimly it was realized that this form going about was also a human being. In the twentieth century this has altogether vanished. Eve n tradition has gone, and yet the quest is still for the human being. Man is really seeking fo r man. And why? Because in reality he is seeking for something quite different. If things continue as they were at the turn of the century, then no one will wake up. For the others too are in the state where they are inca pable of awakening anybody. In short, human beings, in community life, must mean somethin g to one another. It is this that has from the beginning radiated through Waldorf School Education, which does not aim at being a system of principles but an impulse to awak en. It aims at being life, not science, not cleverness but art, vital action, awakening deed. T hat is, what matters is a question of awakening, for evolution has made human beings fall into a sleep that is filled with intellectualistic dreams. Even in the ordinary drea m — which is nothing compared with the intellectual dreaming that goes on — man is often a megalomaniac. But, ordinary dreaming is a mere nothing compared with intellectualistic d reaming. An awakening is at stake and it will simply not do to go any further with intellectualism. This objective science which goes about and has dis carded all its old clothes because it fears that something genuinely human might be found in th em, has surrounded itself with a thick fog, with the mantle of objectivity, and so n obody notices what is going about in this objectivity of science. People need something human again: human beings must be awakened. Yes, my dear friends, if an awakening is to take pl ace, the Mystery of Golgotha must become a living experience again. In the Mystery of Golgotha a Spirit-Being came into the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"earth from realms beyond the earth. In earlier time s this was grasped with ancient powers of the soul. The twentieth century is challenged to understand it with new powers. Modern youth, when it understands itself, is demanding to be awakened in its consciousness, not in the ancient and slumbering powers of the soul. And this can only happen through the Spirit, can only happen if the Spirit actually send s its sparks into the communities people are seeking for today. The Spirit must be the Awake ner. We can only make progress by realizing the tragic state of world-happenings in o ur day, namely, that we are facing the Nothingness we necessarily had to face in order to establish human freedom in earth- evolution. And in face of the Nothingness we need a n awakening in the Spirit. Only the Spirit can open the shutters, for otherwis e they will remain tightly shut. Objective science — I cast no reproaches, for I am not overlooking its great merits — will, in spite of everything, leave these shutters tightly c losed. Science is only willing to concern itself with the earthly. But since the fifteenth ce ntury the forces which can awaken human beings have disappeared. The awakening must be soug ht within the human being himself, in the super-earthly. This is indeed the deepest qu est, in whatever forms it may appear. Those who speak of something new and are inwardly e arnest and sincere should ask themselves: “How can we find the unearthly, the sup ersensible, the spiritual, within our own beings?” This need not again be clothed in inte llectualistic forms. Truly it can be sought in concrete forms, indeed it must be sought in such forms. Most certainly it cannot be sought in intellectualistic forms. For if you as k me why you have come here, it is because there is living within you this question: How can w e find the Spirit? If you see what has impelled you to come in the right light, you will f ind that it is simply this question: “How can we find the Spirit which, out of the forces of the present time, is working in us? How can we find this Spirit?” In the next few days, my dear friends, we will try to find this Spirit."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Younger Generation Younger Generation: Lecture III III TODAY I shall speak in the most concrete way about the Spirit in order to lay a foundation for the next few days, and I must appeal to you to try to arouse a fundamental feeling for what is here meant by the Spirit. What is taken into account by the human being today ? He attaches importance only to what he experiences consciously, from the time he w akes up in the morning until the time he goes to sleep at night. He reckons as part of th e world only that which he experiences in his waking consciousness. If you were listening to the voice of the present and had accustomed yourselves to it, you might say: Yes, bu t was it not always so? Did human beings in earlier times include in what they meant by reality anything in addition to what they experienced in their waking consciousness? I certainly do not wish to create the impression th at we ought to go back to the conditions in earlier epochs of civilization. That is not my intention. The thing that matters is to go forward, not back. But in order to find ou r bearings we may turn back, look back, rather, beyond the time of the fifteenth century, b efore the age I attempted to describe radically to you yesterday. What men of that time s aid about the world is looked upon today as mere phantasy, as not belonging to reality . You need only look at the literature of olden times and you will find, when men spoke of “s alt,” “mercury,” phosphorus and so on, that they included many things in the meaning which people are anxious to exclude today. People say nowadays: “Yes, in those days men added something out of their own phantasy when they spoke of salt, mercury, phosphor us.” We will not argue about the reason why this is so a nxiously excluded today. But we must realize that people saw something in phosphoru s, in addition to what is seen by the mere senses, in the way modern men see color. It wa s surrounded by a spiritual-etheric aura, just as around the whole of Nature there seem ed to hover a spiritual aura, although after the fourth or fifth century A.D. it was very colorless and pale. Even so, men were still able to see it. It was as little the outcome of pha ntasy as the red color we see. They actually saw it. Why were they able to see this aura? Because someth ing streamed over to them from their experiences during sleep. In the waking Consc iousness of that time man did not experience in salt, sulphur, or phosphorus any more than he does today; but when people in those days woke up, sleep had not been unfruitfu l for their souls. Sleep still worked over into the day and man's perception was richer; his e xperience of everything around him was more intense. Without this knowledge as a basis we cannot underst and earlier times. Later on the experience of the ancients in connection with sulph ur, phosphorus and so on became a mere name, an abstraction. The Spirit continued as an abstraction in tradition, until, at the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"end of the nineteenth century, the word spirit conv eyed nothing to the mind, nothing by way of experience. External culture, which alleges such great progress, naturally attaches the greatest importance to the fact that the human being acts with his waking consciousness. Naturally, with this he will build m achines; but with his waking consciousness he can work very little upon his own nature. if we were obliged to be always awake we should very soon become old-at least by th e end of our twentieth year — and more repulsively old than people today. We cannot a lways be awake, because the forces we need to work inwardly upon our organism are active within us only during sleep. it is of course true that the human being can work at extern al, visible forms of culture when he is awake, but only in sleeping consciousness can he wo rk upon himself. And in olden times much more streamed over from sleeping consciousness into the waking state. The great change took place in the middle of the fi fteenth century: this trickling of sleep consciousness into waking consciousness ceased. Pic torially I would say: In the tenth and eleventh centuries of western civilization man stil l grew up in such a way that he felt: Divine-spiritual powers have been performing deeds within me between my going to sleep and waking up. He felt the influx of divine-spiritu al forces just as in waking consciousness he experienced the health-bringing light of the sun . And before going to sleep there was in every human being an elemental mood of prayer, full of Nature-forces. People entered sleep — or if they were men of knowledge they at le ast strove to do so — by giving themselves over to divine-spiritual powers. The education of those who were destined for the sp iritual life was such that this mood was deliberately cultivated. At the end of the nine teenth century those who regarded themselves as the most spiritual men had for a long time replaced this by another method of preparation. I have often witnessed how people p repare themselves for sleep: “I must take my fill of beer to prepare for sleep.” This so unds grotesque. Yet we see it is historically true that vision into the spiritual world through s leep was a deliberate and conscious striving among human beings of past epochs, apart f rom the fact that the candidates for initiation — the students of those days-were prepar ed in a sacred way for the temple-sleep in which they were made aware of man's participatio n in the spiritual world. At the present time when one considers the developm ent of civilization people do not ask: What has come about in modern mankind from the educational point of view? The question is not asked because people do not think o f the whole human being but only of part of him. One has a strange impression if one se es a little further than the nearest spiritual horizon: people believe they at last know the truth about certain things, whereas the men of old were altogether naive. Read any curr ent history of physics and you will find that it is written as if everything before this age were naive; now at last things have been perceived in the form in which they can permanently remain. A sharp line is drawn between what has been achieved today and the ideas of nature evolved in “childish” times. No one thinks of asking: What educational effect ha s the science that is absorbed today, from the point of view of world-historical progress ? Let us think of some earlier book on natural scienc e. From the modern point of view it is childish. But now let us put aside the modern po int of view and ask: What educational effect had such a book at that time and what effect has a modern book? The modern book may be very clever and the older one very phantasti c, but if we consider the educational"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"value as a whole, we shall have to admit that when a book was read — and it was not so easy to read books in those days, there was somethi ng ceremonial about it — it drew something out of the depths of men's souls. The rea ding of a book was actually like the process of growing: productive forces were released in the organism and human beings were aware of them. They felt something real was th ere. Today everything is logical and formal. Everything is assimilated by means of the h ead, formally and intellectually, but no will-force is involved. And because it is all assim ilated by the head only and is thus entirely dependent upon the physical head-organization, it r emains unfruitful for the development of the true man. Today there are people who struggle against materia lism. My dear friends, it would be almost more sensible if they did not. For what does materialism affirm? It asserts that thinking is a product of the brain. Modern thinking is a product of the brain. That is just the secret — that modern thinking is a product of the b rain. With regard to modern thinking, materialism is quite right, but it is not right abo ut thinking as it was before the middle of the fifteenth century. At that time man did not thi nk only with the brain but with what was alive in the brain. He had living concepts. The con cepts of that time gave the same impression as an ant-hill, they were all alive. Mod ern concepts are dead. Modern thinking is clever, but dreadfully lazy! People do not feel it, and the less they feel it the more they love it. In earlier times people felt a tingling wh en they were thinking — because thinking was a reality in the soul. People are made to belie ve that thinking was always as it is today. But modern thinking is a product of the brain; earl ier thinking was not so. We ought to be grateful to the materialists for dra wing attention to the fact that present-clay thinking is dependent upon the brain. Such is the truth and it is a much more serious matter than is usually imagined. People bel ieve that materialism is a wrong philosophy. That is not at all true. Materialism is a product of world-evolution but a dead product, describing life in the condition where lif e has died. This thinking which has evolved more and more since the fifteenth century and which has entrenched itself in civilization the farther w est we go, (oriental civilization in spite of its decadence has after all preserved some of the o lder kind of thinking) has quite definite characteristics. The farther west we come the more does a thinking, regarded by the orientals as inferior, take the upper hand. It does not impress the oriental at all; he despises it. But he himself has nothing new; all he has is the old kind of thinking and it is perishing. But the European, and more so the Americ an, would not feel at ease if he had to transfer himself into the thinking of the Vedas. Th at kind of thinking made one tingle and the Westerners love dead thinking, where one does n ot notice that one is thinking at all. The time has come when people confess that a millwh eel is revolving in their heads — not only when someone is talking nonsense but when they are talking about living things. They merely want to snatch at what is dead. Here is an example which I am only quoting for the sake of cultural interest, not for the sake of polemics. I described how it is possible to see an aura of colors around stones, plants and animals. The way in which I put this in the book Knowledge of the Higher Worlds was such that it made living thinking, not d ead thinking, a necessity. A short time ago a professor at a University who is said to have something to do with philosophy, came across this description. To think livingly! Oh, no? that won't do; that is impossible! And"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"t here is supposed to be an aura of colors around sto ne, plant, animal! — He had only seen colors in the solar spectrum and so he thinks that I too can only have seen them in the solar spectrum and have transferred them to stone, plant and animal. He cannot in the least follow my way of describing, so he calls it just a torrent of words. For him, indeed, it is so. He is incapable of understanding it at all. And for a great number of University professors it can be the same. A millwheel is going round in thei r heads, so away with the head; and then, of course, nothing can possibly come out of i t! The living human being, however, demands a living k ind of thinking and this demand is in his very blood. You must be clear about this. Yo u must get your head so strong again that it can stand not only logical, abstract thinking, b ut even living thinking. You must not immediately get a buzzing head when it is a matter of thinking in a living way. For those whose characteristic was pure intellectualism had d ead thinking. The purpose of this dead thinking was the materialistic education of the Wes t. If we look into it, we get a very doubtful picture. The earlier kind of thinking could be carried over into sleep when the human being was still an entity. He was a being among other beings. He was a real entity during sleep because he had carried living thinking with him int o sleep. He brought it out of sleep when he woke up and took it back with him when he fell a sleep. Modern thinking is bound to the brain but this cannot help us during sleep. Today, therefore, according to the way of modern science, we can be the cleverest and most le arned people, but we are clever only during the day. We cease to be clever during the ni ght, in face of that world through which we can work upon our own being. Men have forgotten to work upon themselves. With the concepts we evolve from the time of waking to that of sleeping we can only achieve something between waking and sleeping. Nothing can be achieved with the real being of man. Man must work out of the forces with which he builds up his own being. During the period when he has to build himself up, when he is a little child, he needs the greatest amount of sleep. If ever a method should be discove red for cramming into babies all that is taught to seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds, you wo uld soon see what they would look like! It is a very good thing that babies are still provided for from the mother's breast and not from the lecturing desk. It is out of sleep tha t man must bring the forces through which he can work upon his own being. We can carry into sleep nothing from the concepts w e evolve through science, through external observation and experiments and the contro lling of experiments; and we can bring nothing of what is developed in sleep into these co ncepts of the material world. The spiritual and the intellectual do not get on well t ogether unless united in the world of full consciousness. Formerly this union was consummated, but in a more subconscious way. Nowadays the union must be fully conscious, and to this human beings do not wish to be converted. What happened when a man of earlier times passed wi th his soul into sleep? He was still an entity, because he had within him what hov ers around material things. He bore this into sleep. He could still maintain his identity wh en in sleep he was outside the physical body and in the spiritual world. Today he is less a nd less of a real entity. He is well-nigh absorbed by the spirituality of Nature when he leav es his body in sleep. In true perception of the world, this is at once evident to the soul. You should only see it! — well, you will be"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"able to see it if you will exert yourselves to acqu ire the necessary vision. Humanity must attain this vision, for we are living in an age whe n it can no longer be said that it is impossible to speak of the Spirit as we speak of an imals or stones. With such faculties of vision you will be able to see that even though Cae sar was not very portly in physical life, yet when his soul left his body in sleep it was of a considerable “size” — not in the spatial sense, but its greatness could be experienced. His soul was majestic. Today a man may be one of the most portly of bankers, but when his sou l steps out of his body in sleep into the spirituality of Nature, you should see what a ghast ly, shrunken framework it becomes. The portly banker becomes quite an insignificant figure ! Since the last third of the nineteenth century humanity has really been suffering from spi ritual under-nourishment. The intellect does not nourish the Spirit. It only distends it. T hat is why the human being takes no spirituality with him into sleep. He is well-nigh s ucked up when with his soul as a thin skeleton, he stretches out into the world of spirit ual Nature between sleeping and waking. That is why the question of materialism is far from theoretical. Nothing is of less importance today than the theoretical strife betwee n materialistic, spiritualistic and idealistic philosophy. These things are of no reali ty, for the refutation of materialism achieves nothing. We may refute materialism as ofte n as we like, nothing will come of it. For, the reasons we bring in order to refute it are just as materialistic as those we quote for or against idealism. Theoretical refutations achiev e nothing one way or the other. But what really matters is that in our whole way of looking at the world we have the Spirit once again. Thereby our concepts will regain the force t o nourish our being. To make this clear, let me say the following. Now, I really do not find any very great difference between those people who call themselves materialists and those who in little sec tarian circles call themselves, let us say, theosophists. For the way in which the one makes ou t a case for materialism and another for theosophy is by no means essentially different. It comes down to whether people want to make out a case for theosophy with the kind of t hinking entirely dependent upon the brain. If this is so, even theosophy is materialist ic. It is not a question of words, but whether the words express the Spirit. When I compare much o f the theosophical twaddle with Haeckel's thought, I find the Spirit in Haeckel, wh ereas the theosophists speak of the Spirit as if it were matter, but diluted matter. The point is not that one speaks about the Spirit but that one speaks through the Spirit. One can speak s piritually about the material, that is to say, it is possible to speak about the material in mobile concepts. And that is always much more spiritual than to speak un-spiritually about t he Spirit. However many come forward today with every possible kind of logical argument in defense of the spiritual view of the world; this si mply does not help us, does not help one bit. During the night we remain just as barren if d uring the day we ponder about hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, iodine, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon , silica, potassium, sodium and so on, and then evolve our theories; as if we ponder about the human being consisting of physical, etheric, and astral bodies. It is all the same so f ar as what is living is concerned. To speak in a living way about potassium or calcium, to treat c hemistry as really alive, this is much more valuable than a dead, intellectual theosophy. For theosophy too can be taught in a dead, intellectual way. It does not really matter w hether we speak materialistically or intellectually, what matters is that the Spirit sha ll be in what we say. The Spirit must penetrate us with its livingness. But because this is no longer understood, it is very"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"disagreeable when anyone takes this seriously. I did this in one of my last Oxford lectures, and t o make myself quite clear I said: It is all the same to me whether people speak of spiritism, r ealism, idealism, materialism or anything else When I need language to describe some external phenomenon I use materialistic language. This can be done in such a way that the Spirit too lives within it. If one speaks out of the realm of the Spirit, what one says will be spiritual although the language may have materialistic form. That is the d ifference between what is cultivated here as Anthroposophy and what is pursued in other places under similar names. Every other week books against Anthroposophy are brought out. They contain statements which are supposed to be leveled against what I have said , but what they attack is always quite new to me for as a rule I have never said such thin gs. They collect all sorts of rubbish and then write voluminous books about it. What they att ack has usually nothing whatever to do with what I actually say. The point is not to fight materialism but to see to it that the concepts come out of the world of the Spirit, that they are really experienced, that they are concepts filled with life. What is here presented a nd accepted as Anthroposophy is quite different from what the world says about it. People fight today against Anthroposophy — and some times also in defense of it — quite materialistically, un-spiritually, whereas wh at really matters is that experience of the Spirit should be made a reality in us. People easil y get muddied, for when one begins to speak of spiritual beings as one speaks of plants a nd animals in the physical world, they take one for a fool. I can understand that; but the re is just this, that this folly is the true reality, indeed the living reality for human beings ! The other kind of reality is good for machines but not for human beings. This is what I wanted to say quite clearly, my dear friends, that in what I intend here and have always intended, the important thing is no t merely to speak about the Spirit, but out of the Spirit, to unfold the Spirit in the very speaking. The Spirit can have an educative effect upon our dead cultural life. The Spirit must be the lightning which strikes our dead culture and kindles it to renewed life. Therefore, do not think that you will find here any plea for rigid concepts such as the concepts physic al body, etheric body, astral body, which are so nicely arrayed on the walls of theosophical groups and are pointed out just as, in a lecture room, sodium, potassium and so on are point ed to with their atomic weights. There is no difference between pointing at tables giving the atomic weight of potassium and pointing to the etheric body. It is exactly the sam e, and that is not the point. Interpreted in this way, Theosophy — or even Anthroposophy — is no t new, but merely the latest product of the old. The most incredible twaddle is heard when people su ddenly feel themselves called upon to uphold the spiritual. I do not mention thes e things for the sake of criticism, but as a symptom. I will tell you two stories; the first run s as follows. I was once at a meeting in the West of Europe on the subject of theosophy. The lec tures had come to an end. I fell into conversation with someone about the value of these lectures. This personality who was a good disciple of theosophical sectarianism told me of his impression of the lectures in these words: “There are such beautiful vibrations in this hall.” The pleasant sensation, you see, was expressed in terms of vibrations — in other wor ds, materialistically."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Another time people pestered me about some discover y that had been made on the spiritual plane. It was stated that repeated earth- lives — which as a matter of fact can only be revealed to the soul by genuinely spiritual perc eption — must also be perceived in an earthly guise, must be clothed in terms of material istic thinking. So these people began to speak of the “permanent atom” which goes through al l earth-lives. They said: If I am now living on the Earth, and come back again after hund reds of years, the atoms will be scattered to the four winds — but one single atom g oes over into the next earth-life. It was called the “permanent atom”. Quite happily the most materialistic ideas were being introduced into the truth of repeated earth-lives, into a truth that can only be grasped by the Spirit. As if it could profit anyone to have a single atom say from the fourth or filth century going around in his brain! Surely it is the same as if a surgeon in the world beyond had managed to equip me in this life by having pres erved my stomach from a former incarnation and inserted it in my present body. In principle, these things are exactly the same. I am not telling you this as a joke, but as an inte resting symptom of people who, wanting to speak of the Spirit, talk of the pleasant sensat ion coming from spiritual “vibrations” and have only absorbed through imitation what others ha ve known about repeated earth-lives, clothe this in such a way that they talk about the permanent atom. Books have been written by theosophists about this permanent atom — books w ith curious drawings showing the distribution of hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine and so o n. And when one looks at them they seem no less outrageous than the sketches which mat erialists have made of the atoms. It does not matter whether we say: This is spiritual, or that is material. What matters is to realize the necessity of entering the living Spirit . I do not say this in a polemic sense but to make it clear to you. The following is characteristic. There lives at the present time a very gifted Benedictine Father Mager, one of the finest minds in the Order — and the Benedictines have exceedingly fine minds. Mager has written an extrem ely interesting little book on “The Behaviour of Man in the Sight of God.” It belongs, in thought, to the time when Benedict founded his Order. Had it been written then it woul d have been quite in accordance with the times. When someone writes a book about the “Be haviour of Man in the Sight of God” one can admire it. And I do admire it. The same pri est has, however, also given his opinion on Anthroposophy. And now he becomes the densest of materialists. It is really terribly difficult for one to force one's way into such a ri gid kind of thought in order to describe the statements made by this priest. What he censures mo st is that the perception in Imaginative knowledge, which I put first, is of suc h a nature that for Father Mager it amounts to a lot of pictures. He gets no farther. A nd then he says, in accordance with his scientific conscience, that Anthroposophy materiali zes the world. He takes violent exception to the fact that Anthroposophy materializ es the world, in other words, that Anthroposophy does not confine itself to the unreal , abstract concepts he loves — for this Father loves the most abstract concepts. Just read any Catholic philosophy and you will find — Being, Becoming, Existence, Beauty and so on — all in the most abstract form. Whatever you do, don't touch the world! And the Fat her notices that Anthroposophy contains living concepts which can actually come do wn to real things, to the real world. That is an abomination to him."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"One ought to answer him: If knowledge is to be anyt hing real, it must follow the course taken by God in connection with the world. This cou rse started from the Spiritual and was materialized. The world was first spiritual and the n became more and more material, so that real knowledge must follow this course. It is not sought for in Anthroposophy, but one comes to it. The picture slips into reality; but Fa ther Mager condemns this. And yet it is exactly what he must himself believe if he wants to give his faith a reasonable content. But he calls it in our case the materialization of know ledge. Of course, there is no satisfying those who insist: For heaven's sake no living concepts, for they will slip into reality, and concepts must be kept away from that! In such cases we can only have concepts belonging to waking consciou sness and none that is capable of working upon man from the spiritual world. And that is exactly what we need. We need a living evolution and a living education of the huma n race. The fully conscious human being feels the culture of the present day to be cold, ar id. It must be given life and inner activity once again. It must become such that it fills the h uman being, fills him with life. Only this can lead us to the point where we shall no longer h ave to confess that we ought not to mention the Spirit, but it leads us to where the go od will to develop within us the inclination not for abstract speaking, but for inwa rd action in the Spirit that flows into us, not for obscure, nebulous mysticism, but for the co urageous, energetic permeation of our being with spirituality.

Tomorrow, we w ill speak of these things again."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Younger Generation Younger Generation: Lecture IV I V TODAY I shall begin with a review of ethics up to t he end of the nineteenth century. I do not wish to convey that philosophical expositions c an give rise to an impulse for the renewal of the moral life, but rather to show that forces which work from other sources to determine the moral life are symptomatically expres sed in the philosophical expositions of ethics. We must give up the view that systems of philosophy which start from the intellect can give a sound direction. Yet the whole impulse of th e age expresses itself in what the philosophers say. No one will declare that our reac tion to the temperature of a room is influenced by the thermometer; what the thermometer registers is dependent upon the temperature of the room. In the same way we can gau ge, from what philosophers write about morality, the condition of morals in general. You see, I treat philosophical expositions of ethic s in rather a different way, merely as a kind of thermometer for registering conditions. Jus t as we know the temperature of a room by reading the thermometer, so we can find out a gr eat deal about the undercurrents of the life of humanity in a particular region or period b y knowing what the philosophers express in their writings. Consider the following only from this point of view as I read you a passage printed in 1893 in the periodical Deutsche Literaturzeitung th at deals with Spencer's Principle of Ethics. The reviewer says: “It contains, as I think , the most complete argument, supported by a crushing weight of material, that there is abs olutely no such thing as one universal morality for all mankind, nor is there an unchangea ble Moral Law: that there exists only one norm which underlies all judgments of human cha racteristics and actions, namely, the practical fitness or unfitness of a character or ac tion for the given state of the society in which the judgment is made. On this account the sam e things will be very differently judged according to the different cultural conditio ns in which they occur. The view of the present writer is that this masterpiece (Spencer's Principles of Ethics) must, from a scientific point of view at least, strike dumb any recent attempts to base ethical judgments upon intuition, inborn feelings, or the most eviden t of axioms and the like.” This passage is characteristic of the attitude of m ost of the civilized world at the end of the nineteenth century, so that it could be express ed in philosophical terms. Let us be clear as to what is said. The attempt is made in this very important work, Spencer's Principles of Ethics, to prove — as the r eviewer rightly says — with crushing weight of material, that it is impossible to draw f orth from the human soul moral intuitions, moral axioms, and that we must stop talking about m oral intuitions. We can only say with certainty that man acts according to his natural en dowments. Any action is judged by a man's social environment; he is forced to bring his action into line with the judgment of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"this social environment. Hence conventional moral j udgments are modified as human society changes from century to century. And a revi ewer in the nineties of last century says that it is at last possible to silence, so far as s cience is concerned, all attempts to speak of ethics and moral views in such a way that moral int uitions arise out of the soul. I have chosen this example because it characterizes what faced one when one thought about ethics and moral impulses. Into this mood of the age, my dear friends, I sent my Philosophy of Spiritual Activity which culminates in the view that the end of the ni neteenth century makes it eminently necessary that men, as time goes on, will only be a ble to find moral impulses in the very essence of the soul; that even for the moral impuls es of everyday life, they will be obliged to have recourse to moral intuitions. All other impuls es will become gradually less decisive than the moral intuitions laid bare in the soul. In view of the situation which I faced, I was obliged to say, “The future of human ethics depends upon the power of moral intuition becoming stronger; advance in moral education can o nly be made as we strengthen the force of moral intuition within the soul, when the individual becomes more and more aware of the moral intuitions which arise in his so ul.” Over against this stood the judgment — a universal one, for we only speak here of what holds good universally — that it is proven with ove rwhelming evidence that all moral intuitions must be silenced. It was therefore neces sary to attempt to write a book that would present in a virile way the very point of vie w which, with equal vigor, science declared should be forever silenced. This example shows clearly that the turning-point o f the nineteenth century was a time of tremendous significance for the spiritual evolut ion of the West. It goes to show those who have been growing up since the end of the last century are faced with quite a different situation in the life of soul from that of previous centuries. And I said with regard to the Spiritual, that at the end of the nineteenth centur y, man stood, in his soul-being, face to face with “Nothingness”. It was necessary to emphas ize, because of man's deeper spiritual nature, that for the future, moral intuition is con fronted with what had come from the past, with the Nothingness. This turning-point of the nin eteenth century revealed itself in German culture in a most tragic way. We need only m ention the name of Nietzsche. For those who lived through the transition from the nineteenth to the twentieth century with alert and wide-awake consciousness, Nietzsche represents an experience of real tragedy. Nietzsche was a personality who through th e successive periods of his life poignantly experienced that he was faced with the N othingness, that Nothingness which he had at first assumed to be a “something,” a reality . It will not be superfluous for our study during the next few days to say a few words about Friedrich Nietzsche. In a certain respect Nie tzsche, through his tragic destiny, clearly indicates the twilight in the spiritual evolution o f mankind at the end of the nineteenth century, making a new dawn necessary for the centur y just beginning. Nietzsche started from a mature scientific standpoi nt; this he first met in philology in the middle of the nineteenth century. With a mind o f extraordinary inner flexibility Nietzsche assimilated the philological standpoint o f the middle of the nineteenth century"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"and with it he absorbed the whole spirit of Greek c ulture. Nietzsche was not a personality to shut himself off from the general culture. The very reverse of a theoretical scholar, he accepted natur ally what he found in the middle of the nineteenth century, namely, Schopenhauer's philosop hical pessimism. This made a profound impression upon him, because he realized m ore deeply than Schopenhauer the decline of the spiritual life in the midst of which he was living. The only form in which the light that pointed towar ds the future came to him was in Richard Wagner's music. As you know, Wagner was a f ollower of Schopenhauer at the time he made Nietzsche's acquaintance. Thus, towards the beginning of the last third of th e nineteenth century, Nietzsche developed the view that was no theory but the very substance of life to him — that already in Greek culture there had dawned the age in which the full human content was being crushed by intellectualism. Nietzsche was not corre ct in regard to the complete development of intellectualism, for in the form in which Nietzsche experienced intellectualism as an all-destroying spirit, it had , as I said yesterday, come upon the scene only since the fifteenth century. What Nietzsche ex perienced was the intellectualism of the immediate present. He dated it back to the later ag e of Greek culture, and held that the influence working so destructively upon what was li vingly spiritual began with Socrates. And so Nietzsche became anti-Socratic in his philos ophy. With the advent of Socrates in the spiritual life of Greece he saw intellectualism and the faculty of understanding driving away the old spirituality. Not many have grasped with such innate power the co ntrast between the character of Greek culture as it appears in the writings of Aesc hylus, of Sophocles, in the early sculpture and in the mighty philosophies of men like Heraclit us, Anaxagoras and others; the contrast of this life of soul, still full of spiritual impul ses — and that other life of soul which gradually began to paralyze the true spirituality. According to Nietzsche this began with Socrates who confronted all world-questions with in tellectual questions, with Socrates who established his art of definition, about which Niet zsche felt: “When it began man no longer looked at the immediate and living Spirit in the ol d natural way.” Provided this idea is not carried too far and thus made intellectual, it show s that Nietzsche felt something of great significance. Real experience of the Spiritual, wherever we meet it, always becomes individualism. Definition inevitably becomes generalization. In go ing through life and meeting individuals we must have an open heart — an open mind for the i ndividual. Towards each single individual we should be capable of unfolding an ent irely new human feeling. We only do justice to the human being when we see in him an en tirely new personality. For this reason every individual has the right to ask of us that we should develop a new feeling for him as a human being. If we come with a general idea in our heads, saying that the human being should be like this or like that — then we are bein g unjust to the individual. With every definition of a human being we are really putting u p a screen to make the human individual invisible. Nietzsche felt this in regard to the spiritual life — hence his opposition to the Socratic"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"teaching. And so, during the sixties and early seve nties of the nineteenth century there grew in his soul the idea that the true and living Greek culture has a kind of pessimism at the root of its feeling about the world. He thought the Greeks were convinced that immediate life, in its elementary form, cannot give man satisfaction, a complete feeling of his dignity as man. Therefore the Greeks took refug e in what art was to them. And to the Greeks, the art they cultivated in the time of thei r prime was the great comforter, helping to overcome what was lacking in material existence. So that for Nietzsche, Greek art could be understood only out of a tragic feeling about life, and he thought that this mission of art would again be revived by Wagner and through his ar tistic impulse. The seventies approached and Nietzsche began to fee l that after all this was not so, because in his time he failed to find the impulse w hich the Greeks had set up as the great consoler for the material life around them. And so he reflected: “What was it that I wanted to find in Wagner's art as a renewal of Greek art? What was it? Ideals.” But it dawned upon him, as he let these ideals work upon his soul, tha t they were no different from those of his own epoch. During the last third of the nineteenth century the re came a terribly tragic moment in Nietzsche's life, the moment when he felt his ideal s to belong to his own times. He was forced to admit: “My ideals are no different from w hat this present age calls its ideals. After all, I am drawing from the same forces from which m y own age draws its ideals.” This was a moment of great pain for Nietzsche. For he had expe rienced the idealistic tendencies manifest in his day. He had found, for example, a D avid Friedrich Strauss — revered by the whole age as a great man — but whom he had unmasked as a philistine. And he realized that his own ideals, stimulated by his absorption i n Wagner and in Greek art, strongly resembled those of his time. But these ideals seeme d to him impotent and unable to grasp the Spiritual. So he said to himself: “If I am true to myself, I c annot have any ideals in common with my time.” This was a tragic discovery although not expressed in these words. Anyone who has steeped himself in what Nietzsche lived through during the years of which I am speaking, knows that there came for Nietzsche the t ragic moment when, in his own way, he said: “When a man of the present day speaks of idea ls and these coincide with what others call their ideals, then he is moving in the realm o f the ‘empty phrase’, the ‘empty phrase’ that is no longer the living body but the dead corp se of the Spirit.” This brought Nietzsche to the conviction: I must re solutely put aside the ideals I have evolved hitherto. And this putting aside all his id eals began in the middle of the seventies. He published his Human All Too Human, The Dawn of D ay and The Joyful Wisdom — works in which he pays some homage to Voltaire but which also contain a certain view of human morals. An external inducement to forsake his former ideali sm and steer towards the views of his second period was his acquaintance with the wor ks of Paul Rée. Paul Rée treated the moral nature and its development from a purely scie ntific point of view, entirely in line with the natural science of the day. Paul Rée has w ritten the very interesting little book, On the Origin of Moral Perceptions and also a book on The Genesis of Conscience. This book, which everyone should read who wants to know about the thought of the last third of the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"nineteenth century, had a very deep influence on Ni etzsche. What is the spirit of this book? Again, I am not de scribing it because I think that philosophy has a direct influence upon life; I do s o because I want to have a thermometer for culture by which we can read the state of the e thical impulses of the time. Paul Rée's view amounted to this: The human being, originally, had no more than what in his opinion a child has, namely, a life of instinct, impulses o f unconscious, instinctive activity. The individual human being, when he becomes active, com es up against others. Certain of these activities unfolded towards the outer world happen to suit other human beings, to be beneficial to them; other activities may be harmful . From this there arises the judgment: What proceeds from the instinctive activities of th e human being as beneficial is gradually seen to be “Good;” what proves harmful to others is branded as “Evil.” Life becomes more complicated all the time. People forget how they pu t labels on things. They speak of good and evil and have forgotten that in the beginning t he good was simply what was beneficial and the evil what was felt to be harmful. So finall y what has arisen has become instinct, has recast itself as instinct. It is just as if someone struck out blindly with his arm — if the result is a caress, then this is called good; if it is a b ox on the ears, then it is evil. And so judgments pile up. The sum of such judgments becomes instinct . People know how they raise their hand just as little as they know why a voice comes out of the soul and utters this or that moral judgment. This voice they call conscience. Th is voice of conscience is simply what has arisen out of instinctive judgments about the b eneficial and the harmful. It has become instinct, and because its origin has been forgotten , it speaks from within as if it were the voice of conscience. Nietzsche realized fully that not everyone would ag ree with Paul Rée. But he was also quite clear that when views on natural science were such as they were in his day, it is impossible to think about Ethics otherwise than in the way Paul Rée did. Nietzsche was thoroughly honest; he deduced the ultimate conseque nces as Paul Rée had done. Nietzsche bore the philosopher no grudge for having written s uch things. This had not much more significance for Nietzsche than what was circumscrib ed by the four walls of the room in which Paul Rée did his writing, just as a thermomet er indicates nothing more than the temperature of the immediate environment. However, it shows something universal, and Nietzsche felt this. He felt the ethical sediment o f the times in this book and with this he agreed. For him there was nothing more important th an to put aside the old “empty phrase” and to say: “When people talk about nebulou s ideals they make nothing clear. In fact everything is instinct.” Nietzsche often said to himself: Here is someone wh o says, I am an enthusiast for this or that ideal and I rejoice that others too should be enthusiastic about it. And so, Nietzsche comes to the conclusion that when all is said and d one, a man who is an enthusiast for certain ideals and wants to enthuse others, is so c onstituted that when he is thinking of these ideals he can work up the juices in his stoma ch in the best way for the digestion of his food. I am putting this rather inelegantly but it i s exactly what Nietzsche felt in the seventies and eighties. He said to himself: People talk about all sorts of spiritual things and call them ideals. But in reality it is there for no other purpose than to enable people, each according to his constitution, to digest and carry out bodily functions in the best way. What is known as human must be divested of the “empty ph rase,” for in truth the human is all-too-human."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"With a magnificent devotion to honesty, Nietzsche d eclared war on all idealism. I know that this aspect of Nietzsche has not always been e mphasized. A great deal that has been said about him is pure snobbery, without anything s erious in it. So Nietzsche found himself facing the “Nothingness” at the end of the first pe riod of his spiritual development, consciously facing the Nothingness in a second peri od which began with Human All Too Human and ended with The Joyful Wisdom . Finally, only one mood remained, for it is impossible to reach a real spiritual content when a ll ideals are traced back to bodily functions. One example will show what Nietzsche's v iew became. He said to himself: There are people who work towards asceticism, that is to say, towards abstention from physical enjoyment. Why do they do this? They do it because they have exceedingly bad digestion arid feel most comfortable when they abstain from p hysical enjoyment. That is why they regard asceticism as the highest aim worth striving for. But unconsciously they are seeking what makes them most comfortable. They wish to feel the greatest enjoyment in the absence of enjoyment. That absence of enjoyment is their greatest enjoyment shows us how they are constituted. In Nietzsche, who was thoroughly honest, this mood intensified to moments when he gave vent to words like these: “Ich wohn' in meinem eigenen Haus, Hab' niemand etwas nachgemacht, Und lache jeden Meister aus, Der sich nicht selber ausgelacht.” (I dwell within my own house and have imitated no single man; and I laugh at every master who has not laughed at himself.) In its poetic anticipation this verse is a magnific ent description of the mood that came to its climax about the turn of the nineteenth century , yet it was already there earlier, in a form that made itself felt in the life of soul. Nie tzsche found his way out of this second period of facing the Nothingness by creating what i s implicit in two ideas to which he gave poetic expression. The one was the idea of the “Sup erman.” Ultimately there was nothing left but to call upon something which must be born out of the human being but was not yet there. After his grandiose experience of facing Not hingness, there arose the idea of the eternal recurrence of the same, which came to him o ut of the theory of evolution. In his"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"scientific period he had become familiar with the i dea of evolution. But as he steeped himself in what came from these thoughts about evol ution he discovered nothing that would bring evolution forward; these only gave him the idea of eternal recurrence. This was his last period, which need not be described an y further, although from the point of view of psychology a very great deal might be learn t from it. I do not wish to draw a character-study but only to indicate how Nietzsche, who was forced through illness to lay down his pen at the e nd of the eighties, had experienced in advance the mood that dominated deeper souls at the turn of the century. During the last third of the nineteenth century Nietzsche tried to express a mood drawn from his store of ideas, from Greek philosophy and art, from art as f ound in Wagner, from the philosophy of Schopenhauer, and so on. But time and again Nietzsc he himself abandoned his own views. One of his last works is called The Twilight of the Idols, or How to Philosophize w ith the Hammer . He felt himself as a destroyer of the old ideas. It was really very remarkable. The old ideas had already been destroyed by the spi rit of cultural evolution. During Nietzsche's youth the store of ideas was already de stroyed. Up to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, ideas continued through tradit ion but came to an end in the last third of the nineteenth century. The old spirit was already in ruins. It was only in the “empty phrase,” the cliché, that these ideas lived on. Those who thought in accordance with spiritual real ity in Nietzsche's day would not have felt that they had to smash the ideals with a hammer but that they had already been smashed simply in the course of the evolution of th e human race. Mankind would not have reached freedom unless this had happened. But Nietz sche who found these ideals still blossoming in the empty phrase was under the illusi on that he was doing what had already long been done. What had been the inner fuel of the spiritual life in the former age, the fuel whereby the Spirit in man could be kindled and, once kindled, i lluminate both Nature and his own life — this had passed away. In the realm of the moral t his is expressed by people saying: There can be no moral intuitions any longer. As I mentioned yesterday, theoretical refutations o f materialism as world-conception are sheer nonsense, for materialism has its justific ation in this age. Thoughts which our age has to recognize as right are products of the brain . Therefore a refutation of materialism is in itself of the nature of the empty phrase, and no one who is honest can see the good of refuting materialism theoretically for nothing is t o be gained by it. The human being has come to the stage where he no longer has an inner, living Spirit but only a reflection of the Spirit entirely dependent upon the physical brain. Here materialism is fully justified as a theoretical world conception. The point is not that people have a false world-conception or refute it, but that little by little they have come to an inner attitude of life and soul that is lacking in Spirit. This rings tragically, like a cr y, through Nietzsche's philosophy. This is the situation of the spiritual life in whic h souls with natural feeling among the young of the twentieth century found themselves. Yo u will not come to any clear view, to any tangible experience, of what is brewing indisti nctly, subconsciously in your souls and what you call the experiences of youth, unless you look into this revolution that has"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"inevitably taken place in the spiritual life of the present period of evolution. If you try to characterize what you experience on a ny other basis, you will always feel after a time that you must brush it aside. You will not hit upon a truth but only on clichés. For unless the human being today honestly admits: I must grasp the living, the active Spirit, the Spirit which no longer has its reality but only its corpse in intellectualism — unless I come to this, there is no freedom from the confusio n of the age. As long as anyone believes that he can find Spirit in intellectualism, which i s merely the form of the Spirit in the same way as the human corpse is the form of a man, man w ill not find himself. To find oneself is only possible if man will honest ly confess: Intellectualism has the same relation to the living essence of the Spirit a s a dead corpse to the man who has died. The form is still there but the life of the Spirit has gone out of intellectualism. Just as the human corpse can be treated with preparations that preserve its form — as indeed Egyptian mummies show — so too can the corpse of th e Spirit be preserved by padding it out with the results of experiment and observation. But thereby man gets nothing of what is livingly spiritual, he gets nothing that he can uni te naturally with the living impulses of the soul. He gets nothing but a dead thing, a dead thin g that can wonderfully reproduce what is dead in the world, just as one can still marvel at the human form in the mummy. But in intellectualism we cannot get what is truly spiritu al any more than a real human being can be made out of a mummy. As long as importance is attached to conserving wha t the union of observation and intellect is intended to conserve, one can only say : The achievements of the modern age are great. The moment the human being has to unite in t he depths of his soul with what his Spirit inwardly holds up before him — there can be no link between intellectualism and the soul. Then the only thing is for him to say: “I am thirsting for something, and nothing I find out of intellectuality gives me water to quench my thirst.” This is what lives in the feelings of young people today although, naturally, it is not so clear when expressed in words. Young people today s ay many things, annoying things when one gets to the bottom of what is said. But one soo n overcomes it. The annoyance is due to the fact that bombastic words are used that express anything rather than what the speaker really feels. The empty phrase over-reaches itself and what appears as the character of the youth movement is, for one who lives in the Spirit, like a continuous bursting of bubbles; it is really intellectualism overreaching itself. I do not want to hurt any of you personally, but if it does hurt — well, I cannot help it. I should be sorry, but I still think it right to say it. I cannot say only pleasant things; I must sometimes s ay things which will not please everyone. Moreover I must say what I know to be tru e. So, in order to characterize what is rightly there in the souls of young people today, w e need something more than a revival of old concepts over-reaching themselves in empty phra ses; we need a highly-developed feeling for truth. We need truth at the bottom of our soul. Truth is t he alpha and the omega of what we need today, and when your Chairman said yesterday t hat we have got to a point where we do not want to utter the word “Spirit” any longer, that is in itself a confession of the truth. It would be much more clever if our age, which has los t the Spirit, would stop there and not want to talk about the Spirit, because then human b eings would again begin to thirst for the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Spirit. Instead of this, anything and everything is termed “Spirit,” “spiritual.” What we need is truth, and if any young person today acknowledge s the condition of his own soul, he can only say: This age has taken all spirit out of my s oul, but my soul thirsts for the Spirit, thirsts for something new, thirsts for a new conque st of the Spirit. As long as this is not felt in all honesty the yout h movement cannot come into its own. Let me add the following to what I have said in cha racterization of what we must seek. In the deepest, innermost being of the soul, we must s eek for light; above all else we must acquire the most profound feeling for honesty and t ruth. If we build upon honesty and truth, then we shall progress, for humanity must in deed progress. Then we shall speak of the Spirit which is so like our human nature. The s oul is most of all like the Spirit, therefore it can find the Spirit if only it so wills. In our time the soul must strive beyond empty phrase, convention and routine; beyond the empty ph rase to a grasp of truth; beyond convention to a direct, elementary warm-hearted rel ation between man and man; beyond routine to the state in which the Spirit lives in e very single action, so that we no longer act automatically but that the Spirit lives in the most ordinary everyday actions. We must come to spirituality in action, to the immediate experie nce of human beings in their relations to one another and to honest, upright experience of tr uth."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Younger Generation Younger Generation: Lecture V V YESTERDAY I tried to characterize the spiritual lif e at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries; to describe i t as I experienced it, and as it led to the writing of my Philosophy of Spiritual Activity ( The Philosophy of Freedom ). The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity was to point to moral intuitions as that within man which, in the evolution of the world, should le ad to the founding of the moral life of the future. In other words, through my Philosophy of Spiritual Activity , I wanted to show that the time has come, if morality is to cont inue in the evolution of mankind, to make an appeal to what the individual is able to ca ll forth from his inmost nature. I mentioned that the Philosophy of Spiritual Activity was published at a time when it was universally said that at last it had been recog nized that moral intuitions were an impossibility and that any discussion about moral i ntuitions must once and for all be silenced. I therefore considered it essential to es tablish the reality of moral intuition. Thus there was a distinct cleft between what the age, am ong many of its most eminent minds considered to be truth, and what I was obliged to m aintain as truth out of the principles of human evolution. But on what is this difference really based? Let us look into the depths of man's life of soul, as we see it today in the West. In earlier ti mes people also spoke of moral intuitions, that is to say, it was said that, as an individual entity, man could call forth from within himself independently of external life the impetus to action. But when the new age dawned, in the first third of the fifteenth century and mor e powerfully in subsequent centuries, what had been said about moral intuitions was no longer quite true. It was said: Morality cannot be established by the observation of external facts ; men were no longer aware of a real light when they looked into their inner being. So they de clared that moral intuitions were there, but that actually nothing more was known about them . For centuries statements were such that one might say: The thinking, which had been na tural before the fifteenth century, moved onwards automatically and facts formerly just ified had ceased to be so. Traditions, of which I have spoken, persisted throu gh the centuries and contributed towards such statements. Before the fifteenth centu ry, men did not speak in indefinite terms as was current later, and this very indefinit eness was untruthful. When speaking of intuitions, of moral intuitions he spoke of that wh ich rose up in his inner being, of which he had a picture as real as the world of Nature when h e opened his eyes in the morning. Outside he saw Nature around him, the plants and th e clouds; when he looked into his inner being, there arose the Spiritual, the Moral a s it was given to him. The further we go back in evolution the more we find that the rising tip of an inner realm into human experience was a matter of course. These facts, as I have explained them to you, are the outcome of Spiritual Science; they may also be stud ied historically by considering external symptoms. In the days when speech, from being an in ner reality was lapsing into untruthfulness, proof for the existence of God came into evidence."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Had anyone during the first centuries of Christiani ty spoken about proofs for the existence of God, as Anselm of Canterbury, people w ould not have known what was meant. In earlier times they would have known still less! For in the second or third century before Christ, to speak of proofs for the existence of God would have been as if someone sitting there in the first row were to stand up and I were to say: “Mr. X stands there,” and someone in the room were to assert “No, that must f irst be proved!” What man experienced as the divine was a Being of full reality standing before his soul. He was endowed with the faculty of perception for what he called divine; th is God appears primitive and incomplete in the eyes of modern man. They could not get beyon d the point they were then capable of reaching. But the men of that age had no desire to hear about proofs, for that would have seemed absurd. Man began to “prove” the existence o f the divine when he had lost it, when it was no longer perceived by inner, spiritual perc eption. The introduction of proofs for the existence of God shows, if one looks at the facts i mpartially, that direct perception of the divine had been lost. But the moral impulses of tha t time were bound up with what was divine. Moral impulses of that time can no longer b e regarded as moral impulses for today. When in the first third of the fifteenth century th e faculty of perception of the divine- spiritual in the old sense was exhausted, perceptio n of the moral also faded and all that remained was the traditional dogma of morals which men called “conscience.” But the term was always applied in the vaguest manner. When, therefore, at the end of the nineteenth centu ry it was said that all talk about moral intuitions must be silenced, it was the final consequence of a historical development. Until then human beings had a feeling, however dim, that such intuitions had once existed. But now they began to put themselves to the test. I ntelligence had at least brought them to the point of being able to do this; they discovered that with the methods they were accustomed to use to think scientifically, they wer e unable to approach moral intuitions. Let us consider the moral intuitions of olden times . History has become very threadbare in this respect. We have a history of outer events and in the nineteenth century a history of culture was established. But this age has been inca pable of producing a history which takes man's inner life of soul into account; there is no knowledge of how the life of soul developed from the earliest times until the first t hird of the fifteenth century. But if we go back in time and consider what was spoken of as mor al intuition, we find that it did not arise as a result of inner effort. For this reason the Old Testament, for instance, is right not to feel what figured then as moral intuition as beg otten from within, but as divine commandments, coming to the soul from outside. And the further back we go the more the human being felt what he saw when he beheld the mor al, to be a gift to his inner nature from some living divine being outside him. Moral in tuitions held good as divine commands — not in a figurative or symbolic sense, but in an absolutely real sense. There is a good deal of truth in contemporary relig ious philosophies when they allude to a primal revelation preceding the historical age on earth. External science cannot get much beyond, shall I say, a paleontology of the sou l. Just as in the earth we find fossils, indicating an earlier form of life, so in fossilize d moral ideas we find forms pointing back to the once living, God-given moral ideas. Thus we can get to the concept of primal revelation and say: This primal revelation faded out. Human be ings lost the faculty for being conscious of primal revelation. And this loss reach ed its culminating point in the first third"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"of the fifteenth century. Human beings perceived no thing when they looked within themselves. They preserved only the tradition of wh at they had once beheld. Religious communities gradually seized upon this tradition an d turned its externalized content, this purely traditional content, into dogmas which peopl e were expected merely to believe, whereas formerly they had living experience of thei r truth, though as coming from outside man. This was the very significant situation at the end of the nineteenth century: Certain circles realized that the old intuitions, the God-g iven intuitions, were no longer there; that if a man wants to prove with his head the ideas of the people of old, moral intuitions simply disappear; science has silenced them. Human beings even when receptive are no longer capable of receiving moral intuitions. To be consis tent, one would have had to become a kind of Spengler , and to say: — There are no moral intuitions; man in future will have no alternative but gradually to wither up — perhaps as king one's grandfather: “Have you heard that there were once moral intuitions, moral influences?” And the grandfather would answer: “One would have to search the libraries; at second or third-hand one might still glean some knowledge of moral intuitions but no lon ger from actual experience.” So there is no alternative but to wither up and become senil e, not to have youth any more. — That would have been consistent. But people did not dare , for consistency was not an outstanding quality of the dawning age of the intel lect. Indeed, there were many things that one did not dar e! If a judgment were pronounced it was only half given, as in the case of du Bois-R eymond [a leading German physiologist at the turn of the nineteenth century] who delivered a speech about the boundaries to the knowledge of Nature. He said that supernaturalism c ould not be mentioned in connection with natural science, for supernaturalism was faith and not knowledge. Science stops short at the supernatural — and nothing further was said by him on the subject. If mentioned, people got excited and said that this was no longer science; consistency was not a characteristic of the century then ending. So, on one hand, there was the alternative of withe ring. The Spiritual passes over gradually into the life of soul, the life of soul i nto the physical. As a result, after some decades, souls would only have been able to ferret out antiquated moral impulses. After some years, not only the thirty-year-olds but also the twenty-year-olds would have been going about with bald heads, and the fifteen-year-o lds with grey hair! This is a figurative way of speaking, but Spenglerism would have become an impulse carried into practice. That was one alternative. The other alternative was to become fully conscious of the following: With the loss of the old intuitions we are facing Nothingness. What can be done? In this Nothingness to seek the “All”! Out of this very Nothingness try to find something that is not given, but which we ourselves must strenuously work for. This was no lo nger possible with passive powers of the past, but only with the strongest powers of cog nition of this age: with the cognitional powers of pure thinking. For in acts of pure thinki ng, this thinking goes straight over into the will. You can observe and think, without exerti ng your will. You can carry out experiments and think: it does not pass right over into the will. You can do this without much effort. Pure thinking, by which I mean the unf olding of primary, original activity, requires energy. There the lightning-flash of will must strike directly into the thinking"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"itself. But the lightning-flash of will must come f rom each single individual. Courage was needed to call upon this pure thinking which become s pure will; it arises as a new faculty — the faculty of drawing out of the human individuali ty moral impulses which have to be worked for and are no longer given in the form of t he old impulses. Intuitions must be called up that are strenuously worked for. Today wh at man works for in his inner being is called “phantasy.” Thus in this present age which h as, apart from this, silenced inner work, moral impulses for the future must be produced out of moral phantasy, moral Imagination; the human being had to be shown the way from merely poetical, artistic phantasy, to a creative moral Imagination. The old intuitions were always given to groups. The re is a mysterious connection between primal revelation and human groups. It was always to groups of human beings in association that the old intuitions were given. The new intuitions must be produced in the sphere of each single, individual human soul; in ot her words, each single human being must be made the source of his own morality. This m ust be brought forth through the intuitions out of the Nothingness by which man is c onfronted. That was the only possibility left, if as an honest man one was not willing to turn to a kind of Spenglerism — and to work in the Spengler w ay is far from alive. It was a question of finding a living reality out of the Nothingness which confronted men, and it goes without saying that at first one could only make a beginnin g. For a creative power in the human being had to be called upon, the creation, as it we re, of an inner man within the outer man. In earlier times the outer man received moral impul ses from outside. Now the human being has to create an inner man and with this inne r man there came, or will come, the new moral intuition. So, out of the times themselves th ere had to be born a kind of Philosophy of Spiritual Activity — something that must inevita bly be in sharp opposition to the times. Let us complete this survey of the condition of the soul of modern man by considering another aspect. You see, as a preparation for intel lectualism in western civilization, the consciousness of man's pre-earthly existence had fo r a long time been wiped out. Western civilization had lost it in very early times. So th at in the West there was not this consciousness: “When I issue from the embryonic sta te of physical development something unites itself with me, something that descends from the heights of spirit and soul and permeates this physical earth-being.” Now in this connection the following presents itsel f quite clearly to our vision. I have already given you a picture to elucidate it. I said that when we look at a corpse we know that it cannot have its form through the forces of nature, but must be the remains of a living human being. It would be foolish to speak about the human form as if it were itself something living. We must go back to what was the l iving human being. In the same way, looked at impartially, man's intellectual thinking presents itself as dead. People naturally will say: “Prove this for us.” It proves itself in the very beholding and the kind of proofs necessary for the side issues are indeed available. But to demonstrate it I would have to go into a good deal of philosophy and this lies outsid e the scope of our present task. To anyone looking at it without prejudice, intellectual think ing, out of which our whole modern civilization flows, bears the same relation to livi ng thinking as the corpse to the living human being. Just as the corpse is derived from the living man, so the thinking we have today is derived from the living thinking of an ear lier time. But upon sound reflection I"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"must say to myself: “This dead thinking must have o riginated in a living thinking which was there before birth. The physical organism is the to mb of the living thinking, and the receptacle of dead thinking.” But the strange fact is that during the first two p eriods of human life, up to the sixth, seventh or eighth years, to the end of the change o f teeth, and then further, up to the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth years — that is t o say, to the age of puberty — the human being has a thinking not yet entirely dead; but in process of dying. It was only living thinking in pre-earthly existence. During the first two periods of life it comes to the point of dying, and for modern man, since the first third of the fifteenth century, thinking is quite dead by the time of puberty. It is then the corpse of living thinking. It was not always so in the evolution of mankind. If we go back before the fifteenth century, it becomes evident that thinking still was something living. There exi sted livingly the kind of thinking which human beings today do not like because they feel as if ants were swarming in their brain. They do not like it when something is really alive within them. They want their head to behave in a quiet and comfortable way. And the thinking in it, too, should take a peaceful course so that all one needs is to help things along with the laws of logic. But pure think ing — that is just as if an ant-heap were let loose in one's head, and that, people say, is n ot as it should be. At the beginning of the fifteenth century the human being was still able to endure living thinking. I am not saying this in order to criticize; that would be out-of-pl ace, just as out-of-place as to criticize a cow because she is no longer a calf. It would have been the greatest disaster for humanity if this had not happened. There had to be human beings who could not endure having an ant-heap in their head! For what was dead had to be brought to life again in a different way. And so it came about after the middle of the fiftee nth century that human beings inwardly experienced a dead thinking once puberty w as passed. They were filled out with the corpse of thinking. Go really deeply and seriou sly into this idea and you will understand that it is only since that time that an inorganic natural science could arise, because the human being began to grasp purely inorg anic laws. Now for the first time man could grasp what is dead in the way striven for sin ce Galileo and Copernicus. The living had first to die inwardly. When man was still inwardly alive in his thinking, he could not grasp the dead in an external way for the living kind of knowledge imparted itself to what was external. Natural science became increasingly pure science and nothing more, and this continued until, at the end of the nineteenth centu ry, it was well-nigh only mathematics. That was the ideal towards which it strove — it str ove to be Phoronomy, a kind of system of pure mechanics. So, in the modern age, man began more and more to m ake what is dead into the actual object of knowledge. That was the whole aim. This l asted for some centuries; evolution took this direction. Men of genius like de Lamettri e, for example, anticipated the idea that the human being was really a machine. Yes, the huma n being who only wants to grasp what is dead avails himself of what is merely a machine within him, of what is dead within him. And this makes the development of natural science e asy for modern man. For his thinking is dead by the time of puberty, whereas in earlier days he had God-given intuitions; thinking preserved the forces of growth within itse lf far beyond puberty. In later times,"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"l iving thinking was lost; human beings in later life learnt nothing more; they simply repeated mechanically what they had assimilated in earlier youth. You see, this suited the old, who held the control of culture in their hands: to comprehend a dead world with their dead thinking. O n this dead thinking, science can be founded, but with it the young can never be taught and educated. And why? Because up to puberty the young preserve the livingness of thinki ng, in an unconscious way. And so, in spite of all the thought given today to principles of education, if rigidified objective science which comprehends only what is dead becomes the tea cher of the living, the youthful feel it like a thorn in the flesh. This thorn enters their heart and they have to tear out from their heart what is living. Many still overlook what has had to come about out of the depths of human evolution: a definite cleavage between young and old. And this cleavage is due to the fact that the young cannot allow the dead thorn to be thrust into their living heart — the thorn which the head produces out of intellectualis m. The young demand the livingness that can only come out of the Spirit as the result of strenuous effort by the individual. We are making a beginning in the sphere of moral intui tions. A beginning has been made in what I have tried to p resent in my Philosophy of Spiritual Activity in regard to this purely spiritual matter — for su ch are moral intuitions, striven for by the human individuality. Because one has dared to open one's mouth while others were saying that nothing should be said — the powers which ordained that one should be stopped from speaking of moral i ntuitions will themselves be silenced. And so I called upon the living, the purely Spiritu al Science is dead. Science cannot make what is living flow from the mouth. And without thi s one cannot build on it. One must appeal to an inner livingness, and so begin to seek in the right way. The divine lies precisely in the appeal to the original, moral, spiritual int uitions. But if one has once grasped the spiritual then one can unfold the forces which enab le one to grasp the Spiritual in wider spheres of cosmic existence. And that is the straig ht path from moral intuitions to other spiritual contents. In my book Knowledge of the Higher Worlds , I have tried to show that knowledge of the supersensible worlds is built up gradually o ut of Imaginative, Inspired and Intuitive experience. If we look at outer Nature, we reach fi rst Imagination, then Inspiration, and lastly Intuition. In the moral world it is differen t. If in that world we reach picture- consciousness, Imaginations as such, then with Imag inations of Nature we have at the same time developed the faculty for moral intuitions. Al ready at the first stage we acquire what, in the other sphere, is not attained until the thir d stage. In the moral world, intuition follows immediately upon outer perception. In the w orld of Nature, however, there are two intermediate stages. So that if, in the moral world one speaks of intuitions not in mere phrases but honestly, truthfully, one simply cannot do otherwise than recognize these intuitions as being purely spiritual. But then one must work on to discover other realms of the Spirit. For qualitatively one has grasped in mo ral Intuition the same as the evolution of the natural world, filled with content by a book su ch as Occult Science . But, my dear friends, we must proceed as follows. O n the one hand, we must acknowledge that outer science by its very nature c an only comprehend what is material; hence perception of the material is not only materi alism but also phenomenalism. On the other, we must work to bring back life into what ha s been made into dead thinking by"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"natural science. Thus certain Bible words become alive on a higher l evel. I do not want to intersperse what I say in a sentimental way with words from the Bible but only to elucidate things for our better mutual understanding. Why is it that today we no longer have any real phi losophies? It is because thinking, as I have described it, has died; when based merely upon dead thinking, philosophies are dead from the very outset. They are not alive. And if lik e Bergson one seeks in philosophy for something living, nothing comes of it because, alth ough spasmodic efforts are made, one cannot lay hold of the living. To grasp the living means first to attain vision. What we need to reach the living is what after our fifteenth yea r we can add to what has worked within us before our fifteenth year. This is not disturbed by our intellect. What works within us, a spontaneous, living wisdom — we must learn to carry this over into the dead thinking. Dead thinking must be permeated with forces of grow th and with reality. For this reason — not out of sentimentality — I want to refer to the words. from the Bible: “Except ye become as little children ye cannot enter the Kingdom of H eaven.” For it is always the Kingdom of Heaven that one is seeking. But if one does not become like the child before puberty, one cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Childlikeness, youthfulness, must be brought into dead thinking. T hereby it becomes alive, it comes once more to intuitions; thus we learn to speak out of t he primal wisdom of the child. Out of a science of language such as Fritz Mauthner has writ ten, moral intuitions not only become dumb, but actually all talk about the world is sile nced. People ought to stop talking about the world because Mauthner proves that all talk abo ut the world consists only of words and words are incapable of expressing reality! Such thinking has made its appearance only since th e first third of the nineteenth century. But supposing our words and concepts not o nly meant something but had real existence. Then indeed they would not be transparen t; then, like clouded lenses before our eyes, they would conceal what is material; because they are realities they would hide the world from us. Something splendid would be made of man had he concepts and words which signify something in themselves! He would hav e been held fast by them. But concepts and words must be transparent so that we m ay reach things through them. It is imperative when the desire is almost universal to s ilence all talk about reality, that we learn to speak a new language. In this sense we must return to childhood and learn a new language. The language we learn in the first years of childhood gradually bec omes dead, because it is permeated by dead intellectual concepts. We must quicken it to n ew life. We must find something that strikes into what we are thinking, just as when we learnt to speak an impulse arose in us out of the unconscious. We must find a science that is alive. We should consider it a matter of course that the thinking which reached its apex in the last third of the nineteenth century silences our moral intuitions. We must lear n to open our mouth by letting our lips be moved by the Spirit. Then we shall become childr en again, that is to say, we shall carry childhood on into our later years. And that we must do. If a youth movement wants to have truth and not only phraseology, then such a movemen t is imbued of necessity with the longing for the human mouth to be opened by the Spi rit, a longing for the quickening of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"human speech by the Spirit which wells forth from t he individual. As a first step, individual moral intuitions must be brought out of the human i ndividuality; we shall see how as a result, the true Science of the Spirit, which makes all Anthropology into Anthroposophy, is born."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Younger Generation Younger Generation: Lecture VI V I IN THE ways you want to be active during your stay here, many of you are thinking above all about the question of education. Not so much, p erhaps, about education in the sense of ordinary school pedagogy but because we are living in an age when many new impulses must come into the evolution of mankind. There is a tendency to think that the attitude of the older towards the younger generation must assum e a different character, and thence comes the thought of education. The fundamental cha racter of the age is considered as having to do with education. In saying this I want to describe an impression whi ch, I believe, may be noticed in many of you. It seems to me important that when anyone l ooks at his epoch, he should not only bear in mind the generation now young, entering the century in full youth, and its relation to the older generation that has, in the way I have described, carried over something from the last third of the nineteenth century, but one m ust also consider: What will be the attitude of this young generation towards the comin g generation, to the generation which cannot, as the first, after the last third of the n ineteenth century, maintain the same attitude to Nothingness that I have described? For the comin g generation will not have what the present age has given to the younger generation thr ough opposition towards their elders, namely enthusiasm — more or less indefinite, but ne vertheless enthusiasm. What will further evolve will have much more the character of a longing, of an undefined yearning, than was the case among those who derived their ent husiasm from a mood of opposition against the traditional. And here we must look still more deeply into the hu man soul than I have done up to now. I have already shown that in the evolution in the W est, consciousness of the pre-earthly existence of the soul has been lost. If we take the religious conceptions which are closest to the development of the human heart in the West duri ng the past centuries, we can but say: For a long time existence before the descent into a physical earthly body has been lost to man's sight. Form an idea of how utterly different it is when one is permeated with the consciousness that something has come down from div ine-spiritual worlds into the physical human body, has united itself with the physical hum an body. If nothing of this consciousness exists there is quite a different fee ling, especially about the growing child. The growing child, when looked at with this conscio usness, reveals from its very first breath, or even before, what is being manifested by the spiritual world. Something is revealed from day to day, from week to week, from y ear to year. Observed in this way, the child becomes a riddle which one approaches in quit e a different way from what is possible when one thinks one is confronting a being whose ex istence begins with birth or conception, and who, as is said nowadays, develops from this starting point, from this point of germination."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"We shall understand one another still better if I c all to your attention how with this there is connected the keynote of the riddle of the whole world. You know that in former days this fundamental feeling about the world-riddl e was expressed in the paradigm: “Man, know thyself!” This saying, “Man, know thyself “is about the only saying which can hold its own against the objections always arising when a so lution of the world-riddle is broached. Now I will say something rather paradoxical. Suppos e somebody found what he might call the solution of the world-riddle. What would there remain to do after the moment when this world-riddle was solved? Man would lose all fr eshness of spontaneous striving; all livingness in striving would cease. It would indeed be comfortless to have to admit that the world-riddle has been solved by means of a cognitio nal method. All that is necessary is to look in some book or other; there the solution is g iven. A great many people think thus about the solution o f the world-riddle. They consider the world-riddle a system of questions that must be answered by explanations or something of the kind. One feels benumbed at the thought that a solution of the world-riddle could somewhere be given in this way, that the solution c ould actually be studied! It is a terrible, a horrible thought; all life is frozen by it. But what lies in the words “Man, know thyself!” exp resses something quite different. It really says: Man! look around you at the world; the world is full of riddles, full of mystery, and man's slightest movement points in the widest s ense to cosmic mysteries. — Now one can indicate precisely where all these riddles are solved. There is quite a short formula for the indication. We can say: All the riddles of the world are solved in man — again in the very widest sense. Man himself, moving as a living being through the world — he is the solution of the world-riddle! Let him gaze at the s un and experience one of the cosmic mysteries. Let him look into his own being and know : Within thyself lies the solution of this cosmic mystery. “Man, know thyself and thou knowest the world I.” But this way of expressing the formula is an intima tion that no answer is final. Man is the solution of the world-riddle but to know the hu man being, we have what is infinite before us and so imbued with life that we never rea ch an end. We know that we bear the solution of the world-riddle within ourselves. But we know too that we shall never come to an end of what there is to search for in ourselves. From such a formula we only know that we are not given out of the universe abstract quest ions to be answered in an abstract way, but that the whole universe is a question and the h uman being an answer. We know that the question of the nature of the universe has reso unded from times primeval until today, that the answer to these world-questions has resoun ded from human hearts, but that the questioning will go on resounding endlessly, that h uman beings must continue on into the distant future to learn to live their answer. We ar e not directed in a pedantic way to what might be found in a book but to the human being him self. Yet in the sentence, “Man, know thyself!” there sounds over to us from ancient time s when school, church and centers of art were all united in the Mysteries, something which p oints to what has not been learnt from formulae, but from that book about the world which can be deciphered, but deciphered only through endless activity. And the name of this book about the world is “Man.” If the full import of what I put before you yesterd ay is grasped, through such a change in the experiencing of knowledge, through the attit ude we have to knowledge, the spark of"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"life will strike into the whole nature of man.

If we picture the moral evolution of man up to the time when it became problematic, up to the first third of the fifteenth century, we fin d that the most diverse impulses were necessary to follow what I characterized yesterday as God-given commandments. When we imagine the driving forces prevalent among various peoples in different epochs, we find a great range of inner impulses arising like instinct s, depending on particular conditions of life. One could make an interesting study of how th ese impulses to obey the old moral intuitions originate, how they grow out of the fami ly, out of the racial stock, out of man's inclination towards the other sex, out of the neces sity to live together in communities, out of man's pursuit of his own advantage. But in the same way as we were obliged to call atte ntion yesterday to how old moral intuitions have lived themselves out in historical evolution, so the impulses mentioned no longer contain an impelling force for the human bei ng They cannot contain it if the self-acquired moral intuitions, of which I spoke ye sterday, have to appear in man; if single individuals are challenged in the world-evolution o f humanity, on the one hand, to find for themselves moral intuitions by dint of the labor of their own souls, and, on the other to acquire the inner strength to live according to the se moral intuitions. And then it dawns upon us that the old moral impulses will increasing ly take a different course. We see emerging in the depths of the soul, although misjudged and misunderstood today by the majority of civilized humanity, two mo ral impulses of supreme importance. If attempts are made to interpret them, confused ideas usually result. If people want to put them into practice, they do not know as a rule what to do with them. Nonetheless they are arising: in the inner life of man the impulse of mo ral love, and outwardly, in the intercourse between human beings, the moral impulse of confidence . Now the degree of strength in which moral love will be needed in the immediate future for all moral life, was not necessary in the past — not just in this form. Certainly, of former times too one could say that the words, “Joy and lo ve are the pinions which bear man to great deeds,” are true. But if we speak truly and n ot in mere phrases, we must say: That joy and that love which fired human beings to do this o r that were only a metamorphosis of the impulses described before. Great and pure love, wor king from within outwards, will have in future to give man wings to fulfil his moral intuit ions. Those human beings will feel themselves weak and lacking in will, in face of mor al intuitions, who do not experience the fire of love for what is moral springing from the d epths of their souls, when through their moral intuitions they confront the deed to be accom plished. There you see how in our times we have a parting of the ways! It becomes evident by contrasting the atavistic elements of the older age which play over in many ways into the present with what is living within us like the earl y flush of dawn. You will often have heard those fine words Kant wrote about duty: “Duty! Subl ime and mighty Name, you embrace nothing that charms and require only submission” — and so forth. The sternest terms in which to characterize duty! Here the content of dut y stands as a moral intuition imparted from outside, and the human being confronts this mo ral intuition in such a way that he has to submit to it. The moral experience when he thus submits himself is that no inner satisfaction is gained from obedience to duty; only the cold statement: “I must perform my"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"duty” remains. You know Schiller's answer to Kant's definition of duty: “Gerne dien' ich den Freunden, doch tu' ich es leid er mit Neigung, Und so wurmt es mich oft, dass ich nicht tugendhaft bin.” (I serve my friend gladly, but unfortunately I do i t with inclination, and so it often worries me that I am not virtuous.) Thus Schiller retorts ironically to this categorica l imperative. You see, over against the so-called categorical imp erative, as it comes down from former times out of old moral impulses, there stand s the summons to mankind, out of the depths of his soul, evermore to unfold love for wha t is to become action and deed. For however often in future there may resound: “Submit to duty, to what brings you nothing that will please” — it will be of no avail. Just as little as a man of sixty can behave like a baby can we live at a later age in a way suitable t o an earlier epoch. Perhaps that would please people better. But that is of no account. Th e important thing is what is necessary and possible for the evolution of humanity. We can simp ly not discuss whether what Kant, as a descendant of very ancient times, has said should b e carried on into the future. It cannot be carried on, because humanity has developed beyond i t, developed in such a way that action out of love must give mankind the impulse for the f uture. On the one hand we are led to the conception of eth ical individualism, on the other, to the necessity of knowing that this ethical individu alism must be borne on the love arising from perception of the deed to be accomplished. Thu s it is, from man's subjective viewpoint. From the aspect of the social life, the matter pres ents itself differently. There are people today in whom there no longer echoes the voice of p rogressive evolution; because they accept all kinds of outside opinions they say: “Yes , but if you try to found morality on the individual, you will upset the social life.” But su ch a statement is meaningless. It is just as sensible as if someone were to say: if in Stuttgart it rains a certain number of times in three months, Nature will ruin some particular crop on th e land. — If one is conscious of a certain responsibility towards knowledge one cannot imagine anything more empty. As humanity is developing in the direction of individu alism, there is no sense in saying that ethical individualism upsets the community. It is r ather a question of seeking those forces by which man's evolution can progress; this is nece ssary if man is to develop ethical individualism, which holds the community together a nd fills it with real life. Such a force is confidence — confidence between one human being and another. Just as in our inner being we must call upon love for an et hical future, so we must call upon confidence in relation to men's intercourse with ea ch other. We must meet the human being so that we feel him to be a world-riddle, a w alking world-riddle. Then we shall learn in the presence of every human being to unfold feel ings which draw forth confidence from the depths of our soul. Confidence in an absolutely real sense, individual, unique confidence, is hardest to wring from the human soul . But without a system of education, a cultural pedagogics, which is directed towards conf idence, civilization can progress no"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"further. In future mankind will have to realize thi s necessity to build up confidence in social life; they will also have to experience the tragedy when this confidence cannot develop in the proper way in the human soul. Oh my dear friends, what men have ever felt in the depths of their souls when they have been disappointed by a human being on whom they had relied, all such feelings will in future be as nothing compared with the tragedy when , with an infinitely deepened feeling of trust, human beings will tragically experience d isillusionment in their fellow men. It will be the bitterest thing, not because men have never been disappointed, but because the feeling of confidence and disillusionment will be i nfinitely deepened in future; because one will build to such a degree in the soul upon the jo y of confidence and the pain of the inevitable mistrust. Ethical impulses will penetrat e to depths of the soul where they spring directly from the confidence between man and man. Just as love will fire the human hand, the human ar m, so that from within it draws the strength to do a deed, so from without there will f low the mood of confidence in order that the deed may find its way from the one human being to the other. The morality of the future will have to be grounded on the free moral l ove arising from the depths of the human soul; future social action will have to be st eeped in confidence. For if one individuality is to meet another in a moral way, ab ove all an atmosphere of confidence will be necessary. So we anticipate an ethics, a conception of moralit y that will speak little of the ethical intuitions of old but will emphasize how a human be ing must develop from childhood so that there may be awakened in him the power of mora l love. Much will have to be given in the pedagogics of the future to the growing generat ion by teachers and educators through what educates effectively without words. In educati on and teaching there will have to be imparted much of that knowledge which is not an abs tract indication of how man consists of this or that, but which leads us over to the oth er human being in such a way that we can have the proper confidence in him. Knowledge of man, but not a knowledge that makes us cold towards our fellow-men but which fills us with confidence — this must become t he very fibre of future education. For we have to give weight again, but in a new way, to what once was taken seriously but is so no longer in the age of intellectualism. If you go back to Greece, you will find that the do ctor in his medical art, for example, felt extraordinarily akin to the priest, and priest s felt themselves akin to the doctor. Such an attitude can be seen dimly, confusedly in the perso nality of Paracelsus who has been, and still is, so little understood. Today we relegate t o the sphere of religion the abstract instruction which leads away from real life. For in religious instruction we are told what man is without his body, and so on — in a way that is singularly foreign to life. Over against this stands the opposite pole in civilization, wher e everything brought forth by our own time is kept far from the realm of religion. Who today sees any trace of a religious act in heal ing, for instance, an act in which permeation by the spirit plays a part? Paracelsus s till had a feeling for this. For him, the religious life was such that it entered into the sc ience of healing. It was a branch of the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"religious life. This was so in olden times. The hum an being was a totality: what he had to perform in the service of mankind was permeated by religious impulses. In quite another way, for we must strive to gain moral intuitions th at are not God-given but born by our own efforts, — life must again be permeated by a religi ous quality. But first and foremost it must be made evident in the sphere of education. Confide nce between one human being and another — the great demand of the future — must per meate social life. If we ask ourselves — What is the most essential qu ality to be a moral human being in the future? — We can only answer: “You must have co nfidence in the human being.” But when a child comes into the world, that is to say, when the human being comes out of pre-earthly existence and unites with his physical body in order to use it as an instrument on earth between birth and death — when the human b eing confronts us as a child and reveals his soul to us, what must we bring to him i n the way of confidence? Just as surely as the child, from its first movement on earth, is a h uman being, yet the confidence we bring him is different from the confidence we bring to an adult. When we meet the child as teacher or as a member of the older generation, thi s confidence is transformed in a certain respect. The child comes into earthly existence fro m a pre-earthly world of soul and spirit. We observe, revealing itself in a wonderful way fro m day to day permeating the physical out of the world of soul and spirit, what may be ca lled in the modern sense of the word — the divine. We need again the divine which leads the human bein g out of pre-earthly into the present, as through his bodily nature he is led onw ards in earthly existence. When we speak of confidence between men in the moral sphere, and apply it to education, we must specialize and say: — “We confront the child who ha s been sent down to us by the divine- spiritual Powers — and for whom we should be the so lvers of all riddles — we confront the child with confidence in God.” Yes, in face of the child, confidence in man becomes confidence in God. And a future will have to come i n the evolution of humanity in which what weaves even in a more neutralized form from ma n to man, will assume a religious coloring in relation to the child or to young peopl e generally who have to be guided into life. There we see how through actual life, morality is t ransformed back into religiousness, into a religiousness that expresses itself directly in everyday life. In olden times all moral life was a special part of the religious life, for in the commandments of religion moral commandments were given at the same time. Humanity has passed through the epoch of abstractio n; now, however, we must again enter the epoch of the concrete. We must feel once again how the moral becomes the religious. And in future the moral deeds of educati on and instruction will have to shape themselves in a modern sense into what is religious . For pedagogy, my dear friends, is not merely a technical art. Pedagogics is essentially a special chapter in the moral sphere of man. Only he who finds education within the realm o f morality, within the sphere of ethics, discovers it in the right way. What I have describe d here as a specifically religious shade of morality, receives its right coloring if we say: — “The riddle of life stands before us as an enigma. The solution of the riddle lies in Man.” — And there indeed it does lie. But anyone who teaches has to work unceasingly, in a living wa y, at the solution of this riddle. When we learn to feel how in education we are working uncea singly at the solution of the world-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"riddle, we take our place in the world quite differ ently from what would have been the case had we sought for solutions merely by means of head knowledge. In regard to the feeling about Education with which you may have come here, the important thing is to carry away with you into the world this special aspect of pedagogics. This feeling will enable you to stand in the world and not only lead you to asking: — How profound is the tragedy of the young who had to fol low the old? — You will also ask, looking into the future: “What living forces must I release in myself to look rightly upon those who are coming after me?” For they in turn wi ll look back to those who were once there. A youth movement in whatever form, if it con siders life in a fully responsible way, must have a Janus head; it must not only look at th e demands the young make on the old, but also be able to look at the still undefined dem ands raging around us with tremendous power — demands which the coming youth will make up on us. Not only opposition against the old, but a creative looking forward, is the right guiding thought for a true youth movement. Opposition may, to begin with, have acted as a stimulus to enthusiasm. The power of deed will only be bestowed by the will to create, the will to do creative work within the present evoluti on of humanity."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Younger Generation Younger Generation: Lecture VII VII YESTERDAY I pointed out how the longing of the youn g today is permeated by something Janus-headed. Certainly, this appears to be permeat ed by enthusiasm which comes from opposition. But however strongly, at the beginning o f the century, this feeling breathed of the present, whoever has now had experience of it no longer finds the opposition in its full measure. Many do not yet admit this impartially, pa rticularly among the young themselves. Yet it indicates something very significant. The ge neration which at the beginning of the twentieth century confronted world-evolution in suc h a way that “facing Nothingness” was a most profound experience — this generation was qu ite new upon the scene in human evolution. But this feeling must reckon with many d isappointments prepared out of its own depths. The full spread of the sails as it was some twenty years ago is no longer there. Not only the terrible event of World War I has deflated thes e sails, but certain experiences working outward from within have arisen in young people and modified their original feeling. One such experience became evident, at the beginning of the twentieth century, in the feelings of those who had grown older in years but were not inwardly old. It was not clearly expressed in words, but in other than the literal w ords there was in the young something which pointed to a responsive tiredness. Here I am placing before you an idea difficult to d escribe accurately, because what I really mean is only fully intelligible to those who have experienced the youth movement with a certain awakeness, whereas a great part of h umanity has been asleep to this youth movement. When one speaks to people in the way I hav e during the past days, it is as if one were talking of something quite foreign to them, so mething they have slept through and towards which even today they adopt an extraordinari ly sleepy attitude. Responsive tiredness, I called it. In ordinary life organic existence requires not only activity but also after accomplished work the accom panying state of tiredness. We must not only be able to get tired, we must also from time t o time be able to carry tiredness around within us. To pass our days in such a way that we g o to sleep at night simply because it is customary to do so, is not healthy; it is certainly less healthy than to have the due amount of tiredness in the evening and for this to lead in the normal way into sleep. So too, the capacity to become tired-out by the phenomena meeti ng us in life is something that must be. When education, for example, has been discussed, I have often heard it said that there must be an education which makes learning a game fo r children; school must be all joy for the child. Yes, those who speak like this should ju st try how they can make school all joy for the children, so that the children laugh all the ti me, so that learning is play and at the same time they are learning something. This is the very best possible educational principle for ensuring that nothing at all is learnt."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The right thing is for teachers to be able to handl e what does not give the child joy, but perhaps a good deal of toil and woe, in such a way that the child as a matter of course submits to it. It is very easy to say what should b e given to the child. But childhood can be injured through learning being made into a game. Fo r it is essential that we should also in our life of soul be made tired by certain things — that is to say, things should create a responsive tiredness. One must express it thus, tho ugh it sounds pedantic. Tiredness existed among the young in earlier times, too, when they had to strive towards something living, a certain science, a certain kind of knowled ge. I mean times when those possessing a certain amount of knowledge were still able to stand before the young, who wanted to acquire it, as an embodied ideal. Tiredness certain ly existed even then. My dear friends, there may be some here who take th e above statement with mild scepticism. There are many people today who would t ake it with scepticism, for when it is claimed that those who knew something stood as a ki nd of ideal for those anxious to learn, this idea appears to many as unrealizable. For, at the present time, it is almost incredible that anybody should be regarded as a kind of embodi ed knowledge, embodied science, that is striven for as we strive for a personal ideal. Yet, leaving out ancient times, this feeling was st ill present in a high degree even in the later Middle Ages. Those wonderful and inspiring fe elings of reverence, permeating life with real recreative forces for the soul in the lat er Middle Ages, have to a great extent been lost. And because the urge that once existed was no longer there, the young could no longer get tired from what they were destined to experienc e. To give this concrete expression I should have to say: Science — I mean science as it was actually pursued, not what frequently goes by the name of science — could be s tored up, something that is not in the heads of human beings but in the libraries. Science gradually was not really wanted any more. Hence it did not make people tired. There was no feeling of being overcome by an urge for it; it no longer made one tired. There was no longer any possibility of getting tired from a knowledge that was acquired with difficulty. And from this, what permeated the young, at the tur n of the nineteenth century, derived a quite special character — the character of the li fe-force in a human being who goes to bed at night before he is tired and keeps turning and t wisting about without knowing why. I do not want to imply anything derogatory, for I am not of the opinion that these forces, which are there at night in the human being when he turns and twists about in bed because he is not tired, are unhealthy forces. I am not calling t hem unhealthy. They are quite healthy life-forces, but they are not in their proper place ; and so it was, with those forces which worked in the young at the turn of the nineteenth c entury. They were thoroughly healthy forces, but there was nothing to give them directio n. The young had no longer the urge to tire these forces by what was told them by their el ders. But forces cannot be present in the world without being active, and so, at the time ref erred to, innumerable forces yearned for activity and had no guiding line. And these forces appeared, for example, in the acad emic youth. And then one noticed things which I have indicated during these lectures , but which must receive more careful consideration if we want to understand ourselves."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Since the first third of the fifteenth century, all man's striving for knowledge has, out of intellectuality, taken on a character pre-eminently adapted to science, which hardly touches the human being at all. People no longer fe el how the human element holds sway in writings of the twelfth or thirteenth century, f or instance. This does not imply that we have to return to the twelfth or thirteenth century , to implicit belief in all we find there. We shall certainly not comply with the demands of cert ain churches in this direction. But because of the indifference with which people s tudy nowadays what is to be found in a chapter of modern biology — or of some other s ubject — it is impossible to understand what Albertus Magnus wrote. In that way we do not g et to know what he wrote at all. We must take the book and sit down to it as if we were sitting down in front of another human being, because what he says cannot be taken with in difference, or objectively as one says; the inner being, the life of soul, is engaged, it r ises and fails, and is quickened to movement. The life of soul is at work when we read even the d riest chapter written at that time, by an Albertus Magnus, for instance. Quite apart from the fact that in these writings there is still the power of pictorial expression for what appear ab stract things, there is always something in the general ideas which gives us a feeling of mo vement that we might be working with spade and shovel — from the point of view of our lif e of soul, that is — everything is brought into splendid human activity; through the p ictures we are given we sense that the one who possesses this knowledge has full confidence in what he is imparting. For such people it was not a matter of indifference if they discovered something of which they thought that in the eyes of God it could be either pleasing or displeasing. What a difference there is between the picture given, let us say, by Albertus Magnus, as the great scholar of the Middle Ages, and one of the eminent minds of the nineteenth century, as, for example, Herbart — one could name others but Herbar t had a great influence on education up to the last third of the nineteenth century — wh oever realizes what a difference there is must see it like this: Albertus Magnus seems to com e before us as a kind of fiery luminous cloud. What he does when he devotes himself to knowl edge is something that lights up in him or becomes dim. We feel him as it were in a fie ry, luminous cloud, and gradually we enter this fire, because if one possesses the facul ty of getting inside such a soul, even if for the modern soul it is antiquated, in steeping onese lf in what is moral, writing about it, speaking about it, or only studying it, it is not a matter of indifference whether in the eyes of a divine-spiritual Being one is sympathetic or a ntipathetic. This feeling of sympathy or antipathy is always present. On the other hand, if according to the objective sci entific method, Herbart discusses the five moral ideas: good-will, perfection, equity, ri ghts, retribution — well, here we have not a cloud which encircles us with warmth or cold but so mething that gradually freezes us to death, that is objective to the point of iciness. An d that is the mood that has crept into the whole nature of knowledge and reached its climax at the end of the nineteenth century. And so knowledge gradually became something to which people devoted themselves in a way that even outwardly was quite remarkable. It was only at the lecture-desk that one got to know those represented as men of knowledge. I do not know if others as old as myself have had similar experiences. But in the nin eties of last century I was always having cause for annoyance. At that time I used to be mixin g in all kinds of learned circles, and"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"there I had much reason to rejoice, and was eager t o discuss many questions. One could look forward to such conversations and say to onese lf: Now we shall be able to discuss, let us say, “the difference between epigenesis and evol ution” — and so on. Yes, one might begin like that but very soon one he ard: No, there is to be no “talking shop.” Anything that savored of talking shop was ta boo. The man who knew his subject was only heard from the platform and when he left it he was no longer the same person. He took the line of speaking about everything under th e sun except his own special subject. In short, life in science became so objective that thos e with a special subject treated this too very objectively, and wanted to be ordinary men when not obliged to deal with their subject. Other experiences of a similar kind could be relate d. I have said this just for the sake of elucidation. But I will tell you the real point in another way. We may find that the teacher hands on to the young things he has only half learn t. We find here or there, for example, those who teach standing before their class with a note-book, or even a printed book by someone else — for all I know, the note-book too may contain things written by other people, but I will not assume that — and boldly set ting to work to give his lesson out of this book. By such a procedure he is presupposing that t here is no supersensible world at all. How is it that people give their lessons from a note -book or some other book, thus presupposing that no supersensible world exists? Here too Nietzsche had one of his many interesting flashes of insight. He called attention to the fact that within every human being another is hidden. This is taken to be a poetic way of speaking, but it is no such thing. In every human being another is hidden! This hidden being is often much cleverer than the o ne to be seen. In the child, for example, this hidden being is infinitely wiser. He is a supe rsensible reality. He is there within the human being, and if we sit in front of a class of s ay, thirty pupils, and teach with the help of a book or a notebook, we may perhaps be able to tra in these thirty pupils to regard this, in their visible selves, as something natural, but — o f this we can be quite certain — all the thirty invisible human beings sitting there are jud ging differently. They say: “He is wanting to teach me something that he has first to read. I should like to know why I am expected to know what he is reading. There is no reason for me t o know what he is only now reading for himself. He doesn't know it himself, otherwise h e wouldn't be so uncertain. I am still very young and am expected to learn what he, who is so much older, doesn't know even yet and reads to me out of a book!” These things must be taken concretely. To speak of a supersensible world does not mean merely to lose oneself in phantastic mysticism and to talk of things which — I say this in inverted commas — are “hidden” from one; to spea k of supersensible worlds means in the face of life itself to speak about actual reali ties. We are speaking of actual realities when we speak as the thirty invisible children about the teacher of the thirty visible ones who perhaps on account of discipline were too timid to say this aloud. If we think it through, it does not seem so stupid; the statements of these th irty invisible, supersensible beings are, in fact, quite reasonable. Thus, we must realize that in the young individuali ty sitting at the feet of someone who is to teach or educate, much goes on that is entire ly hidden from outer perception. And that"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"was how there arose deep aversion to what came in th is way. For naturally one could not have a great deal of confidence in a man who faced the hidden being in one in such a way that this job of his had become as objective as the a pproach to knowledge generally at the end of the nineteenth century. So a deep antipathy was felt; one simply did not try to take in hand what should have carried one through life, and consequently could not get tired from it. There was no desire to have what would hav e made one tired. And nobody knew what to do with the forces which could have led to the tiredness. Now one could also meet on other ground those who we re in the youth movement at the turn of the nineteenth century. Often they were not young physically — mostly very old. They were to be met in movements like the theosophic al movement. Many were no longer young, yet had a feeling towards what contemporary knowledge gave them similar to the young. They did not want this knowledge, for it coul d no longer make them tired. Whereas the young, as the result of this incapacity to get tired, raged, — forgive the expression — many theosophists were looking in their theosophy f or a kind of opiate. For what is contained in theosophical literature is to a great extent a sleeping draught for the soul. People were actually lulling themselves to sleep. T hey kept the spirit busy — but look at the way in which they did so. By inventing the maddest allegories! It was enough to drive a sensitive soul out of its body to listen to the exp lanations given to old myths and sagas. And oh! what allegories, what symbols! Looked at from t he biology of the life of soul, it was sheer narcotics! It would really be quite good to d raw a parallel between the turning and twisting in bed after spending a day that has not b een tiring and the taking of a sleeping draught in order to cripple the real activity of th e Spirit. What I describe are not theories but moods of the a ge, and it is imperative to become familiar with these moods by looking from every ang le at what was there. This incapacity to get tired at the turn of the nineteenth century is extraordinarily significant. Yes, but this led to the impossibility of finding anything right, for human evolution had arrived at a point where people said with great enthusiasm: “We shall allow nothing to come to us from outside; we want to develop everything from within our own being. We want to wander through the world and wait until there comes out of our own inner being what neither parents, nor teachers, nor even the old traditions can give us any longer. We want to wait for the New to approach us.” My dear friends, ask those who have spoken in such a way whether this new thing has come to them, whether ready-prepared it has dropped into the laps of those who have had this great longing. Indeed the intoxication of thos e times is beginning in some degree to be followed by the “morning after” headache. My only ai m is to characterize, not to criticize. The first thing that arose was a great rejection, a rejection of something which was there, which man could not use for his innermost being. An d behind this great rejection there was hidden the positive — the genuine longing for somet hing new. But this genuine longing for what is new can be ful filled in no other way than by man permeating himself with something not of this earth . Not of this earth in the sense that when man only lets soul and body function as they d o, nothing can come with the power really to satisfy. The human being unwilling to tak e in anything is like a lung which finds no air to breathe. Certainly a lung which finds no air to breathe may first, before it dies, even if only for a moment, experience the greatest thirst f or air. But the lung cannot out of itself"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"quench this thirst for air; it has to allow for the air to come to it. In reality the young who honestly feel the thirst of which we have been spea king, cannot but long for something with which to be in harmony, that does not come only out of himself like the science that has grown old and is no longer wholesome for the soul to breathe in. That was felt in the first place but far too little that a new young science must be there, a new spiritual life, able once again to unite with t he soul. Now what belongs to present and future ages must lin k itself with older phenomena of human evolution. The difference consists in these o ld phenomena of human evolution arising from a life of soul that was full of pictur es and dream-like, whereas the life of soul we bear within us and towards which we are still str iving, must become fully conscious. But we must in many respects go back to older contents of the soul. Now I should like to turn your mind's eye to a const itution of the Spirit prevailing in old Brahmanism in the ancient East. The old Brahmin sch ools spoke of four means to knowledge on the path of life. And these four means for gaining knowledge are — well, it is difficult to give ancient thoughts in a suitable fo rm considering we are living not only centuries but thousands of years later — but, in or der to get somewhere near the mark, I will depict these four means to knowledge in the fol lowing way. First, there was that which hovered, as it were, midway between tradition and re membrance, something connected with the Sanscrit root smrti (s-mr-ti — Tradition, Remembrance.) which at present man only has as idea. But it can be described. Everyone knows what remembrance, personal remembrance is. These people did not connect certai n concepts with personal remembrance in the rigid way we do, where the idea I have here in mind was concerned. What they remembered out of their own childhood beca me one with what their fathers and grandfathers had told them. They did not distinguis h between what they themselves remembered and what they received through tradition . If you were to practise a more subtle psychology, you would notice that actually t hese things flow together in what lives in the soul of the child, because the child takes in a great deal that is based on tradition. The modern human being sees only that he acquired it as a child. The ancient Indian did not see this. He paid much more heed to its content, which did not lead him into his own childhood but to his father, grandfather and great- grandfather. Thus tradition and personal remembrance flowed into each other indistinguishably . That was the first means of acquiring knowledge. The second means for acquiring knowledge was what w e might describe as “being represented”, (not a “representation” as the word i s applied in ordinary intercourse today, but literally — an “appearing before the eyes”) — w hat we call “perception.” The third means to knowledge was what we might call thinking that aims at synthesis. Thus we could say: remembrance with tradition, obser vation, and the thinking that aims at synthesis. But a fourth means for acquiring knowledge was also taught with all clarity in ancient Brahmanism. This can be described by saying: Having something communicated by other human beings."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"So I ask you to notice that in ancient Brahmanism t radition was not identified with having something communicated by other human beings . This was a fourth means for the attainment of knowledge. Perhaps this will be cleare r if we link it up with what is tradition and at the same time of the nature of remembrance. Where tradition is concerned, the human being did not become conscious of the way in which it came to him, he was conscious only of the content. But in man's remembr ance he had in mind that it had been communicated to him by someone else. The fact of ha ving received something from others was an awakening force in knowledge itself. Today many of those who are true sons of the ninete enth century are shaking their heads, if we count this “what is told us by others” as one of the means of acquiring knowledge. A philosopher who dabbled in thinking tha t aimed at synthesis and regarded what he was told by others as a means to knowledge w ould never get through with his thesis nor be accepted as a university lecturer. At most he might become a theologian, for theology is judged in a different way. What is at t he bottom of all this? In olden times men understood the experience of having something kindl ed within them in mutual intercourse with another human being. They counted somebody els e telling them what they themselves did not know among the things needed for life. It wa s reckoned so emphatically as one of the factors necessary for life that it was consider ed equal to perception through eyes and ears. Today people will naturally have a different feelin g — that it is splendid for a human being to tell another what the other does not know, and the world calls for this. But it has nothing to do with the essence of things. What is e ssential is for observations and experiments to be made and for the results to be cl early expressed. The other has nothing to do with the essential nature of knowledge. Today it will be natural to feel this. But from the human standpoint it is not correct. It is part of life that man should be permeated in soul and spirit by what I described yesterday as a necessary factor of the social life, namely, by confidence. In this particular domain, confidenc e consists in what one human being tells another, thus becoming for the other a source of ex perience for soul and spirit. Confidence must above all things be evoked in the yo ung. Out of confidence there must be found that for which the young are thirsting. Ou r whole modern spiritual development has moved in the opposite direction. Even in theore tical pedagogics no value is attached any longer to the fact that a human being might hav e something he would like to tell another which the latter did not know. Theoretical p edagogics was thought out in such a way that as far as possible there was only presente d to the young what could be proved in front of them. But that could not be a comprehensiv e proof. In this regard people have remained at a very infantile stage. Pedagogy envisa ged: How can I give the children something under the assumption that they do not bel ieve me? How can I introduce a method which perceptibly proves? No wonder that ther e came the corresponding echo and that it was henceforth demanded of teachers: Yes, n ow prove that for me! And now what I am going to say may sound antiquated, my dear frien ds. But I do not feel it at all antiquated; I feel it as something really young, ev en as part of the youth movement. Today when someone stands there before a number of young people who are to be taught, it is as if there sounds towards him out of the young souls even before he is in their"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"presence: “Prove that for me, prove that for me; you have no right to ask us to believe you!” I feel it as tragic — and this is no criticism — th at the young should suffer from having been educated by the old so that they have no longer the ability to receive what is necessary for life. And so there arises a tremendous question, wh ich we shall be considering in the next few days. I should like to give you a graphic descr iption of it. Let us imagine the youth movement progressing and t aking hold of younger and younger human beings — finally mere infants. We sho uld then get an infant youth movement, and just as the later youth movement reject s the knowledge that can be given to it, so will the infants who ought still to be at th eir mothers' breasts, say: “We refuse it, we refuse to receive anything from outside. We don't w ant our mothers' milk any longer; we want to get everything out of ourselves!” What I have here presented as a picture is a burnin g question for the youth movement. For the young are really asking: “Where are we to o btain spiritual nourishment?” And the way in which they have asked hitherto has been very suggestive of this picture of the infants. And so in the coming days we shall conside r the question of “the source of life”, after which Faust was striving. The question I have put before you as a picture is intended to stimulate us to contribute towards a Solution, bu t a solution which may mean something for your perception, for your feeling, even for you r whole life."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Younger Generation Younger Generation: Lecture VIII VIII UP TO now we have given an outer description of wha t was experienced by those growing-up about the turn of the nineteenth century , by considering the trend of man's spiritual culture. Today, in order to find the brid ge to a true self-knowledge, we will study the human being more from within. When we consider the externals of spiritual evolution, especially in the West, we are led back to the firs t third of the fifteenth century; in an inward study we find ourselves led back to the four th post-Christian century. A date indicating some important moment would be the year 333 A.D., yet this date is of course only approximate. It is not a date from which to ma ke calculations, but as pointing approximately to weighty matters affecting a large proportion of European humanity. Let us look into the soul of a man who before this date lived into the culture of Southern Europe, or in certain districts of Northern Africa. These districts come into prominence when we try to gain an idea of what gave the tone t o the cultural life of the time. The souls of these human beings were still so constituted tha t they were conscious that human thought was not simply a head process, but that it was revealed, either directly to the individual, or, where the human being was not able to receive such revelation directly, through the confidential communication of other hum an beings. The prevalent feeling among the educated today — and among the uneducated — is that their thoughts are worked out in their own heads — this feeling did no t then exist. It was a period of actual transition. In the Middle East outstanding spiritua l personalities were concerned with how thoughts came to humanity from spiritual realms. In Southern Europe and in Northern Africa doubts crept in as to whether the human bein g possessed the faculty of receiving thoughts by revelation. These doubts were only fain t at first, there was still an overwhelming feeling: When I have a thought, this t hought has been put into me by a God either indirectly or transmitted by way of human he redity, that is, through tradition, not natural heredity. Thought can enter earthly evoluti on only as revelation. The first Westerners to feel strong doubts in this direction were those who had come from the Northern peoples and entered the civilizat ion of the South. They were of Germanic and Celtic blood and had moved with the va rious migrations from the North to the South. These people, had they grown up only out of their own forces, might have reached the point of saying: Thoughts are something we work out for ourselves. This feeling, however, was dulled down by what they foun d as the Graeco-Latin culture, as the culture of the East. These cultures were extraordin arily intermixed up to the fourth century; every possible trend was working within th em. Yet in the migrations southwards it was realized that thoughts can be grasped only by d rawing them down into the world of the senses from a supersensible world. We have, my dear friends, only an external history, we have no history of feeling, no history of thought, no history of the soul. Hence s uch things do not come to our notice; we do not notice how the whole disposition of soul cha nges from one century to another."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"T here was a tremendous swing round in man's inner pe rception in the fourth century. We find then something that for the very first time ca used man to reflect upon the origin of thought; so that what previously had been accepted without question, namely, the fact that thoughts were revealed, gradually came to a point w here a theory was needed to prove that they were the result of revelation. But these peopl e were by no means convinced that the human being could create his thought-world out of h imself. Now consider the great difference here between the souls of the present day and the souls of that time. I am speaking of some souls onl y. What I am describing to you was naturally present in various shades. For one part o f humanity matters were as I have described them; for another, there was still an inv incibly strong, intense belief that soul-spiritual Beings descending into the human org anism communicated thoughts to man. It was, if I may put it, only the “elite” among hum anity who at that time grasped thought in such a way that they had to ask: Where do thoughts come from? The others knew very little about thoughts; for them it was quite evident that thoughts were given. Now take the souls born approximately after the yea r 333. These souls were no longer able, out of a natural feeling, to give a matter-of -course explanation of the origin of thought. Thus a period followed in which theorists, philosophers and philosophical theologians argued as to the significance of though ts in the world and there arose the struggle between Nominalism and Realism. The Nomina lists were those in the Middle Ages who said: Thoughts live only in the human individua lity; they are only a summing-up of what exists outside in the world and within the sep arate individuals. The Realists still had a vivid recollection of ancient times when men regard ed thoughts as having substance, as something substantial that was revealed. They conce ived thoughts so that they said: It is not I who think the thought; it is not I who, for i nstance, sum up all dogs into the general concept dog; but there exists one general thought “ dog” and this is revealed out of the spiritual world, just as a color or tone is reveale d to the senses. It was a struggle to understand rightly the nature of thought which had, as it were, alighted as an independent possession into the human soul. It is of extraordin ary interest to steep oneself, from this point of view, in the spiritual history of the Midd le Ages. As we approach the fifteenth century, we discover w ith what intensity human beings strove to come to terms with what is revealed throu gh thought in man. Whereas mankind before the year 333 really had the idea: There is a divine weaving streaming around the earth just as in the physical world the atmosphere streams round it; and in this streaming, Beings reveal themselves to man and leave behind in him thoughts. They are, so to speak, the footprints of the divine world surrounding the earth, which are graven into men as thoughts. Whereas those souls who before the year 3 33 considered that in the thought-world a feeling of their connection with th e spiritual world existed, we find the Middle Ages permeated by the tragedy of still seeki ng to connect thought in some way with the divine-spiritual. Now why did those souls who, up to the fifteenth ce ntury thought about thoughts, if I may put it so — why was it that they strove so vigo rously to connect thoughts with what is divine-spiritual in the cosmos? It was because they felt an inner impulse which they were unable to express in clear concepts, but which was present in them as a definite experience of soul. This originated from all the souls who wer e born to play a leading part, from the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"fourth to the fourteenth century, being reincarnati ons from the time before the year 333 from the souls who had argued vehemently as to the real or merely nominal character of concepts, having lived previously at the time of th e Mystery of Golgotha. The Mystery of Golgotha took place in comparative i solation in Western Asia. But that was only the external manifestation of a spiritual event which took place in the physical world. Something happened in the souls who had reac hed a certain degree of maturity. When we consider those actually fighting over the r eality or unreality of thoughts we find personalities in whom were reincarnated souls whose previous incarnation had taken place during the first three Christian centuries. Essenti ally, however, civilized mankind was made up of souls reincarnated from the time before the M ystery of Golgotha. Out of the real connection between the human soul and the divine sp iritual world which expressed itself in the acceptance of thought being received through re velation — out of this experience which souls living in the Middle Ages had in an earlier e arth-life many centuries before, arose the impulse to dispute about the reality or unreality o f the thought-world. For what is it that is known as Scholasticism at th e beginning of the new era in the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth centuries? What a ctually filled the souls of the Scholastics? It is the following — the decisive moment had arriv ed in the evolution of man; it was not given utterance but was felt by outstanding souls o f that time. The Gods had forsaken the sphere of human thought, as if man only had thought s that were wrung dry. When we observe the souls who lived from the fiftee nth century on into later times, we find them to be those who in their previous incarna tion had lived not long after the year 333. Up to the eighth, [or] ninth post-Christian ce nturies, at least those who were teachers still had the feeling that human thought was a gift of the Gods. And the men who in their previous earth-life had already felt the world of t hought to be forsaken by the Gods were those — naturally I am speaking only of a part of h umanity — destined to be born again about the turn of the nineteenth century. When, therefore, we observe not only external desti ny, but the inner destiny of the human soul, we must pay no heed to that which wells up out of our childhood from the depths of the soul. We must look to the time in whi ch souls were incarnated who could no longer hear from their teachers that thoughts were Beings permeated, imbued by the divine. There-by the inner feeling arose to flee fr om thought, that something warmer, more saturated with substance should be found. This aros e because already in a previous incarnation the divine character of thought had bec ome subject to the gravest doubts, or had indeed been entirely lost. It was at the turn o f the nineteenth century that what shines through with the greatest intensity out of the prev ious earth-life was experienced as tragedy. Since the first third of the fifteenth century the receiving of thought from the divine- spiritual world was already lost to man. Because he could no longer receive thoughts out of the divine-spiritual world, they were grasped out o f external observation. External observation and the art of making experiments reach ed such a height just because the taking in of things inwardly was replaced by gleani ng them from the external sense world. In the development of world-history, however, what is solely dependent on external"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"conditions does not immediately become apparent. Fo r even if since the fifteenth century man has lost the faculty of perceiving thought from within as a revelation from the divine- spiritual world, souls were not yet there able to f eel the full tragedy of being forsaken by revealed thought. In those who had lived their form er life on earth before the sixth or seventh century, particularly before the fourth pos t-Christian century, there lived the feeling: Yes, we must admit that we receive our tho ughts from the external world, but in spite of this our soul tells us that even the thoug hts received from the external world are given us by God. We no longer know how thoughts are God-given, but our inner being tells us that this is so. A truly brilliant spirit who had such a mood of sou l was Johannes Kepler. Johannes Kepler was as much a natural scientist of an earlie r time as of a later one. He drew his thoughts from external observation, but in his inne r experience he had an absolute feeling that spiritual Beings are there when man is receivi ng his thoughts from Nature. Kepler felt himself to be partly an Initiate, and for him it wa s a matter of course that he experienced his abstract building up of the universe artistical ly. It is extraordinarily valuable, from a scientific p oint of view, to immerse oneself in the progress human thought has made through such a man as Kepler. But one is more deeply stirred when one steeps oneself in Kepler's life of soul, in that soul-life which in later times did not work with such intensity and inwardness in any other natural scientist, certainly not in any authoritative teacher of mankind at large. F or between the fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries the feeling was entirely lost that through thought the human soul is brought into connection with the divine-spiritual. Those who do not merely study the course of time in an unimaginative fashion just taking in the content, but are able to experience s omething in the course of events, have remarkable things revealed to them. I do not wish h ere to talk of how Goethe's special way of thinking about Nature has become an impossibilit y for later science. I mean for the external science of the times following his; for sc ience did not realize where the difference lay between external science and that of Goethe. Bu t I do not want to speak about this. You need only look at certain scientific books of the f irst third of the nineteenth century, those that gave the tone to the later mode of thought; yo u need only look, for instance, into the physiological works either of Henle or Burdach whic h absolutely belong to the first third of the nineteenth century, although they may have been written later, and you will note in them all a different style. There is still somethin g of the spirit which wells up directly out of the soul when, let us say, they speak of the embryo or of the structure of the human brain; there is still something of what has since been ent irely lost. In this connection it is significant to bring to mi nd a personality still actively working during the last third of the nineteenth century. He was already subject to the forces driving out the spirit from science, nevertheless he still retained the spiritual life in his own soul. Just let the anatomy of Hyrtl work upon you; he har dly belonged to the last third, chiefly to the second third of the nineteenth century. These b ooks are written in the style of later anatomists, but one can see that it was difficult f or Hyrtl. He writes chapter after chapter, always restraining the impulse to allow his soul to flow into his sentences. Occasionally it peeps up through the style, occasionally even throu gh the content. But there is, one might say, the iron necessity to stop the soul and spirit welling up from the man's inner being"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"whenever natural processes are described. Today we can barely imagine what can be experienced when, let us say, we go back from a con temporary anatomical book to Hyrtl or Burdach. One feels as if charged with a certain amo unt of warmth in one's scientific feeling on going back to the second third, but particularly to the first third of the nineteenth century. Certainly at that time science was not at its zenith. But that is only of secondary importance and need not be considered further. I am speaking of what was experienced in science. And about that one can say: Through studyi ng the path taken by the scientific soul, we can verify what Spiritual Science reveals to us, namely, that at the end of the nineteenth century more and more souls arose in whom there no longer lived from their previous earth-life the impulse that thought is God-given — I mean that there was no longer even an echo of this. For although the sense for the indivi dual past earth-life had been lost, its echo still lived on long afterwards. Thus felt those who still had a living warmth withi n them, who had not become dried up by the prejudice that in science one must be object ive — in its usual sense; actually what is striven for by Spiritual Science is the truly objec tive science, but not in the scientists' meaning of the word. These souls not dried up throu gh striving after objectivity asked: What is there in us still bound up with the divine- spiritual (they did not ask this consciously but subconsciously) from which we were torn in our previous earthly incarnation? Rising to the surface of consciousness was the feeling that man had lost his connection with the divine-spiritual world. On the other hand, it is a feeling that man dare not lose this connection, for without even this fai nt consciousness there is no life for his soul. Hence an intense yearning aroused, the strong inclination to that undefined longing for the Spirit, and yet the incapacity to reach it. It is characteristic of the generation growing up a bout the turn of the nineteenth century and at the beginning of the twentieth that it shoul d ask the older generations: Can we discover the Spiritual in our earthly environment? And the leaders who were asked unconsciously by youth: How can we find the Spiritu al in Nature, how can we find it within human life itself? — these leaders condemned as uns cientific this bringing the Spirit into the study of Nature and of human life. Thus in the second half of the nineteenth century a dreadful thing happened — the slogan “Psychology, science of the soul without a s oul” arose. I lay no special stress on how certain philosophers said that we need a soul-scien ce without soul. What the philosophers say has no great influence, but it is symptomatic o f what figures very widely as feeling and of how one deals with the younger generation. True, only a few philosophers actually said: We need a psychology without soul. But the whole ag e said: We older people wish to teach you mineralogy, zoology, botany, biology, anthropol ogy, even history, in a way to make it appear to you as if at the most there are experienc es of the soul, but not a soul as such. And the whole world, in so far as it is observed scient ifically, must be experienced as having no soul. Those who were first to bring with them out o f their previous earth-life the tragedy of experiencing soullessness were compelled to ask wit h the utmost insistence: Where can we look to fill the soul with Spirit? And from what th eir age considered of greatest value — in other respects rightly so — they gleaned the least information. Those who in the last third of the nineteenth centu ry wrote that one can gather the nature of their soul-life from their books were, ev en in the nineteenth century, a vanishing"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"minority. In general the people who wrote these boo ks were not the most brilliant. Among those who do not write books there are distinctly c leverer people than among those who do write them. In the last third of the nineteenth cen tury profounder natures were living in the midst of the superficial ones content with a sc ience bereft of Spirit. And when one looks into these profounder natures, which is possible th rough Spiritual Science, one finds in the last third of the nineteenth century a wrestling wi th deep problems. Those who had this inner life were no longer listened to; they no long er found the opportunity to become leaders. Many people foresaw clearly what the microscope was bringing in its wake in the second half of the nineteenth century. They were to be found among those who, participating in the cultural life, did not really penetrate into it because they felt dissatisfied with a culture devoid of Spirit, and therefore had their thoughts inwardly silenced in face of the growing scientific conceptions, yet asking w ith deep feeling: How can microcosmic evolution be brought into relation with macrocosmic evolution? This problem became increasingly pressing in their feeling life. There were also men who, as a result of their educa tion, followed the scientific tradition that continued to become ever emptier and emptier o f spirit. They hoped, for instance, for always greater scientific results from the further development of the microscope; they hoped with its help to see smaller and smaller obje cts. But others of a deeper nature looked with disturbed feelings upon the further developmen t of the microscope, particularly upon the views which followed in its train. The highest hope of one group was, by examining ever smaller and smaller objects, to penetrate into the nature of what is living. But others felt that this whole business would bring the world to n aught, that the use of the microscope sucked the soul dry. I trust you will not think that I am indulging in s atire in a mystic, fantastical fashion on the use of the microscope. That would never occur t o me. I am naturally fully aware of the services rendered by the microscope, and I would ne ver wish to put a spoke in any scientific wheel. I am simply recounting facts rela ting to the life of soul. The number of these solitary spirits steadily decre ased. Fortlage, who lived as Professor in Jena at the end of the nineteenth century, was o ne of them. He spoke somewhat as follows: One can look more and more thoroughly into the microscope and go on discovering ever smaller things, but in this minute ness one loses what is substantially true. If you want to see what is being sought with the ai d of the microscope — which, with ever greater perfection, allows one to penetrate further and further into the minute — then turn your gaze out into the infinite space of the univer se. From the stars there speaks what you are seeking within the minute. You talk of the secr ets of life, and seek for them from what is minute, and ever more minute. But there one loses l ife, not for reality, but for knowledge. Life is lost in this way. You can find it again whe n you understand how to read the stars. Some have said: Life is brought down from the cosmo s. But they sought for a material means, possibly in the meteor-showers flying throug h cosmic space and bringing germs out of other worlds down to the earth. But when one gaz es from the earth out into limitless space, it is not limitless at all. For the mechanis tic-mathematical way of perception, the firmament was done away with by Giordano Bruno: but for more intimate perception it is"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"again there in the sense that one cannot simply dra w a radius from the earth and prolong it into infinity. This radius has in fact an end, and at this end there is everywhere, at the inner periphery, life to be found and not death. From thi s world-periphery life radiates in from all directions. I only wish to indicate to you by these examples th e nature of those inner problems of experience which confronted the soul at the turn of the nineteenth century. Out of the dullest experience of soul the question really was put: Where can we rediscover the Spiritual? You see, this question must set the mood if any pha se of the youth movement is to find a right content — Where can I find the Spiritual? How does one experience the Spiritual? The really important thing is that side by side wit h all yearning expectation there shall also be found among the young, single ideals striving to wards an inner activity of the soul. I should like to preface what I have to say tomorrow by the following. In what I have named Anthroposophy, in fact in the foreword to my Philosophy of Spiritual Activity , you will meet with something which you will not b e able to comprehend if you only give yourself up to that pas sive thinking so specially loved today, to that popular god-forsaken thinking of even a previo us incarnation. You will only understand if you develop in Freedom the inner impu lse to bring activity into your thinking. You will never get on with Spiritual Scie nce if that spark, that lightning, through which activity in thinking is awakened does not fla sh up. Through this activity we must reconquer the divine nature of thinking. Anthroposophical literature demands that one shall think activity. Most people are only able to think passively, finding active thinking im possible. But active thinking has no room for sleepy nor for intellectual dreaming. One must keep in step with it and get one's thinking on the move. The moment thinking is set in motion one goes with it. Then what I should like to call modern clairvoyance ceases to b e anything miraculous. That this clairvoyance should still appear as something parti cularly miraculous comes from people not wishing to develop the energy to bring activity into their thinking. It often drives one to despair. One often feels when demanding active thin king of anyone that his mood is illustrated by the following anecdote: Somebody was lying in a ditch without moving hand or foot, not even opening his eyes; he was asked by a passer-by: “Why are you so sad?” The man answered: “Because I don't want to do anything. ” The questioner was astonished at this, for the man lying there was doing nothing and had apparently done nothing for a long time. But he wanted to do even more “doing nothings ” Then the questioner said: “Well, you certainly are doing nothing,” and got the answer: “ I have to revolve with the earth and even that I don't want to do “ This is how people appear who do not wish to bring activity into thinking, into what alone out of man's being can bring the soul back in to connection with the divine-spiritual content of the world. Many of you have learnt to de spise thinking, because it has met you only in its passive form. This, however, is only he ad-thinking in which the heart plays no part. But try for once really to think actively and you will see how the heart is then engaged; if one succeeds in developing active think ing the whole human being in a way suited to our present age enters with the greatest intensity into the spiritual world. For"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"through active thinking we are able to bring force into our thinking — the force of a stout heart. If you do not seek the Spirit on the path of thought, which although difficult to tread must be trodden with courage, with the very blood o f one's heart, if you do not try on this path to suck in that spiritual life which has flowe d through humanity from the very beginning, you will create a movement where the inf ant would believe himself able to draw nourishment out of himself and not from his mother' s breast. You only come to a movement with real content when you find the secret of developing within an activity which enables you to draw again out of cosmic life true spiritual nourishment, true spiritual drink. But that is pre-eminently a problem of the will, a problem of the will experienced through feeling. Infinitely much depends today upon good-will, upon an energetic willing, and no theories can solve what we are seeking today . Courageous, strong will alone can bring the solution.

I assume that you are familiar with the soul princi ples of man according to anthroposophical knowledge. You know that we must d ifferentiate in the soul between what was active in human nature up to the fifteenth century — the so-called intellectual or mind soul — and the consciousness soul which since that time has been principally active in those who have developed to the level of culture to which man has so far advanced. In describing a particular activity of the soul as that of the intellectual or mind soul, it does not indicate that intellect, in itself, as we understand it today, is a special characteristic of the intellectual or mind soul. The intellectual or mind soul was developed particularly by the Greeks and among them intellect was certainly n ot what it is today. But you will have been able to gather that from yesterday's lecture. Among the Greeks, concepts, ideas, were bestowed by the Spirit. But because of this, their intellect was not so cold, so lifeless and dr y as ours is today when it is the result of effort. Intellectualism has first arisen through th e special development in the consciousness soul. You can only get the right conception of the intellectual or mind soul by transporting yourselves into the mind of a Greek. Then you will certainly discover the difference between the relation of the Greek towards the world and our own. This will be made clearer by our lecture today. These introductory words serve as a basis to unders tand that in the centuries preceding the modern age, that is, up to the fifteenth centur y, human beings met and spoke to one another out of the intellectual or mind soul. Today we face the consciousness soul. But to feel it the developing human being had to reach the turn of the nineteenth century. It has been brought about by circumstances already describ ed. But because of this the problems of life have appeared in an entirely new way. Probl ems must be regarded in a new way nowadays, otherwise the connecting bridge between c onsciousness soul and consciousness soul, which means for modern humanity the bridge be tween one man and another, cannot be found. We are suffering from this at the present time — we cannot find the bridge between human being and human being. Above all we must ask many of our questions in a ne w way, in a form that may at first seem grotesque. But it is not meant to be so. Now l et us suppose that a three-year-old child were to resolve not to pass through the tedious pro cess of waiting for its second teeth until the seventh year, but this child were to say: It is weary work to go through four more years until I get my second teeth; I will get them at onc e.

And so, too, it is a condition of natural developme nt, for which today only few people have any feeling, that only from a certain age onwa rds the human being can know something about the connections in life of which he must know, but which cannot be exhausted by information about external things.

But matters where a judgment formed by active thinking is necessary, cannot be k nown before we reach a certain time in life, that is, between about the eighteenth and nin eteenth years. Just as it is impossible to get the second teeth before the seventh year so it is impossible to know something in its essential reality before the eighteenth year. It is simply impossible before the eighteenth year really to know about those things that are not just under our nose, things for which active judgment is necessary. Before this one may h ave heard something, may believe something on authority. But one cannot know anythin g about it. Before this we cannot unfold that inner activity of soul necessary for us to say: I know something about this or that which does not lie in a region accessible to m ere eyes or ears. Such things are hardly mentioned today. They are, however, exceedingly imp ortant for life. If culture is to find roots again, one must speak about such things, and treat them in a knowledgeable way. What, then, follows from the fact that before his e ighteenth year the human being cannot, properly speaking, know anything? It follow s that the human being before he is eighteen must depend upon those who are older, just as the infant is dependent on its mother's breast — it is in no way different. From t his, however, there follows something of the greatest significance for the intercourse betwe en teachers, educators, and the younger generation. If this is not heeded the connection is simply false. Now, people are not conscious today that this is so ; generally in the sphere of education, an opposite direction is taken. But it was not alwa ys so. If we look back before the first third of the fifteenth century, a real modern youth movem ent would not have been possible. At that time there could never have been a youth movem ent in the present form with a justified right of existence. Why could there have been no such thing? To answer this question we must turn to the conditions which obtai ned among those preparing for life in the monastic schools. We could also take the condit ions for the young who were being prepared for trades. We should not find much differ ence. In the earliest of those times it was definitely realized that no one could be brough t before his eighteenth year to the point of real knowledge. It would have seemed absurd had one maintained that it was possible to give anyone real knowledge before his eighteenth ye ar. At that time it was known among older people, especially if they wanted to teach or educate: “The young cannot be brought to the point of actual knowledge. We must be capabl e of inducing the young to believe in what we, according to our knowledge, hold to be tru e.” And to lead the young to believe was a sacred task. Today this is all upside-down, because what in earl ier times was demanded only of the young, namely, belief, is now demanded in connectio n with the supersensible of those who are grown-up. At that time the concept of belief wa s only there for those who were young. But it was regarded as something sacred. A man woul d have reproached himself with violating his most sacred duty if, as teacher or ed ucator, he had failed to make the young believe in him out of the freshness and lively conv iction of individual human nature, so that"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"t h e y t h us received the truth. This shade of feeling lay in all education, in all instruction. In other respects the education and teaching of that t ime may today arouse a sense of antipathy because of its division into all kinds of classes and distinctions. But putting that aside, the desire was there to maintain the faith o f the young. Something else was connected with this: that teache rs felt that it was first of all necessary to justify the claim that the young shoul d believe in one. I shall explain this by means of an example in the monastery schools which were the only educational institutions in the time preceding the fifteenth century. One ha d first to justify the claim that one should be taken seriously; for this was the basis u pon which the belief of the young was to be founded. A man did not think, just because he wa s a grown-up or because some authority had granted him a diploma or given him a post, that the young had to believe in him. It is true that diplomas and the like played a certain external role even in those days. But to justify the right to be taken seriously mean t that to begin with one avoided giving them definite knowledge. It was not customary in th ose days to impart knowledge. It is so foreign to us today to connect any definite concept with the remark: We do not wish to impart knowledge to the young — that this saying is quite unintelligible. But at that time it was self-understood that before there was any wish to impart knowledge the young should be made to see and to feel that one was capable of something. It was only when the young people had reached a certain age that the teacher t old them what he knew. The first step was to show what one could do, and for this reason the substance of the teaching was the trinity of grammar, dialectic and rhetoric. These w ere not sciences. For it is only in the course of time that grammar has become the present pseudo-scientific monstrosity. In those times grammar was not at all what it is today ; it was the art of combining and separating thoughts and words. Instruction in gramm ar was the teaching of an art, and all the more so in the case of dialectic and rhetoric. Everything given was so arranged that the pupils should feel the ability of their teachers, t hat they should feel their teachers capable of speaking and thinking and of letting beauty hold sway in their speaking. Grammar, dialectic and rhetoric — this was instruction in ab ility, in an ability closely connected with the human activity of the teacher and educator. Today when we speak of the objective method of teac hing, we keep the teaching quite apart from the personality of the teacher. We drag in every possible kind of gadget, even those dreadful calculating machines, in order that the teaching may be as impersonal as possible. We try to separate it entirely from the p ersonal. Such a separation is not really possible. The endeavour to keep the teaching entire ly apart from the personal only leads to the worst sides of the teacher coming into play, an d his good side is quite unable to unfold when so much objectivity is dragged in. Thus it was a natural demand on the teacher that he should first let the young feel what he was capable of in the very highest sense, as a h uman being. He had to show his mastery of speech, his mastery of thought, and how beauty w as part of his speech. Only by letting the young for a time witness what one could do, was the right acquired to lead them gradually to what can be known, to arithmetic, geom etry, astronomy and music, to music as it was conceived of at that time, that is, as a per meation of the whole world-order by harmony and melody. Because a start was made from g rammar, dialectic and rhetoric, one was able later to pour into arithmetic, geometry, a stronomy and music as much of the artistic as was possible, having had an artistic po int of departure."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Now all this has evaporated, has vanished into thin air, with the first dawn of intellectualism. Of everything artistic that appear ed then we have but the scantiest remains. Here and there, in certain universities, the doctor 's degree still bears with it the title: “Doctor of Philosophy and of the Seven Liberal Arts .” But you know the real state of affairs where the Seven Liberal Arts are concerned! That ca n be established historically; for instance, the famous Curtius who taught in Berlin w as an extraordinary personality who held a quite irregular diploma. If you ask for what subject he actually received the venia legendi , you would expect it to have been for history of a rt. But that is not correct. His teaching certificate was for Eloquentia — fluency o f speech. But the times were such that this branch of knowledge was out of date. He was pr ofessor of eloquence, but in order to teach he took up history of art — and dealt with it most excellently. Even at the time when Curtius was teaching it would have been strange had eloquence been a branch of instruction. Eloquence or rhetoric, however, was on e of the fundamental branches of instruction given to the young of earlier times, wi th the result that something thoroughly artistic came into education. But the introduction of the artistic into education was still in keeping with the old order in which intellectual or mind soul encountered intellectual or mind soul. And today people are still not able to p ut the question from the new point of view: How must things be in human affairs if consci ousness soul is to meet consciousness soul? As soon as education is considered in the wid er sense this question arises of itself. It has been put for a long time, for decades, but huma n beings have not yet developed an active enough thinking to formulate and feel it cle arly. And where do we find an answer? One answer to this question is found by learning to perceive — for it is a matter of the unfolding of will and not of a theoretical solution — that when the child enters earthly existence he brings with him the power of imitation ; up to the time of the change of teeth, the child just imitates. Out of this power of imita tion speech is learnt. Speech is, so to speak, poured into the child just as his blood circ ulation is poured into him when he comes into earthly existence. But the child should not co me to a more and more conscious education by giving him out of the consciousness so ul knowledge in the form of truth. In earlier times it was said: Before the eighteenth ye ar the child cannot know anything, so he must be led through ability to knowledge which he a ccepts first as belief; thereby the forces of knowledge will be awakened in him between the ei ghteenth and nineteenth years. For it is out of the inner being that the forces of knowle dge must be awakened. To keep the young waiting until their eighteenth year, adults behaved in relation to youth so as to show what they were capable of, afterwards educating them to experience together with the teacher in a provisional way, up to the eighteenth year, what later they would be expected to know. Up to the eighteenth or nineteenth year the “acquis ition of knowledge” was provisional, because before the eighteenth or nineteenth year it is not possible really to know anything. But in fact no teacher can convey knowledge to any boy or girl if in their feeling there has not ripened the conviction: He is capable! A teache r has not the right sense of responsibility towards the human being if he wants to set to work before the young take it as a matter of course that be knows his job. Before the students were given arithmetic — as arit hmetic was understood in those days, and it was not the dry, abstract stuff of tod ay — those who guided them into arithmetic, knowing too how to speak and think, had also the gift of eloquence. When the young know this out of their own feeling, it is a g ood reason for looking up to those who are"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"o lder. When they only know that the teacher has a di ploma, it sometimes happens that when the child is not more than ten everything goes to pieces. The question which was a living one in those days must again be given life. But because today consciousness soul encounters consciousness soul in human affairs, thi s question cannot be solved as formerly when human beings confronted each other with their mind souls. Today a different solution must be found. Naturally, we cannot return to the liberal arts, al though it would be preferable than what is being done today. We must reckon with moder n conditions — not the external conditions but those dealing with the evolution of the human race. Here we must find the transition from imitation, which up to the change o f teeth is natural in the child, to the stage when we can bring knowledge to the human bein g, reckoning first upon trust and belief and later upon his own judgment. But there is an intermediate period, today a very c ritical one for the young. For this period we must find the solution of the most signif icant world-problem; upon these problems depends the future progress or otherwise o f human evolution — even its total submergence. The question is: How must adults handl e children between the years of imitation and the years when knowledge can be given ? Today this is one of the weightiest of all cultural questions. And what was the youth movement in so far as it is to be taken seriously? It can be summed up in the burning question: Have the older p eople an answer for this? And it became clear to the young that no such answer was t o be found in the schools, so they drifted out — out into grove and meadow and into th e fields. They preferred, instead of being school boys and girls, to become birds — bird s of passage ( W andervögel ). We must look at life, not at theories, when one see ks to encompass the great problems of world-culture. If one really looks into life tod ay one will find that the period between the age of imitation and the age at which the human bei ng can receive knowledge in the form of truth must be filled if humanity is not to pine away. This must be done by giving the human being with artistic beauty what he needs for head, heart and will. The seven- foldness of grammar, dialectic, rhetoric, arithmetic , geometry, astronomy and music, grew out of an older cultural order; it was of the natur e of art. Today too we need art but, according to the demands of the consciousness soul, it must not be specialized in the way of the Seven Liberal Arts. During the primary school a ge and far beyond it, for as long as education holds good, the whole teaching must be wa rmed through and fired by the artistic element. During the primary school years everything must be steeped in beauty, and in later years beauty must rule as the interpreter of truth. Those human beings who have not learnt to walk in t he ways of beauty, and through beauty to capture truth, will never come to the ful l manhood needed to meet the challenges of life. The great German writers divined this even if its full importance was not emphasized. They were not met with understanding. H ow clearly we see this search for truth through beauty in Goethe. Listen how he says: “Art is a manifestation of secret forces of Nature,” which simply means that only through an artistic grasp of the world does man reach the living truth — otherwise it is dead. And Schiller's words, the beautiful words: “Only through the dawn of beauty do you penetrate t o the land of knowledge.” Unless we"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"first permeate ourselves with the meaning of the pa th, [that] only through the artistic can we penetrate into the realm of truth, there can be no question of acquiring a real understanding of the supersensible world in accorda nce with the age of the consciousness soul. For you see, with the help of the recognized scienc es, today knowledge of man is limited to the physical body alone. With modern science the re is no possibility of knowing anything about the human being beyond his physical body. Tha t is why science can only speak conclusively — yet grandly — about physiology or bi ology so long as it is a question of the physical body. True, people talk about psychology. It is only known as experimental psychology; phenomena of the life of soul are obser ved, but what figures as phenomena of the soul is connected with the physical body. They cannot form the slightest conception of any real phenomena of the life of soul. Hence they have hit upon the idea psycho-physical parallelism. Parallel lines, however, can meet only at infinity. So, too, the connection between the physical body and the soul can be under stood only at infinity. Thus psycho- physical parallelism was setup. All this is symptomatic of the incapacity of the ag e to understand the human being. For, firstly, if one seeks to understand the human being , the power of intellectualism ceases. Man cannot be understood out of the intellect. One may choose to adhere firmly and rigidly to intellectualism; but then, knowledge of the huma n being must be renounced. But for that one would be obliged to tear out the mind and heart and that is impossible. If it is torn out it withers way. For the head can renounce knowledge of man, but this entails the stunting of mind and heart. All our present culture is expre ssed in a withered life of mind and heart. And, secondly, understanding of man is not to be ac hieved with concepts that lead us in the domain of outer Nature. However much we can achieve outwardly with these concepts they cannot lead us to the second member of the human bo dy, to the human etheric body, the body of formative forces. Just imagine that with the methods of modern scienc e man could know as much, let us say, as he will know at the end of earth evolution — quite an appalling amount! I will assume the existence of a very finished and very cl ever scientist. I am not saying that there are not among us scientists already near this stage . For it is not my belief that in the future there will be more progress in intellectualism. A d ifferent path will be taken. I have the very highest respect for the intellectualism of our learned men. Do not for a moment think that I am saying this out of a lack of respect. I m ean this in all seriousness. There are vast numbers of very clever scientists, of this there is no doubt at all! But even were I to assume that science had reached its highest peak, it would still only be able to understand the physical body of man, nothing at all of the etheric body. Knowledge of the etheric body is not based upon phantasy. But the stimulus to acquir e the faculty for perceiving this subordinate supersensible member of man's nature ca n arise only out of artistic experience of the soul. Art must become the life blood of the soul. The more people wish in our objective science to av oid carefully everything of the nature of art, the more are they led away from know ledge of man. Through the microscope and other instruments we have come to know a great deal. But it never leads us nearer to the etheric body, only farther from it. Finally we entirely lose the path to what is a prime necessity for understanding man. In the case of pla nts we may get the better of this, for"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"t h e y do not concern us so intimately. It does not worry the plant that it is not the product of the laboratory which modern science makes it out to be. It still goes on growing under the influence of the etheric force of the cosmos and do es not limit itself to the forces presumed to exist by physics and chemistry. But when we conf ront men things are different. Then our feeling, our confidence, our reverence, in short al l that is in our mind which in the age of the consciousness soul naturally rises above instin ct — for with the consciousness soul everything rises above instinct — depends upon our having an education which allows us to perceive something more than merely the human physi cal body. When teachers deprive us of insight into what man r eally is, we cannot expect those forces to flourish which in the right way place man over against man. Everything depends upon the human being to free himself from the shack les of mere observation and experiment. Indeed we can estimate observation and experiment at their right value only when we have become free of them, and the simplest way of breaking free is the artistic way. Yes, when the teacher stands in front of the child again as — in an earlier epoch — grammar dialectic, rhetoric stood, that is to say, when the teacher stands before the young so that his way of teaching is again that of the ar tist, and is permeated by art, there will arise a different youth movement — it may appear un attractive to you, but nevertheless it will arise — which will crowd around the teachers w ho are artists, because there they will draw nourishment and receive what the young must ex pect from those who are older. The youth movement cannot be a mere opposition, a mere revolt against the older generation, for then it becomes like the infant who can do noth ing because it cannot receive milk from its mother. What is to be learnt must be learnt. Bu t it will be learnt when there is as natural an urge towards those who are older as the infant h as towards its mother's breast, or as the small child feels when, by imitating, he learns to speak. This urge will be stimulated when the young find the artistic coming from the older g eneration, when truth first appears in the garb of beauty. In this way all that is best wi ll be kindled in the young, not the intellect which always remains passive, but the will which st irs thinking into activity. Artistic education will be an education of the will, and it is upon the education of the will that everything else depends. Tomorrow, then, we shall continue."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Younger Generation Younger Generation: Lecture X X YESTERDAY I w a nted to show how we must come to an education, stee ped in artistic form. I drew attention to how in earlier times the teache r took his start from the artistic, which he did in higher education by treating as arts what to day has become entirely abstract and scientific, namely, grammar, dialectic and rhetoric . This was done in such a way that the young human being started by recognizing in his tea cher: This man can do something which I cannot do. And through this alone the right relationship was established between the younger and the older generations. For this rel ationship, my dear friends, can never develop along the path of intellectuality. As soon as one stands consciously on the ground of the intellect or without the ideas inwardly reve aled in the intellectual or mind soul, there is no possibility of differentiating between human beings. For human nature is so constituted that when it is a matter of making some thing clear through the consciousness soul, everyone thinks that the moment he has concep ts he is capable of discussing them with anyone. Thus it is, with the intellect. For th e intellect neither man's maturity nor his experience comes into consideration; they only do s o when it is a question of ability. But when their elders have ability the young quite as a matter of course pay tribute to maturity and experience. Now, in order to understand these things thoroughly we must consider from a different point of view the course taken by mankind's evoluti on. Let me tell you what spiritual science has discovered about the course of history, with regard to the intercourse between men. External documentary history can go back only a few thousand years before the Mystery of Golgotha and what is to be found can never be es timated rightly because spiritual achievements, even in the time of ancient Greece, c annot be grasped by modern concepts. Even for the old Grecian times quite other concepts must be used. Nietzsche felt this. Hence the charm of his brief, unfinished essay on P hilosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks, where he deals with philosophy in connectio n with the general development of Greek culture up to the time of Socrates. In Socrat es he saw the first flicker of pure intellectuality; everything philosophical in the tr agic age of Greek development proceeded from wide human foundations for which, when express ed in concepts, these were only the language through which to convey what was experienc ed. In the earliest times philosophy was quite different from what it later became. But I only want to mention this in passing. I really want to point out that with spiritual Imag ination, and especially with Inspiration, we can look back much further into hum an evolution and, above all, into men's souls. Then we find when we go very far back, some seven or eight thousand years before the Mystery of Golgotha, that the young had a natur al veneration for great age. This was a matter of course. Why? Because what exists today on ly in earliest youth existed then for the whole evolution of man."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"If we look at the human being with less superficial ity than is often done today, we find that the whole evolution of the human soul changes at about the change of teeth, during the sixth, seventh or eighth year. Man's soul becomes d ifferent, and again it changes at the time of puberty. I have discussed this fully in my book The Education of the Child from the Standpoint of Spiritual Science. On occasion it is noticed that man's soul becomes different in the seventh year and again in the fourteenth or fifteenth. But what people no longer notice is that changes still take place at the begi nning of the twenties, at the end of the twenties, in the middle of the thirties, and so on. Whoever is able to observe the life of soul in a mo re intimate way knows such transitions in man, that human life runs its course in rhythms. Try to perceive this, let us say, in Goethe. Goethe records how he was cured of certain childlike religious ideas by the Lisbon earthquake, thus about the time when he was changing his teeth, and how puzzling everything was for him. He tells how as a small chi ld he began to reflect: Is there a good God ruling the world, when one sees that countless people have been swept away through these terrible fiery forces in the earth? — Especia lly in these decisive moments of his life, Goethe was prone to let external events work upon h is soul so as to be conscious of its changes. And he says concerning this period of his l ife that he became a strange kind of pantheist, how he could no longer believe in the id eas imparted by the older people in his home and by his parents. He tells how he took his f ather's music-stand on which he set out minerals, placing on top a little candle that he li t by holding a burning-glass to catch the first rays of the morning sun. In later life he exp lained that he had wanted to bring an offering to the great God of Nature by lighting a s acrificial fire, kindled from Nature herself. Take the first period of Goethe's life, then the fo llowing one, and so on till you piece together this whole life out of parts of about the length of his childlike episode, and you will find that with Goethe something always happened dur ing such times fundamentally to change his soul. It is extraordinarily interesting to see that the fact of Schiller's urging Goethe to continue Faust only found fruitful soil i n Goethe because at the end of the eighteenth century, he happened to be at a transiti onal period of this kind. It is interesting too that Goethe re-wrote Faust at the beginning of a following life-period. Goethe began Faust in his youth in such a way that he makes Faus t open the book of Nostradamus. There we have the great scene: “What powers celestial, lo! ascend, descend Each unto each the golden vessels giving!” But turn the page and there we find: “Thou, Spirit of the Earth, to me art nearer.”"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Goethe rejects for Faust the great tableau of the m acrocosm and allows only the earth- spirit to approach him. And when at the beginning of the nineteenth century he was persuaded by Schiller to revise Faust he wrote the “Prologue in Heaven.” Anyone who observes his own life inwardly will discover that t hese changes hold good. Nowadays we only notice them when we deliberately train ourselv es to look deeply into our own life. In ancient times, six thousand, seven thousand year s before the Mystery of Golgotha, these changes were so noticeable that they were exp erienced in the life of soul as the change of teeth or puberty is today. And, indeed, ap proximately up to the middle of life, up to the thirty-fifth or thirty-sixth year, life was on the up-grade. But then it began to decline. People experienced the drying-up of life. But while certain products of metabolism become deposited through sluggishness in the organism and the physical organism becomes increasingly heavy and lethargic, it was also felt that up to the greatest age the soul and spirit were on the ascent, how the soul is set free with the drying up of the body. And people in olden days would not have spoken with suc h ardour of the patriarchs — the word itself only arose later — had they not noticed exte rnally in men: True, he is getting physically old, but he has to thank his physical ag ing for lighting-up his spirit. He is no longer dependent on the body. The body withers, but the soul becomes free. In this modern age it is most unusual that such a t hing happens, for instance, as occurred at the Berlin University. Two philosophers were there, the one was Zeller — the famous Greek scholar — and the other Michelet. Zell er was seventy years old and thought he ought to be pensioned off. Michelet was ninety a nd lectured with tremendous vivacity. Eduard von Hartmann told me this himself. Michelet is supposed to have said: “I don't understand why that young man doesn't want to lectu re any more.” Michelet was, as I said, ninety years old! Today people seldom keep their freshness to such a degree. But in those times it was so, especially among those who concerned themselves wit h spiritual life. What did the young say when they looked at the Patriarchs? They said: It is beautiful to get old. For then one learns something through one's own development that one cannot know before. It was perfectly natural to speak in this way. Just as a l ittle boy with a toy horse wants to be big and get a real horse, so, at that time, there was t he desire to get old because it was felt that something is then revealed from within. Then came the following millennia. It was still exp erienced up to a considerable age, but no longer as in the old Indian epoch — in the termi nology of my Occult Science. At the zenith of Greek culture, man still had living exper ience of the change occurring in life in the middle of the thirties. Men still knew how to d istinguish between body and spirit, and said: At the age of thirty, the physical begins to d ecline, but then the spiritual begins to blossom forth. This was experienced by the soul and spirit in the immediate presence of men. The original feeling of the Greeks was based u pon this, not upon that phantasy of which modern science speaks. To understand the full ness of Greek culture, we should bear in mind that the Greeks were still able in consciou sness to come to thirty, five-and-thirty, six-and-thirty years, whereas a more ancient humani ty grew in consciousness to a far"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"greater age. Herein consists the evolution of human ity. Man has more and more to experience out of Nature unconsciously what is for a later time; this requires him to experience it consciously for consciously it must a gain be experienced. Whoever observes himself can recognize the seven-yearly changes; the length of time is not pedantically exact, but approximate. A man who looks back to the period of his forty-ninth, forty-second, thirty-fifth years can recognize quite well: At tha t time something happened in me by which I learnt something which out of my own nature I could not previously have done, just as I should not have been able to bite with my second teeth before I had them. To experience life concretely is something that has be en lost in the course of man's evolution. And today if anyone does not inwardly train himself to observe, these epochs from the thirtieth year onwards are completely blurred. Comp aratively speaking, an inner transformation can still be noticed at the beginnin g of the twenties — even up to the end of the twenties, though it is then rather less noticea ble. But with the present human organization man receives something from his natura l evolution only up to his twenty-sixth or twenty-seventh year, and this limit will recede more and more. In earlier times men were not free in their organization, destined as th ey were to have these experiences out of their own nature. Freedom has become possible only by the withdrawal of Nature. To the extent Nature ceases freedom becomes possible. Thro ugh his own striving, through his own powers, man must arrive at finding the spiritual, w hereas formerly, the older he became the more did the spiritual thrive. Today emphasis is no longer placed on what the old become merely by growing older. Intellectualism is left which, between the eighteen th and nineteenth years, can develop so that from then onwards one can know with the intell ect. But as far as intellectuality is concerned, one can at most reach a greater degree o f proficiency but make no qualitative progress. If one has fallen a victim to the desire to prove or to refute everything intellectually, one cannot progress. If someone put s forward what is the result of decades of experience but wants to prove it intellectually, an eighteen-year-old could refute him intellectually. For whatever is possible intellectu ally at sixty is equally possible at nineteen, since intellectuality is a stage during the epoch o f the consciousness soul which in the sense of deepening is of no help to progress, but only to proficiency. The young may say: “I am not yet as clever as you are; you can still take me in.” But he will not believe the other to be his superior in the sphere of intellect. These things must be emphasized to become intelligi ble. I do not wish to criticize. I am saying this only because it is part of the natural evolution of humanity; we should be clear about the following characteristic of our age, name ly, that if man does not strive out of inner activity for development and maintain it cons ciously, then with mere intellectualism at his twentieth year he will begin to get rusty. H e then receives stimuli only from outside, and through these external stimuli keeps himself go ing. Do you think that if things were not like that people would flock to the cinema? This lo nging for the cinema, this longing to see everything externally, depends on the human being b ecoming inwardly inactive, on his no longer wanting inner activity. The only way to listen to lectures on Spiritual Sci ence, as meant here, is for those present to do their share of the work. But today th at is not to people's liking. They flock to lectures or meetings with lantern slides so that th ey can sit and do as much as possible without thinking. Everything just passes before the m. They can remain perfectly passive."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"But our system of teaching is ultimately of this ch aracter, too, and anyone who on educational grounds objects to the triviality of th e modern object lesson is said to be behind the times. But one has to oppose it, for man is not a mere apparatus for observing, an apparatus that wants simply to look at things. Man can live only by inner activity. To listen to Spiritual Science means to invite the human bein g to co-operate with his soul. People do not want this today. Spiritual Science is an invita tion to this inner activity, that is to say, it must lead all studies to the point where there is n o more support in external sense- perception because then the inner play of forces mu st begin to move freely. Not before thinking moves freely in this inner play of forces can Imagination be reached. Thus the basis for all Anthroposophy is inner activity, the c hallenge to inner activity, the appeal to what can be active when all the senses are silent a nd only the activity of thinking is astir. Here there lies something of extraordinary signific ance. Just suppose you were capable of this. I will not flatter you by saying that you are. I only want to ask you first to assume that you are capable of it, that you can think in s uch a way that your thoughts are only an inner flow of thoughts. What I called pure thinking in my Philosophy of Spiritual Activity was certainly not well named when judged by outer c ultural conditions. For Eduard von Hartmann said to me: “There is no such thing, one c an only think with the aid of external observation.” And all I could say in reply was: “It has only to be tried and people will soon learn to be able to make it a reality.” Thus take i t as a hypothesis that you could have thoughts in a flow of pure thought. Then there begi ns for you the moment when you have led thinking to a point where it need not be called thinking any longer, because in a twinkling — in the twinkling of a thought — it has become something different. This rightly named pure thinking has at the same time become pur e will, for it is willing, through and through. If you have advanced so far in your life o f soul that you have freed thinking from outer perception, it has become at the same time pu re will. You hover with your soul, so to speak, in a pure flight of thought. But this pure f light of thought is a flight of will. Then the exercise or the striving for the exercise of pure t hought begins to be not an exercise in thinking only but also an exercise of the will, ind eed an exercise of the will that goes right to the center of the human being. For you will make the following remarkable observation. It is only now, for the first time, that you can sp eak of thinking, as it is in ordinary life, as an activity of the head. Before this you really have n o right to speak of thinking as an activity of the head, for you know this only as external fac t from physiology, anatomy, and so on. But now you feel inwardly that you are no longer th inking so high up, you begin for the first time to think with the heart. You actually interwea ve your thought with the breathing process. You actually set going of itself what the Yoga exercises have striven for artificially. You notice that as thinking becomes more and more a n activity of the will it wrenches itself free first from the breast and then from the whole human body. It is as though you were to draw forth this thinking from the extremity of your big toe! And if with inner participation you study what has appeared with many imperfections — for I make no claims for my Philosophy of Spiritual Activity — if you let it wor k upon you and feel what this pure thinking is, you will experience that a new man is born within you who can bring out of the spirit an unfolding of the will. Does man know before this that he has a will? He re ally has no will, for he is given up to instincts connected with his organic development. H e often dreams that he does this or that out of an impulse of the soul, but he really does i t because of the good or bad condition of"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"h is stomach. But now you know that you have permeate d the physical organism with what fills it with consciousness. You do not need to be a clairvoyant for this. All you need do is to be interested in the Philosophy of Spiritual Activit y and let it work upon you. For this Philosophy of Spiritual Activity cannot be read as other books are today. It must really be read so that once you get into the Philos ophy of Spiritual Activity you have the feeling that it is an organism, one member developi ng out of another, that you have found your way into something living. People immediately say: Something is going to get into me which will take away my freedom. Something is enter ing me that I do not want to have. People who entertain such thoughts are like those w ho were to say that if the human being at two or three years has to get used to spea king a certain language, he will thereby lose his freedom. The human being ought to be warne d against language for he will no longer be free when brought into this chance associ ation of ideas. He ought to be able to speak at will now Chinese, now French, now German. Nobody says this because it would be too absurd, and life itself refutes such nonsense. On the other hand there are people who either hear or see something of Eurythmy and say th at it, too, rests upon the chance association of the ideas of individuals. But one sh ould be able to assume that philosophers would say: One must look into this Eurythmy and see if in evoking gestures we may not have the foundations of a higher freedom and find t hat it is only an unfolding at a higher level of what is in speech. So one need not be surprised — for really nothing t hat goes beyond intellectualism is regarded without prejudice today — that people get goose-flesh when one tells them that a certain book must be read quite differently from ot her books, that it must be read in such a way that from it something is really experienced. W hat is it that must be experienced? It is the awakening of the will out of the spiritual. In this respect my book was intended as a means of education. The intention was not only to g ive it content but to make it work educationally. Hence you find in my Philosophy of S piritual Activity an exposition on the art of forming concepts, a description of what take s place in the soul when one does not keep with one's concepts to the impressions from ou tside, but lives within the free flow of thoughts. That, my dear friends, is an activity which aims at knowledge in a far deeper sense than the external knowledge of Nature, but it is at the same time artistic, wholly identical with artistic activity. So that the moment pure thinking is experienced as will, man's attitude becomes that of an artist. And this, my dear friends, is like-wise the attitude we need today in the teacher if he is to guide and lead the young from the time of the ch ange of teeth to puberty, or even beyond puberty. The mood of soul should be so that out of the inner life of soul one comes to a second man, who cannot be known as is the oute r physical body, which can be studied physiologically or anatomically, but who must be li vingly experienced and may rightly be called, in accordance with the real meaning of the terms, “life body” or “ether body”. This cannot be known through external perception but mus t be inwardly experienced. To know this second man a kind of artistic activity must be unfolded. Hence there is this mood in the Philosophy of Spiritual Activity which most people never discover — everywhere it touches the level of the artistic. Only most people do not discover this because they look for the artistic in the trivial, in the naturalistic and no t in free activity. Only out of this free activity"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"c a n education really be experienced as art, and the t eacher can become an artist in education when he finds his way into this mood. The n in our epoch of the consciousness soul all teaching will be so arranged as to create an artistic atmosphere between teacher and pupil. And within this artistic atmosphere ther e can develop that relation between led and leader which is an inclining towards the leader , because he can do something which he is able to show forth artistically, and one feels t hat what he can do one would like to be able to do oneself. Thus no opposition is aroused becaus e it is felt that one would destroy oneself by opposing. Because of the way writing is taught today, it ofte n happens that even as a child — for in the child there is always a being who is cleverer t han the teacher — one asks: Why should I be bothered to write? I have no kind of relationshi p to writing — which is really what the North American Indians felt when they saw European s cript. They felt the black signs to be witchcraft. The feeling of the child is very simila r. But let us awaken in the child what it means to look at black, red, green, yellow, white. Let us call up in him what it is when we surround a point by a circle. Let us call up the gr eat experience contained in the difference there is when we draw two green circles and in each of them three red circles, then two red and in each of them three green, two yellow with th ree blue ones in them, then two blue containing three yellow circles. We let the childre n experience in the colors what the colors as such are saying to the human being, for in the w orld of color lives a whole world. But we also let the children experience what the colors ha ve to say to one another, what green says to red, what blue says to yellow, blue to green and red to blue — here we have the most wonderful relation between the colors. We shall not do this by showing the child symbols or allegories, but we shall do it in an artistic way. Then we shall see how out of this artistic feeling the child gradually puts down figures out o f which the letters then develop as writing once developed from picture-script. How for eign to the child today are B, G, or any other sign that has developed through inner necessi ty to its present form. What is a G, K, or U to a seven-year old? He really has not the slight est kinship with it. it has taken the human being thousands of years to acquire this relationsh ip. The child must acquire an aesthetic relation to it. Everything is exterminated in the c hild because the written characters are not human; and the child wants to remain human. In order to understand youth in its relation to the older generation we must go right into the art of education. The cleft between age an d youth must be bridged not by hollow phrases but by education that is an art, education which is not afraid to find its support in real spiritual-scientific knowledge. That is why I said a few days ago: Where does this art lead to? It leads to experience of the real spiritu al. And where goes what the age has gradually developed in such a way that it believes it must be given as a matter of course to the young? Where does that lead? It does not lead t o the Spirit but to that which is devoid of Spirit. It is regarded a sin to bring the Spirit into what goes by the name of knowledge and science. Science does not leave the human being alone even i n earliest childhood. It cannot very well be otherwise. For the teacher is so drilled in systematized botany (and many books are entirely given over to systematized botany) that he believes he is committing a sin if he speaks to the children about botany in a way that i s not scientific. But what is found in a botanical textbook cannot mean anything to a child before he is ten, and it is not until he is at least eighteen or nineteen that it can acquire a ny real significance for him."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Su c h is the situation. Now I have no intention of creat ing another intellectual theory about education. The aim is to create an artistic a tmosphere between the older and the younger. But when this comes about, something happe ns which must occur if young people are to grow into the world in a healthy way. What t he human being of today grows into can be described quite concretely. Between the ninth an d tenth years an undefined feeling lives in the soul of every human being who is not a psych opath. There need not necessarily exist either a clear or unclear concept of this. But it b egins to live within the human being from his ninth or tenth year. Up till then what is calle d the astral body alone is concerned with man's life of soul. But from that time onwards the force of the ego nature first begins to stir. It is not formulated in concepts. But in the life o f feeling, deep within the soul, there lives unconsciously a question in the heart of the growin g human being. This question takes different forms in different people. But a question arises which put in the form of a concept might be expressed as follows: Up to now the astral body has believed in other human beings; now I need something that somebody says to me so that I may believe in him or in others in my environment. Those who as children hav e most resisted this are those who need it most. Between the ninth and tenth years the human being, to strengthen his ego, begins to be dependent on an older person in whom h e can trust — without this trust needing to be drummed in — in whom he can believe w ith the help of the artistic atmosphere that has been created. And woe betide it if this question which may still be one for many children up to their sixteenth or seventee nth year and sometimes even to the years I mentioned yesterday, the eighteenth or nine teenth — woe betide it if nothing happens to enable this question of the young to be answered by the old so that the young say: I am grateful that I have learnt from the old what I can learn only from the old; what he can tell me, he alone can tell me, for it will b e different if I learn it when I am old. Through this can be created something in an educati onal way which, applied in the right way, can be of the greatest significance for the epoch of the consciousness soul, which, in fact, in the earliest times of the Patriarchs, w as already alive between young and old. Then, every young person said to himself: The old m an with his snow-white hair has experiences which can only come when one is as old as he. Before then the necessary organs are not there. Therefore he must tell his ex periences to us. We are dependent on what he relates because he alone can relate it. Cer tainly I shall one day be as old as he. But I shall not experience what he tells for thirty-five or forty years. The times will have progressed by then and I shall experience something different. But what I want to learn is only to be learnt from him. Here is something in the spiritual realm which may be compared with feeding at the mother's breast. Just as the infant might say: “I t oo shall one day give the breast to a child, but now it is my mother who must give it to me” — s o it is in the spiritual life. In the foundations of the spirit life of the world it is a s though a chain were there, reaching from the past over into the future, which must be receiv ed by each generation into itself, must be carried onwards, re-forged, perfected. This chain h as been broken in the age of intellectualism. This was generally felt among thos e growing up about the turn of the nineteenth century. Try to feel that you did experi ence something of the kind, even if at the time you were not able to express it. Try to sense that by feeling this, you were feeling about it in the right way. And if you sense this you will realize the true significance of the youth movement today, the youth movement which has, and m ust have, a Janus-head, because it"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"is directed towards experience of the spiritual — a n experience of the spiritual which carries thought so far that it becomes will, that i t becomes the innermost human impulse.

The human being who is growing into the epoch of th e consciousness soul is held fast today in the abstract ideas of the head. But there lives outside man's head, if I may so express myself, the desire to experience more than the head is able to. To begin with man has only a connection with Nature formed between he r and his head. Everything he absorbs in science, so far as he regards it as vali d, is acquired from Nature through the head. Between man and Nature today there always sta nds man's head. It is as though everything that comes to the human being from the w orld were to pour itself into the head, as though the head were entirely choked up so that it lets nothing through its dense layers that could bring about a relation with the world. E verything remains stuck fast in the head. Man thinks everything through only with his head. B ut he cannot, after all, live merely as a head. For joined to the head there is always the re st of the organism. The life of the rest of the organism remains dull, unconscious, because eve rything is directed towards the head. Everything stops short there. The rest of man recei ves nothing from the world because the head allows nothing to reach it. The head has gradu ally become an insatiable glutton. It wants everything that comes from the world outside, and man is obliged to live, where his heart and the rest of his organism is concerned, as if he had nothing whatever to do with the surrounding world. But these other parts of the organism develop wish, will, capacity for desire; they feel themselves isolated. For instance, the eyes catch c olors and allow only scanty remains to be experienced in the head, so that the colors cannot work down, they cannot reach the blood nor the nervous system in the rest of the body. It is only in his head that man still knows something about the world. But he has all the more capacity for intensely desiring with the rest of his organism to meet the outside world. Thi s again is something living in the maturing human being — this desire to find some kin d of connection with the world not only with the head but with the rest of the organis m; to learn to think not only with the head but with the whole man; to learn to experience the world with the whole man and not only with the head. Now human beings today still have the capacity of l earning to experience the world with the whole man at an early age. For what I have just been saying refers to the grown man. Before the change of teeth a child still has the fa culty of grasping the world with his whole being. This is shown, for example, in the fact that it would be a mistake to suppose that the baby's experience when sucking milk is as abstract as an adult's. When we drink milk we taste it on our tongue, and perhaps round our tongu e. But we lose the experience of taste when the milk has passed our throat. People ought t o ask why their stomach should be less capable of tasting than the palate — it is not less but equally capable of tasting; only the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"head is a glutton. In the grown man the head claims all taste for itself. The child, however, tastes with its entire organism and therefore with its stomach. The infant is all sense-organ. There is nothing in him that is not sense-organ. Th e infant tastes with his whole being. Later this is forgotten by man; and this tasting is impaired by the child learning to speak. For then the head which has to take part in learnin g to speak begins to stir and develops the first stage of insatiability. The head in retur n for giving itself up to learning to speak reserves for itself the pleasures of tasting. Even as regards “tasting the world,” connection with the world is very soon lost. Now this “tasting the world” is of no particular importance, but the relation of the whole human being with the world is. You see, we can get to know an important philosophe r such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte, for example, in various ways. Every way is right. I do not wish to stress any one of the following in particular. It is wonderful to go deep ly into the philosophy of Fichte — which not many people do nowadays because they find it to o difficult — and much is gained from it, yet they would have gained far more if with str ong feeling they had walked behind Fichte and had seen him appear, planting the whole sole of his foot and especially his heels firmly on the ground. The experience of Johann Gottlieb Fi chte's walk, the curious way he stumped his heel on the ground, is something of tre mendous power. For those able to experience each step with the whole being, this wou ld have been a more intensive philosophy than all Fichte was able to say from the platform. It may seem grotesque, but perhaps you will feel what I am trying to say. Today such things have been entirely lost. At most a man, who not twenty but fifty years ago was a boy, can remember how some philosophy of this kind still existed among the country folk. In the country people still got to kn ow each other in this way and many expressions with the wonderful plasticity of dialec t reveal that what today is seen only with the head was then seen with the whole man.* (An inc ident is quoted here which is untranslatable because of the Austrian idiom.) As I have said, these things have been lost. Human beings have reduced themselves to their head and have forced themselves to believe th at the head is their most valuable part. But this has not brought them to an ideal condition , because the rest of human nature asserts its claims in the subconscious. Experiencin g through something other than the head is lost today with the change of teeth in early chi ldhood. If you have an eye for these things you can see the walk of the father or the mother in the son or daughter decades later. So exactly has the child lived itself into the adults around him that what he has felt becomes part of his own nature. But this living ourselves i nto something no longer spells culture with us. Culture is what the head observes and what can be worked out by means of the head. Sometimes people dispense with the head, and then they write down everything and put it in the archives! Then it goes out of the hea d into the hair where it cannot be retained because at thirty they no longer have any hair! But really I am not saying this as a joke, nor for the sake of being critical, for this is all part of the necessary development of humanity. Men had to become like this to find through inner effort, inner activity, what they can no longer find in a natural way; in other words, to experience freedom. And so today, after the change of teeth, we must si mply pass over to a different way of"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"experiencing the surrounding world from the way of the child who experiences it with his whole being. Therefore primary school education in future must proceed by way of the artistic I described yesterday, so that through the outer man the soul-nature of another human being is experienced. If you educate the huma n being by what is abstract and scientific, he experiences nothing of your soul. He only experiences your soul if you approach him through art. For in the realm of the a rtistic everyone is individual, each one is a different person. It is the ideal of science t hat everyone should be alike. It would be quite a thing — so say people today — were everyone to teach a different science. But that could not be, for science confines itself to what i s the same for all human beings. In the realm of the artistic each human being is an indivi duality in himself. But because of this there can come about an individual, personal relati on of the child to the man who is alive and active artistically, and this should be so. Tru e, one does not come to the feeling for the whole man as outer physical being as in the first y ears of childhood, but to a feeling for the whole man in the soul of the one who is to lead. Education must have soul, and as scientist one cann ot have soul. We can have soul only through what we are artistically. We can have soul if we give science an artistic form through the way it is presented, but not through th e content of science as science is understood today. Science is not an individual affa ir. Hence during the primary school age it establishes no relation between teacher and pupi l. All instruction must therefore be permeated by art, by human individuality, for of mo re value than any thought-out curriculum is the individuality of the teacher and educator. It is individuality that must work in the school. What grows between teacher and pupil from the change of teeth to puberty — what is the link between them? What binds them together is solely what man brings with him into his earthly existence from supersensible, spiritual worlds, from his pre- earthly existence. My dear friends, it is never the head that recognizes what man brings with him out of his pre-earthly life. The head is made for the purpose of grasping what is on the earth. And on the earth there is only the physical part of man. The head understands nothing of what confronts one as the other human being and comes from pre-earthly existe nce. In the particular coloring the artistic impulse gives to the human soul there live s and weaves what the human being has brought down from pre-earthly existence; and betwee n the period of the change of teeth and puberty the child is particularly disposed to f eel in his heart what meets him in the teacher as coming out of pre-earthly existence. A y oung child has the tendency to feel the outer human form in its earthly shape; from his sev enth to his fourteenth or fifteenth year he seeks — not through theoretical concepts but thr ough the living-together with human beings — what does not lend it self to be grasped i n concepts but is manifested in the teacher; and it resists conceptual form. Concepts h ave form, that is to say, external limits. But human individuality in the sense described has no external limits, only intensity, quality; it is experienced as quality, as intensity , very particularly in the period of life referred to. It is experienced, however, through no other atmosphere than that of art. But we are now living in the epoch of the conscious ness soul. The first treasures we acquire for the soul in this epoch consist in intel lectual concepts, in abstractions. Today even the farmer loves abstractions. How could it be otherwise, for he indulges in the most abstract reading — the village newspaper and much e lse besides! Our riches consist really in abstractions. And therefore we must free ourselv es from this kind of thinking, through"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"developing what I spoke of yesterday. We must purif y our thinking and mould it, into will. To this end we must make our individuality stronger and stronger, and this happens when we work our way through to pure thinking. I do not say this out of idle vanity, but because that is how I see it. Whoever works his way through to pure thinking as I have described in my Philosophy of Spiritual Activity will find that this does not bring him simply to the possession of a few concepts which make up a philos ophic system, but that it lays hold of his own individuality, of his pre-earthly existence . He need not suddenly become clairvoyant; that will only happen when he is able to behold the pre-earthly. But he can confirm it by ga ining the strength of will that is acquired in the flow of pure thoughts. Then the individualit y comes forth. Then one does not feel happy with a philosophic system in which one concep t proceeds from another and everything has rigid outlines. But one feels compel led to have one's being in a living and weaving world. We acquire a special kind of life of soul when we experience in the right way what is meant by the Philosophy of Spiritual Activity . Thus it is a bringing down of pre-earthly existence into the life of the human being. But it is also the preparation for the vocation of teac her, of educator. Through study we cannot become teachers. We cannot drill others into being teachers, because each one of us is already a teacher. Every human being is a teacher, but he is sleeping and must be awakened, and Art is the awakener. When this is dev eloped it brings the teacher, as a human being, nearer to those whom he would educate. And as a human being he must come near to them. Those who are to be educated mus t get something from him as a human being. It would be terrible if anyone were to believe it possible to teach just because he knows a great deal. This leads to absolute absur dity. This absurdity will be apparent to you if you think about the following picture. Now take a class in a school. There are perhaps thi rty pupils in the class. Among these pupils there are, let us say, two geniuses, or only one, for that is enough. If we have to organize a school we cannot always give the post of teacher to a genius just for a future genius to be able to learn all he should be able to learn. You will say that this would not matter in the primary school. If the child is a gen ius he will go on to a higher school and there certainly find geniuses as teachers. You woul d not say this because experience does not bear it out — but you must admit the case may a rise that the teacher is faced with a class in which there are children predestined to be come cleverer than he is himself. Now our task of teacher consists in bringing the childr en not merely to our degree of cleverness, but to the full development of their own powers. As teachers, therefore, we may come into the positi on of having to educate somebody who will be greater than we. It is impossible to pr ovide schools with enough teachers unless one holds to the principle that it does not matter if the teacher is not as clever as the pupil will be some day. Nevertheless he will still be a g ood teacher because it does not depend on the giving out of knowledge but on activating the i ndividuality of the soul, upon the pre-earthly existence. Then it is really the child who educates himself through us. And that is the truth. In reality we do not educate at all. We only disturb the process of education when we intervene too energetically. We only educat e when we behave in such a way that through our own behavior the child can educate hims elf. We send the child to primary school in order to rid him of troublesome elements. The teacher should see to it that the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"troublesome elements are got rid of, that the child escapes conditions under which he cannot develop. So we must be quite clear upon this point: we cannot cram anything into a human being through teaching and education. What we can do is to see to it that the human being, as he grows up, should succeed in developing the abilities within him. That we can do, but not through what we know but through what s tirs inwardly within us in an artistic way. And even if the rare thing should happen that as teachers we are not particularly endowed with genius — one should not say this, but in spite of your youth movement you are old enough for me to say it — if the teacher ha s only a kind of instinctive artistic sense he will offer less hindrance to the growth of the c hild's soul than the teacher who is inartistic and tremendously learned. To be tremendo usly learned is not difficult. These things must for once be said most emphaticall y. For even when spoken clearly, our age does not hear them. Our age is terribly unr eceptive for such things. And regarding those who assure one that they have understood ever ything, after thirty years it is often apparent that they have understood nothing whatever . Thus the configuration of soul in the human being is what is essential in practical pedag ogy, in instruction and education, during the child's life between the change of teeth and pu berty. And after this the human being enters a period of life in which, in this age of th e consciousness soul, still deeper forces must work up out of human nature if men are to give anything to one another. You see, the feeling with which one man meets anoth er is tremendously complicated. If you wanted to describe the whole round of sympathie s and antipathies, and the interworking of sympathies and antipathies with whi ch you meet another man, you would never come to an actual definition. In fifty years you would not succeed in defining what you can experience in five minutes as the relations of life between man and man. Before puberty it is pre-eminently an experience of the pr e-earthly. The pre-earthly sheds its light through every movement of the hands, every look, th rough the very stressing of words. Actually it is the quality of the gesture, the word , the thought, of the teacher that works through to the child and which the child is seeking . And when as grown-up people — so grown-up that we h ave reached the age of fifteen or sixteen or even beyond! — we meet other human being s, then the matter is still more complicated. Then, what attracts or repels others i n a human being actually veils itself in a darkness impenetrable to the world of abstract conc epts. But if, with the help of Anthroposophy, we investigate what one can really e xperience in five minutes but cannot describe in fifty years, we find that it is what ri ses up from the previous earth-life or series of earth-lives into the present life of the soul, a nd what is exchanged. This indefinite, indefinable element that comes upon us when we meet as adults is what shines through from earlier lives on earth into the present. Not o nly the pre-earthly existence but everything the human being has passed through in th e way of destiny in his successive earth-lives. And if we study what is working upon the human bein g we find how today, in the epoch of the consciousness soul — because everything is p ushed into the head and what we take in from the outer world cannot get through to man a s a whole — our head culture sets itself against what alone can work from man to man. Human beings pass one another by because they stare at each other only with the head, with t he eyes — I will not say, because they knock their heads together! Human beings pass one a nother by because only what plays"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"over from repeated earth-lives can work between man and man, and modern culture does nothing to develop a sense for this. But this must also be brought into our education; we should be able to experience what is deeper down in man, what plays over from previous earth-lives. This will not be achieved unless we dr aw into our education the whole life of man as it is lived out on earth. Today there is only a feeling for the immediate pre sent. Therefore all that is asked of education is that it shall benefit the child. But i f this is the only thing that is asked, very little service is rendered to life. Firstly, becaus e the question is put one-sidedly, one gets a one-sided answer; and secondly, the child should be educated for the whole of life, not only for the schoolroom or the short period after school so that he does not disgrace us. But we need an understanding for the imponderable things i n life, an understanding for the unity in man's life as a whole as it unfolds on earth. There are human beings whose very presence, at a ce rtain age, is felt by those around them as a benediction. There are such human beings. If we were to look for the reason why such people, not through their acts but through the ir being, have become a blessing to those around them, we would find that as children they we re fortunate to have been able in a natural way to look up to someone in authority whom they could revere. They had this experience at the right time of life. And because t hey were able to revere, after many years they become a blessing to the world around them. It can be expressed concisely by saying: There are human beings who can bless. There are not many who can bless. But it is a question of the power to bless. There are men who c ertainly have the power to bless. They acquire it in later life, because in their childhoo d they have learnt to pray. Two human gestures are causally connected: the gestures of pr aying and blessing; the second develops from the first. No one learns to bless who does not learn it from prayer. This must not be understood sentimentally or with the slightest ting e of mysticism, but rather as a phenomenon of Nature is observed — except that this phenomenon is nearer to us in a human way. Now we have to care for a child hygienically so tha t he can grow in accordance with nature. If you were to devise an apparatus for a ch ild that would keep him a certain size so that he could not grow, so that even the size of hi s arm would not change and the young human being would remain as he is all his life, thi s would be terrible. The human being must be treated in such a way that he can grow. Wha t would it be like were the little child not to change, were he to look no different ten yea rs hence? It would be dreadful were he to remain as he is at four or five. But in school w e supply the children with concepts and cherish the notion that they should remain unchange d for the whole of the children's lives. The child is supposed to preserve them in memory; f ifty years hence they are to be the same as they are today. Our school text-books ensur e that the child remains a child. We should educate the child so that all his concepts a re capable of growth, that his concepts and will-impulses are really alive. This is not eas y. But the artistic way of education succeeds in doing it. And the child has a different feeling when we offer him living concepts instead of dead ones, for unconsciously he knows th at what he is given grows with him just as his arms grow with his body. It is heart-breaking to witness children being educ ated to define a concept, so that they have the concept as a definition only. It is just t he same as if we wanted to confine a limb in"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"an apparatus. The child must be given pictures capa ble of growth, pictures which become something quite different in ten or twenty years. I f we give him pictures that are capable of growth, we stimulate in him the faculty through fee ling to find his way into what is often hidden in the depths of the human individuality. An d so we see how complicated are the connections We learn to come to a deeper relation t o human beings through the possibility being given us in our youth for growth in our life of soul. For what does it mean to experience another human b eing? We cannot experience other people with dead concepts. We can comprehend them o nly if we meet them in such a way that they become for us an experience which takes h old of us inwardly, which is something for our own inner being. For this, however, activit y in the inner being is needed. Otherwise our culture will reach the point which it is fast a pproaching. People go out to luncheons, dinners and teas, without knowing much about one an other. Yet it is about themselves that, relatively speaking, modern people know most. And w hat do they instinctively make of their experiences? Suppose they go about among the people they meet at lunch or dinner. At most they think — Is he like me or is he differe nt? And if we believe him to be like ourselves, we consider him a fine fellow; if he is not like ourselves, then he is not a fine fellow and we do not trouble ourselves about him an y longer. And as most men are not the same as ourselves, the most we can do is sometimes to believe — because really it would be too boring to find no fine fellow anywhere — that w e have found someone like ourselves. But in this way we do not really find another human being but always ourselves. We see ourselves in everyone else. For many people this is relatively good. For if they were to meet somebody who in their opinion was not altogether, b ut yet to a certain extent, a fine fellow, and were really to comprehend him, this would be so overwhelming an experience that it would quite drown their own manhood, and by a secon d encounter their ego would be drowned still more deeply. In the case of a third o r fourth there would be no approaching him at all, for by that time he would certainly hav e lost himself! There is too little inner strength and activity, too little kernel, too littl e inner individuality developed, so that people for fear of losing themselves dare not exper ience the other human being. Thus men pass one another by. The most important thing is to establish an educati on through which human beings learn once again how to live with one another. This cannot be done through hollow phrases. It can be done only through an art of educ ation founded upon a true knowledge of the human being, that art of education referred to here. But our intellectualistic age has plunged the whole of life into intellectuality. In our institutions we actually live very much as if no longer among human beings at all, we live in an embodied intellect in which we are entangled, not like a spider in its own web, but li ke countless flies which have got themselves caught. When we meet anyone, do we feel in any sense what t his human being can become for us? Do we judge today as humanly as this? No, for t he most part we do not — present company is always excepted — for the most part we d o not but we ask — well, perhaps on the door of a certain man's house there will be a l ittle plate with an inscription “Counselor at Law,” conveying a concept of some kind. So now w e know something about this man. In another case the inscription is “Medical Practition er.” Now we know that the man can cure us. In another case the inscription is “Professor o f English.” And now we know something about him — and so on and so forth. If we want to k now something about chemistry, how"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"do we set about it? We have no other means than to enquire if somewhere there is a man who is a qualified chemist. What he can tell us the n is chemistry. And so we go on. We are really caught up in this spider's web of concepts. We do not live among human beings. We trouble ourselves very little about human beings. W e only concern ourselves with what is on paper. For many people that is their only essent ial fact. How else should they know what kind of man I am unless it is written down som ewhere on paper! This, of course, is all rather an overstatement, an d yet it does characterize our epoch. Intellectuality is no longer merely in our heads bu t it is woven around us everywhere. We are guided by concepts and not by human impulses. When I was still fairly young, at Baden near Vienna I got to know the Austrian poet Hermann Rollett, long since dead. He was convinced that the right thing was development towards intellectualism, that one must develop more and more towards the intellectual. At the same time, however, he had an incurable dread o f this, for he felt that intellectualism only takes hold of man's head. And once when I visi ted him with Schröer, we were talking with him and he began to speak in poetical fashion about his incurable fear in regard to culture. He said: When one looks at human beings to day, they cannot use their fingers properly; many of them cannot write; they get write r's cramp, their fingers atrophy. When it is a question of sewing on trouser buttons, only tailors can do that! It is dreadful; the limbs are atrophying. The fingers and the limbs wil l not only get less skillful but they will also get smaller, they will wither away and heads w ill get larger and larger. That is how he described his poet's dream and then he said he thou ght the time would come when only balls, balls which are heads, would be rolling abou t over the surface of the earth. That was the cultural dread I met with in this man in the last third of the nineteenth century. Now he was also a child of his age, that i s to say, he was a materialist, and that was why he had so great a dread that at some point in t he future such living heads would be rolling about on the earth. Physical heads will not do this. But to a serious extent the etheric and astral heads do it already today. And a healthy education of the young must preserve human beings from this, must set human bei ngs upon their legs again, and lead them to the point where, if they are pondering over something, they will feel the beating of their heart again and not merely add something to t heir knowledge. With this we must reckon if in preparation for man's future, we penet rate ourselves with the art that must enter education. What more there is to be said on t his subject I shall try to develop for you tomorrow."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Younger Generation Younger Generation: Lecture X II XII FROM what has bee n said during the last few days it will be clear th at nowadays one human being meets another in a different way from w hat was the case in the past, and this is of quite recent date — in fact, it entered human evolution with the century. In poetical language no longer suitable for today, former ages foretold what in this century has come for the whole of humanity. Former ages spoke of how, at the end of the nineteenth century, the so-called Dark Age would ha ve run its course, how in a new age there must come quite new conditions in human evolu tion, conditions difficult to attain because at first man is not accustomed to them. And in spite of the fact that we have now entered an epoch of light, much will seem more chao tic than what was brought by the long, gloomy Age of Darkness. We must not merely translate into our language what was formerly presented in a picture derived from ancient clairvoyant vision: if so, we should be understanding only the old again. We must learn to perceive it anew with t he spiritual means of today. We must permeate ourselves deeply with the consciousness th at in this epoch for the first time human ego meets human ego in an intercourse of soul that is free of all veils. Were we to go back to the first epoch after the gre at Atlantean earth-catastrophe, to the seventh or eighth millennium before Christ, we shou ld find that fully grown men actually confronted one another as today only the child conf ronts grownups, with comprehension of the complete human being as I characterized it yest erday, a comprehension where soul and spirit are not found separated from the body but wh ere the physical body is perceived as being of the nature of soul and spirit. In the epoc h I have called the ancient Indian, which followed immediately upon the Atlantean catastrophe , the human being did not consider soul and spirit in the abstract way that we do toda y, with a certain justification. It is precisely expressions used in this most ancie nt epoch which seem to us entirely spiritual which are misunderstood today. We misunde rstand them if we believe that in the first post-Atlantean epoch of culture men overlooke d all they saw in the outer world and were only willing to concentrate on what existed ou tside the world of the senses. This was by no means the case. They had a much fuller percep tion of, let us say, a human movement, or of the play of expression on a countenance, or o f the way young people grow in five years, or of the plastic development of new leaves and blossoms in a plant, or in an animal of the way the whole of its forces pour into the ho of and other parts of its leg. Men did direct their gaze into the world we call that of th e senses, but in the material processes they saw the Spiritual. For them what in the material wo rld presented itself to their senses was at the same time spiritual. Naturally, such percept ion was only possible because over and above what we see in the sense-world, they actually perceived the Spiritual. They saw not only the meadow carpeted with flowers but over the flowers they saw in a vibrating, active existence the cosmic forces which draw forth the pl ants from the earth. In a certain way"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"they saw — it seems grotesque to modern man but I a m telling you facts — how the human being bears on his head a kind of etheric, astral c ap. In this etheric, astral cap they experienced the forces underlying the growth of the hair. People today are prone to believe that the hair grows out of the head simply by being pushed from inside, whereas the truth is that outer Nature draws it forth. In olden times men saw the reality of things which later as an artistic copy shed their light into civilizat ion. Just think of the helmet of Pallas Athene for instance which quite obviously belongs to the h ead. Those who do not rightly experience this helmet think of it as placed upon h er head. It is not placed upon the head. It is bestowed by a concentration of raying cosmic forces that are working around the head of Pallas Athene and densifying, so that in olden t imes it would have seemed impossible to the Greek to form the head of Pallas Athene without this covering. They would have felt as we do today about a scalped head. I am not saying t hat this was the case among Greeks of later times. In ancient times men were able to experience the se nse-world as having soul and spirit, because they experienced something of an etheric an d soul-spiritual nature. But these men did not ascribe any great importance to the soul an d spirit. People readily believe that in the oldest Mysteries the pupils were principally ta ught that the sense world is semblance and the spiritual world the only reality, but this is not true. The strivings of the Mysteries were directed to making the material world comprehe nsible to the human soul by the roundabout way of comprehending what is of the natu re of soul and spirit. Already in the epoch of the first post-Atlantean cu lture, the Mysteries were striving to understand man as a being of soul and spirit, and p articularly inwardly — not theoretically — to feel, to interpret any manifestation of the ph ysical man in terms of the spirit. For example, it would have been impossible for them to have given a mechanistic explanation of walking, because they knew that when man walks h e has an experience with every step, an experience which today lies deep beneath the thr eshold of consciousness. Why do we walk? We walk because when we stretch our leg forwa rd and put down our foot, we come into a different relation to the earth and to the h eavens, and in the perception of this change — that we place one foot into a different de gree of warmth from that in which the other foot has remained — in the perception of this interchanging relation to the cosmos there lies something that is not only mechanical bu t distinctly super-dynamic. This was the perception in more ancient times; the gaze of the human being even then was directed to man's external form, to his externa l movements. And it would never have occurred to the men of that time to imagine that wh at they saw as dumb show in Nature — the growth and configuration of plants, the growth and configuration of animals — was to be interpreted in the way that we scientifically do today. In the human heart and mind there was something altogether different; a man, be longing to the old Indian civilization to which I referred yesterday, felt it as entirely nat ural that during a certain period of the year the earth breathes in the being of the heavens, and during another period of the year she does not breathe in but works within herself by shu tting out the heavens. It was natural for it to be different in ancient India because climati c conditions were different. But were we in imagination to extend our own climatic conditions w e should have to say: During the summer the earth sleeps, gives herself up to the he avenly forces, receives the power of the sun in such a way that this power of the sun pours into the earth's unconsciousness. Summer is the sleep of the earth. Winter is her wak ing. During the winter the earth thinks"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"through her own forces what during the summer in he r sleeping and dreaming she has thought in relation with the heavens. During the wi nter the earth works over in her own being what during the summer has come to her throug h the in-working of the forces and powers of the cosmos. Nowadays little is known of these things — in pract ical knowledge, I mean — as when the peasant out in the country puts potatoes into t he ground during the winter. But nobody thinks about the fate of these potatoes because men have lost the faculty of getting right into the being of Nature. It would never have occur red to human beings who felt in this way to look out into Nature at animals, plants and mine rals shining and sparkling in their color, to imagine that in this there is one single reality , a dance of atoms — that would have seemed utterly unreal. “But man needs this dance of atoms for his calculations about Nature.” Yes, that is just it, people believe they need the dance of atoms to be able to make calculations about Nature. Calculations in those da ys meant being able to live in numbers and magnitudes and not having to attach these numbe rs and magnitudes to what is only densified materiality. I do not want to raise objec tions against the service densified materiality renders today, yet one must mention how different the configuration of souls was in that more ancient age. Then another age came in my book Occult Science. I have called it the old Persian; everything was built upon the principle of authorit y. People preserved during the whole of their life what is today experienced in a dull, rep ressed form between the seventh and fourteenth years. They took it with them into later life. It was more intimate but at the same time more intense. In a certain sense human beings looked through the external movement, through man's external physiognomy, or th rough a flower. They looked at something that was less outwardly objective. What t hey saw gradually became only a revelation of what exists as true reality. For the first post-Atlantean epoch of civilization the whole external world was simply reality, spiritual reality. The human being was spirit. He had a head, two arms and a body, and that was spiri t. There was nothing to deter the ancient Indian from addressing the being he saw sta nding on two legs, with arms and a head, as spirit. In the next epoch men already saw more deeply into things. It was more in the nature of a surface behind which something more etheric was perceived, a human being more in a form of light. Man had the faculty of perceiving this form of light because atavistic clairvoyance was still present. And then came the epoch of the third post-Atlantean culture. One felt the need for penetrating still further into the inner being of m an or of Nature. The outer had become clearly perceptible and man is beginning to look th rough the outer perceptible to the spirit and soul within. The Egyptians, who belong to this epoch of the third post-Atlantean culture, mummified the human body. In the epoch of the old Indian culture, mummification would have made no sense; it would ha ve been a fettering of the spirit. A distinction had arisen between body and spirit by t he time mummification was practised. Formerly men would have felt they were imprisoning the human spirit, no distinction having been made yet between body and spirit, if th e body had been embalmed as mummy. Then among the Greeks — and actually into our own t ime — there was already a clearly established separation between the body and the spi rit and soul. Today we can do no other than keep these two apart, the bodily and the soul- spiritual. Thus in earlier epochs man"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"really saw the ego through sheaths. Imagine the ancient Indian. He did not look at man' s ego. His language was such that it really only expressed outwardly visible gestures an d outwardly visible surfaces. The whole character of Sanscrit, if studied according to its spirit and not only according to its content, is of the nature of gesture, of surface; it express es itself above all in movement and contour. The ego was therefore seen through the sheath of th e physical body, in the next epoch through the sheath of the etheric, in the third epo ch through the sheath of the astral man, man's ego still remaining indefinite, until in our epoch having cast off its veil it enters into human intercourse. No one can adequately describe the impulse that has entered modern evolution, unless he draws attention to the relationship of ego to eg o, free from the sheaths, which is emerging in a totally new way, though slowly, today . I shall not speak in the usual sense of our age being an age of transition. For I should li ke to know which age is not! Every age is an age of transition from the preceding one to the one that follows. And as long as one simply says — Our age is an age of transition — wel l, it remains just a hollow phrase. There is something to grasp only when one describes what makes a transition. In Our age we are going over from experiencing the other man through sheaths, to direct experience of the other man's ego. And this is the difficulty in our life of soul; we have to live into this quite new relation between man and man. Do not think that we must lear n all the teachings about the ego. It is not a question of learning theories about the ego. No matter whether you are a peasant on the land or someone working with his hands, or a sc holar, it holds good for all of you that at the present time, in so much as we have to do with civilized men, their egos meet without sheaths. But that gives its special coloring to the whole of our cultural development. Try to develop a feeling for how in the Middle Ages there was still much that was elementary in the way in which one human being expe rienced another. Let us imagine ourselves in a medieval town. Let us say, a locksmith meets a town councilor in t he street. Now what was experienced was not just that the man knew the other to be a to wn councilor; it was not exhausted by the locksmith knowing — we have elected that man. I t is true there existed a link which gave the men a certain stamp. One belonged to the t ailors' guild, one to the locksmiths' guild. But this was experienced in a more individua l way. And when one as locksmith met a town councilor, he knew from other sources than fro m the directory: That is a town councilor. For the man walked differently, his look was different, he carried his head differently. People knew that he was a town council or from things other than documents, the newspaper or things of the sort. One man experi enced the other, but experienced him through his sheaths. But in the sense of modern evolution we must increa singly experience human beings without sheaths. This has gradually arisen. But in a certain sense men are afraid of it. If we had a cultural psychology then it would describe, i n connection with recent centuries, men's fear of being obliged to consort with human b eings whose egos are unsheathed. It is a kind of terror. In the form of a picture, one might say that those people who in the last"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"century really experienced their own times have fri ghtened eyes. These frightened eyes, which you would not have been able to find either a mong the Greeks or the Romans, make their appearance in the middle of the sixteenth cen tury, especially in the sixteenth century. Then we follow up these frightened eyes in literatu re. For instance, one can form a clear mental picture on reading the writings of Bacon of Verulam. We can glean from his writings with what kind of eyes he looked out at th e world. Still more so with the eyes of Shakespeare. They can be pictured quite clearly. On e need only supplement the words by the descriptions which circulated of Shakespeare's appearance. And so we must picture the people of recent centuries who lived most deeply in their own times as having frightened eyes, an unconsciously frightened look. At least on ce in their lives they had this frightened look. Goethe had it. Lessing had it. Herder had it. Jean Paul never got rid of it to the day of his death. We must have an organ for perceiving the se subtleties if we want to develop any understanding of historical evolution. Men who want to find their way livingly into the tw entieth century should realize that those who represented the nineteenth century can no longer represent the twentieth. It goes without saying that books about Goethe writ ten in the nineteenth century by the philistine Lewes, or the pedant, Richard M. Meyer, can give no real conception of Goethe. The only literary work of the last third of the nin eteenth century which can give some idea of Goethe is at best the Goethe of Herman Grimm. Bu t that is a nightmare to those suffering from the great cultural disease of modern times, philistinism. For in this vast volume on Goethe you find the sentence: “Faust is a work that has fallen from heaven.” Just imagine what the commentators who pull everyth ing to pieces have said; and imagine someone comes along and says that this should not b e pulled to pieces. This may not seem important, yet we must notice such things in speaki ng about cultural phenomena. Read the first chapter of Grimm's Raphael and you will have the feeling: this must be an abomination to every orthodox professor, neverthele ss something of it can be taken over into the twentieth century, for the very reason tha t for the orthodox professor nothing in it is right. Thus man was seen within sheaths. Now we must learn to see him as an ego-being without sheaths. This alarms people because they ar e no longer capable of perceiving what I have described as the sheaths in which, for insur ance, one could have seen our town councilor. It is no longer possible, at any rate no t in Middle Europe, to give people outer representations of the sheaths. For outer represent ations, the sheaths still had a connection with the spiritual content existing in medieval cou ncilors. Today — I must confess — it would be difficult for me to distinguish by their o uter sheaths between a councilor and a privy councilor. In the case of a soldier, in the d ays when militarism was supreme one could still do it. But one had studiously to learn to do it, to make it a special study. It was no longer connected with basic human experience. So there existed a kind of terror, and people made themselves indifferent to it by means of what I described yesterday as the web of intelle ctualism that spreads itself around us, and within which all are caught. In the centers of culture which have retained something of the East, the inner is still brought into a relatio n with the outer, the basic with the intellectualistic. Those of you who come from Vienn a will sense that in the last century this was still very much so. For in Vienna, for instance , a man who wore spectacles was known"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"as “doctor.” People did not bother about the diplom a; they were concerned about the exterior. And anyone who could afford to take a cab was an aristocrat. It was the exterior. There was still a feeling of wanting to live within what can he described in words. The great transition to this newer age consists in man meeting man free of his sheaths — according to his inner disposition, to what the sou l demands; but the capacities for this untrammeled encounter have not yet been acquired; a bove all we have not yet acquired the possibility for a relation between ego and ego. But this must be prepared for by education. That is why the question of education is of such bu rning importance. And now let me tell you quite frankly when the grea t step forward in educational method can first be made towards the individual ego -men of the new age. But I beg you not to use what I am going to say to impress other peop le who are of an opposite opinion, for if you do so the only result will be a volley of abuse against Anthroposophy. We shall work rightly in education only when we have learned to f eel a certain bashfulness about speaking about it at all, when we feel abashed at the idea o f talking about education. This is astonishing but it is true. The way in which educat ion is being talked about will be regarded as shameless in future. Today everyone talks about it and about what he considers right. But education does not allow itself to be tied down in formal concepts, nor is it anything we come to by theorizing. One grows into education by getting older and meeting younger human beings. And only when one has grown older and has met younger people, and through meeting younger people and having once been young oneself we penetrate to the ego — only then can education be taken quite natura lly. Many suggestions about education today seemed to me no different from the content — horrible dictum — of the book of the once famous Kn igge, who also gave directions as to how grownup people should be approached. It is the same with books on good breeding. Therefore what I have said and written about educat ion, and what is attempted practically in the Waldorf School, aims only at saying as much as possible about the characteristics of the human being, in order to learn to know him, not to give directions: “You are meant to do this in such-and-such a way.” Knowledge of man — that is what must be striven for, and the rest left to God, if I may use this religious p hrase. True knowledge of man makes the human being a teacher. For we should really get the feeling that we are ashamed to talk about education. But under the cultural conditions of today we have to do many things that ought to make us ashamed. The time will come when w e shall no longer need to talk about education. Today these ways of thinking are lacking , but only for a little more than a hundred years. Now read Fichte or Schiller thoughtfully. You will find in their writings what to modern people appears quite horrible. They have spoken, fo r example, about the State and about organizations to make the State into what it should be. And they have spoken about the aim of the State, saying: Morality must be such that th e State becomes superfluous, that human beings are capable out of themselves of becoming fr ee men, capable through their morality of making the State superfluous. Fichte said that the State should be an institution which gives over the reins and gradually becomes entirely superfluous. It would ha rdly be possible to demand this of our contemporaries nor would they take it seriously. To day it would make a similar impression"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"as the following incident on a troupe of actors. — A play had been performed for the fiftieth time by a traveling company when the director said: “Now that we have performed this for the fiftieth time, the prompter's box can be dispen sed with.” But the actors were quite terrified at the idea. Finally one of them pulled h imself together and said: “But, sir, then one will see the prompter!” This is about what woul d happen with our men of the present day. They do not see that the prompter, too, can be dispensed with. Thus it is today. The State will have found its best constitution when it makes itself superfluous, but the government officials and the Chancellors and the Pr ivy Councilors — what would they all say to such a thing? Now in practical everyday life we must be right wit hin this great revolution going on in the depths of modern souls if we are to reach an ou tlook where there is as little talk about education as there was in older cultural epochs. Ed ucation was not talked about in earlier days. The science of education first arose when man could no longer educate out of the primal forces of his being. But this is more import ant than is supposed. The boy or girl, seeing the teacher come into the classroom, must no t have the feeling: “He is teaching according to theoretical principles because he does not grasp the subconscious.” They want a human relation with the teacher. And that is alwa ys destroyed when educational principles are introduced. Therefore if we are to g et back to a natural condition of authority between young and old it is of infinite importance, and an absolute necessity, that education shall not be talked about so much, that t here should be no need to talk or think about it as much as is done today. For there are st ill many spheres in which education is conducted according to quite sound principles, alth ough they are beginning to be broken through. You see, theoretically it is all quite clear, and t heoretically people know how to handle the matter, just as it is handled by the academic o pinion of the present-day. But in practice it is quite good if there should happen to anyone w hat happened to me. A friend had scales by his plate and weighed the different foods so as to take the right quantity of each into his organism. From the physiological point of view this was correct — quite definitely so. But picture this transposed into the realm of education . Unfortunately it does happen, though in a primitive way and only in certain connections. But it is more wholesome when this happens intuitively, if parents, instead of buying some special physiological work on nourishment, judge how to feed their children throu gh the feeling of how they themselves were once fed. And so in Pedagogy one must overcome everything which lays down rules as to how much food should be taken into the stomach, and of striving in the sphere of education for real insight into the nature and bein g of man. This insight into the nature of man will have a certain result for the whole of hum an life. You see, whoever comes to an understanding of the h uman being in the way I have been describing during these days, and thereby imbues hi s knowledge with artistic perception, will remain young. For there is some truth in this — once we have grown up we have actually become impoverished. Yet it is of the grea test importance that we should have forces of growth within us. What we have in us as a child is of the utmost importance. But to this we are led back in inner experience through true knowledge of man. We really become childlike when we acquire the right knowledg e of man and thereby qualify ourselves to meet those who are young and those who are still children in the right way."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"There must be a striving that says, not in an egois tical sense as often happens today: “Except ye become as little children ye cannot ente r the Kingdom of Heaven.” We must seek for this even in practical life. Unless we wer e imbued with an active human force which worked in us during childhood, we could never be educators. Pedagogics is not enough if it makes the teacher or educator merely c lever. I do not say that it should make him empty of thought. But in this way one does not become empty of thought. Pedagogics that makes the teacher merely clever is not of the right kind; the right kind of pedagogics makes the teacher inwardly alive and fills him with lifeblood of the soul which pours itself actively into his physical life-blood. And if there is anything by which we can recognize a true teacher or educator, it is that his pedagogica l art has not made him a pedant. Now, my dear friends, that you can find a pedant wo rking in some place is perhaps only a myth or a legend. If teachers are pedants, if the se myths and legends are founded on truth, then we may be sure that pedagogy has taken a wrong road. To avoid giving offense I must assume these legends and myths to be hypotheti cal and say: If pedants and philistines were to be found in the teaching profession it woul d be a sign that our Education is going under. Education is on the ascent only when, in its experience and whole way of working, pedantry and philistinism are driven right out of m en. The true teacher can be no philistine, can be no pedant. In addition to this, so that you may be able to che ck what I have been saying, I ask you to consider from what vocation in life the word ped ant is derived. Then, perhaps, you will be able to contribute to the recognition of the rea lity of what has been indicated; I do not want to enlarge upon it because already much that I have said is being taken amiss. It is only on the assumption mentioned that we can have a right Pedagogy, otherwise it would have to become a Pedagogy in accordance with what I have been giving you in these lectures. Thus in the lecture tomorrow I will attem pt to bring these talks to some conclusion."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Younger Generation Younger Generation: Lecture X III XIII N ATURALLY a great deal more could be said in conclus ion to what I have put before you here. In speaking one is obliged to explain things in words and ideas. What is intended is the unity of character, the unity of force, that on e would wish to make stream through the words and ideas. Let me sum up by using a half pict orial form to convey what I still wish to say to you. Elaborate it for yourselves and you wil l perhaps understand better what I mean. Now from various aspects I have drawn your attentio n to how every civilized human being today lives in intellectualism in a life of c oncepts, which in our epoch has developed in the most intense, penetrating way. Mankind has w orked itself up to the most abstract concepts. You need only compare, for instance, how in an age preceding our own, Dante received descriptions of the world from his teacher . Everything was still permeated with soul, everything was still of a spiritual nature; i t wafted like a magic breath through the whole of Dante's great poem. Then came the time whe n humanity molded what was experienced inwardly into abstract concepts. Men ha ve always had concepts but, as I have already explained to you, they were revealed concep ts, not concepts that no longer corresponded to inner revelations of the soul. Only when men had wrestled through to concepts no longer springing from revelations did t hey evolve concepts from observation of external Nature, and from outer experiments — only then did they allow validity to what was received from outside through mere observation. If we go deeply into the old world of thought, into that of the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, we have the feeling that it w as united with the inner being of the soul. There was still an inner life then, a living from w ithin outwards, an experiencing which arose in man because he had united himself with thi s life. The conceptual system even of the most primitive hu man being is acquired from outside today, from external Nature observed by the senses. And even those who still cling to the older concepts no longer hold to this belief with any depth of conviction, not even the peasant. When something is passed on from outside, something established scientifically and verified by Nature, it becomes the ideal toward s which people strive. But concepts, ideas, arising out of the inner life of the soul, h ave the characteristic by thus struggling out of the soul, as I have already explained, of becomi ng dead concepts. And the human being feels it right that, in so far as they are born out of his inner being, these concepts shall die. But the strange thing that has come to pass during the last few centuries, reaching its culmination in the nineteenth century, is that the concepts dying in the inner being took on fresh life from the outer world. It can actually be proved by a historical phenomenon. Think how Goethe out of his inner being built up a whole conception of evolution. It reached its zenith in his concept of metamorphosis. We have the feeling that we are working out of the living into the dead, but that t he human being has to work into what is dead because the living implies coercion. Freedom c ould only arise by concepts becoming dead. Yet these concepts have taken on new life fro m outer Nature. Inasmuch as"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"D arwinism, for instance, has come upon the scene — e ven in our Middle European civilization — we have concepts and ideas which acq uire new life from outer Nature. But it is a life which devours the human being. Today we must feel the full intensity of being surr ounded by a thinking bound to Nature but which devours the human being. How does it devo ur the human being? With the ideas the most advanced kind of thinking draws from Natur e, we can never understand man. What does our magnificent theory of evolution provi de? It gives us a survey of how animals evolve from animals, and how man stands before us — but only as the culminating point in the ranks of the animal kingdom, and not what we ar e as men. This is what modern civilization tells us. Previous civilizations understood the kingdoms of Nature as arising out of man, modern civilizatio n grasps man as arising out of Nature, as the highest animal. It does not grasp to what exten t animals are imperfect men. If we fill our soul with what our thinking has become through Nature, there appears in the picture of the man-devouring dragon what is the most potent fa ctor in modern civilization. Man feels himself confronting a being who is devouring him. Consider how this devouring has taken effect. Where as from the fifteenth century onwards natural science has been triumphantly progr essing, knowledge of man has been more and more on the downgrade. The human being cou ld only keep going with difficulty, by preserving and handing on the old no longer livin g ideas and traditions. Only with difficulty could man protect himself from having hi s innermost life devoured by the dragon. And in the last third of the nineteenth cen tury the dragon stood with particular intensity before the human being, threatening in th e most terrible way to devour the individual life of the soul. Those who had within t hem a fully developed life of soul felt how the dragon, who was destined for death, had acquire d fresh life in the new age through observation and experiment, but it was a life that devoured the human being. In more ancient times men played a part in producin g the dragon, but endowed with the necessary amount of death-forces, they could ma ster him. In those days man contributed to his experience only as much intellec tuality as he could master through forces of the heart. Now, the dragon has become ste rnly objective; he meets us from outside and devours us as beings of soul. This is the essential characteristic of civilizatio n from the fifteenth century on into the nineteenth. We see it correctly only when we consid er the picture of the dragon; in olden times it had a prophetic meaning and pointed to wha t would come in the future. But olden times were conscious of having given birth to the d ragon, and also of having given birth to Michael or St. George, to forces capable of overcom ing the dragon. But from the fifteenth century and on into the nine teenth, humanity was powerless against this. It was the epoch that has gradually s uccumbed to complete belief in the material world. As a result it had become so paraly zed in its soul-life that in respect of the deepest treasures of the soul, truthfulness had gon e. An era which made the world arise out of the Kant-Laplace primeval nebula which densifies into a globe, and in this process engenders living beings and finally man — could but say: Ultimately such activity must disappear into universal death by warmth, but that will also be the death of everything man"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"has developed in the moral sphere! There have alway s been people who sought to prove that the moral world-order could find a place in a world-order as conceived by Kant-Laplace, ending with universal death, yet such a view is not sincere. And by no means sincere, by no means honest, was the view that cons idered moral development to originate in illusions and disappear when the universal death through warmth brings about complete annihilation. Why did such a view of the world ever arise? Why do es it fundamentally live in all souls today? Because the dragon penetrates even to the re motest country cottage — though not consciously recognized — and slays the heart. Why i s this so? It comes about because man can no longer understand man. For what takes place in man? There is taking place every moment in man what occurs nowhere else in the earthly world around us. He tak es in the foodstuffs from the surrounding world. He takes them from the kingdom o f the living and only to a small extent from what is dead. But foodstuffs as they pa ss through the digestive system are destroyed, even the most living ones. Man takes in living substance and completely destroys it in order to infuse his own life into wh at has been killed. And not until the foodstuffs pass into the lymph ducts is the dead ma de living again in man's inner being. One can see if one penetrates the being of man that in the human organic process, permeated as it is with soul and spirit, matter is completely destroyed and then created anew. In the human organism we have a continual pro cess of destruction of matter so that matter within the human organism can be newly creat ed. Matter is continually being changed into nothingness and newly created in us. The door to this knowledge was firmly barred in the nineteenth century, when man arrived at the law of the conservation of matter an d of energy, and believed that matter is also conserved in the human organism. The establish ment of the law of the conservation of matter is clear proof that the human being is no lo nger inwardly understood. But now consider how infinitely difficult it is tod ay not to be considered a fool if one fights against what is regarded in modern physics a s a definite fact. The law of the conservation of matter and of energy simply means t hat science has entirely barred the way leading to man. There the dragon has entirely devou red human nature. But the dragon must be conquered, and therefore the knowledge must gain ground that the picture of Michael overcoming the dragon is not merely an anci ent picture but that it has reached the highest degree of reality just at this time! It was created in ancient times because men still felt Michael within themselves permeating their unc onscious, and by which they unconsciously overcame what arose out of intellectu alism. Nowadays the dragon has become quite external. Nowadays the dragon encounte rs us from outside, threatening continually to kill the human being. But the dragon must be conquered. He can be conquered only through our becoming aware how Micha el, or St. George, also comes from outside. And Michael, or St. George, who comes from outside, who is able to conquer the dragon, is a true spiritual knowledge which conquer s this center of life (which, for man's inner being is a center of death) — the so-called l aw of the conservation of energy so that in his knowledge man can again become man in a real se nse. Today we dare not; for so long as there is a law of the conservation of matter and of energy, moral law melts away in the"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"u niversal death through warmth — and the Kant-Laplac e theory is no mere phrase! Man's shrinking away from this consequence is the f earful untruth that has penetrated right into the human heart, into the human soul, an d has seized hold of everything in the human being, making him a being of untruth upon the earth. We must acquire the vision of Michael who shows us that what is material on earth does not merely pass through the universal death through warmth, but will at some ti me actually disperse. He shows us that by uniting ourselves with the spiritual world we ar e able to implant life through our moral impulses. Thus what is in the earth begins to be tr ansformed into the new life, into the moral. For the reality of the moral world-order is what th e approaching Michael can give. The old religions cannot do this; they have allowed the mselves to be conquered by the dragon. They accept the dragon who kills man, and by the si de of the dragon establish some special, abstractly moral divine order. But the dragon does not tolerate this; the dragon must be conquered. He does not suffer men to found somethin g alongside him. What man needs is the force that he can gain from victory over the dr agon. You see how profoundly this problem must be grasped . But what has happened in modern civilization? Well, every science has become a metamorphosis of the dragon, all external culture too is an outcome of the dragon. C ertainly, the outer world-mechanism, which lives not only in the machine, but also in ou r social organism, is rightly called a dragon. But besides, the dragon meets us everywhere , whether modern science tells us about the origin of life, about the transformation of living beings, about the human soul, or even in the field of history — everywhere the resul t proceeds from the dragon. This had become so acute in the last third of the nineteenth century, at the turn of the nineteenth century and on into the twentieth, that the growing human being, who longed to know what the old had received, saw the dragon coming towards him in botany, zoology, history, out of every science — saw himself confronted in every sph ere by the dragon waiting to devour the very core of his soul. In our own epoch the battle of Michael with the dra gon has for the first time become real, to the highest degree. When we penetrate into the spiritual texture of the world, we find that with the culmination of the dragon's powe r there also came — at the turn of the nineteenth century — Michael's intervention with wh ich we can unite ourselves. The human being can have, if he will, Spiritual Science ; that is to say, Michael actually penetrates from spiritual realms into our earthly r ealm. He does not force himself upon us. Today everything must spring out of man's freedom. The dragon pushes himself forward, demanding the highest authority. The authority of s cience is the most powerful that has ever been exercised in the world. Compare the autho rity of the Pope; it is almost as powerful. Just think — however stupid a man may be yet he can say: “But science has established that.” People are struck dumb by scienc e, even if one has a truth to utter. There is no more overwhelming power of authority in the w hole of man's evolution than that of modern science. Everywhere the dragon rears up to m eet one. There is no other way than to unite ourselves with Michael, that is to say to permeate ourselves with real knowledge of the spiritual weav ing and being of the world. Only now does this picture of Michael truly stand before us; for the first time it has become our"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"e ssential concern as man. In olden times this pictur e was still seen in Imagination. That is not possible today for external consciousness. Henc e any fool can say that it is not true that external science is the dragon. But it is the drago n all the same. Yet some saw themselves confronting the dragon but were not able to see Michael: those who grew up with science and were not so bewi tched by the dragon that they quietly let themselves be devoured, who reacted against the soul being investigated by apparatus for testing the memory — who found no answer to the ir search for man, because the dragon has devoured him. This lived in the hearts of many human beings at the beginning of the twentieth century — they felt instinctively that th ey saw the dragon, but could not see Michael. Hence they removed themselves as far as po ssible from the dragon. They sought for a land which could not be reached by the dragon ; they wanted to know nothing more of the dragon. The young are running away from the old because they want to escape from the region of the dragon. That also is an aspect of the Youth Movement. The young wanted to flee from the dragon because they saw no possibilit y of conquering the dragon. They wanted to go where the dragon was not. But here there is a mystery and it consists in the fact that the dragon can exercise his power everywhere, even where he is not spatially pr esent. And when he does not succeed in killing man directly through ideas and intellect ualism, he succeeds by so rarefying the air everywhere in the world that one can no longer brea the. And this will certainly be the case — young people who ran from the dragon so as not to be injured, and who came into such rarefied air tha t they could not breathe the future, felt intensely the nightmare of the past because the air had become unwholesome where it was formerly possible to escape the immediate influence of the dragon. The nightmare that comes from within is, as regards human experience, not very different from the pressure that comes from without, from the dragon. In the last third of the nineteenth century, the ol der generation felt direct exposure to the dragon. The young people then experienced the n ightmare of the air corrupted by the dragon — air that could not be breathed. Here, the only help is to find Michael who conquers the dragon. Man needs the power of the vic tor over the dragon, for the dragon receives his life out of a world quite different fr om that in which the human soul can live. The human soul cannot live in the world out of whic h the dragon receives his life-blood. But in the overcoming of the dragon the human being must acquire the strength to be able to live. The epoch from the fifteenth century to th e nineteenth, which has developed the human being so that he has become quite empty, must be overcome. The age of Michael who conquers the dragon must now begin, for the pow er of the dragon has become great! But it is this above all that we must set going if we want to become true leaders of the young. For Michael needs, as it were, a chariot by means of which to enter our civilization. And this chariot reveals itself to the true educato r as coming forth from the young, growing human being, yes, even from the child. Here the pow er of the pre-earthly life is still working. Here we find, if we nurture it, what becom es the chariot by means of which Michael will enter our civilization. By educating i n the right way we are preparing Michael's chariot for his entrance into our civiliz ation."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"W e m u st no longer nurture the dragon by cultivating a sc ience with thoughts unconcerned with penetrating into the human soul, i nto man, so as to develop him. We must build the chariot, the vehicle for Michael. Th is needs living manhood, a living humanity such as flows out of supersensible worlds into the earthly life and manifests there, precisely in the early periods of human life . But for such an education we must have a heart. We must learn — speaking pictorially — to make ourselves allies of the approaching Michael if we want to become true teach ers. More is accomplished for the art of education than by any theoretical principles, if what we receive into ourselves works so that we feel ourselves Michael's confederates, alli es of the spiritual being who is entering the earth, for whom we prepare a vehicle by carryin g out a living art of education of the young. Far better than all theoretical educational principles is to lift up our eyes to Michael who, since the last third of the nineteenth century , has been striving to enter our outworn dragon-civilization. This is the fundamental impulse of all educational doctrine. We must not receive this art of education as a theory, we must not take it a s something we can learn. We should receive it as something with which we can unite our selves, the advent of which we welcome, something which comes to us not as dead co ncepts but as a living spirit to whom we offer our services because we must do so, if men are to experience progress in their evolution. This means to bring knowledge to life ag ain, it means to call forth in full consciousness what once was there in man's unconsci ous. My dear friends, in olden times when an atavistic c lairvoyance was still natural to human beings, there were Mystery centers. In these Mystery centers, which were at the same time church, school, and center of art, the pu pils sought also for knowledge, though more of a soul nature, in their development. Many t hings could be found in such centers — but libraries did not exist. Do not misunderstand m e — no library in our own sense. Something existed akin to our library, that is to s ay, things were written down; but everything that was written down was read with the purpose of working upon the soul. Nowadays a great deal of what constitutes a library is only there to be stored up, not to be read. The bulk is used only when a thesis must be w ritten because there such things are discussed. But people would prefer entirely to elim inate livingness. What is supposed to come into these theses must be quite mechanical. Th e aim is for the human being to enter into them as little as possible. Man's participatio n in spirituality has been wrested from him. Spirituality, but now in full consciousness, must b ecome living again, that we do not merely experience what can be perceived by the sens es but experience once more what can be perceived by the spirit. The age of Michael must begin. In fact everything that has fallen to man's lot since the fifteenth century has come t o him from outside. In the age of Michael the human being will have to find his own relation to the spiritual world. And learning, knowledge, will acquire a quite different kind of v alue. Now in the ancient Mysteries what was in the librar ies was more of the nature of monuments upon which was inscribed what was intende d to pass into man's memory. These libraries contained what cannot be compared i n any way with our books. For all leaders in the Mysteries directed their pupils to a nother kind of reading. They said: Yes,"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"t here is a library — but they did not call it so — a nd this library is out there in the human beings walking about. Learn to read them! Learn to read the mysteries that are inscribed in every man. We must return to this. Only we must com e to it, as it were, from another side so that as teachers we know: All accumulation of le arning, of knowledge, is worthless. As such it is dead and gets its life only from the dra gon. We should have the feeling that in wishing “to know,” knowledge cannot be stored up he re or there, for then it would at once fall apart. In literature, what is Spirit can only be touched upon lightly. How can you really find within a book what is Spiri t? For the spiritual is something living. The spiritual is not like bones. The spirit ual is like the blood. And the blood needs vessels in which to flow. What we recognize as spir itual needs vessels. These vessels are growing human beings. Into these vessels we must po ur the spiritual in order that it may hold together. Otherwise we shall have the spirit s o alive that it immediately flows away. We must so preserve our knowledge that it can flow into the developing human being. Then we shall make the chariot for Michael, then we shall be able to become Michael's companions. And what you seek, my dear friends, you will best attain through being conscious of wishing to become companions of Michae l. You must once again be able to follow a purely spir itual Being who is not incarnated on the earth. And you will have to learn to have faith in a human being who shows you the way to Michael. Humanity must understand in a new and l iving way the words of Christ: “My Kingdom is not of this world.” For it is just throu gh this that it is in the true sense “of this world!” For the task of man is to make the Spirit, which without Him would not be on earth, into a living content of this world. The Chr ist Himself came down to earth. He did not take man away to an earthly life in the heavens . The human being must permeate his earthly life by a mediating spirituality which give s him power to conquer the dragon. This must be understood so thoroughly that one can answer the question: Why did human beings tear each other to pieces during the s econd decade of the twentieth century? — They tore each other to pieces because they carri ed the battle into a region where it does not belong, because they did not see the real enemy , the dragon. To the conquest of the dragon belong the forces which, only when developed in the right way, will bring peace upon earth. In short, we must take seriously our entrance into the Michael age. With the means available at present, we shall have to guide man ag ain to the experience of being surrounded by the picture of Michael, powerful, rad iant; for Michael, through the forces developing in man towards a full life of soul, can overcome the dragon preying on humanity. Only when this picture can be received in a more living way than formerly into the soul, will there come forces for the developmen t of inner activity out of man's knowledge that he is of the company of Michael. Onl y then shall we participate in what can lead to progress and bring peace between the genera tions, in what can guide the young to listen to the old, and the old to have something to say which the young long to receive and understand. Because the older generation dangled the dragon in front of youth, they fled to regions poor in air. A true youth movement will only reach its goal when instead of being offered"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"t he dragon, the younger generation finds in Michael the forces to exterminate the dragon. This will show itself by older and younger generati ons having something to say to each other and something to receive from each other. For, in fact, if the educator is a complete human b eing he receives as much from the child as he gives to the child. Whoever cannot lear n from the child what he brings down from the spiritual world, cannot teach the child ab out the mysteries of earthly existence. Only when the child becomes our educator by bringin g his message to us from the spiritual world will the child be ready to receive from us ti dings of earthly life. It was not for the sake of mere symbolism that Goet he sought everywhere for things that suggest a breathing — outbreathing, inbreathing; ou tbreathing, inbreathing — Goethe saw the whole of life as a picture of receiving and giv ing. Everyone receives, everyone gives. Every giver becomes a receiver. But for the receivi ng and the giving to find a true rhythm it is necessary that we enter the Michael Age. So I want to conclude with this picture for you to see how the preceding lectures were actually meant. Their aim was that you should not m erely carry away in your heads what I have said here, and ponder over it. What I should p refer is for you to have something in your hearts and then to transform what you carry in your hearts into activity. What the human being carries in his head will in time be los t. But what he receives into his heart, the heart preserves and carries into all spheres of act ivity in which man is involved. May what I have ventured to say to you not be carried away mer ely in your heads — for then it will certainly be lost — but if it is carried away in yo ur hearts, in the whole of your being, then, my dear friends, we have been talking together in t he right way. Out of this feeling, let me give you my farewell gr eeting today by saying: Take what I have tried to express as if I had wanted, above all , to let something that cannot be uttered in words penetrate to your hearts. If hearts have foun d some connection with what is meant here by the Living Spirit, then at least in part wh at we wanted to achieve in these gatherings will have been fulfilled. With this feeling we will separate today; with this feeling, however, we shall also come together again. Thus we shall fi nd association in the Spirit, even though we work apart in different spheres of life. The chi ef thing will be that in our hearts we have found each other; then the spiritual, all that belo ngs to Michael, will also flow into our hearts."}]
