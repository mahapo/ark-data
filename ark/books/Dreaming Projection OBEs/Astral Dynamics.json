Throughout the 20th century, many fine books have been written about these topics. For over a quarter century, I have been fascinated by the Astral World and the possibility of astral travel. My introduction to this enticing subject came in the form of tattered old copies of Robert Crookall's Astral Projection: A Record of Out-of-Body Experiences and Case-book for Astral Projection . My next encounter with astral projection was H. F. Prevost Battersby's Man Outside Himself . As I continued reading about astral projection and out-of-body experiences (OBE), works by Fox, Muldoon, Powell, Smith, and \"YRAM\" cluttering my desk and shelves. Each book glimpsed into the astral world and higher levels. I read time and time again how many had made astral trips, bringing back words of encouragement, prophecy and descriptions of exciting \"worlds\" beyond ours. It soon became evident to both myself and colleagues that a newer, easier and more reliable method of projecting out-of- body must be developed, and a tutorial written, to assist first-time (and even advanced) students on their quest. It was of utmost importance that this work be written to answer students' questions and, furthermore, to assist the seasoned researcher in conducting theoretical studies and practical experiments. Therefore, an author of such a guide should be well versed in the theory, practice and behavioral aspects of such a multidimensional undertaking. Each author, however, left me slightly empty — always expecting more, but always getting less than I anticipated. Some works provided a deep philosophical theory of astral travel with no practical application. Others, though expertly written, gave some practical applications but no logical theory backing up the author's assumptions. Lastly, there were hundreds of books containing case study after case study documenting people who suddenly, and without apparent reason, experienced OBEs. Although descriptions were meticulous, these guides contained nothing but a series of good and intriguing stories. I longed for still more. Finally in the early spring of 1996, I discovered Mr. Robert Bruce's work on the Internet. In a series of constantly updated articles, I realized he was introducing an excitingly innovative approach to out-of-body projection and astral travel. An approach which included sound yet radically different theory, detailed practical experiments and, finally, individual case studies. In these studies, the reader meets many people who tried his new techniques and experiments and experienced almost immediate results in projection. I also discovered, while reading his on-line comments and correspondences, that Robert meticulously tried and retested his experiments: going down many blind alleys and often into some frightening situations, discovering the best and safest avenue for the would-be projector. In some cases, his journeys caused psychical and astral shock. In plain, jargon-free descriptions, Robert lays bare his fears, hopes and dreams. He also outlines many potential problems and practical solutions awaiting the student of astral travel. Over the months, I became an admirer of Robert's works and in September 1996 began corresponding with this Australian mystic and arcane experimenter. Robert, a true perfectionist, is constantly fine-tuning his experiments and theories. In this latest endeavor, Astral Dynamics , Robert takes his readers on a fascinating mystical, scientific and arcane journey into the astral dimension and beyond. This wonderful book has the potential for allowing anyone, regardless of spiritual or metaphysical training, to achieve a conscious exit from their body and to travel through the various levels of finer worlds. In an easily understood and well- illustrated format, Robert slowly guides reader out of body and into this world of wonder and excitement. Astral Dynamics consists of over five years of constant revisions, experiments, research, and personal insight. It is sad this book did not exist twenty-five years ago when I started my quest. My path would have been far less rocky and my results and discoveries far more amazing if it had. Professor C.E.Lindgren D. Ed., F.C.P., F.R.S.A."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 Preface This remarkable, invaluable book... I've never seen anything quite like it. In one fascinating volume, Robert Bruce has gathered together a personal narrative, a \"how-to\", a troubleshooting guide, and a theoretical perspective on the nonphysical structure underlying the strange and multidimensional life we all lead. Whether you are a skeptic, a veteran astral projector, a newbie, or an armchair traveler, there's treasure here. I first came across Robert Bruce as a presence in an Internet news group called alt.out -of-body (\"out-of-body experience\" is, of course, the modern term for what used to be called astral projection), so I recognized his name when he contacted us at Hampton Roads to see if we would have an interest in publishing his book. I said we would, but was unprepared for the quality of the manuscript that he sent us, electronically, from half a world away in Australia. It's in a class by itself. What he says here rings true. In fact, it does a lot more than ring true. It opens doors. Astral Dynamics provides the intelligent and motivated reader with everything needed to put theory into practice. The book's six parts may be read each on their own, but they have been placed to build nicely one upon the other. Part One, \"Elements of Projection\" , presents Robert's theory of what actually goes on when the projectable double leaves the physical body. This in itself, right out of the gate, is fascinating terrain. His theory of the consequences of the mind-split that results from projection is itself worth the price of the book. Part Two, \"NEW Energy Ways\", presents his stunningly practical method of raising energy and awareness by using touch, which he calls Tactile Imaging. I have tried this method on half a dozen people, selected more or less at random, each of whom obtained the desired awareness within seconds ! And then, as if the new method of visualization weren't enough, Robert proceeds to describe the nature and anatomy of our energy bodies, a description firmly rooted in his own personal explorations. Part Three, \"Core Skills\", builds on this foundation, demonstrating how to succeed at the three tasks that are essential to success in astral projection: deep physical relaxation, taming the mind, and attaining the trance state. Then part Four, \"Projection Exit and Technique\", tells you what you need to know to stop reading about astral projection and actually do it. Part Five, \"The Akashic Connection\", proceeds into the realm of the theoretical, not for the sake of getting lost in theory, but in order to make sense of things seen and heard. Particularly interesting is Robert's description of the nature and meaning of what he calls the Akashic Pulse. As to his description and analysis of the astral planes, the silver cord, the etheric body, and the Akashic record — I doubt that these have been equaled anywhere in the subject's extensive modern literature. I am confident that they have not been excelled. Finally, Robert's section on strange astral phenomena takes on a few conundrums that are worth exploring. Projection into higher realms; reality fluctuations; astral noise ; what Robert calls astral wildlife... he covers the turf as it hasn't been covered to date. And he does it so casually, in so unpretentious a manner, his mood ranging from deepest awe to casually joking, with all the range between. If you have any interest at all in the subject of astral projection, lucid dreaming — higher consciousness in general — you're going to love this book. I predict that it will become a classic, read and valued for many years to come. Frank DeMarco Chairman, Hampton Roads Publishing Company, Inc."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 An Introduction to Astral Dynamics Other worlds and dimensions exist all around us, every minute of every day, that very few people ever see or step into, even though they believe or know them to be there. By picking up this book you have taken your first step towards a level of understanding few aspire to, let alone achieve. For almost a decade now (at the time this book was released) I have made myself available to the global Internet community as a free consultant and adviser. In this time I have counseled, advised and helped with an enormous variety of issues and problems, including OBE, astral projection, clairvoyance and energetic development, to name but a few. You may be surprised to find that these areas, while seemingly quite different, are all very closely related. This service has been, and still is, a true labor of love for me. It has given me a progressively increased understanding of the real problem areas with these subjects, allowing me to use my experience and inspirational abilities to find practical and innovative solutions that really work. In 1991, I stumbled upon the Internet and World Wide Web and couldn't believe my luck. I had found an electronic medium which allowed me to communicate my ideas to millions of people around the world. I quickly became seriously involved with OBE and paranormal related news-groups, and soon wrote a fairly disjointed but comprehensive series of articles for them called \"The Treatise on Astral Projection\". I made these freely available to the global Internet community as I wrote them. These articles were designed to answer questions I was continually being asked, as well as to dispel many common misconceptions and problems, as I saw them. The series rapidly grew to book length and became extremely popular resource material. Over the years since, through public interest and demand, I have written a far more comprehensive and detailed work, Astral Dynamics — the book you are now reading. This deals with all aspects of out-of-body operations, and encapsulates my current knowledge on OBE. My sole motivation for writing comes from a genuine desire to share my knowledge with mankind. The primary goal has always been to create a user-friendly, readable and useful tutorial, guide and reference work for all who aspire to travel out of their bodies. Other than in subject matter, Astral Dynamics bears virtually no resemblance to the original series of articles. I took the opportunity while writing this book to update and expand upon my original theories, procedures and guidance, while answering some of the more interesting questions posed to me over the years. You now read the fruits of my ongoing experience, exploration and seemingly endless problem solving. The guidance offered within this book is largely drawn from my own personal experience as an active hands-on mystic and backyard metaphysical researcher-cum-mad-scientist, having practiced conscious-exit OBE and related disciplines most of my life. Because of this, you may notice a distinct lack of references to other written material within this book. Unless referenced or otherwise specified, everything within Astral Dynamics is my considered opinion, based on my personal experience. This unorthodox approach comes about simply because I rarely accept partisan opinion, and never take anything at face value. I delight in taking a fresh look at all things considered mystical, metaphysical or paranormal. This approach has given my searching mind a keen edge, allowing a far deeper understanding of these things than would otherwise be possible. It also allows me something I dearly love — the opportunity to discover! Some of the theories, explanations, techniques and procedures given within Astral Dynamics are completely new (some might kindly say radical and inspirational) whilst others are logical improvements on existing ones. All have been thoroughly road-tested by my many volunteers and me, and all have been found to be safe and effective — provided that all cautions given are duly heeded. These are taught in simple, progressive, easy-to-grasp stages, and are written in plain English with many illustrations. And on the matter of plain English: Well, the English language and its grammar are not quite up to the task of discussing some of the subject matter within this book, i.e., But I refuse to fall into the trap of using Eastern terminology to discuss metaphysical and esoteric matters. While this solves some problems it can also be needlessly confusing. I have instead constructed some descriptive phrases and bent the meanings of some words to suit. My extensive use of the word energetic , and constructions like bio-energetic and pure-energetic , are good examples. In the context of this book these refer to different qualities of energy manifested by the human energy body and its various aspects, including its projected double. Please check the glossary for other word-usage peculiarities found in this book. The new techniques and procedures released in this book, especially the NEW energetic manipulation and development system given in part two, \"NEW Energy Ways\", have been extremely effective. These are, I believe, the most advanced and effective of their kind in the world today. For all their apparent sophistication, they are very easy to learn and are simple to use. As a whole, they provide a powerful set of tools for manipulating and developing the energy body, and in the case of OBE, of stimulating the projection reflex and empowering all aspects of out-of-body operations. Conscious exit projection is, as I believe and intend to show, nowhere near as difficult as is commonly believed today. It is my sincere belief that armed with the knowledge within this book, just about anyone is capable of repeatedly achieving conscious out-of-body experiences — if they will just take a little time to learn how it all works. \"Per Ardua Ad Astra\" Through Travail to the Stars"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 1. Dimensional Theory The Holy Grail for projectors and OBE researchers is a reliable key to planned and repeatable out-of-body experiences. I have spent a significant part of my life on this quest, studying the mechanics and dynamics of OBE, from both inside and outside my body. I have come to believe that this elusive key lies only partly in projection technique and natural ability. The real key lies, I believe, in understanding the relationship between OBE and physical body/brain memory storage. To be more precise, it is the downloading of the projected double's delicate shadow memories into more accessible levels of the physical brain than normally occurs during the reintegration of the projected double with its physical counterpart. After an OBE, the only enduring part of the experience is the memory of it. If that memory becomes lost, then there is nothing left to indicate a projection ever occurred. Therein lie both the problem and the solution. First, a little background on the basic structure of the out-of-body environment and of the projectable double. Nonphysical Dimensions All nonphysical dimensions are levels of existence vibrating (for want of a better word) at a higher frequency than the known physical universe. This makes them invisible and undetectable to the normal five senses and to all scientific means available today. Just as different types of energies — light, gravity, x-ray, heat, microwave, etc. — occupy the same space at the same time in the normal physical universe without interfering with each other to any great extent, so do these different dimensional levels coexist in the same space at the same time. Each is of a completely different type, with its own unique properties and spectrum of frequencies. But it is very difficult to give an easily understandable description that imparts the look and feel of nonphysical dimensions. The astral planes, for example, are part of an incredibly complex nonphysical dimensional level, as compared with the relatively predictable and stable physical dimension. Many of the complexities of the astral planes are virtually unknown. The nonphysical laws governing this dimension (call these astral physics) are fluid and variable in the extreme. On top of this, projectors' minds can greatly affect their perception of the astral dimension. This leaves precious few constant factors for any astral researcher or explorer to work with. When dealing with the astral dimension you cannot simply point and say, as you can in the physical universe: \"This is our planet, Earth; this is its atmosphere and that is outer space, etc\". You cannot even point and say , \"There is the astral dimension!\" Although the astral dimension permeates the entire physical universe, it is, for the greater part, nonspatial. Doorways to the astral exist everywhere and nowhere, both inside and outside the human mind. That being said, please bear with me as I dissect and expound on the nature, mechanics, and dynamics of OBE and nonphysical dimensions. This will provide a workable understanding of the relationships and conflicts between the physical and nonphysical aspects of our vast multidimensional universe. I hope this will allow you to work with or around these problem areas during future out-of-body operations. Traditional Dimensional Theory This book is steeped neither in Eastern terminology nor esoteric theory. I much prefer to use Western descriptive terms wherever possible, and relate my own experience and reasoning. The modern New Age belief system (adopted mainly from Eastern esoteric theory) describes seven major dimensions, or levels of existence, including the physical dimension. These begin with the physical dimension-solids, liquids, gases-and four etheric subplanes. The other six dimensions are labeled the Astral, Mental, Buddhic, Atmic, Anupadaka, and Adi. Each dimension is reputed to contain seven internal levels or planes, and each plane is reputed to contain a number of lesser sub-planes or realms. As you can see, an attempt to list the internal components of all seven major dimensions would make for an exceedingly complex and lengthy list. And there are many variations of the above structure. I will not attempt to elaborate these any further. Traditional Eastern dimensional theory can be extremely complex, and is often steeped in what to the average Westerner would seem like mysterious Eastern cultural and religious concepts. Wrestling with any nondescriptive foreign terminology is the last thing anyone needs when dealing with a subject as inherently complex as dimensional theory. Strange-sounding words and phrases can very easily cloud important issues. The Real-Time Zone I call the nonphysical dimensional level closest to the physical universe the real-time zone. This is, naturally, the dimensional level the vast majority of projectors find themselves in when they first project out of body. The real-time zone can best be thought of as a buffer zone or intermediary area dividing the physical universe from the astral dimension proper. It shares some properties of the physical universe (a direct and objective real-time reflection of reality) and some properties of the astral dimension (a fluid, nonphysical environment). The real-time zone, although technically still a part of the astral dimension, is best considered a completely separate dimensional level. This sidesteps much of the confusion inherent in trying to relate a single set of projection-related factors and environmental properties to more than one dimensional level. The out-of-body environment is anything but simple. Each dimensional level contains a different environment, each with its own unique set of aspects and properties. Reality fluctuations are the most noticeable confusing factor in the real-time zone. These fluctuations are so consistent in the real-time zone that they actually form one of its few constants. I have found the real-time zone to be fairly stable and predictable in itself. Most fluctuations are caused, I think, from interactions between the fairly sensitive real-time environment and the generally unstable perceptions of the real-time projected double. Because the real-time zone is so close to the physical dimension, New Age thought puts it at the very bottom of the dimensional scale. This leads people to consider it to be a lower astral subplane, traditionally a negative and unsavory"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 environment, to be actively avoided. But the real-time zone does not bear any direct relationship with the lower astral subplanes. It is a completely separate neutral area, best considered as being neither high nor low in the dimensional spectrum. The average projector finds the real-time zone fairly dark and gloomy, a totally inaccurate picture that stems from projecting only late at night, just before going to sleep. At night the world is naturally dark and gloomy and full of shadows! I would suggest to all who dispute this that they project during the daytime at least once and experience this difference. There is nothing at all dark or gloomy or scary about a real-time projection on a sunny day. On the contrary, it is one of the most delightful and thoroughly enjoyable experiences I can think of. The real-time zone overlays and permeates the entire physical universe and contains a perfect reflection of reality within it. Everything happens in real-time — as reality actually happens — hence its name. Projectors traveling within the real-time zone and remaining stable and unaffected by reality fluctuations perceive themselves to be following the actual spatial contours and geographical shape of the physical universe. They thus appear to be existing inside a direct nonphysical reflection of reality... as reality happens. I have spent a great deal of time in the real-time zone exploring its properties and limitations. The experience is very much like being an invisible specter in the real world. The normal laws of physics do not have any direct effect on real-time projectors. They are free to travel at will anywhere in the physical universe, at any speed, and can defy gravity. They can move through solid matter at will, although they may perceive some texture and varying degrees of resistance. Real-time projectors exist as invisible points of consciousness (although they usually perceive themselves quite differently) connected to the physical body via an invisible energetic linkage often called the silver cord. Their physical location is usually consistent with where they perceive themselves to be in the real world. Their movements can be tracked and ascertained if they are viewed with real-time sight, a type of clairvoyance. The only other way to verify the real-time aspects of a real-time projection is for the projectors to gather information and accurately report real-life events and facts that they would have no other possible way to know. Real-time sight enables observers to see into the real-time zone around them. The quality of this type of sight is variable. Sometimes only cloudy shapes or indistinct images of the surrounding room will be seen through closed eyelids and bedcovers. A stronger level of real-time sight can, at the other extreme, be mistaken for normal physical sight (it can be that clear) when projectors see their rooms and real-life events happening around them vividly, but through closed eyelids. A simple way of proving that real-time projection is an objective rather than a purely subjective experience is with a deck of cards. Shuffle the deck and, without looking, lay one card face up on top of a wardrobe, cabinet or somewhere high up in your own home, preferably at least twenty feet (six meters) away from where your physical body will be. Or tape the card to a window, facing outward, without looking at it. Do not use more than one card until you have some real success with this test. Do not try to guess the card. Guesswork — even simply wondering what the card is — can easily cause subconscious interference (reality fluctuations), which can make a genuine real-time observation extremely difficult. If, for example, you try to guess or intuit what the card is, you may see the card you have guessed, instead of seeing the actual card. This can undermine the real-time observation with a small reality fluctuation and make the observation inaccurate. At the very start of the projection, immediately move to where the card is and look at it. Glance at it only briefly, and remember it. When you are sure you can remember the card, re-enter your body, write down the card you saw, and then go check. To give this test a fair go, keep it very short and do not try to do anything more during the projection. When you approach your physical body to reenter it, hold the memory of this card firmly in mind and, quite literally, shout it out loud as you are reentering, e.g., \"The Queen of Hearts !... The Queen of Hearts!\" This will maximize your chances of remembering not only the projection, but also the face of the card you saw during the test. Please follow this procedure to the letter, or you may lose the memory not only of the card, but of the entire projection. The normal abilities of the projected double often manifest spontaneously before an actual projection. These abilities have many levels, but their most basic quality enables a physical observer to see and hear into the real-time zone around them. I usually develop fairly strong real-time sight and hearing during meditation. Most people develop some level of real-time sight and hearing just before or during projection, just before they exit their physical body. This results in the commonly reported experience of projectors seeing details of the room around them through closed eyelids, and of hearing strange noises and/or voices around them during the separation phase of an OBE. As an example of a real-time projection experience, I think of my nephew Matt's two-week visit back in 1991. During this time, apart from many other activities, I coached Matt on projection. A few days before he was due to leave, while meditating late at night, I clearly saw Matt's projected real-time double float through the wall and come into the room I was sitting in. He waved cheerfully at me and I slowly waved back at him, without breaking my entranced state — no mean feat in itself — immensely pleased that Matt had finally managed to get out of his body. Matt floated about the room, seemingly having some difficulty with movement and directional control, but apparently thoroughly enjoying himself. He soon floated out of my sight and that was the last I saw of him that night. The next morning Matt was very excited about his first conscious-exit projection. He vividly remembered using my technique and feeling heavy vibrations, then leaving his body, moving through the wall and seeing me, and us waving at each other. He lost track of the experience shortly after he floated back through the wall. Note: a few seconds after Matt moved out of my sight, I heard a distinct groan and movement coming from the direction of his bedroom. Matt appears to have briefly awakened at that time and thus ended his first conscious-exit projection. The short duration of his projection (following my advice on keeping it short) appears to have been a key factor here, allowing the easy recall of the experience after the event. The Astral Dimension The astral dimension is the next closest of the unseen dimensions to the physical universe. The astral flows from the real- time zone, but is best thought of as being completely separate from it. It is divided into seven major levels or planes, each containing many subplanes and internal realms. The astral dimension spans the universe, but for all intents and purposes is"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 totally nonspatial. The astral dimension does not overlay the physical universe as precisely as the real-time zone does, especially at its higher levels, but it occupies the same space nevertheless. My reasoning here is that the astral is dimensionally further removed than is the real-time zone, and thus does not bear such a direct geographical relationship with the physical universe. Certainly the movements of an astral projector, in relation to the physical dimension, cannot be ascertained by astral or clairvoyant sight in the same way as can be done with a real-time projector. Astral sight is the ability to see into the astral dimension proper. This is spontaneously experienced more often by those with some level of clairvoyant ability (active or dormant) than by those without it. Astral sight allows the observer to see other projectors, thought forms, astral beings, wildlife, and even spirit beings. This ability often works in conjunction with real-time sight, giving the observer a mixed real-time plus astral viewpoint, which can be fairly confusing at times. The astral dimension is uniquely related to the inhabitants of the physical dimension, permeating the universe like a huge mind net, catching and holding all energetic reflections and emanations of consciousness. It is affected by all the finer dimensional levels above it. The structure of the astral planes appears to filter and hold all energetic reflections generated by the thoughts, awareness, and perceptions of all living beings, including inanimate matter and life forms not generally considered to contain consciousness. Even a humble rock has an energetic value on the atomic and subatomic levels. This process appears to have been going on since the beginning of time. Another way of describing this: the astral dimension contains an enduring energetic shadow generated and cast by the contents and inhabitants of the physical dimension."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 2. The Projectable Double There are many different types of OBE and therefore many different types of projectable double. To make sense of OBE and projection — to obtain a better understanding of some of the energetic intricacies involved — it is necessary to examine the main aspects of the projectable double. Let us start by taking a brief look at its structure, starting at its very lowest energetic aspect... the etheric body. The Etheric Body The human etheric body (also called the energy body) is the subtle body most closely related to and enmeshed within the physical body. I do not believe this aspect can separate from its physical body while its physical body still lives. It has three main aspects: bioenergetic, pure-energetic, and expanded-energetic. The three aspects are strongly interrelated. The bioenergetic aspect of the human etheric body is the underlying, supporting bioenergetic mechanism and active living template for bodily intelligence and all biological life processes. It works in line with the biological functioning of the physical body, and exists as an exact bioenergetic counterpart that is firmly enmeshed with the living physical body. The pure-energetic aspect has at least seven primary energy centers (often called chakras or psychic centers), hundreds of secondary energy centers (minor chakras), and thousands of tiny energy exchange ports. Throughout this runs a complex network of internal and external energy pathways, connecting circuitry, and energetic structures. This aspect of the etheric body does not strictly follow the internal and external contours of the physical body. The expanded-energetic aspect occurs when the physical body falls asleep, or enters the trance state. The substance of the pure-energetic aspect of the etheric body becomes energetically excited and begins to expand outward. This allows the pure- energetic aspects of the etheric body to function independently from the physical body, without disturbing it while it sleeps. Holding the mind awake during the trance state creates a wide range of energetic conflicts. These conflicts can cause some very peculiar sensations, such as the feeling of expansion (often perceived as the sensation of shrinking or falling inward). The degree of etheric body expansion possible depends greatly on the level of sleep or trance attained. The etheric body, in its energetically excited and expanded state, is a true subtle body in its own right. The main difference between it and any other subtle body — e.g., the real-time and astral bodies — is that the expanded etheric body is not normally capable of leaving the confines of its physical body. The continuing presence of all three aspects of the etheric body appears essential for the continuance of biological life processes. I believe that the etheric body is far too dense and too firmly enmeshed within the physical body (as subtle bodies go) to allow a full projection of its energetic substance to occur. The closest subtle body to the etheric body is the real-time body, the generation of which begins inside the expanding etheric body before any type of OBE, conscious or unconscious. Thus the etheric body is found to have more than a small part to play in the process of generating and projecting the real-time double. Trance and Inner-Body Projection If the physical body falls asleep while its mind is even partially awake, it enters a level of the trance state. The telltale sinking heaviness and cozy warmth of the trance state will then be felt, if only momentarily, before the seeming oblivion of sleep occludes normal waking consciousness. When the first level of the trance state is attained — light trance — the etheric body begins its expansion process. To be more precise, the first stage of the expanded etheric body generation process forms the separate but still internal subtle body. The deeper the level of trance, the more strongly the etheric body will be generated as a distinctly separate and independently functioning subtle body. As the expanded etheric body is generated, the center of consciousness automatically transfers (internally projects or reflects) into the etheric body. This is the first stage of the multilevel projection process, just one small step away from the physical body and its normal level of waking consciousness. The center of consciousness has now shifted one level up from its physical body, and is now just one level down from the first projectable subtle body, the real-time projectable double. I see falling asleep and entering the trance state as having the same general effect, each causing a type of inner-body projection or energetic reflection of the center of consciousness into the etheric body. If this process occurs while falling into normal sleep, a sleeping copy of consciousness and memory are reflected into the etheric body. A short time after this event, as the sleeping body falls more deeply asleep (or as the trance state deepens), the real-time body will be internally generated in a similar fashion, in preparation for its full extrusion (or projection) by the physical/etheric body outside the bounds of the physical body. This is the second level of the natural subtle body generation and projection process. The generation and projection of sleeping subtle bodies will now continue, with the projected mind remaining undisturbed and sleeping throughout, on up through the dimensional spectrum. This is the basic outline of the natural multileveled, multidimensional sleep-projection process, as I see it, that occurs to everyone during normal sleep. The reason this process can occur so gently and naturally is that the projecting center of consciousness is asleep. When it is asleep it is safely out of the way, so to speak. A sleeping mind does not cause any energetic conflicts to arise during this natural process, whereas an awake mind will cause plenty. If the etheric body generation process occurs while the mind is held awake, a full waking trance state is achieved: body asleep, mind awake. A full copy of the awake and thinking mind is reflected into the expanding etheric body. The trance state allows waking, thinking consciousness to continue within the confines of the etheric body, while the physical body and its mind (these latter always containing the original copies of mind and memory) sleep. This is the first stage of the multileveled, multidimensional conscious-exit projection process. Now using a projection technique to exteriorize the sense of whole-body awareness, the trancer will generate a real-time"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 double within the confines of the physical/etheric body. Once this is successfully generated — again, internally — a full copy of awake consciousness will automatically be reflected into it as it forms. The newly generated real-time body is the first level of the projectable double, but is still fully enmeshed within the physical/etheric body at this stage. With continued efforts, the projection reflex can now be triggered while the mind is fully awake. An energetic copy of the awake mind can then be projected outside the bounds of the physical body. It is now held and energetically maintained within the projected real-time double. Thus we have the basic outline of the underlying process that allows and causes a conscious-exit projection, or OBE, to occur. A deep, tickling, upward-moving, trickle of energy within the torso accompanies the internal generation of the real-time projectable double. This is especially noticeable in the stomach, solar plexus, and chest areas. This sensation is caused, I believe, by the transformation of etheric matter, as different types of energies are generated throughout the physical/etheric body to form the real-time projectable double. The conditions that allow for a conscious-exit projection, or OBE, are now complete. Full waking consciousness can now be projected free of the confines of the physical/etheric bodies along with the projecting real-time double. This is the second level of the multileveled, multidimensional conscious-exit projection process. The biggest difference between natural sleep projection and conscious-exit projection is the presence of awake consciousness during the exit. This interferes with the natural sleep projection process, as waking consciousness tries to go along for the ride during the exit, so to speak. The presence of waking consciousness causes a great deal of internal energy conflicts to arise during the now not-so-natural awake projection process. This explains the greatly increased difficulty levels associated with conscious-exit projection. It also goes a long way toward explaining why such heavy energy-movement sensations — e.g., racing heartbeat, pressure, heavy vibrations — are so often experienced during the conscious-exit projection. Etheric Body Projection It is commonly believed that the etheric body is capable of a limited kind of low-powered projection outside its physical body. OBEs where the projected double feels weak and has difficulty moving, perhaps even collapsing on the floor shortly after the exit, are said to be etheric projections. While this is an understandable supposition, to me it is illogical to think that the etheric body can separate or project from the physical body while it still lives. The internal beginnings of projection as given above show that a progressive refinement of subtle bodies is an integral part of the whole process. This allows the generation and projection of progressively higher levels of a projectable double, while retaining firm energy links with the physical body and its original copy of mind and memory. The etheric body not only generates all projectable doubles, but it also provides the energy substance required to maintain the separate existence and functionality of all external subtle bodies. The etheric body can aptly be described as being the base-level generator and energy supplier of all subtle bodies. As the sole energy generator, if the etheric body were to completely project out of the physical body, its plethora of intimate energy links with its physical body, the energy foundation of the projection mechanism, would be grossly interfered with. This is inconsistent with the nature of the projection mechanism. It also defies logic that a subtle energy mechanism could exist that would allow the possibility of an accidental expulsion of the etheric body. If the etheric body were to be completely projected, it would logically have to have its energy supported and maintained by its physical body, which is far too gross for this purpose. The full expulsion of the etheric body only happens at death, I believe, and possibly to a lesser extent during an NDE, or near-death experience. The etheric body is the energy fountain. It is the foundation of all biological life processes and the bioenergetic generator and maintainer of all pure-energetic functions. The etheric body depends on complex bioenergetic links with its physical body for all its energy needs , to fuel and enable its pure-energetic functions. What is often called an etheric projection, I believe, is a type of energetically overextended projection. How does this happen? During the course of a full multilevel sleep projection, the physical/etheric body wakes up, usually experiencing projection-related symptoms and vibrations. The sleeping real-time double is already projected and is floating, asleep, just above the physical body at this time. All its higher aspects have, also, already been projected into their related dimensional levels. As the physical/etheric mind awakes beneath it, the real-time double only is reeled back into the physical/etheric body. All the higher projected doubles continue existing and/or functioning in their higher levels, albeit a little more sluggishly now. The now-awake projector then experiences a spontaneous real-time projection exit, as the real-time double slips back out of the physical body again — but this time while fully awake. (Projectors in these events are totally unaware that they are disturbing a full-spectrum, multilevel sleep projection in full progress. Once this projection of the awake real-time double is complete, the projected double finds itself extremely weak and has great difficulty moving. Usually, the projector will collapse in slow motion and become totally incapacitated very shortly after the exit. Added to this, it is likely that the presence of awake consciousness in the projected real-time double is contributing to the energetic tension between the physical/etheric body and all its higher sleep projected doubles. The real-time double, being the only subtle body that is properly awake, throws an energetic spanner in the workings of the natural full-spectrum sleep- projection process, so to speak. Another cause of weakness during a projection is the physical body and its mind remaining too awake and physically tense after the exit, especially if the projected double remains within close proximity (within twenty feet, or six meters) of its physical body. This can cause a great deal of energetic tension, which can cause various sensations of duality and weakness, with the center of consciousness often flicking back and forth between these two awake aspects of the same projector."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 Three Basic Aspects of the Projectable Double Real-Time Body The real-time body is the first level of the projectable double. If observed by an awake observer with real-time sight (a type of clairvoyance), it will be seen to have a faintly silver, ghostly, see-through appearance. Often just a vague ghostly shape will be seen, but sometimes facial features will be made out as well. If a real-time projector observes another real-time projector, while both are out of body, they will usually look reasonably normal to each other, although often a little shadowy or transparent. They will also always look slimmer and younger, fitter and better looking than in actuality. All projected doubles are shaped by body awareness, and will always look younger and fitter than their actual physical body. With older projectors, the age of their projectable double's appearance is usually about thirty-five. The real-time double's natural level of operations is within the real-time zone. It can exist and function in real time only so long as there is enough energy flowing to it from its physical/etheric body. This energy flow maintains its integrity and mental coherence on that dimensional level. There is more than one variation and strength of real-time double possible. This is greatly influenced by the quantity of energy flowing into it from the physical/etheric body, and by its energetically developed state. A projector's real-time body parts will only become visible if that projector deliberately looks for them. The hands are the easiest body parts to observe: They vary in appearance from fairly normal to quite distorted, elongated, spectral, and ghostly. This variability in appearance is probably related to energetic flow and the corresponding strength of a projection. In all cases, though, real-time hands will begin melting away almost the moment they are observed, like white ice sculptures under a powerful blowtorch. This goes a long way toward explaining how out of body shape-shifting works. Projectors can deliberately alter their appearance by overriding their natural sense of whole-body self-awareness. They simply feel themselves as having another shape and form, and concentrate on holding their new sense of whole-body self-awareness firmly in mind at all times. Natural out-of-body creative ability does the rest, and their shape is thus altered for as long as they can maintain awareness of their new sense of form. The whole real-time body of a projector can be seen clearly — with no melting effect — by other real-time projectors, and even by awake physical observers with real-time sight. This apparent contradiction appears to be caused by the nature of out- of-body perception, which is a kind of direct mind perception. It is also worth noting the apparent similarities between out-of- body perception and normal clairvoyance. Every projected double, I believe, broadcasts its own image of whole-body self- awareness energetically. This energetic broadcast is received by other projectors, and by clairvoyants, as a fixed image that will not melt and requires no interpretation. As with clairvoyance, when awake observers use real-time sight, their brow centers receive energetic broadcasts directly. This energetic reception is translated into bioelectrical signals that flow into die sight center of the brain, as per normal sight, where they automatically convert into a visual image in the receivers' mind's eye. If the natural energetic broadcast image of a projector is deliberately altered — say through shape-shifting — then the resulting image is changed. As the projected double does not have functioning eyes, per se, this shows something of how direct energetic mind perception works in all types of projected double. It also provides an insight into how tile mind's eye images of visual clairvoyance work. Astral Reflection I consider the astral body to be a completely separate subtle body in its fully projected state. A much weaker version exists as a continual astral reflection or echo of self-awareness in the astral dimension. This astral echo exists whether a person is awake or asleep. It is a mindless astral reflection of awareness, thoughts, and fantasies, with no more substance than a reflection in a mirror. This astral echo does not have the ability to think or reason independently. (If you think of the way the astral planes work, absorbing, filtering, and recording all energetic reflections and emanations of consciousness, this is not an unreasonable suggestion.) Because of this, an awake person viewed by a projector may appear to be doing some very peculiar things indeed. This is because the majority of awake people have in their minds at any given time a mixture of objective thoughts and awareness, and subjective fantasy and ideas. The exceptions to this rule are those individuals who are totally focused on a single task, or those who have conquered the necessity of having uncontrolled fantasies and a continual internal mental dialogue. As an example: Jill is hanging out her washing (objective experience) while her mind is far away, sitting on a tropical island having a romantic lunch with Jack, her favorite person (subjective fantasy). Viewed by an astral projector or clairvoyant ,Jill's astral reflection might be seen to be having lunch with Jack under a palm tree on a beach in her backyard, with a line of washing hanging in the foreground and Jill's house just behind the scene. The objective parts of this scene have become mixed with subjective fantasy elements to produce this bizarre scenario around Jill's astral reflection. Astral Body Proper The next major state of existence above the real-time body is in the astral body proper. The astral planes are the natural level of operations for this subtle body. As with all subtle bodies, projected astral bodies viewed by another astral projector, or with astral sight or clairvoyance, will appear to be very solid and real looking, albeit younger and fitter than they are in reality. Once the center of consciousness has shifted from the real-time body to the astral body, the physical/etheric body diverts the majority of its energies into the astral body. This fortifies the astral body, making it able to easily support a full copy of Fig. 1. Melting and distorted hand effects"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 awake and thinking consciousness. The astral body is much more stable than the real-time body and hence is easier to maintain during a conscious astral projection. And, as the astral projector is existing in an environment that bears little or no resemblance to the physical dimension, reality fluctuations are much less noticeable. In its natural environment, the astral double feels much lighter and more energized than does the real-time projected double. It is dimensionally more removed from its physical body, and as a result experiences far less by way of energetic conflicts, tensions, and pressures than the real-time double usually does. The astral body perceives itself as having a body, but as with the real-time body this will only be seen if deliberately looked for. It will also have difficulty studying its body parts closely. The melting-body-parts effect still happens to the astral body, especially with its hands, but this is visually less dramatic than it is with the real-time double. Once the quality of energies flowing into the real-time body changes-as the astral body proper is generated and energized — the real-time body quickly weakens. It soon starts falling asleep in the real-time zone. Typically, when the real-time double loses power in this way and begins falling asleep, it will either be reeled in by the physical/etheric body, to hover nearby mimicking its physical body's sleeping position, or will wander aimlessly about the real-time zone, only partially conscious. This explains, I think, why most projectors encountered during a real-time projection seem to be wandering aimlessly about, like sleepwalkers, unaware of where they really are or what they are doing. They often seem to be mentally in another dimension entirely. They still have a partially functioning real-time body, but they are not existing in it strongly enough to function mentally on that level. They can be briefly awakened by other real-time projectors, but will usually be confused and muddled. They have the annoying tendency to become suddenly incoherent and even to fall asleep midsentence. Similarly, if a higher subtle body is energized strongly enough, awake consciousness will become centered most strongly in that higher body, causing the astral body to fall asleep in the astral dimension. It may then wander about the astral in much the same way and mental state as does the real-time body under the same circumstances. Children, Animals, and OBE Children According to my observations, children frequently have OBEs, and seem to have more energy for this than adults. I often see and hear children gallivanting about the real-time zone. I have not seen babies younger than walking age though, unless being carried by their mothers. Solo OBEs appear to start when children become more physically and emotionally independent. I usually develop fairly clear real-time sight and hearing during trance-meditation sessions ; especially in the evenings. At these times I will often see and hear my own children while they are projecting. There is nothing vague or imaginary about these observations. They usually cut and dive about the room calling for me to watch their antics — as children do. They do not understand the reasons underlying their temporarily enhanced state of being, but are hugely excited by it all the same. Like most adults, children generally remember little of their OBEs after-ward. But I must say children take their newfound abilities, like flying and passing through walls, in their stride, as if these were all perfectly natural for them. I can't see, hear, or feel them physically at these times, even if they all scramble onto my lap. But I can see their faces clearly and hear their voices distinctly with my real-time senses. I also feel the telltale energetic shivers that are a basic indicator of close contact with any nonphysical being. With real-time sight, children look ghostly, as if made of pale smoke, but their faces are denser, with a silvery sheen, making them clearly recognizable as who they are. Animals In my experience, animals project regularly, especially pets. I suggest this is a natural ability common to the entire animal kingdom. I have frequently observed pets and other animals roaming the real-time zone. With real-time sight I have also observed my own pets as they exit their bodies — a truly fascinating sight! I rarely see animals projecting in higher levels of the astral planes, although I frequently encounter them in lower regions, with pets often accompanying their human friends. On many occasions I have also seen and interacted with deceased pets in the real-time zone (apparently visiting) and also in the spirit worlds (often called heavens) when I have visited these. The repeatable nature of these experiences suggests animals not only project, but also survive death as independent spirit beings. This last may or may not apply to domesticated and wild animals. I believe close long-term association with humans stimulates animals' higher emotions, as in the case of much-loved pets, elevating them to more independent levels of spiritual being. In principle, this last has similarities with how humans are elevated by lives of spiritual discipline, love, and service, and by long-term contact with advanced spiritual beings."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 3. The Incredible Mind-Split Exactly what departs from the physical body and brain during an OBE? How does this happen? What, if anything, is left behind to watch over the sleeping physical body? What safeguards and protects die continuing integrity of the original copy of mind and memory during an OBE? Many people, not surprisingly, are fearful of attempting projection because these questions have not been satisfactorily answered. Half-baked theories, assumptions, stories, legends, and myths abound. Two early OBE researchers and authors, Sylvan Muldoon and Hereward Carrington, attempted to deal with the subject of the commonly felt perceptions of duality — of being in two bodies at the same time, during an out-of-body experience — in their book, The Projection of the Astral Body. Muldoon stated that the physical brain receiving two sets of perceptions at the same time caused dual perception. He considered that one set came from the physical body and one from its projected double, via its silver cord connection. The sense organs of me physical body, Muldoon surmised, must continue to function even though me physical body was left empty after the projected double made a conscious exit. For some reason, Muldoon and Carrington did not consider the possibility that consciousness could continue to function in both bodies at the same time. They assumed the physical body was left as a mindless shell during any OBE. This observation, I believe, comes from the very real perception that every projector has of separating from their physical body during a conscious-exit projection. This empty body assumption, like a lot of early research and books on OBE and related fields, became source material for all researchers and writers that followed in their footsteps. This error in observation has been continually propagated ever since. It is today almost universally accepted that the physical body is left empty, unguarded, and exposed during any type of OBE. Many people even believe their essential spirit or soul leaves their physical body during a projection. These beliefs, quite understandably, raise real concerns about safety and integrity during an OBE. If the mind and spirit did actually leave the physical body empty during an OBE, it would be logical to assume that this empty body could easily be vulnerable to outside interference. The possibility of psychic attack, or even of possession, would be reasonable concerns. Over the last hundred years or so, the above empty body assumption has generated many beliefs, legends, and rituals: watcher beings, astral sentinels, and astral guardians, plus the perceived necessity for shields, magical wards, and rituals. One person I spoke to stated vehemently that all projectors must first wash in consecrated saltwater men bind themselves in iron chains to protect their supposedly empty body during a projection-or risk possession and soul damage or worse. Because these issues have remained clouded for so long, many projectors and would-be projectors worry a great deal about what might happen if they cannot find their way back to their body, or if their silver cord were to break or become damaged, or if they were unable to get back to their bodies, or accidentally became locked out of it in some way. They worry about returning to find their physical body already occupied by an invading spirit, entity, or demon — or even by another projector, for that matter. The experience of consciously separating from the physical body and leaving it behind can be extremely vivid and convincing. The experience of existing and operating remotely and independently from the physical body is also very distinct. But empty body perceptions do not allow projectors to perceive the underlying mind-split effects at work, because successfully remembered conscious-exit projection allows for only one side of a projection experience to be remembered... from the projected double's side only. If a projection is unsuccessful, the memories retained come solely from the physical body's side — all shadow memories (OBE memories) are lost. It is necessary to have memories from both sides of a single projection experience before the mind-split can be perceived for what it is. Only then can the mechanics and dynamics of the projection mechanism be truly appreciated and understood. The integrity and safety of the physical body and of its original copy of consciousness, mind, and memory, are never jeopardized during OBE. As I will show in the coming pages, the physical body is never left empty while it lives. The Reflecting Nature of Hind As part of a natural process, consciousness reflects a copy of itself, outside the bounds of the physical body, either while it sleeps or during any kind of conscious OBE. This reflection is a kind of energetic echo, containing a complete copy of consciousness, mind, and memory. It reflects into a subtle body or energetic vehicle capable of supporting and maintaining its integrity outside the bounds of the physical body. This process does not lease the physical body empty and unguarded. The reflection of consciousness usually happens unnoticed during sleep or an OBE. The mind-split effect is not apparent even during fully conscious-exit projections, where the projectors are fully aware of their OBE from beginning to end, including the exit and reentry phases. The symptoms of the mind-split effect are often strong, and quite evident if you know what to look for. But they are seldom recognized because of the way in which the mind-split happens, and because the nature of the physical brain is to store only a single memory for any single time period. Most people have enough trouble grasping the concept of a single projected double maintaining awake consciousness outside the bounds of the physical body. Grasping that there can be multiple reflected copies of a single mind, all existing and functioning simultaneously and independently on different dimensional levels, can take a bit of a mind flip. But that's essentially what happens. Understanding the mind-split and the true nature of humankind's multidimensional existence is extremely important. The mind-split effect makes sense of a great deal of the often confusing and conflicting data available on OBE. It greatly simplifies the understanding of OBE, and provides insight into some of the more esoteric and mind-boggling complexities of inter- dimensional relationships and operations in general. As I have said, it takes a bit of a mind flip to grasp the concept of there being multiple copies of a single mind, each with the potential to exist and operate independently during an OBE. Once the first level of the mind-split is grasped, the next logical step is to consider the possibility of multiple sets of memories recorded by the brain for any given time period during sleep and OBE. This, naturally, raises questions of how the physical brain would deal with these, or even if it could cope with"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 them at all. What types of memory-recording problems would this cause the poor old physical brain? How would this affect its overall ability to record and recall out-of-body experiences? And, if there are inherent problems with these memory processes, how can these be overcome to improve OBE operations and recall? The above questions, while appearing simple, raise complex issues. When I first tried to work it all out it gave me a blinding headache! I discovered the mind-split effect by sheer accident, during an extremely powerful projection, as told below. Subsequent experiments with the mind-split effect, sparked by this initial discovery, have since verified my original hypothesis. Once properly understood, many of the negative effects of the mind-split on OBE recall can be worked with, or worked around, instead of being suffered in ignorance. An understanding of the mind-split effect greatly improves the chances of getting out of body to start with, even for a rank beginner. It does this by improving the likelihood that projectors will remember their OBEs after the fact. The efficiency of all aspects of out-of-body operations is, in general, also greatly improved. I believe fully conscious OBE is nowhere near as difficult to achieve as is commonly believed today. The reason projection is considered difficult is because successful projectors usually do not perceive the mind-split and its effects. These lucky few, who have the knack of getting around the mind-split effect without even knowing what they are doing or how they are doing it, recall some of their out-of-body experiences. (No one recalls them all.) Because these lucky few don't really know what they are doing, they cannot explain how they do it. Therefore, studying their experiences and copying their techniques will not necessarily yield the desired results. The mind-split is the single biggest cause of OBE failure, but is virtually unknown for what it is. The mind-split leaves no trace or memory of what went wrong if a projection fails. Time and again it will turn successful OBEs into seemingly failed attempts. This thwarts the natural learning process, as it does not allow projectors to learn from their failures and thus improve upon their efforts. Because of all this, people tend to concentrate the majority of their efforts on projection techniques, searching for just the right quick fix to launch them out of their bodies. Projection technique, while important, is not the be-all- and-end-all for successful projection. There is a definite knack to remembering an OBE, which can only begin to be learned when the mind-split is properly taken into account. Portrait of the Mind-Split One full copy of thinking mind and memory — conscious and subconscious — stays at all times within the bounds of the physical body, whether awake, asleep, dreaming, or projecting. This original or master, copy never leaves the bounds of its physical body while it still lives. When the physical body falls asleep, or enters the trance state (mind awake and physical body asleep), consciousness is automatically reflected (projected) into the expanding etheric body. An energetic reflection of consciousness now exists at a slightly higher energetic state than the awake physical body allows for. The etheric body now contains within it a full reflection, a copy of all memories, conscious and subconscious. The expanded etheric body is now one energetic step above the physical body, one energetic step closer to the real-time body, which is the first level of the projectable double. The sleeping physical body contains an energetic mechanism called the dream mind. At some stage after the onset of sleep or the trance state, the physical mind (master copy) will begin dreaming. The etheric body can stay fully conscious if held in the trance state during a conscious OBE. It is also capable of functioning completely independently from its projected and dream mind aspects, even while both of these are fully active. The physical/etheric body now internally generates the real-time body, the first projectable double. This naturally occurs during sleep (sleep projection), but can occur during the trance state. As the real-time body is internally generated, another full copy of consciousness and memory are automatically reflected into it. As long as the real-time body generation and reflection of consciousness is still fully enmeshed within the physical/etheric body , its thoughts are fully synchronized with those of the etheric body. No noticeable mind-split effect has occurred at this stage, although the energetic conditions that allow the mind- split to occur are now present. All systems are go at this stage and a projection out of body can now happen naturally or can be artificially triggered by a projection technique. As the real-time body projects — at the precise moment marking the beginning of separation — the first true mind-split occurs. After projection, the real-time body exists as a completely separate entity, functioning, thinking, experiencing, and recording memories remotely and independently from its physical/etheric body. After the real-time double has projected free, the expanded etheric body, with its own copy of awake consciousness, remains aware for as long as it can hold itself awake. It will usually consider it has failed with its projection attempt, if one has been made, although it may have experienced many projection-related exit symptoms. It will feel tired, lethargic, and heavy, often experiencing partial or full waking paralysis, and will normally fall asleep fairly quickly. When the etheric copy of consciousness falls asleep, it appears to sink into and meld with the physical/dream mind, sharing its dream state. During conscious-exit projection, the real-time body will be vividly aware of the sensation of separating from and leaving its physical body behind. At this stage, the real-time double is operating completely independently from its physical/etheric double. Each will occasionally sense the other's existence, and an interchange of perceptions (sensations of duality) will often be experienced. The real-time double will, for example, often feel its physical body and hear sounds coming from that location. This sensory perception interchange, one of the most frequently noticeable symptoms of the mind-split, is greatly affected by distance. It is strongest within twenty feet (six meters) or so, and becomes progressively less noticeable with increased distance. Conditions now allow for further energetic copies of consciousness to be reflected into higher subtle bodies and dimensions, above and beyond the projected real-time double and the real-time zone. After this process has taken place, we have two complete energetic copies, plus their master copy of consciousness and memory:"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 1. Physical/dream mind (master copy) 2. Physical/etheric mind (expanded etheric body) 3. Real-time projected double (first true mind-split) One completely exterior mind-split has also occurred between the physical/etheric body and die real-time projected double. All three copies are energetically interconnected, and all three are capable of functioning and thinking completely independently — although in the case of the physical/dream mind, on a more internalized level of consciousness within die dream environment. The natural purpose of this multiple mind-split effect is, I believe, to allow the essential animating spirit to strip away the layers of gross matter that hold it fixed within the physical body and physical universe. This process progressively exposes the more refined spiritual aspects of the central animating core of spirit consciousness. This enables it to temporarily exist in higher dimensions, to reflect a part of itself there, during sleep or OBE. A solid base inside the physical/etheric body remains behind throughout this process, however, safely holding the original, or master, copy of its earthly consciousness and memories for its current incarnation. I suggest that shifting the base level of consciousness from the physical/etheric body directly into higher dimensional levels, in a single step, is way too big a leap. This shift appears to require a gentler series of multiple reflections into progressively higher and more refined subtle bodies, via multiple mind-splits. The conscious essence held and maintained within any projected subtle body is not just a mere energetic reflection of mind and memory, but a fully functional copy of its essential animating consciousness and spirit, plus all of its conditional and influential energetic modifiers. More on this later. My overall impression is that this process is designed to provide the central animating spirit consciousness with regular and direct exposure to the refining and adjusting influences of living karma and universal law, as they exist at vastly higher and more rarefied dimensional levels. This, I believe, is how karma and universal law actually work: the higher subtle bodies filter up and down through the dimensional scale — from the gross physical body to its highest energetic slate — whenever the physical body sleeps. You can find many clues showing the mind-split at work by examining some of the enormous numbers of case histories available today — if you know what you are looking for. Projectors often experience and make note of symptoms of the mind-split, but these have never been fully accounted for. The most commonly felt symptom is the sensation of duality — of being aware of the physical body while also being aware of existing in a subtle body at a different location. For example: \"I was flying through the clouds when I suddenly became aware of feeling my physical body back on my bed, and of hearing the clock Licking in the room and traffic noises drifting in through the open window\". Duality sensations are an occasional side effect of the mind-split, caused, I believe, by the silver cord, which is the two-way energetic linkage connecting the physical/etheric body with its projected double. Shadow Memory Shadow memory is my term for all memories not gained during normal waking consciousness by the physical body — memories gained through OBE, including lucid dreams and dream experiences. Shadow memories are downloaded into the physical brain after an OBE, and appear to exist in inaccessible levels of memory. Full waking consciousness completely overrides and hides shadow memories, making them extremely difficult to access and thus remember under normal circumstances. A very light trance or near-daydreaming state encourages shadow memories to surface inside the conscious mind where they can become real memories. During this relaxed state, the conscious mind tends to wander through events, ideas, fantasies, and memories, which causes associations to be made with fragments of shadow memories. Associations trigger the upsurge of shadow memories into conscious levels of the mind. The first few minutes of each day, just after waking, are when most people recall shadow memories . This is thus the ideal state and time from which to practice shadow memory recall exercises, using leading trigger phrases to cause associations. Double Trouble — Experience I experimented with duality, mind-split, and astral-feedback effects for well over a decade before writing this book. I had always been curious as to how and why my physical body reacted with its projected double, and how distance affected this. I intuitively sensed there was more to this than the common belief that the physical body tries to reclaim its projected double if it gets too close. I had often experienced unexplainable and confusing mixtures of perceptions and memories, at times with two or more sets of events apparently occurring at the same time during OBEs. Like many projectors, I had also often been aware of events and noises in the real world around my physical body at the same time that I was experiencing things in my projected double at a remote location. The following is a detailed account and breakdown of my first full mind-split and astral-feedback experience. I have tried to simplify this as much as possible to ease the inherent difficulties — not to mention the grammatical nightmares — that arise when trying to explain something as unnatural and confusing as a fall mind-split experience. Please bear with me. Fig. 2.

The wind was getting up and shaking the windows and doors. I glanced at the clock, briefly illuminated by a flicker of lightning. It was half past two in the morning. This was not unusual for me, as occasionally I will meditate all night. I felt wonderful, well-rested and full of energy. As the first distant sounds of thunder rolled softly over the house, I thought to myself, \"I don't think I've ever projected in a thunderstorm.... I wonder what it's like?\" Closing my eyes once again, I raised more energy through my still active primary centers, deepening my level of trance. When I was satisfied with my level of trance, I shifted my body awareness out in front of myself, strongly feeling myself as standing a few feet in front of my chair. The vibrations quickly started and spread throughout my body. My heart center soon began to race. The vibrations peaked and I felt a trickling upward rush of energy through my stomach and a brief falling sensation as I began to project. Then, just as I considered everything was going fine, the vibrations suddenly stopped and ... nothing happened... zilch! Puzzled, I sat pondering, heavy with trance, wondering why such an apparently successful projection exit had failed. This had happened to me on many occasions, but I had never understood why. I was, however, just about to find out why... the hard way. Projected Double's Side Buzzing free of my physical body after an easy exit, I came to rest floating several feet in front of where I was sitting. At this distance, my real-time double reflected the heavy action within my heart center. It throbbed loudly as energy poured into me from my physical/etheric body. It felt as if there were a tittle petrol engine throbbing inside my chest. As I floated across the room, the little engine in my chest purred faster as if to match my speed, then slowed again to a steady throbbing whenever I stopped. I passed through the wall near the window and went out into the blustery rain-drenched night. What a gloriously wet feeling! I could feel and smell and taste the rain passing through me as I floated across my front garden. The invigorating sounds and smelts and tastes of rain and wetness and plants and trees and soil and grass were everywhere. These rain smells were so strong, many times stronger than I would be able to sense in my physical body. The rain-swept night filled me with a wonderfully happy type of energy. It felt great to be so alive and out of my body on such a glorious night as this. Swooping up and over the roof with a quick loop, I hovered, looking around, the rain- filled wind buffeting and sleeting through me even more strongly up here. [The wind and rain did not actually move my projected double, but I was keenly aware of the sensation of them passing through me.] Sitting on the chimney, I gazed out over my old hometown, watching the rain dance in the streets below me, swirling and gurgling happily down gutters and drains. I listened carefully, taking everything in. The rain sounds seemed full of friendly voices, murmuring magical bubbly rhythms. Above, the low boiling clouds glimmering with hidden internal lightning. The tow sounds of heavy rolling thunder filled me with awe and tingling energy. Sitting on the roof, enjoying the storm and feeling a bit like a wet Mary Poppins, I felt something tugging at my innards. I knew that this was coming from my physical body in the room not far beneath me. I reached out with my feelings and sensed my physical body, instantly becoming aware of it. I felt the chair beneath me and the pillow under my feet. I could hear the drumming rain, but as it sounded from inside the house. Funny thing, for a moment I felt tike I was back in my body again. I could hear my father's old clock ticking on the wall. The sound of my old Labrador, Blue-Boy, snoring and dream yipping, drifted in from under the kitchen table in the family room to my far right. Floating higher above the roof, I swooped down through the garden and looped back up high, just grazing the dark- gray underbelly of a heavy storm cloud in the process. The sensations coming from my physical body eased the higher I went, soon stopping altogether. When I floated back down to the roof again, the tugging sensation began again. This was getting really weird, I thought. I had often wondered at the real cause of the proximity reaction between my projected and physical bodies. Many times I had felt myself being in more than one place at the same time, sometimes even flickering back and forth between my two bodies. But, I asked myself again, how could that be? It didn't make sense. If I was up here, then how could I be down there at the same time? Surety, once I left my physical body I was out of it and my body was left empty behind me, a mere hollow shell... or was it? My physical body was less than twenty feet below me at this time. I was intrigued now and decided to devote the rest of this projection to investigating proximity and duality sensations a little more closely. Passing through the roof, I watched the insides of tiles and timbers and plaster sheeting as I passed through them. I could feel resistance and texture and could even taste their dusty acrid flavors. Each type of matter looked quite different from any other and all were brightly illuminated on the inside, not dark as you might expect. Projected + Physical Bodies As I came through the ceiling, I saw my physical body in the armchair, right where I'd left it. At the same time, though, I also became fully aware of myself sitting in the chair, watching my own projected double coming down through the ceiling, I was seeing myself floating down through the ceiling, as well as seeing myself sitting in the armchair — both at the same time! It was me sitting in the chair, watching my projected double floating down through the ceiling. But, it was also me floating down through the ceiling, watching myself sitting in the chair, while also watching my projected double watching the other me sitting in the chair. I was aware not only of both sets of vision, but of both sets of thoughts, from both sides at once. I was aware of being aware of both sets of thoughts, and of being aware I was aware of being aware of being aware of both sets of thoughts, and this was swiftly compounding and getting worse. This was not only mind-blowing and confusing, it was also starting to make me feel quite ill... both of me. An important aspect of this experience is that until my physical aspect saw its projected double entering the room, it was totally unaware its earlier projection attempt had been successful. Luckily, at this time, my physical aspect was experimenting with real-time sight, and was observing and studying the room around it If not for this factor, I doubt I would ever have discovered the mind-split. Nor would I have experienced the full-on duality and astral-feedback effects that occurred, which gave me such an insight into the nature of the mind-split. My physical aspect was only momentarily surprised when it saw its own projected double. As soon as it connected"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 visually, a strong telepathic link formed between them and memories flooded both ways. An exchange of memories occurred between my physical and projected aspects. Both aspects, physical and projected, then knew exactly what had happened to each other from the moment of separation, when the mind-split had initially occurred, until then. This provided me with a unique experience: that of having two completely different sets of memories, for a single time period, coexisting within my mind (within both aspects of my mind) at the same time. Physical Body As stated, my physical aspect was aware of attempting a projection and feeling the usual energetic sensations associated with a powerful real-time exit. These sensations had then stopped cold, leaving my physical aspect sitting in the chair wondering what had gone wrong. It (I) decided to carry on with some energy work and real-time sight experiments. My physical aspect was totally oblivious, at this time, that it had already successfully projected its real-time double. My physical aspect felt a little heavy and sluggish after the supposedly failed projection attempt, with all the symptoms of a fairly deep trance. I also had fairly strong real-time sight, and could see the room much clearer than before. This was all fairly normal for the type of meditation and energy work I was doing at the time. I did not suspect that anything extraordinary was happening to me at this time. I decided to play around with real-time sight instead of falling back into a more abstract mystical state of deep trance meditation. I studied the room around me, slowly shifting my view so I could see behind me without physically moving. I was moving my etheric body around, quite literally, inside my own skin. There was no real sensation of movement, although it took considerable effort and concentration to do it, but my point of view moved as if my head were turning. By the way, this indicates that the etheric body (if awake) can gain some freedom of movement inside its physical body while an OBE is in progress. After several minutes, I felt an uncomfortable tension building up in my torso. This had happened a couple of times already during the course of my current experiments, but I thought that my effort to rotate my etheric body inside my physical body was causing it. I tried to extend a part of myself through the wall behind me, to project my point of view through it, but failed, although I could see behind me fairly clearly. I then felt a tangible presence in the room with me. I rotated my gaze to the front again , just in time to see an astral being slide down through the ceiling. I was momentarily surprised and perplexed, but realization flooded me the moment my gaze connected with the gaze of my projected double. This caused an incredibly strong telepathic connection, visual plus mental, and another set of memories suddenly flooded into me... feeling almost as if they had been there all the time. As we connected, the uneasy tension in my physical body worsened. I started to feel steadily increasing symptoms of nausea and something like physical shock. This connection was the start of what I now call astral feedback . Physical + Astral Bodies As my physical aspect and its projected double connected, we both became aware of both sets of memories from the moment of our initial separation at the projection exit. Once the telepathic connection and astral feedback started, I began to feel weak and nauseous in both bodies. My physical heart began pounding erratically — and this was reflected into my projected double. I was experiencing two completely different sets of vision, thoughts, and feelings, all at the same time, reflecting back and forth and swiftly compounding. This was, apart from the growing disorientation and nausea, absolutely fascinating. It also made a lot of sense. This first full mind-split experience provided answers to a lot of questions about certain projection oddities and phenomena. Just because my projected double was separated from its physical body, why would my physical mind (original copy) have to stop thinking and being? Why would it be left empty? I now had firsthand evidence that the mind splits, reflecting itself into two or more identical and independently thinking aspects during a projection. My projected double moved with some difficulty, carefully observing and studying its physical body in the chair, while the physical aspect of me watched it back and tried to do the same. This was no mean feat and took some very real effort on both sides. The nausea and mental pressure steadily increased in both aspects. I studied these effects as best I could in the short time I had. My heart center was throbbing unevenly and it felt like my physical heart was also pounding heavily and erratically. My level of trance began eroding at the start of the telepathic connection and I was now feeling more paralyzed than tranced. My physical body felt disoriented, dizzy, and highly nauseous. I could feel cold sweat trickling down my face and a chill spreading through my stomach and bowels. I felt like I was going into physical shock and would soon lose control over my bodily functions or pass out, or both. Throughout all of this I remained calm and controlled, but my mind(s) were definitely being stretched way beyond their design limits. I started to worry, considering the possibility that I might damage or kill myself if I continued with this experiment for too long. This would obviously negate its value entirely, to say the least. As my projected double was the only aspect capable of moving, and as this aspect was fully aware of the danger we were both in, he (it? I?) quickly moved out of the house. The feedback ceased the moment he went out through the wall and we soon lost contact with each other entirely. The nausea, etc ., quickly eased off. Projected Double — Same Time Period I felt weak and heavy; movement was becoming extremely difficult, like wading through thick mud. I struggled to move about the room while trying to study and understand the strange effects I was experiencing. I had very little energy and felt the nausea my physical body was feeling, which seemed to make it even worse, somehow reflecting and compounding it. I felt an incredible pressure, as if something were dragging at me and sucking the life out of me. I moved away from my physical body, an extremely difficult thing to do. I felt a great weight pull ing at me from behind as I turned my back on my physical body. It was as if I were moving in slow motion. A chill went through me as I turned and an atmosphere of fear settled over me that I could not explain. We understood what was happening to us, both aspects of myself, and both of us concentrated on clearing our minds in an effort to ease the telepathic tension between us. This helped a little, and with enormous effort I made it through the wall and back out into the rain-drenched night. The pressure eased off quickly as I left the house and soon disappeared altogether. I flew away from the house, skimming rooftops and enjoying the thunderstorm once more. Flying through heavy rain is a truly invigorating experience and I felt the strength flowing back into me. Looping high under the heavy storm clouds"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17 and swooping down again, I followed the wet road at motorcar speed close to the surface, watching the heavy raindrops dancing off the road as I slid along it. I could taste and smell the wet bitumen intensely and could also feel the texture of the road's surface as I scooted along it, weaving through the shadows of the dimly lit, tree-lined street. I mulled over the implications of what had just happened and decided I had better get back to my physical body fairly soon, as it had been quite distressed when I'd left. My physical aspect probably would expect me back very shortly and would not appreciate it if I stayed out for too long. I knew I'd feel that way if I were he, which I was, or am. On that slightly confusing note, I turned and made a beeline back to the house and my waiting physical body. Physical Body Once the projected double departed, the nausea eased quickly, but I still felt quite shaky and my heart continued thudding erratically, missing the occasional beat. I could move again, but only just, and I still felt partially paralyzed. I figured my projected double was still out but would return very soon. I knew I would if I were he, or rather, if he were me, which he was, or I was, or I am, or he is (whatever the correct grammar for this is). I relaxed, trusting myself, and cleared my mind to make the coming reentry easier. Astral + Physical My projected double returned a few minutes after leaving, slipping quietly through the wall and into the room. He/I approached my physical body, feeling at the last moment like he/I were being sucked into it. My physical aspect became aware of its projected double's return when the feeling of tangible presence and tension began again. A few seconds later, my physical aspect felt a tingling energetic body rush as its projected double reentered and reintegrated with its physical body. The tingling surge of energy started in my legs and quickly rushed up through my torso (a trickling, tingling excitement kind of energetic sensation) from my groin up through to my heart. The gap in my memories, from the time my two aspects had last parted company, suddenly vanished. I now had full recall of both sides of the latter part of the experience, the most recent part. I must say, it is an extremely odd thing to have two sets of memories for a single time period, but you soon get used to it. Separation Point The mind-split experience, as given above, and the many controlled experiments I have done similar to this, indicate that when the projected double leaves the physical body it takes with it a full copy of all memories up to the exact moment of the mind-split. From that moment onward, the projected double records its own memories completely separately. The physical body also continues recording its own set of memories after the moment of separation — memories of a continuing and unbroken existence within the physical/etheric body after an apparently failed projection attempt. The physical body has no further contact or way of knowing what is happening to its projected double after the moment of separation. When the mind-split occurs, there is a very definite break in the connection between the physical brain and its projected copy, as though a switch had been thrown. Many projectors hear a definite \"Click\" at the moment of separation, sounding much like a light switch being thrown. This may be a symptom of the mind-split occurring. Both physical and projected aspects continue to record two completely separate sets of memories, in two unbroken streams, separately and independently, until reintegration. If the download of the projected double's shadow memories (into an accessible level of the physical brain) is unsuccessful, the physical/etheric mind will have no way of knowing that a projection ever took place. In this case, only the memories of the physical/etheric aspect will remain. This is what normally happens after a seemingly failed projection attempt, where projection-related symptoms have been experienced, e.g., vibrations, rapid Fig. 3.

On reintegration, the strongest set of memories for the same time period — usually the physical/etheric body's side of the experience, its thoughts and dreams — becomes the memory stream retained and recorded in the physical body's permanent storage mechanism, the human brain. This is because the physical/etheric body's memories are automatically recorded by the physical brain as they happen, making shadow memory recall, by nature, a fairly difficult proposition. If the projected double does not succeed in impressing its shadow memories strongly upon the physical brain during reintegration, or if the physical brain is unreceptive, its shadow memories will usually fail to make any noticeable impression at all. They thus become effectively lost to the conscious mind. Shadow memory loss is far less likely if the physical/etheric mind works with its projected double before, during, and after their reintegration. This is part of the reason why I strongly advise people to keep their early projections ultrashort, as this greatly increases their chances of reclaiming their shadow memories during reintegration. Astral Feedback As the above mind-split experience shows, astral feedback can occur if the physical/etheric mind connects with its own real-time mind during a projection. Direct astral feedback is a powerful energetic, telepathic phenomenon that, if allowed to continue for too long, could very possibly cause psychological, energetic, and even physical damage to the brain. Direct astral feedback is like forcing the human mind to grasp actual infinity — the limitlessness of which no human mind is capable of grasping. Full astral feedback, as shown above, seems to occur only when both physical and projected doubles are fully awake and focused directly on each other at the same time. This can easily be avoided by not looking too closely at your physical or projected bodies, from either aspect, during a projection. If this does happen, however, astral feedback can be broken very easily when it first starts by simply shifting the attention of the projected double away from its physical body and leaving the area immediately. But the energetic sensations caused by the reintegration of the projected double with its physical body are extremely important to shadow memory recall when working with the mind-split. All reasonably competent real-time projectors can re- create a full mind-split experience with astral feedback, provided they can hold their physical/etheric aspect awake for long enough after the exit, and if they can use real-time sight ability to make the necessary visual/telepathic connection. This will provide firsthand evidence of the mind-split and its far-reaching effects. To sum up, astral feedback has three main aspects: 1. Telepathic connection: Astral feedback results from the physical/etheric and real-time mind focusing directly on each other during a projection, forming a direct two-way, reflecting, compounding, and incredibly strong tele-pathic connection. This is something like the infinity effect you get when you hold two mirrors facing each other. Each mirror (or mind) reflects a reflection of its own reflection (identical minds) and this compounds back and forth into infinity. 2. Visual Connection: When the physical/etheric mind is awake during a projection, it usually gains some degree of real- time or astral sight. This allows it to see into the real-time zone around it, making it possible for it to see its own projected double. This in itself presents no real problem unless the projected double looks back at it. They then begin seeing through each other's eyes, and this causes a reflecting visual link that begins compounding into infinity, along with their thoughts and feelings. A direct two-way visual connection appears necessary to cause astral feedback. This is a very disturbing phenomenon and I don't recommend you try it for more than a few seconds at a time. 3. Emotional Connection: Emotion can also form a part of astral feedback, as above, but will more often cause a different type of feedback on the emotional level alone. Emotional feedback, which does not appear to require a telepathic or visual connection, is quite different from astral feedback. It does not cause the same nauseating feedback effect, but can affect the physical/etheric body and its projected double quite strongly. Fear, anxiety, anger, excitement, and the sexual urge — especially primal urges such as fear and sex — all have very strong emotional undercurrents that can cause particularly strong emotional feedback between the physical/etheric, real-time, and astral bodies. If not taken into account and controlled, primal urges can reflect back and forth, growing in strength and compounding. This can cause enormous problems for an unwary projector. OBE Success and Failure Apart from my own extensive projection experience, I have also dealt with an enormous number of case histories during my years consulting on the Internet. In this time, I have dealt with a great many almost projection experiences sent to me by projectors who appear to be doing everything right. In most cases, they have learned and practiced the necessary skills and techniques, but keep failing the exit. Everything goes fine up to the moment when separation should occur: they feel a falling or floating sensation, then nothing happens... zilch. The whole experience ends right there. All the projection-related sensations vanish. This usually leaves them blurry, heavy, and sometimes even partially paralyzed — though no more so than a good level of trance will. Most people are so tired and disappointed by their seemingly failed projection attempt that they just roll over and go to sleep. They believe they have simply failed... once again. (Does this sound familiar?) But in most cases like this, the projection itself has been a complete success. Falling asleep is the very last thing you should do after the projected double has made its exit. A light sleep does not cause too many problems, as long as the projected double does not stay out for too long. A deep sleep, however, causes plenty of problems. The projected double should always plan to reenter before its physical/etheric body falls into a deep sleep. Once the physical/etheric mind falls into a deep sleep, the projected double may not be able to reenter its physical body at"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 that time. A deeply sleeping physical/etheric body is, at the very least, unable to respond to the energetic sensations caused by its returning projected double. If it does not recognize the symptoms of reentry and reintegration, it cannot help in recapturing shadow memories. It may wake up suddenly after reintegration, but it may not be able to recall any projection memories — usually not. The energetic sensations caused by the returning projected double are very distinct and noticeable, if you know what they are and are awake enough to feel them. These are extremely important. They can be used with great effect to capture shadow memories at the precise moment of reintegration, when they are strongest. An awake or only very lightly sleeping physical/etheric mind allows for much easier and more reliable shadow memory downloading during the tricky reintegration phase at the end of a projection. The projected double cannot reenter its physical/etheric body unless this is partially awake, or only very lightly asleep and easily awakened, to allow full reintegration and a successful shadow memory download. If the physical/etheric body and mind have fallen into a deep sleep, the projected double may be held outside the bounds of the physical/etheric body until it wakes up and causes reintegration to occur through the act of waking. Just as a partially sleeping or tranced physical body and mind are required for projection to occur, so a body and mind at least partially waking are required for reintegration to occur. On top of this, if the projected double stays out of its body for too long it will at some point lose control and begin to fall asleep itself. When the physical body finally wakes up, there may be — if anything — only a vague blur remaining of any projection memories, often mixed up with fragments of dreams. Ignorance of the mind-split, projection, and shadow memory recall is the major cause of projection memory failure. If the mind-split effect is properly taken into account, however, it can be made to work for projectors, not against them. Out-of-body projection, in itself, is reasonably easy to learn. Most people can learn to project with a minimum of training and fuss. Very few, however, remember their projections, although they will most likely succeed during many early attempts. Working with or around the mind-split, to recapture shadow memories, is the key to successful OBE. In most cases, it is not the projector's projection technique or abilities that cause projection failures, but the mind-split phenomenon itself. Successful projectors may doubt my theories on the mind-split and its wide-ranging affects on all aspects of OBE, because they have always experienced a single continuance of memory during OBE — the few they remember, that is. They remember consciously exiting their body with their memory continuing to record in a single and apparently unbroken stream. This gives them the vivid impression that they have actually left their physical body behind (and they have, in one sense) but does not prove they have left it completely empty. They might say: \"Hey man, I remembered my entire projection and my whole mind came with me, pal! I got out and traveled and did some really neat things, then got back into my body and remembered it all, as simple as that, just like any normal memory\". But, I ask you this, does it really happen quite as simply as all this? Do poor skill, poor natural ability, and poor projection technique really account for the extremely high failure rate associated with conscious-exit projection? I don't think so. It is more logical to consider that when an entire projection is remembered from exit to reentry, memory has simply continued recording in an apparently unbroken stream throughout the entire projection, from start to finish. The projectors are unaware that the shadow memories have simply overwritten the physical/etheric body's memories for that time period. The mind-split still occurred, but was completely unnoticed. This provides a single memory, apparently unbroken, of a projection from the time of separation to reentry — one single memory stream for a single time period. In this case, they have simply lost the physical side of the experience, rather than losing the projection side. Mixed Projection/Dream Memories Understanding and taking into account the mind-split takes us a long way toward explaining a great many projection and dream memory problems. Logically, of two or more memory sets for a single time period, the strongest parts will form the dominant memory set. These will form the final wrinkle in the physical brain, so to speak, replacing weaker ones. If there are strong elements in each memory set, only fragments of the strongest parts may be retained. Counting the basic reflected copies created by the mind-split effect: (1) dream mind, (2) etheric mind, (3) real-time mind, and (4) astral mind, we have the potential for three distinct mind-splits to occur between these copies: one internal and two external. This list does not include anything above the astral body. Please note that the awake physical body/mind becomes the etheric body/mind before any mind-splits occur. So the physical body/mind is not counted as a separate entity in the list below. This is because when the physical body/mind is in the awake state, all reflected copies are fully integrated and contained within it — i.e., they don't exist in this state. [Time lines (memory streams) are shown below as ] 1. Dream mind (reflected copy). First unbroken memory stream recording. Mind-Split #1 — Internal Split 2. Etheric mind ( master copy ). Second unbroken memory stream recording. Mind-Split #2 — External Split 3. Real-time mind (reflected copy). Third unbroken memory stream recording. Mind-Split #3 — External Split 4. Astral mind (reflected copy). Fourth unbroken memory stream recording."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 The above shows four completely separate memory streams being simultaneously recorded for a single time period during an OBE. These are recorded by four identical copies of the same mind, each existing independently on a different dimensional level. The bottom line here is that the physical brain's final memory for any single time span during an OBE (that final wrinkle) can come from more than one source. Any or all of these four reflected aspects of the same mind can contribute to this final memory. An important point to keep in mind is that the etheric body/mind is so closely enmeshed with the physical brain that it has much less trouble storing its memories therein. This, in itself, can cause shadow memory recall problems. During the trance state, for example, the center of thinking consciousness shifts into the etheric body, thus allowing the physical body to fall sleep. However, if the etheric mind stays awake in the trance state, it is capable of recording a single unbroken memory stream directly into the physical brain's storage mechanism. Etheric body/mind memories recorded during the trance state continue in a single unbroken memory stream. These memories are recorded directly into the physical brain, which, therefore, may not allow the projected double to interfere with previously recorded memories. This would involve overwriting previously recorded and stored memories (real memories) with another memory set for that same time period. This may be unacceptable to the physical brain's memory storage mechanism. If projection occurs during the trance state, and the etheric mind stays fully awake for some time after the exit, reentry is crucial and must be handled intelligently to capture and download the projected double's delicate shadow memories into accessible levels of the brain during reintegration. But projection memories are generally easier to recapture from a tranced or semitranced state than if the physical/etheric minds are allowed to enter the deep sleep state. Higher-Level Mind-Splits My experience indicates that higher subtle bodies, operating above the astral level, may undergo similar mind-split processes, and have similar properties, as their lower counterparts. These, however, operate at vastly higher and more abstract levels of consciousness. I do not mean to deliberately complicate matters here (I think I've done enough of that already), but as I am fond of saying, \"The further away you get from the physical universe, dimensionally speaking, the more bizarre and complicated everything all too soon becomes\". This shows, I think, the enormous difficulties inherent to projecting into dimensional levels above the astral planes, and of remembering this after the fact. It goes a long way toward explaining why projections into the mental and higher dimensions are virtually unheard of. And, let's not forget that we are also dealing with multiple copies of the subconscious mind, and multiple altered states of consciousness. I think there is enough to deal with just studying the lowest levels of the mind-split and of its effects on OBE and shadow memory storage. The higher levels can be disregarded for now. Anything above the astral planes is pretty much out of the reach of the majority of projectors anyway. Problems of reintegration and shadow memory recall appear mostly to concern the first two mind-splits. These undoubtedly cause similar problems with higher levels of projection. All projection memories, no matter at what level they were gained, must eventually be downloaded into the physical brain in the same way, in order to form a memory at the base level of consciousness. The complications raised by breaking down the entire mind-split effect from start to finish are staggering. While it is certainly something to ponder, it is definitely headache material and not entirely relevant to normal levels of projection."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 4. Complications of Consciousness Further examination of the mind-split effect leads to a very interesting concept: that the majority of people probably succeed at conscious-exit projection when they attempt it, even during very early attempts. Those who attempt OBE and feel projection-related symptoms, like the heaviness of trance, racing heartbeat, vibrations, torso rush, etc., are most probably successfully projecting out of body. They just are not aware of this at the time, and are therefore not remembering it afterward because of the mind-split effect and shadow memory recall problems. A popular theory is that everyone projects out every night to play and explore and learn and do all kinds of neat spiritual stuff, as if we were the astral otters of the universe. Then why do 99 percent of people have no memories of any kind of out-of- body existence? Where are the memories of all these lost OBEs? If the average projectors remember one projection out of a hundred, then surely during that one successful projection they would have some memory of the ninety-nine forgotten experiences? It is also quite common for projectors to become aware halfway through astral-plane projections, skipping the exit and first part of the projection entirely. Surely they would then have some recall of what they had been doing for the first half of their experience? The simple truth is that they never do. If you have been in the astral dimension for an hour, and you suddenly become aware you are in the astral , you never have any recollection of what you have been doing during the hour before you became aware. In a way, this is like waking up in the astral and taking over the astral body, which appears to have been operating independently up until that moment. The memory of what it had been doing for the previous hour is lost from that moment onward. Are these the symptoms of yet another subtle body reintegration and shadow memory recall problem, but on the astral level? The mind boggles at the potential complexities of inter-dimensional subtle body relationships and energetic conflicts. Further, consider the compatibility problems that could arise between different levels of consciousness, different levels of understanding, and memory sharing between these. And let's not forget basic reintegration problems and the fickle nature of the eventual shadow memory download into the only permanent storage medium all subtle bodies share, stretched between all aspects of the mind-split: the humble physical brain. Everything experienced out of body must eventually be downloaded into the physical brain, in base level understandability format, if it is to generate recallable memory. If you examine case histories, or have experienced this yourself, you find that every projection starts fresh, from the very beginning, just as if it were the very first OBE. Projectors never find available any continuing memories of astral-otter type of life, even if they suddenly shift into an astral projection that has been going on for some time. They remember other successful projections, sure, but absolutely nothing of their ninety-nine failures, and all the other nights when they just fell asleep. Few people state that their experience contradicts this scenario. I consider dreams and overactive imagination to account for them. So, what does happen to all these lost astral- and higher-level memories? Do they download into inaccessible levels of the subconscious mind and hide in places where even the deepest level of hypnosis cannot dig them out? Why does one successful conscious-exit projection provide vivid and lasting memories while the other ninety-nine unconscious projections do nothing? It seems possible that an intrusion by the base level of consciousness (the physical/etheric mind in its normal waking state) into the astral double causes the astral double's level of consciousness to drop sharply. This causes the astral level of consciousness to revert to its lowest form, its fully integrated or base level of consciousness. The lowest and coarsest level of a consciousness unit appears, in all cases, to be far stronger than any higher level or aspect of that same consciousness unit (consciousness unit = the whole person or being). When present, the base level thus replaces any higher levels of consciousness and overwrites any memories gained independently by those levels of consciousness on higher levels. This is what I believe happens when higher and lower levels of consciousness reintegrate on any dimensional level or level of consciousness. The stronger base level simply replaces and overwrites the higher level. The projection continues from that point at the base level of consciousness and understandability, neatly replacing higher-level experience memories. The higher-level memories still exist after this event, but they are driven into inaccessible levels of the subconscious mind and memory. The overall effect is that a projection continues from that moment on as if it had just started. This occurs whether reintegration occurs at the bottom end of the scale (in the waking physical body) or at a higher level, say in the astral body, when the projector suddenly becomes aware and wakes up inside the astral body mid projection. The lowest level of consciousness always replaces and overwrites any higher level of consciousness and effectively wipes out all trace of its memories at the moment of reintegration. This same thing appears to happen every time during the re-integration of the real-time projected double with its physical counterpart. The real-time double contains the experience memories of all of its higher aspects within it. All memories of higher levels of existence are therefore usually lost, downloaded into inaccessible levels of subconscious mind and memory. This shows there is an inherent problem with reintegration: downloading and storing shadow memories in accessible levels of the physical brain. By default, shadow memories must be accessible to the base level of waking consciousness, and stored in base-level format, if they are to be recognized by the physical brain as recallable memories. While I think it is unlikely as a continually ongoing process during every moment of sleep, it does seem possible that the projected double and all of its higher selves could lead separate lives while they are out of their physical body. They could be, as is commonly believed, continually gathering experience memories that the base level of consciousness is simply not privy to. The physical brain is not capable of storing and recalling higher-level memories unless they are first converted into simple base-level format. As a very rough guess, I'd say that less than one percent of high-level experience memories are potentially accessible to the physical brain at the base level of consciousness. The great limiting factor of living a multidimensional existence would be the availability of energy to all higher projected aspects. It takes a lot of energy to maintain the integrity of a single projected double. It would take a great deal more, requiring a high level of energetic development, to simultaneously maintain multiple copies of awake consciousness on multiple dimensional levels."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 Memories from higher levels of consciousness may not even be in sync with what the physical brain is capable of recognizing and storing as viable memories. This factor causes the full memories of high-level experiences to be stored deep within the subconscious mind. The only parts of high-level experiences that are storable as recallable memories are those parts the physical brain is capable of recognizing and converting into base-level format. I believe the above factor accounts for the metaphorical abstracts, symbols, images, and feelings that are sometimes remembered after high-level OBEs and dreams, instead of more recognizable types of OBE and dream memories. This, if true, goes a long way toward explaining the abstract and metaphorical nature of prophetic OBEs, visions, and dreams and why these are so difficult to understand and interpret. The physical brain is only capable of storing the surface layer of high-level experience memories. The thin surface layer of memories that can result from high-level experiences are the physical brain's interpretation of higher and more abstract levels of its own existence in higher dimensions, while it is operating at a correspondingly higher level of consciousness therein. I have found that the higher the level of consciousness attained, and the higher the dimensional level projected into, the more abstract and metaphorical existence becomes. Dreams and lucid dreams can also be affected by high-level experiences. High-level experiences may not be able to download into accessible levels of memory, but they will impinge upon the dream mind and affect its environment and experiences. If these dreams are remembered, meaningful and prophetic elements will often be found within them. This is very similar in cause and effect as to how akashic pulse episodes (see part 5) will often leave tantalizing fragments of high-level abstract metaphorical imagery inside normal dream memories. Because of this, the importance of dream memories to the life path of all individuals here in the physical dimension should never be undervalued. This raises the very real possibility that conscious-exit projection causes a shift of the base level of consciousness (normal waking consciousness) into higher subtle bodies. This may be the only thing that allows any memories of existing in those levels to be captured and downloaded into the physical brain. To even begin to work around the complexities of this event requires serious energetic, psychic, and spiritual development. It also requires a major rethink of the belief system of any aspiring high-level operator. High-level projectors must learn to handle all their experiences as a very young child would do, without prejudice or preconceived ideas. They must learn to see with the eyes of a child. For this purpose, their belief system must be pruned back to include only what they can do themselves, and what they have experienced for themselves. Every experience should be accepted simply, as a child would, and not interpreted or explained and overcomplicated to death according to any belief system or dogma, as adults so often tend to do. An overcomplicated or faulty belief system not only blinds high-level seekers , it also effectively blocks their ascension into higher levels. Higher dimensional realities simply cannot be experienced if these realities are contradictory to the seeker's own foundation belief system. This helps explain some of the enormous difficulties encountered when operating in dimensional levels above the midastral planes. It would seem that a fully conscious exit from the physical body would be the most basic requirement for conscious high-level projection. A fully conscious shift into the astral body, and from there into the high astral planes, and from there into the mental body and mental planes and so on, would also seem to be basic requirements to operating in those dimensional levels. These basic requirements may be the only thing that allows conscious projectors to bring back anything resembling real memories from higher levels, even if these are only the surface layers of those memories. Memories gained by the base level while operating at a higher level can then be recognized by the base level of consciousness. Keep in mind, this does not overcome the difficulties encountered with high-level abstract metaphorical imagery natural to all levels of existence higher than the base level of consciousness. High-level surface-layer memories stored in base-level format will still be abstract and difficult to understand by the base level of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 5. Astral Sight In-body real-time or astral sight is a subtle body ability that allows projectors to see through closed eyelids, and even through heavy bedcovers (see chapter 1). Projectors frequently note this phenomenon during the prelude to OBEs and during waking-paralysis episodes. This can also occur during the trance state alone, due perhaps to partial internal generation of the real-time projectable double. The etheric body itself, while glued firmly within the physical body, also seems capable of developing independent real- time and astral-sight abilities, under the right circumstances. This is a complexity of the mind-split effect that most commonly occurs after the projected double has made its exit, and during waking-paralysis episodes. The quality of these abilities is extremely variable. They seem dependent on bioenergetic development, and on natural ability. Many people, when they experience in-body real-time sight, do not realize their physical eyes are actually closed at the time, or that they are seeing through their bedcovers, often in a direction away from where their physical body is actually facing. There appears to be more to real-time and astral sight than meets the eye — if you'll pardon the awful pun. They may seem to result from a part of a subtle body peering out from within the confines of the physical body, but subtle bodies do not contain functioning sense organs, nor functioning copies of sense organs (see chapter 7). Everything seen in this way is better described as being directly perceived by the mind/senses of the subtle body in question. The etheric and real-time bodies, once internally generated and partially freed from the limitations of their physical body, are capable of perceiving energy directly and of interpreting it in a visual way. While separation is still only partial, the physical brain shares the subtle body's perceptions. Under this circumstance, out- of-body sight is shared simultaneously with the sight center of the physical brain. It is therefore perceived as if seen through the eyes of the physical body. These visual perceptions, although technically experienced out of body, cause immediate memories to form in the physical brain. In a way, it can be said that out-of-body perception and shadow memory sharing is taking place, causing direct sight and memory input into the physical brain. Remote-Eye Projection Remote-eye projection is a term I use for another complication of consciousness and of the mind-split. A remote point of consciousness can project out of the physical body without any kind of normal projection being sensed or even appearing to take place. This occasionally happens spontaneously to an awake but extremely tired person, but it can also occur during the somnambulistic or deep-trance states. Accidental remote-eye projectors are always extremely tired and hanging right on the edge of sleep, forcing themselves to stay awake. (There is normally another person involved, keeping the remote-eye projector awake.) The overtired person suddenly sees a vision of a remote scene very clearly, as if with physical eyes. This is usually a real- time scene fairly close to the projector's actual location in the real world. Remote-eye projectors are usually, but not always, able to see in all directions at once. They are also usually unaware of having any type of body or mind at their remote eye's location, although they will be fully aware of their physical body and its surroundings. They also usually have only limited influence over the movement of their remote-eye aspect, if any. Note here that remote-eye projection occurs while the physical body and mind are awake and functional, if only just barely. The physical body is still capable of sluggish movement, even of standing and walking and going to the bathroom — especially if the projector has some experience operating in the full-trance state. Speech is possible, but takes effort and is usually slurred. However, the projectors are fully capable of speaking and of giving a running commentary of the movements and perceptions of their remote-eye aspect — if they can stay conscious long enough to do so. The view from their remote eye may come and go, especially if the remote-eye projectors attempt to undertake any activity requiring more than partial attention. Remote-eye projections are less dramatic and hence less commonly associated with OBE than are normal spontaneous projections, but they are not exactly a rarity. They are caused, I think, by the projection of a very low-powered version of the real-time double, with a barely noticeable mind-split. A weak version of the real-time double is projected, or more aptly ejected, from an extremely overtired physical body and mind that, quite literally, cannot hold itself together any longer. The remote eye (projected double) will, if effort is applied, be found to respond sluggishly to the will of the awake remote-eye projector. This is more of an influence than a control. If left alone, the remote-eye aspect will continue moving about, changing direction and even flying at times, completely under its own volition. This last factor strongly indicates that the remote-eye aspect has its own copy of mind, albeit maybe a weaker copy or reflection of the original. The mind-split effect is quite evident here. Projectors clearly perceive themselves as existing in two separate locations simultaneously. Neither aspect is aware of the other's thoughts and no astral feedback is apparent between them. This can aptly be called a genuine type of out-of-body experience, although the projector is fully aware of being within the bounds of the physical body at all times. The following is a typical remote-eye projection: It is late and I am very tired. My eyes sting with dryness and feel like lead and I have to force them to stay open. The room is dimly lit, with only a little moonlight coming through the window. I can just make out the shadowy shapes of the furniture in the room around me. My body is heavy with trance symptoms. If I stand, I feel like I am walking on big, fluffy pillows, and I can hardly feel my legs at all, though I know they are still there and can still use them if I try. I feel a bone-deep tickling throughout physical my body whenever I move any part of it. My eyes droop closed briefly, and suddenly I become aware of seeing clearly from a remote point of view outside my body. My remote-eye aspect is floating down the road near my house. I can see in all directions at once. I am still aware of listening to my friend talking, and of mumbling a few short replies here and there, when prompted. I can still talk and move my physical body, after a fashion. If I pull myself together, taking a"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 deep breath and forcing my attention back to the room and the conversation, my remote eye view and that of the room around me flickers back and forth. Each time this happens, I get a sinking feeling in my stomach and chest, like the sensation you get when your airplane hits an air pocket. This is the same sensation you get when the projection reflex starts to kick in, just before the separation of the physical body from its projected double. I can hold this remote eye view if I relax and concentrate on it with my eyes closed, but I can also see the same view, superimposed over the darkness, although not as clear, if my eyes drift open. My remote eye view is exactly what I would experience if I were actually projecting in real time. I am not really there, but I am seeing from there. If I drift a little too deeply toward sleep, I feel myself switch to the remote location, inside my real-time body. When this happens, my mind comes with me. I shift back to my physical body again if my friend touches my arm or speaks to me. While focused on my remote-eye aspect, it feels like I am connected to something like a flying remote TV camera, and my eyes are little TV sets receiving the view from there. Control of my remote-eye aspect is difficult, but I do seem to have a slight influence over it. This type of experience usually happens spontaneously, but I have had some success re-creating the necessary conditions and causing it deliberately. If I am not with another person who is instructed to keep me awake, I will usually shift into the remote-eye projection fairly quickly. It is a very delicately balanced and difficult state to hold for any length of time, even with assistance. If I allow myself to fall asleep, the experience invariably becomes a real-time projection without noticeable separation or exit sensations. In my remote-eye projections, I have never experienced waking paralysis, only physical heaviness and sluggishness. I have always been able to think, talk, and move my physical body, albeit very sluggishly. It is quite possible that remote-eye projections involve a different type, level, or strength of the real-time projected double than is normally generated during an OBE. This may be more like a real-time reflected double, rather than a real-time projected double. It is also possible that when the physical body becomes overtired, it internally generates a weak real-time double as its bare minimum requirement for that level of tiredness. This then slips out if the physical body is held semiawake for too long. On the other hand, if the physical body drifts into sleep for only a brief second or two while in this extremely tired state, a projection exit occurs. This may account for the lack of exit-related sensations, or the missing memory of them. The mind-split is quite evident here, with consciousness residing in both the physical body/mind and its projected double at the same time. Each acts independently of each other, with the physical body receiving the remote-eye visual connection as something like secondhand input. The center of consciousness flickering back and forth between these two aspects also shows the strong and intimate link between them. The visual connection between the awake physical body and its remote-eye aspect is most likely provided via the silver cord, as per any other type of projection, but the brow center is also very likely involved here. The awake but tranced physical/etheric mind can be thought of as receiving a type of remote-eye, real-time vision broadcast from its projected double, via its silver cord. If I am right here, this vision is received and seen by the physical/etheric mind in its mind's eye, in a very similar way as normal clairvoyant mind's-eye visions are seen. This type of experience also supports my theory that the physical body's original copy of consciousness stays firmly inside the physical body, but is energetically connected with its projected aspect at all times. This suggests that any other type of out- of-body projection will be found to have similar basic properties, although these may not be quite so apparent nor so well perceived. Remote-eye projection also adds weight to my theories on the mind-split effect, that OBE can occur at any time during the trance state, often without being noticed. The physical/etheric mind stays awake and functional, but remains totally unaware that a projection is in full progress. This often, I believe, happens to people during meditation, usually without them being aware of it at the time. There are some other, more subtle, contributing factors at work during a remote-eye projection. When people are extremely tired, their brain waves slow and their physical bodies feel heavy, fuzzy, and sluggish: These are classic trance-state symptoms. Full trance is the ideal state not only for projection, but also for clairvoyant visions. The will and mental effort required to force overtired eye and eyelid muscles to respond localizes and focuses body awareness in the eyes and brow area. As these muscles are not working properly, most of the eye-opening effort causes a strong, localized body-awareness action in the eyes and brow area. The brow center (third eye) is situated in this very same area. The brow center is intimately connected with the eyes and with the sight center of the brain, with all other types of non-physical sight, and with many aspects of projection-tube-type projections for example. Forcing tired eyes to stay open stimulates the brow center quite effectively, and energizes whatever developed or natural clairvoyant capabilities the brow center has. The full-trance state also causes a naturally increased flow of energy throughout the physical/etheric body, making available to the brow center and its supporting energetic circuitry far more energy than usual. This combination of increased energy flow and brow center stimulation is usually enough to stimulate the brow center into an energetically receptive mode. The Missing Link There is nothing simple about OBE. There are many subtle variations possible. This chapter outlines just one variation that falls into a shady area somewhere between projection and clairvoyance. A more apt description of this type of experience would be real-time remote viewing, rather than OBE, per se. Fig. 4. Tired eyes lifting action, showing awareness effect on brow center"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25 Projections falling into this category often involve clear perceptions of duality, with consciousness often flickering back and forth between the physical and its remote aspect for the duration of the experience. A remote-eye projection experience has a different look and feel to it than more common types of projection. It is also far more mentally and energetically draining, if continued for any length of time, which is not surprising if you take into account the overtired state of the physical body and mind necessary for this phenomenon to occur."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26 6. Waking Paralysis Waking paralysis (also called sleep paralysis) is extremely common: you wake up paralyzed, or suddenly become paralyzed while relaxing or trying to get to sleep — but while still awake. Most people will probably experience it at some time. This can be terrifying, as the cause is always unknown at the time. Paralysis is a well-known symptom associated with out-of-body experience; natural projectors will, more often than not, be found to suffer frequent bouts of waking paralysis throughout their lives, especially during their teens and twenties. I was plagued by it during my childhood, teens, and twenties. It slowly lessened in frequency over the years, but only after I began regular energetic development and learned how to project in my early twenties. I still get it occasionally, a couple of times a year. Waking paralysis is extremely complex and no single explanation can really explain its causes. The two most popular theories are dissociation and spontaneous projection. Dissociation: The general scientific explanation is that the brain dissociates itself from its physical body during sleep, as it enters the dream state, ostensibly to stop the physical body from thrashing about, mimicking its dream actions and injuring itself. Waking paralysis is said to occur when the mind accidentally wakes up inside its dissociated sleeping body. This explanation does have merit, as the physical body does progressively dissociate itself from its mind during sleep, and during the trance state. However, I do not believe this explanation holds all the answers. Entering the trance state brings the first symptoms of dissociation; the deeper the trance state attained, the more difficult movement becomes. But dissociation brought on by the trance state comes on slowly, in degrees, over many minutes. Waking paralysis, on the other hand, comes on very swiftly, usually within only a couple of seconds. And I have never experienced full waking paralysis during trance, not even during the virtual catalepsy of the deep-trance state. Spontaneous projection: The popular New Age explanation is that waking paralysis is caused solely by spontaneous projection, more specifically by a projection that is about to occur or is trying to occur. Many people recommend, because of this, that waking-paralysis victims relax and go along with the experience, so they can convert their waking-paralysis episode into a full OBE. This explanation also has merit, as paralysis definitely appears related to some aspects of projection. However, in my opinion, waking paralysis is a complication of consciousness with many contributing factors. I think it is more complex than is commonly believed. Waking paralysis is often not accompanied by vibrations or other projection-related exit sensations. Very often, for no apparent reason, people will either suddenly become paralyzed while relaxing, or while trying to fall asleep, or they will wake up to find themselves paralyzed. Everything is quiet and they have no major projection-related sensations (vibrations or rapid heartbeat); they just find themselves suddenly and inexplicably paralyzed. Many people (myself included) can detect the onset of a waking-paralysis episode, especially when it comes on during a relaxed but awake state. They feel an almost irresistible sinking sensation moments before the onset of paralysis. This happens very quickly, with only a couple of seconds' warning. While the sinking feeling can be called a projection-related symptom, this is often the only sensation experienced during the entire paralysis episode. Most paralysis episodes, in my opinion, happen after the projection exit has occurred. Full waking paralysis cannot occur before the projection exit. So, why are no projection-related exit sensations usually experienced during waking paralysis? The most logical answer is that spontaneous natural projection has already occurred, and the exit sensations have already passed, or have been missed altogether due to the mind-split effect. The paralysis victim either sleeps through them and wakes up paralyzed, while an OBE is in progress, or the symptoms are so swift and mild they go unnoticed, as with remote-eye projection (see chapter 5). The physical/etheric mind awakes inside its dissociated, mind-split, paralyzed physical body during an OBE, while its projected double is out and about. When projection exit symptoms are experienced only at the beginning of a waking-paralysis episode, it is a fairly safe bet that a spontaneous projection was taking place at that time. The projection exit has been missed due to the mind-split effect. This has left the projector's physical/etheric mind (original copy) fully awake and paralyzed during the remainder of that projection. The projection itself is causing the waking paralysis. While some waking-paralysis victims claim to succeed at converting it into a projection, the vast majority fails to do so. Most people are too afraid at the time to even contemplate a conversion. Those who do try for a conversion usually fail, even if they completely give in to it and genuinely go along with the whole experience. They usually lie there paralyzed until it ends on its own accord, or until they manage to move a part of their physical body and thus break out of it. In this case, they have succeeded in aborting the projection and forcing their projected double to reenter and reintegrate. This ends the paralysis, but causes their projected double's shadow memories to be lost in the process. If paralysis is caused by a projection already in progress, as I suggest, then it would obviously not be possible to have another projection at that same time. This may account for the extremely high failure rate of attempts to convert waking paralysis to OBE. If an episode of waking paralysis has no projection-related symptoms during its onset, but is later converted successfully into an OBE, I would suggest that the projected double has been reeled in after an unnoticed exit (the one that caused the waking paralysis), but with only partial reintegration taking place. It has then been immediately projected out again, but this time produces normal projection-related symptoms because of the presence of awake consciousness during the second exit. Memories of the first exit (the cause of the waking paralysis episode) are not downloaded into the physical brain. These are automatically overwritten during the second exit, leaving no trace of what really caused the waking paralysis in the first place. I would suggest that when an entire episode of waking paralysis is accompanied by vibrations, plus other exit-related sensations, internal energetic mind-split conflicts (most likely caused by the presence of awake consciousness during the projection process) are stalling the spontaneous-projection mechanism. This is another complication of consciousness. Actual projection may or may not occur. In this case, attempting to convert waking paralysis into an OBE by relaxing and going with the experience, or by using a projection technique to aid it, will have much more success. I have experienced waking-paralysis episodes literally hundreds of times, but have never managed to convert one into an"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27 OBE. I have had hundreds of spontaneous projections from the waking state, or have wakened in the middle of them, but these always result in either a partial or full OBE. I perceive a marked difference between spontaneous projections and waking- paralysis episodes. Each feels quite different and, while spontaneous projection is quite acceptable to me, I absolutely loathe waking paralysis. I consider spontaneous projection and waking paralysis to be two different sides of the same coin. Sometimes spontaneous projection is experienced and remembered, but at other times waking paralysis is experienced and remembered. These are two different aspects of spontaneous projection, caused by the mind-split effect, providing two totally different experiences. Only one side of a spontaneous paralysis-cum-projection episode is usually remembered — the side perceived and remembered by the physical/etheric mind. The other side, that of the projected double, is neither perceived at the time nor remembered after the event. Shadow memories are completely lost because of the trauma or excitement waking paralysis always causes. This trauma firmly cements the physical/etheric side of the experience into physical memory, totally disallowing any shadow memories. With certain types of projection, exit symptoms can be extremely mild, often not noticed at all. This is most common with projections involving the brow or crown centers. This indicates natural clairvoyant potential, often unsuspected. It also means the projector has the potential for high-level projections, because clairvoyance and high-level projection are intimately related. It is possible, therefore, that some types of waking paralysis are caused by brow- or crown-center projections in progress, where the exit has been missed. Fear and dread accompany many waking-paralysis episodes, often with a tangible feeling of presence coming from a particular direction. Fear may be caused by mind-split effects combined with emotional feedback (fear and anxiety) between the physical/etheric body and its projected double during a real-time projection. Other kinds of projections may also contribute incidences of waking paralysis and spontaneous projection. There is a strong possibility, for example, that akashic pulse episodes — astral wind — may prove to be a major contributing factor in some waking-paralysis episodes. An akashic pulse episode could, conceivably, force projection on people who are deeply relaxed, even though they are technically still wide awake. They could then experience waking paralysis while left awake inside their physical/etheric mind, until their projected double is released and allowed to reenter and reintegrate after the akashic pulse episode is over. We will look at the akashic pulse in part 5. Related Factors The physical/etheric mind on its own does not usually have the power to animate its physical body during an OBE. To awaken even partially and restore some degree of physical movement, the reintegration of the physical/etheric with its real- time double appears to be the minimum requirement. To restore full waking consciousness and functionality, the complete reintegration of all subtle bodies is required. Another contributing factor may be that the state of energetic development of paralysis sufferers may not allow conscious- exit projection to occur easily. This creates internal energetic conflicts that stall the projection mechanism, causing waking paralysis to occur more easily than projection. Early conscious projection exits are usually marked by extremely heavy vibrations, rapid heartbeat, and other heavy energy-movement sensations. These heavy sensations always reduce in severity during subsequent projections. Logically, there must be a reason for this progressive lessening of sensation. The answer, I think, is that increased energetic development reduces internal energetic conflicts. Attempts at conscious-exit projection involve a lot of primary-center activity, and a great deal of energy flows throughout the etheric body, which forces some degree of energetic development to take place. This forced development appears to account for progressively milder exit sensations being experienced during subsequent projections. If you add energetic underdevelopment to potential conflicts caused by mind-split, and take into consideration shadow memory download problems and other complications caused by the presence of waking consciousness, you have a recipe for disaster. Waking paralysis can thus occur at any time and for many reasons, because of the delicate interactions between these potential complications. In most cases, the waking-paralysis victims remain none the wiser before, during, or after the fact, because of the nature of the mind-split effect. The following two scenarios may explain some other types of waking paralysis, in particular those where strong feelings of fear and dread and a tangible sense of presence are involved. Both of the following scenarios involve strong emotional feedback between the physical/etheric body and its projected double, interfering with and stalling a projection in progress. Emotional feedback has many similarities to astral feedback, but happens on the emotional level only. It is, therefore, only felt, not realized. Paralysis and the Physical Body: The mind awakens inside its paralyzed physical body. It may or may not have felt any projection-related exit sensations earlier. It has awakened for a very good reason: Something has just scared the daylights out of its projected double! It has no way of knowing this has happened, though, or that it is actually in the middle of a projection. It just wakes up paralyzed and scared, sensing a tangible presence somewhere nearby in the room. It cannot move to see what it is sensing, so its fear steadily increases, and floods along the silver cord and into its projected double, as it fights to break free of the paralysis. The projected double keenly feels this new surge of fear. It has no apparent cause or source, but is sensed as coming from a particular direction — from its body, although the projected double does not know it. The projected double now begins to feel a strange pressure dragging upon it, a pressure coming from its own physical/etheric counterpart as it desperately struggles to break free of its paralysis. This struggle has the effect of dragging the projected double back toward its physical body. The projected double does not recognize this dragging force for what it is, and so fights against it with everything it has. Fear escalates quickly on both sides, as both aspects feed and compound the emotional feedback problem. Both sides of the mind-split — physical/etheric and projected double — are scared to death; each senses a tangible dread presence coming from a particular direction — coming from each other, but neither side knows this. The tug of war continues until either the physical/etheric side succeeds in dragging back its terrified projected double (which is usually the case), or until the physical side faints or gives up and falls back to sleep again in exhaustion."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 Paralysis and the Projected Double: The following scenario again relates to emotional feedback, but in this case a conflict between the dream mind and its projected double, where the dream mind has not actually awakened inside its physical/ etheric body. A projected double is floating about in real time, having fun and minding its own business, when it suddenly has a fright. It sees some bushes moving in the shadows and its imagination plays tricks on it: an ominous shape reaching for it. It freezes, not knowing quite what the shape is or what to do about it. It tries to flee, and suddenly senses a very tangible fearsome presence right behind it. An irresistible force starts dragging it backward. It tries to move away, but suddenly feels weak, as if its very life force were being drained. It now feels trapped and has extreme difficulty moving. The dream mind, throughout this, feels the initial fear surge from its projected double, but does not know the cause. The fluid dream state changes at this point and takes on a more sinister aspect. The dream mind may even slip into a nightmare. The dream mind does not awaken inside its physical/etheric body, so it doesn't actually experience true waking paralysis. It will, however, experience a dream-state version of waking paralysis or a slow-motion type of bad dream. The projected double feels trapped, snared by some powerful unseen evil foe. Now so weak it can barely move, it feels like it is wading through rapidly setting concrete. No matter how hard it tries, it cannot seem to break the grip of its unseen assailant. Weak, trapped, and afraid, it moves one step closer toward absolute terror. The fear increases and the projected double fights in vain, growing steadily weaker. The sense of dread increases, and fear builds into mindless, paralyzing terror. It cannot move at all now and feels a cold weight spreading through its chest. The dreadful thing behind it is getting closer and closer, dragging it heartlessly backward toward its evil clutches. The monster almost has it now and is ... just... about... to ... grab it! The projected double can almost feel the monster's fetid breath on the back of its neck. The unseen monster has it now, and is raising its dreadful ax, when, suddenly, the projector wakes up in a pool of sweat, heart pounding, gasping for breath, and shaking with terror. Memories of the projection (just a bad dream?) flood the projector's terrified mind. Paralysis Memories The dominant memories retained after any waking-paralysis episode always come from the strongest and most memorable side of the experience, the side most traumatized. This is usually the physical/etheric side, as that side of the mind-split has a much more direct effect on the physical brain than shadow memories generally do. If the dream mind does not awaken inside its physical/etheric aspect before the end of the paralysis episode, these memories will be from the projected double's side of the mind-split instead. Sometimes, because of the complex and unreliable nature of shadow memory downloading during reintegration, these memories will become mixed. Memories of a bad dream, plus a terrifying projection experience, plus waking up paralyzed and terrified, blend into a uniquely compounded shadow memory download. Ways to Break Paralysis Learning and practicing conscious-exit projection reduces the frequency of paralysis episodes. Projection attempts encourage the energetic development of the projection mechanism within the etheric body. If projection is unacceptable due to fear of OBE, short daytime projection attempts are advised. Energetic development work, like meditation and energy work, as well as developing other core skills, will also help resolve projection-related energetic and mind-split conflicts, which are the underlying causes of waking paralysis. Many people advocate giving into waking paralysis and attempting to convert it into an OBE. I would advise doing this only if vibrations or other projection symptoms are present; otherwise it seems a pointless exercise. If paralysis is frequent, this would definitely be worth a shot at least once. If the conversion continually fails, and no reliable way is found to stop paralysis episodes, a progressive course of energetic development and meditation becomes the most viable option. The simplest and most direct approach, the one most people prefer, is to clear the mind (refuse to fear) and concentrate on moving a single big toe. For some reason, a big toe is the easiest body part to reanimate during a waking-paralysis episode. Once a big toe moves, even slightly, waking paralysis will end. To increase the effectiveness of the above technique, I also recommend using the brushing awareness action (see chapter 12 ) on the big toe to break paralysis. This helps by strengthening body awareness there, making it easier to force movement. Paralysis, like spontaneous projection, is more likely to occur in certain resting and sleeping positions. Lying on the back, for example, tends to promote both projection and waking paralysis for most people. It is worthwhile checking to see if the resting position is a factor, and avoid those positions most likely to promote waking paralysis. When waking paralysis strikes a deeply relaxed but still-awake person, or one trying to fall asleep, it usually comes on with a noticeable sinking sensation, giving a few moments of warning. That is the prime time to fight off paralysis. Rolling out of bed as quickly as possible (you have to be really, really quick) stops waking paralysis before it can take hold. I recommend getting up and taking a short walk, or raiding the refrigerator at this time, as eating helps. It is not advisable to return to bed for at least ten minutes, or waking paralysis will usually happen again immediately. Keeping a clear mind and refusing to fear during a paralysis episode will, in most cases, reduce emotional feedback. If both the physical/etheric mind and its projected double stay calm, the severity and duration of paralysis episodes can be greatly reduced. Overtiredness and sleep deficit are, more often than not, contributing factors with frequent waking paralysis, as well as with frequent spontaneous OBE. Avoiding overtiredness, especially during the week surrounding the full moon, when spontaneous OBE and waking paralysis are more likely to occur, is strongly advised. Food can also play a part with waking paralysis. An empty stomach tends to increase energetic activity within the etheric body, thereby increasing the likelihood of waking-paralysis and spontaneous-projection episodes. A heavy meal can make projection more difficult, as it significantly slows energetic activity in the etheric body and promotes sleep. Unwanted Projection Symptoms Frequent bouts of waking paralysis and spontaneous projection are a big problem for some people. Most people prone to"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29 this cannot stop it from happening and do not like the experience one little bit. Often, they dislike the idea of any kind of deliberate projection. They just want to be left alone so they can sleep in peace. This condition will normally happen to those prone to this condition only a couple of times a year, in clusters of a few days or so at a time, usually around the full moon. In rarer cases, however, this problem can be much more pronounced. If this continues overlong, it can develop into a severely debilitating health problem. Many people try to avoid sleep entirely to avoid the disturbing symptoms. This is the very worst thing anyone could do! Avoiding sleep has the opposite effect and will greatly worsen the overall condition. Lack of sleep also causes a loss of appetite, which, in itself, further aggravates the underlying causes of the condition. An empty stomach heightens energetic activity in the etheric body (raising its vibrations) , which greatly increases the likelihood of waking-paralysis and spontaneous-projection episodes. Frequent waking-paralysis and unwanted spontaneous-projection episodes, especially if involving great fear, can generate an extremely unpleasant psychological condition that can become more and more debilitating the longer it is allowed to continue. Long-term sleep deprivation plus a profound loss of appetite can be extremely debilitating and even physically damaging. Combined with other serious health problems, this condition could even be fatal if left unattended for too long. The first thing to address with this type of problem is the sleep deficit, which is the major underlying cause of the whole problem. This is also the factor most easily rectified. I strongly urge people with this condition to seek prompt medical advice and to tell their doctor exactly what is happening. Sleep disorders like this, regardless of their actual cause, are well known to medical science, and doctors are thus well versed in their treatment. A doctor will usually prescribe a specific type of sleeping medication designed to promote long-lasting, dreamless sleep. This can also stop spontaneous OBEs and waking paralysis. As the sleep deficit is overcome and the normal sleep pattern returns, appetite will return and the projection-related symptoms will begin to ease. Keep in mind that any medication must be taken regularly, as prescribed, until the sleep deficit is completely overcome, before it can be stopped, or the problem may recur. Sleeping in a well-lit room with a TV or radio on low, plus napping during daylight hours, will also help with the fear problems that can be caused by repeated spontaneous projections. If the presence of light inhibits sleep, wearing a sleep mask will help. Also, if spontaneous projections are unavoidable, daylight ones are much less intimidating. Even the most timid of reluctant projectors will usually find daylight projections enjoyable, or at the very least bearable."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 7. OBE and Perception Let's define an objective experience as one in which perceptions are gained directly through the physical body senses, and a subjective experience as perceptions gained or affected by mind or imagination. In those terms, when dealing with out-of-body experience, everything is subjective. I think it helps to realize that the brain is capable only of receiving bioelectrical signals. It is not capable of receiving direct sensory input. Instead, sense organs break down these perceptions into complex bioelectrical impulses. The brain exists in total darkness and silence, inside a heavy bone box (the skull), isolated from the physical world. It has no nerves and can feel neither pressure nor pain, heat nor cold. It might be said to float in a dark, voidlike dimension, receiving sensory input from the real world (physical dimension) only via remotely gathered and transmitted bioelectrical signals. This is similar to a description of how the brain receives — or remembers receiving — sensory input gained during an OBE. Keep in mind that every OBE ends up as a memory of an OBE, and there is no memory of OBE (not counting remote-eye experiences) unless the projected double successfully downloads its shadow memories into the physical brain during reintegration. Once this happens, the physical brain then remembers sensory perceptions received during the OBE as if it had received them directly and firsthand. The only real difference between how the brain perceives the physical universe (objective experience), and how it perceives out-of-body experience (subjective experience), is the way in which the sensory input for each type of experience is gathered and transmitted to it. The brain simply cannot differentiate between physical and nonphysical input sources. Regardless how sensory input is gathered and received by the brain, it is all interpreted as firsthand sensory input. The projected double uses the same basic senses as the physical body, albeit at a greatly enhanced level. It can still see and hear and smell and taste and touch, but through direct energetic mind sensing. For example, the projected double can receive light energy directly, without needing physical eyes, although it must of course have experience with sight to translate this energy in a visual way. Whether the projected double is seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, or tasting, it is perceiving and interpreting the energies associated with these senses directly, completely bypassing the need for physical sense organs or subtle copies of them. Blindness and OBE Perception Supporting evidence can be found in the study of the dream and projection abilities of blind people. It is fairly well known that blind people who have experienced sight before they became blind are capable of having fully sighted dreams and projections. Obviously, if the physical condition of the eyes were reflected into the sight capabilities of the projected double, physical blindness would blind the projected double out of its body during an OBE — which is simply not the case. However, if the physical eyes had nothing to do with OBE perception, then people who have been blind since birth (never experiencing sight) should also be able to see clearly during dreams and projections — which unfortunately is also not the case. Therefore, OBE sensory perception must also be dependent on the learned sensory reception capabilities of the physical brain, not the current functioning or nonfunctioning abilities of the physical sense organs. These principles also apply to profound deafness. Physical blindness does not prohibit OBE or the ability to project, but it does affect sensory perception abilities. Spatial awareness perception, the sense of touch, hearing and other nonvisual sensory perceptions — all very highly developed in blind people — are also greatly enhanced during an OBE. This level of perception allows blind-since-birth projectors to sense and perceive the out-of-body environment very clearly. This level of nonvisual sensory ability may, in many ways, even be superior to normal sight during an OBE, as the case history below suggests. The biggest problem facing blind projectors is that the majority of today's energetic development and projection techniques are heavily reliant upon visualization. Visualization techniques require basic learned sight experience. The techniques given in this book, however, based not on visualization, but on tactile imaging, are eminently suitable for nonsighted projectors. They work well for blind people, and are superior to visualization-based techniques when used by sighted people. A blind projector gave me the following explanation regarding his perceptions during dreams and OBEs. Being blind since birth and being a successful projector is a fairly unusual combination, to say the least. Over the years, my investigations in this area have unearthed many important clues concerning the nature of perception. These provided me with further clues as to the nature and dynamics of other aspects of OBE. In the out-of-body environment, perception is absolutely everything. Therefore, understanding the nature of perception is paramount to understanding the dynamics of OBE and the entire range of related phenomena. My question to CB was \"Could you please expound on your nonsighted condition and how you perceive things during your OBEs?\" C.B.: I've been blind since birth. My optic nerves didn't develop while I was in the womb, but I still have vivid OBEs and dreams. It's hard to explain just how I sense things and get around while I'm out of my body, but I'll give it a try. I experience no real difference between my OBE and dream perceptions. When I have a dream or OBE, I am very aware of what is around me, but everything is always three-dimensional. I can't perceive anything as two-dimensional, such as what's on the surface of a picture, but can perceive the canvas and frame as a whole very clearly. The area around me is extremely vivid in my mind, in all directions, and is very detailed. This awareness is much stronger than my normal awake perceptions are in my own home. When I project it's like I can feel everything around me, as if I am continually touching everything with my fingers, with my mind, with my senses reaching out and touching everything around me all at once. My senses extend a long way, much further than usual, and I can feel into the distance around me in probably much the same way as sighted people do with their eyes. I get around fine when I'm out of my body, with no hesitation or doubt about my surroundings at all. I never worry about bumping into things and can sense exactly"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 what is ahead of me and around me at all times. If I meet people during an OBE or dream, I can instantly tell what they look like and what they are wearing, just as if I were running my hands all over them. This isn't really sight, as I have no idea of what color or light is, but my dream and OBE perceptions are about as close to sight as it gets for me. All this points to the projected double having a far more direct link with the perception of its environment, energetically bypassing the need for physical sense organs or subtle copies of them. The projected double can thus be thought of as a direct mind-sense energetic perceiver. The learned sensory capabilities of the physical brain are the major limiting factors when it comes to interpreting sensory input gained during OBEs and dreams. Objective Real-Time Perceptions For the purposes of this book and of dealing more clearly with OBE, objective experience is best extended to include some sensory input gained through real-time OBE. This should include all perceptions of reality that do not appear to be affected by the mind and imagination of a projector, or any other mind or imagination. During a real-time projection, for example, an objective perception of reality is best thought of as something that is consistent with what a projector knows to be real and true of the physical universe. These perceptions can then be described as being apparently objective, although they were gained remotely from the physical body and its sense organs. Although the real-time zone appears to be actual reality, and projectors existing in real time feel they are existing as invisible ghosts in the real world, they are not, I believe, actually in the physical dimension, nor are they in the astral dimension proper. They are slightly out of phase with both, at a slightly higher vibration than the physical universe, and at a slightly lower vibration than the astral dimension. They are existing inside a direct dimensional reflection, or subtle energetic echo, radiating directly from the physical universe as it happens, in real time. Real-time projectors can be thought of as something like reflections in a mirror. They perceive the real world from inside that mirror and are existing inside a kind of real-time mirror world. A mirror reflects a real time view of actual events happening in the physical world, but in itself the mirror's reflection has no substance and cannot be thought of as real. Or, real-time projectors can be thought of as being on the other side of an invisible mirror, a mirror capable of moving around in response to the projector's will. This allows the projector to clearly perceive the real world as it happens, without being able to directly affect or interact with the real world in a physical sense. The real-time projector experiences the real world through perceptions reflected into it through this mirror, from the real world and in real time. Subjective Real-Time Perceptions A subjective real-time perception is best considered as projectors perceiving something that they know to be incorrect, untrue, or unreal in relation to the real world as they know it. For example, if projectors find misplaced, altered, missing, or new objects and people in their home that they know are definitely not there in reality, then these are best thought of as being subjective perceptions or, more accurately, reality fluctuations. The definition of subjective perception here does not strictly include sightings of other projectors or spirit beings as unreal, even if these are seen during an apparently objective real-time projection. The difference between objective and subjective perceptions, in this case, can become blurred and quite difficult to ascertain. Astral or higher experiences, while technically being entirely subjective, are also not included here. These usually bear no relationship whatsoever with normal objective reality, or with the actual physical universe in real time."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 8. Imagination Versus Visualization Let's face it, 99 percent of people can't visualize for peanuts. That is, 99 percent of people think they cannot visualize for peanuts. But, this is all wrong too, because 100 percent of people can visualize perfectly — they do it all the time — but they just don't know they are doing it! This confusion comes about simply because visualization is generally so poorly explained and taught. Visualization is very easy and does not take any time at all to master. It is a natural ability everyone uses all the time. I have come across countless developmental problems relating to the issue of energy-body manipulation and development techniques. This problem significantly increases the difficulty encountered with any kind of serious energetic development, seriously lengthening development time. Consequently, most people give up before getting worthwhile results. Note: I use the term energy body as simply another way to describe the pure-energetic aspect of the etheric body. If you belong to a meditation or development group, ask people — one at a time and in private — how they really get on with visualization. Note the slightly worried and uncomfortable looks you get, especially from those teaching it. Most people, if they are completely honest, will admit they have a few problems with visualization, or that they just can't do it. You will find the occasional few who claim they have no problem whatsoever with visualization. These lucky few can easily see in their mind's eye whatever they visualize, just like watching TV behind their closed eyelids. The lucky few with this type of visual ability are unintentionally also a big part of this widespread and self-propagating problem. Mind's-Eye Visual Ability The commonly used term visualization is at the root of this problem. Many teachers tell their students that, with a little practice, they should be able to see what they are visualizing. Unfortunately, while this is partly true, it is not something that can be learned quickly, barring strong natural ability. To put it in a nutshell: visualization is not a visual skill. You are not supposed to actually see what you visualize. If you do see something, it is no longer visualization, but a mind's-eye vision type of ability. During any meditation or training exercise requiring deep physical and mental relaxation and visualization, a few people will develop partial clairvoyance, or an awake semilucid dream type of visual ability, or both. These mind's-eye visual abilities enable these people to actually see what they are visualizing, as in the lucid dream state — in which the conscious mind takes creative control of the dream environment. Clairvoyance and lucid dreaming are both very visual abilities. Now, there is nothing wrong with using this type of lucid dream-cum-clairvoyance type of ability to enhance visualization. It's very interesting and useful-but it is not an ability that most people can easily learn. The problem compounds when this type of creative visual ability becomes the accepted norm, and people think they must develop this visual ability to visualize properly. When one person, especially a group leader, tells the rest of the group that they can really see what they are visualizing, the rest of the group thinks they are doing something wrong or that they lack natural ability, and therefore cannot keep up. If they continue believing this, they never will be able to develop themselves to any significant extent. A similar problem can arise when neophytes are exposed to more advanced students, or to those who have realized that visualization is really the constructive use of imagination. These people, although they do not truly see anything when they visualize, use visual terms when describing their visualizations or nonphysical perceptions. Development groups and the New Age movement commonly use the visual terms I see, I saw, lam seeing. More accurate terms should be used instead, such as I sense, I perceive, I feel, I intuit, I am imagining, or lam imaging. But they are not. Now, here's the other side of the problem: The vast majority of energy work, energetic developmental exercises, and projection techniques taught today completely rely on visualization techniques. Given no viable alternative, you obviously cannot do development exercises properly and simply cannot develop yourself if you have a problem with what we might call \"visual visualization\". Understanding exactly what visualization is and is not thus becomes a crucial issue to all aspects of development. Yet everyone, without exception, can visualize easily and perfectly if taught correctly. The development exercises and techniques in this book are based not on visualization, but on a concise, nonvisual imaging system I developed called tactile imaging, based on the active use of the sense of touch and feel and body awareness. This is very easy to learn and is extremely effective, far more effective in energetic manipulation and development than visualization- based techniques could ever be. People who actually see what they visualize may be at a slight disadvantage when they begin using the nonvisual tactile imaging techniques in this book, if they do not change their way of doing things. They will have to stop trying to see what they are doing and learn how to feel what they are doing for these techniques to work effectively. If you are like most people and cannot visualize very well, you are going to do very well indeed with these new techniques. Using Your Imagination We are all capable of easily creating and visualizing the most complex scenario in our minds, without training and with no exceptions. Over the years, I have asked many people who claim they cannot visualize if they ever reminisce, fantasize, daydream, or imagine things. The answer is always \"Yes!\" Everyone is perfectly capable of using imagination to build complex and detailed fantasies in the mind's eye. So, let's get something straight here: Imagination is visualization. Visualization is imagination. They are one and the same. And neither is truly a visual ability. Visualization is not a visual ability. You do not actually see what you visualize, just as you cannot actually see your imagination or fantasy. True visualisation is pure imagination. Imagination is the generator of all daydreams and fantasies, whether memories are relived or something fictional is created based on memory. You cannot really see memories or fantasy creations, but they are so vivid and realistic that they are indistinguishable from any mind's eye creation that is more visual."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33 Concise imagination and concise imaging are terms that are much more apt and workable for the use of imagination to construct detailed fantasies or visualizations. Memory plays an important part in constructive imagination. Imagination is based on memory. If you have ever lost anything, you have most probably tried to re-create your past actions in your mind's eye to help you remember where you lost it. You have replayed these, using imagination, going over your every movement step by step. This is perfect visualization, concise imaging — based entirely on memory. As a sample exercise: get up and go to the kitchen, get a drink of water, and return. As you do this, carefully take note of everything you do and see and feel along the way. Then sit down, close your eyes, and relax. Remember what you just did, from the beginning, and re-create this sequence of actions in your mind — in your mind's eye. It is important to feel everything as if you were actually doing it. This is exactly like creating a fantasy based on real-life events. Remember getting out of your chair and how the room looked as it moved around you as you turned; remember your steps as you walked to the kitchen, what you saw and felt when you arrived, and how your hand looked and felt as it reached out for a glass; remember filling it and drinking; remember how the water tasted and smelled and felt; and remember returning the glass, walking back to your original position, and sitting down again. Do this in real time, taking roughly the same length of time to re-create it in your mind's eye as it took to actually do it. You cannot actually see these actions, but you can remember them and feel them easily. This is exactly like any fantasy you have created in your mind's eye. You can almost see a good fantasy , they can be so real. Fantasies are constructed with imagination. Today this is more commonly called visualization. Again, relaxed and with your eyes closed, try constructing a completely fictional scenario in your mind's eye, with all the necessary parts taken from memory. Remember what it's like to brush your hair. Rehearse this action in your mind, in your mind's eye, without actually doing it first. Imagine there is a table in front of you with a hairbrush on it. Carefully feel yourself reaching out (without actually moving your arm), take the imaginary brush, and lift it slowly to your head and brush your hair. Feel your arm moving all the way as you do this in your mind's eye. Feel your hand pulling the brush through your hair over and over, without actually moving. This is constructive imagination (fantasy or visualization) only. Finally, return the imaginary brush to the imaginary table. You must feel all these movements as you construct them in your mind's eye. Do not try to see this happening, imagine and feel it happening. If may help if you consider that you are using your projected double's arms and hands to perform these actions. You have just successfully created a construction of pure imagination (a complex fantasy or visualization) in your mind's eye. Any visualization or imagination exercise, no matter how lengthy or detailed, is simply an extension of what you have just done in these two exercises. One last constructive imagination exercise: with your eyes closed, remember what it feels like to walk barefoot across a beautiful lawn on a lovely sunny day, with trees and shrubs and flowers all around you. Construct this from your memories in your mind's eye, and ^/yourself as being there inside your creation. Remember a time when you actually did something like this, or remember a scene from a movie you can use for this purpose. Feel yourself walking across the lawn toward a massive ancient tree with heavy leafy branches hanging down all around it. Some of these branches are touching the ground. Imagine the tree becoming bigger and bigger as you approach it. Walking through a small break in the branches, you now move into the restful shade under its leafy boughs. You find yourself standing inside a secret clearing behind the branches. You can smell the living wood and leaves of the tree, intermingled with soft, earthy smells like moss, bark, decaying leaves, and damp earth. Walking around closer to the great bole of the ancient trunk, you see the shape of a comfortable chair carved into the wood and massive roots of the tree. Soft green moss is everywhere and you can feel its friendly touch underfoot. Moving over to it, you sit in this chair and relax. Leaning back, hands clasped behind your head, you close your eyes and listen and feel and smell the secret world around you. You hear the wind gently whispering and murmuring through the branches. You hear small birds fluttering and fluting and insects humming and buzzing all around you, calling and chirping softly to each other. Sit here a while, feeling totally relaxed and at peace with the world, letting all your cares and problems melt away into nothingness. You have just successfully constructed a detailed fantasy scene in your mind's eye. This was full of actions, sights, sounds, smells, and tactile perceptions, based entirely on your memory and imagination. This is exactly what you need to do when you follow any led meditation, where a voice leads you through a fantasy scenario while music and special effects help stimulate your imagination and transport your mind there. You don't actually see what you are visualizing or imagining, but you can generate a detailed mind's-eye perception of it all the same. Nonsighted Adjustment If you are blind and cannot imagine in a sighted way, please convert the exercises in this book into more tactile imagination exercises by replacing the colors, scenes, and sighted descriptions with something from your own nonsighted memory. Use your remembered perceptions of a lovely walk taken in a park and adapt the exercise to suit. Enhance all exercises like this to take into account enhanced perceptions of sound, smell, texture, taste, and spatial awareness. This can easily be done with any constructive imagination or visualization exercise, and can also be done with any led meditation containing sighted details or instructions. Note: Some of these early exercises may cause slight feelings of vertigo or localized dizziness in the stomach and lower chest areas, and even some bone-deep tickling sensations in the arms and legs. Many of these exercises move a point of body awareness outside the bounds of the physical body, which tends to affect the etheric body and often causes energy-movement sensations."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 9. Mobile Body Awareness Body awareness is normally centered in the eyes, but it does not have to stay there. Mobile body awareness (MBA) — the ability to focus body awareness on any specific part of the body — is simple and easily learned, and is an extremely important skill. Combined with other techniques, it enables the dynamic manipulation of the energy body and its energy centers, or chakras, allowing specific parts of the energy body to be directly stimulated, and the flow of energy into and through it to be increased in a controlled way. In the coming exercises, a deep level of relaxation or trance is not required. Light relaxation is quite adequate. Just close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and allow your mind to wind down and settle for a few moments. This is all that is required. I suggest that you do not use a bed for these early exercises, unless you really have to, but instead sit in a comfortable chair with your shoes off. Place a cushion under your feet, wear loose clothing, and do not cross your legs. In these coming exercises, lightly scratch or rub specified body parts as needed, using a small stick or ruler if you have difficulty reaching some parts. This helps to highlight and target specific areas, so that body awareness can be focused more easily and accurately. This scratching is not necessary after you become used to the technique; you will be able to target specific areas with body awareness alone. Repeat the MBA exercises below without scratching and see how you get on without this aid. Try to do this with eyes closed, so you are focusing with body awareness only. Use your eyes if you really need to, but do without using your eyes as soon as targeting can be done with body awareness alone. To demonstrate shifting your center of body awareness and targeting specific areas on the body, lightly scratch the skin of your left knee with your fingernails, just hard enough to leave a slight tingling sensation after you stop scratching. Close your eyes and feel this tingling area with your body awareness. Become intensely aware of that area. Highlight it with body awareness. Feel for this tingling area with your body awareness alone, with your sense of touch and feel. Forget about the rest of your body for now. Next, feel for more of the same knee and become more acutely aware of it as a whole joint. Feel its outline and shape and really get the feel of it with your body awareness. Your center of awareness is now focused entirely in your left knee. Shift your point of body awareness to your right knee, scratching it first to highlight it. Feel its shape and outline with your awareness. Center your awareness entirely in your right knee. Shift your point of body awareness to your right big toe. Scratch it on top of the large joint, where it joins your foot. Wiggle the toe a bit to help you get the feel of it, so you can zero in on it with your body awareness. Feel the whole toe. Feel the tingle on top of it, then feel its outline and shape with your body awareness. Center awareness entirely in your right big toe. Shift your point of body awareness to several other parts of your body — anywhere you like — highlighting them first by a light scratching or rubbing. Feel these different areas as you target them with your (now mobile) point of body awareness. Increasing Sensitivity To improve your body awareness sensitivity, do the following MBA exercises as often as you can until you get the feel for this technique. They will progressively improve your sensitivity, which is extremely important for all the exercises and techniques given in this book. When first learning to move awareness through the surface of your body, it helps if you trace the pathway along your skin with fingertips or a paintbrush, to highlight the path for your body awareness, making it easier to follow with your point of awareness alone. If this is not enough, lightly and slowly scratch or rub the pathway along your skin with your fingernails or a ruler. Follow the slightly tingling trail this leaves behind on your skin with your point of body awareness alone. For tracing and learning wider energy pathways, I suggest you use a paintbrush of the appropriate width. You can do this yourself or have a partner do it for you while you follow the sensations caused by the touch of the moving brush with your point of body awareness. Or you can rub a pathway with your fingers, stroking them repeatedly along the chosen pathway. To start with, I suggest tracing a pathway from the base of your left thumb, along the sensitive inside of your arm and on up to your left shoulder. Close your eyes and concentrate on the feel of the brush or fingers touching and moving along the surface of your skin. Ignore the hand doing the brushing. Repeatedly stroke this pathway, from thumb to shoulder and back to your thumb again, following this with your point of body awareness until you have a good feel for this path. Repeat the above exercise with your right arm. Next, trace and follow a path from your left big toe, up the outside of your shin, over your kneecap, and on up the outside of your thigh to your left hip joint, then back down to the big toe again. Repeat the above exercise with your right leg. Practice this technique until you can trace a pathway to anywhere on your body with your point of body awareness alone, feeling your way along the surface of your skin without having to follow a manually highlighted pathway. Rub and scratch and highlight, as often and for as long as you need to in order to learn this technique. If you are training with a partner, you can help each other by brushing each other's body to stimulate pathways, or with a stroking one-handed massage. Massage is a very good way of learning how to focus and move a point of body awareness. Have your partner give you a slow one-handed massage and follow the touch of his or her hand with your point of awareness. Have him or her trace pathways up your legs and arms, and up your back, following touch with your awareness. Using only one hand for this makes it easier to follow with your awareness. MBA Exercise Focus your awareness in your right knee again until you can feel it well with your awareness. Shift your center of awareness slowly down the outside of your right shin, feeling your shin as your awareness slides down it. Keep moving your awareness slowly until your center of awareness comes to your right foot. Move your awareness slowly out to your right big"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35 toe. Feel this toe with your awareness. Wiggle it a little and make sure you can really feel it and are targeting it well. Move your point of awareness to the toe next to it and feel its shape and outline with your awareness. Tense, move, wiggle, touch, or scratch each toe as needed, to highlight and target it. Next, move your awareness across to your left foot and feel that foot with your awareness. Flex and tense your left foot slightly to get the feel of it as a whole. Next, center awareness in your left big toe. Feel your awareness sliding back toward your ankle , then slowly on up over your left shin until it comes to rest in your left knee. Keep it moving, sliding up your thigh and slowly on up the left side of your body until you can feel your left shoulder. Move your awareness down the outside of your left arm, moving slowly past your elbow to your left hand. Feel your whole left hand with your awareness. Move and center your awareness in your left thumb. Feel its shape and outline with your awareness. Wiggle it a little if you need to highlight it. Feel all your other fingers, one at a time, with your awareness. You have just moved your center of body awareness all around your body, targeting and focusing your awareness in many parts of it. You have also been stimulating your energy body in the process, without knowing it was happening, as your center of awareness moved through your energy body. You may have felt some peculiar tingling or fuzzy sensations as you moved your point of awareness around your body. These sensations are caused by energy movement within your energy body, and are normal for this type of body awareness exercise. To effectively manipulate your energy body, it is necessary to be able to focus your point of awareness at a single point on your body, then to manipulate that point of awareness. This manipulation is done with active body awareness, with something I have called tactile imaging. Tactile imaging is very easy to learn and use. You have already learned the skills required for this and will soon get the hang of it. It just takes a little practice."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36 10. Tactile Imaging Tactile imaging (T.I.) is the active use of body awareness to directly stimulate and manipulate the substance of the energy body. This is simply an extension of MBA. When body awareness is focused on a specific area, and that point of awareness is given motion, this motion directly stimulates the energy body in that area. When done at the site of a primary or secondary energy center (a major or minor chakra) that energy center will be directly stimulated. Individual energy centers can then be targeted and manipulated in a strong and dynamic way. I developed MBA and T.I. for a person who had been blind since birth and of course could not visualize at all, having no conception of what visual sight was like. This person contacted me on the Internet, via a Braille computer, and asked if I had a projection technique that did not rely on visualization. This was an interesting challenge, so I put my mind to solving the problem. After a few significant Eurekas, I came up with MBA and T.I. — both based on the sense of touch. When I road-tested this new technique, I was amazed at how effective it was. It was light years ahead of any other energy-body manipulation technique, far more powerful than visualization techniques. Since that time, I have used this discovery as the foundation for all my energy-body manipulation, development, and projection techniques. Ironically, I lost contact with the blind person who started all this, while the new T.I.-based projection technique (called rope ) was in the throes of development. Learning Tactile Imaging Focus body awareness alone on the specified target area and try not to use your eyes unless you really have to. Many people find they cannot learn MBA or T.I. techniques without using their eyes to help target specific areas. Do what is necessary, but wean yourself from using your eyes as soon as you can. Many advanced exercises and techniques given later in this book do not allow the use of eyes or other targeting or highlighting aids. Circular Exercise The best way to learn tactile imaging is by doing it. Rest your hands comfortably in your lap, or on the arms of your chair, palms down and fingers slightly spread. Close your eyes, relax, and shift your awareness to the base of your right thumb, topside. There are important secondary energy centers (small chakras) in the thumb joints and you are now going to stimulate one of them. Many people will feel one of the thumb centers (small chakras) activate the first time they work on them. The first area to work on is on top of the large joint where your thumb joins the right hand. Flex your thumb while holding this joint between your other fingers to help locate it. Lightly scratch a circular area, clockwise, on top of the thumb joint, about half an inch (1 cm) or so across, to highlight it with awareness. Slowly trace a finger around this same circular path, while following the touch of that finger with your point of awareness. That point of touch, that point of feel, is your point of awareness. Continue following this action until you can remember the exact feel of this circular movement and can re-create this action with your point of awareness alone. (A small artist's paintbrush can also be used for this purpose.) Feel the tingling target area on top of your thumb joint with your point of awareness. Re-create and feel the circular stirring action. Move your point of awareness in a small clockwise circle in that area, as if you were stirring it with an imaginary pencil. Concentrate and feel this action, continuing the motion with your point of awareness alone. Move your sense of feel through your skin with a circular motion. Keep stirring this center with one or two circling actions per second. (The timing is not crucial.) In a short time, this action will gain its own momentum and become almost automatic. It will then take very little effort to continue this action. Hold your point of awareness very close inside your skin as you do this. Feel your point of awareness continually circling and moving through your skin in the target area. After a while — anything from a few seconds to a few minutes during a first attempt — you should start to feel a slight localized heaviness, pressure, tingling, buzzing, or even a bone-deep tickling sensation inside your thumb joint. This may extend into more of your thumb and hand. This sensation indicates that the energy center in the thumb joint has been successfully stimulated into a higher level of energetic activity. If you feel this, immediately move on to the next exercise. If you feel nothing, after trying for several minutes, move on to the next exercise anyway. Stirring Exercise Move your point of awareness in a straight brushing action up and down through your right thumb, from just above the joint at the base to the tip of the nail, feeling this pathway as you go. Move your point of awareness continually back and forth through this area. You are now brushing your entire thumb with your point of awareness and are thus stimulating that whole area energetically. Feel the brushing action through the whole of your thumb. The sensations you may have felt earlier will intensify and spread through more of your thumb as you do this, as more and more secondary energy centers and energy exchange ports in the thumb become energetically active. Repeat both exercises on the thumb of your left hand. Repeat the exercise on the big toes of both feet, one at a time, starting on top of the large joints of the big toes only, where they join each foot. Stimulation Notes Often there are inactive secondary energy centers (small chakras) on one side of the body, but rarely on both sides. If you feel nothing after doing any awareness action for several minutes, move on to the next exercise. While energy-movement sensations become apparent in the majority of cases, some may feel nothing at all, although I have found a complete lack of sensation to be rare. Fig. 5. Tactile imaging stirring technique on thumb joint"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37 No sensation at all indicates the energy body is blocked or inactive in that area. If this is the case, continue with these early exercises as best you can. It is important to learn and practice the technique. Later exercises in this book restore inactive areas and remove energy blockages. A hot shower or bath not only relaxes the physical body and cleanses the skin, but also promotes a stronger energetic flow throughout the energy body. If you have trouble doing these exercises, try bathing first. The tingling in the skin caused by the scratching used to highlight target areas is not the cause of energy-movement sensations. Test this, if you wish, by repeating this exercise in the middle of your forearm, or in the middle of a bleep or thigh, where there are no significant secondary energy centers. This test will be found to cause no discernible energy-movement sensations. Alternatively, try this same exercise on another small energy center, but without the scratching. It is the movement of the focal point of body awareness through the energy body, at the site of an energy center, which causes energy-movement sensations. Using Tactile Imaging Following are some simple but important exercises that build on those given in the previous chapter. These take you one step closer to taking manual control over your own energy body. Please take your time over these, as the practice of tactile imaging is fundamental to most of the procedures given within this book, including trance and projection techniques. Their importance cannot be overemphasized. Awaren e ss Hands The most natural way to use your point of awareness is to feel you have an imaginary pair of hands. Awareness hands are the business ends of tactile imaging. These are powerful awareness tools and you will be using them for raising energy and manipulating energy centers, as well as for projection techniques. You will soon learn how to use them over larger areas and in many other practical energetic ways. Awareness hands are, in practice, simply extensions of body awareness. You have a left and a right awareness hand. Each hand is to be felt as being attached to an imaginary awareness arm coming from each of your shoulders, although the awareness arms themselves are not important. With practice, you will feel that each awareness hand is attached to a different side of your energy body. Each hand is attached to a different side of the brain, and one awareness hand is usually slightly weaker than the other, depending on which side of your brain is dominant . The more you use awareness hands, the stronger they become and the easier they are to use. Awareness Hands Exercise Close your eyes and relax, while sitting or lying comfortably. Using your body awareness alone (without actually moving), take both your awareness hands down to your left foot, as if you were grabbing hold of it. Scratch or rub the top of your left foot and wiggle it a bit to highlight it and make this exercise easier. Feel the whole of that foot. Draw your awareness hands through your left foot, from toes to heel, back and forth several times. After this, draw your awareness hands through your foot to your ankle, and then slowly take them on up through your whole leg. Feel the whole of your leg as you move your awareness hands upward through it. Draw your awareness hands all the way up your shin, past your knee, up your thigh, and on up to your hip. When you get to your hip, flick your awareness instantly back down to your toes again and repeat the upward-stroking, energy-raising action. Do not stroke your awareness back down your leg. Repeat this action over and over, taking several seconds per stroke, feeling the whole of your leg each time. This action forces energy to flow into your foot and draws it up through your leg. You may feel some peculiar sensations as you do this, like tingling, buzzing, warmth, cold, pressure, heaviness, or even bone-deep tickling sensations. Repeat the entire exercise with your right leg. Splitting Awareness Exercise Splitting body-awareness is very simple and easy to do. It feels quite natural in practice, just like using both your real hands at the same time. As an example exercise, split your awareness and feel both your feet at the same time, after targeting them, feeling one in each of your awareness hands. Draw energy up both legs at the same time, exactly as you did with the previous exercise, over and over. With a little practice you'll be able to do this effortlessly. If you have trouble splitting awareness, stick to using one at a time until you feel more comfortable with splitting them. When you have had some practice at splitting your awareness hands, increase the speed of the upward stroking action until you can draw your awareness up through your legs at the same time, taking two or three seconds for each upward sweep, from feet to hips. To add to the above, imagine and feel as if you were sweeping water up through the whole of your legs with your awareness hands. Imagine your awareness hands are each holding a large sponge and you are sponging water upward through the whole of your legs. The water keeps trying to run back down your leg, so focused awareness effort is used to force the water to rise. This action provides more energetic resistance and gives your awareness hands something to grip onto, so to speak. This increases the effectiveness of any whole-of-limb energy-raising action. Visibly Detecting Awareness Hands After a little practice with using your awareness hands, you may start detecting them when they move past your closed eyes. This is especially so if you have been meditating at the same time. You may see vague shadows and indistinct moving shapes. It does not matter, though, if you never see anything, as it is not necessary to see anything for these techniques to work effectively. Watch for this side effect for interest's sake only: many people have reported this phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38 I always see my awareness hands when they move past my eyes, but I've had a lot of practice at this, so am not really a fair test subject. I rely on my volunteers to provide me with more realistic feedback. As an experiment, relax and close your eyes. Concentrate on feeling your awareness hands. Slowly raise your awareness hands past your face and eyes and on up over your head several times (don't actually move your real hands), stroking your awareness hands over your face and head. Try to sense this from behind your closed eyes. See if you can detect shadowy movements, or if you can see the shape of your awareness hands as they move past your eyes. If you succeed at this, you are using a type of energy sight similar to real-time or astral sight, as discussed earlier. This experiment is most effective if done immediately after meditation."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39 11. Supporting Energy Structures To project out of body while fully conscious and have some hope of remembering it afterward, it is an enormous help to be able to increase the flow of energy into and through the energy body. A well-known side effect of the trance state is that it produces a stronger flow of energy than does the normal waking state and with regular use causes slow but progressive development. The majority of case histories on OBE mention energy-movement sensations. The well-known vibrations and rapid heartbeats are nothing more than intense energy-movement sensations associated with the generation and extrusion of the projected double. Underneath our fleshy exteriors we are all bioenergetic beings. When the energetic part of us moves to the forefront, as it does during conscious-exit projection, energy becomes simply everything. At a very early stage, when I saw the many conflicts between New Age thought and various Eastern schools of thought over energetic manipulation and development, I decided to take a fresh hands-on approach with my investigations. My research and experimentation with the energy body over the years has yielded significant discoveries and a great deal of insight. Almost a decade ago, I decided to map out the energy body the hard way, using tactile imaging to feel my way through my own energy body. I literally picked my way through every inch, searching out the smaller energy centers. I probed and stimulated and felt how they worked, what they did, and how they fitted into the structure of the human bioenergetic body as a whole. I avoided researching existing works on this subject at the time, as I wanted to make a completely fresh and unbiased exploration of the human energy body. This work allowed me to unearth much of the underlying support structure of the energy body. This is not unknown today, if you research acupuncture, reflexology, t'ai chi, Qi-Gong, and other energy-related disciplines, mainly of Eastern origin. My fresh investigations, however, have given me a far more workable hands-on understanding of the energy body than would otherwise have been possible. My initial discoveries led to a plan to apply what I had learned. This necessitated the development of many techniques, which in turn led to a great deal more experimenting and testing. The new system was then extensively road-tested by dozens of volunteers who provided extensive feedback. This enabled me to fine-tune my initial theories and techniques, and to develop NEW, a simple but highly efficient energy-body manipulation and development system. It has proven itself extremely valuable and versatile in all aspects of energetic development and OBE. This book contains a modified version of the complete NEW system, tailored to suit the needs of projection training. Five Separate Circuits The human energy body can be likened to an energetic reflection of the physical body, composed of stable and highly structured etheric matter (see chapter 28). It contains within it several different but interdependent energetic circuits. I have defined these circuits logically, through experimentation, observation, and what I consider to be sound reasoning. My definitions and descriptions strive to provide a good rule-of-thumb way of understanding and dealing with the pure-energetic processes of the energy body, without being overly technical or mysteriously esoteric. There are five basic energetic circuits within the human energy body. (I will not discuss the master circuit to any great extent. I have shown it here only to illustrate relationships between the different circuits.) Master Circuit Kundalini Circuit Storage Circuit Three Main Energy Storage Centers Primary Circuit Seven Primary Energy Centers (major chakras) Secondary Circuit Supporting Energy Centers Tertiary Circuit Energy Exchange Ports Each circuit has many different functions on the physical, bioenergetic, and pure-energetic levels. All are interconnected and work together to support each other's energetic requirements, and all are integral parts of the human bioenergetic body as a whole. The primary energy centers (major chakras) and their higher functions cannot properly be used and developed to any extent (barring accident or natural ability) until the lower circuitry and smaller energy centers have been stimulated, developed, and stabilized. If attempts are made to develop and use the higher energetic circuitry first, a great deal of time — often years — must be spent waiting for the lower levels of circuitry to catch up with the new demands being placed on them. Early attempts at energy work, especially with the primary energy centers, can cause major disruptions and realignments within the existing structure of the energy body. New energy pathways must be formed, and old or blocked energy pathways redefined, widened, and cleared. Until the support structure develops to the point where it can handle the greater energetic demands placed on the energetic support structure by the changed requirements of the higher primary centers, energy is often taken from the vitality storage areas of the energy body. This can cause the physical body to become energetically depleted. Fatigue, disorientation, headaches, digestion problems, depression, and a variety of emotional disorders and other odd problems can temporarily manifest, in varying combinations and degrees of severity. These can be especially pronounced if the procedures and cautions recommended within this book are not followed. Primary-center work, especially, should not be undertaken too vigorously at too early a stage of development. Before primary centers are worked on to any great extent, the support structure needs developing so it can better handle the greater flow of energies required of it. The first step is to stimulate and clear individual secondary energy centers, exchange-port clusters, and their interconnecting pathways, one part at a time. While this process may sound a bit tedious, it is well worthwhile. Once the development process is begun, energy begins flowing far more freely and strongly through the energy body than was possible"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 before. This solves many underlying projection-related energetic problems by making projection easier and reducing the severity of heavy exit sensations. Energy Flow The average person normally absorbs only a small amount of the energy and vitality available each day, and steadily less with age. Energy is absorbed during sleep, digestion, breathing, and exposure to sunlight. Let us say that you absorb 100 units of raw energy per day, enough for your average daily requirements. Energy-development exercises increase energy usage, and you begin using 200 or more units of raw energy (vitality) per day. This deficit of 100 units will usually be made up for by the energy body's storage areas, sometimes causing the physical symptoms of energy body disruption and depletion. With a little time and attention, the energy body can be conditioned to handle just about anything. The best way to start is by stimulating, developing, and nurturing the all-important secondary and tertiary energetic structures. The energy body is then better able to adapt and develop in response to its new energetic requirements. Secondary Energy Centers Secondary energy centers are similar to primary energy centers, but are smaller and have fewer functions. Their main purpose is to transform and condition energies received through the tertiary system (energy exchange ports) into the specific qualities required. These smaller parts of the energy body can be likened to something like bioenergetic electronic components. The diagram on the following page represents a typical skeletal-type secondary energy center. These have four poles each and a central connecting core running through their center. Each pole is a small vortexlike energy structure that flowers on the surface of the skin directly above the joint. These poles are connected to a larger internal conduit that runs through the center of all bones, through the bone marrow. Energy flowing through these cores is the cause of the bone-deep tingling sensations commonly felt while raising energy, especially during early exercises. The skeletal secondary centers are interconnected through energetic pathways running through the flesh. muscles, tendons, and nerves, and along the surface of the skin. Slightly different, but with similar functions, are those secondary centers attached directly to physical organs, nerve ganglia, glands, and muscles. These types of secondary centers are not attached to the skeletal system, and usually have only one or two poles flowering on the surface. I have not been able to determine a great deal more about this particular type of secondary energy center. The secondary centers and their connecting pathways are, not surprisingly, fairly well in-line with traditional acupuncture meridians and acupoints. There are also striking similarities between the secondary system, as a whole, and the human nervous and circulatory systems. Energy Exchange Ports Energy exchange ports (tertiary system) are very small energy centers with very simple functions, much like the millions of tiny pores covering the surface of the skin. Their basic function is to absorb and discharge energies. The whole surface of the skin is covered with these, but they are more heavily concentrated in several main areas: the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, the nasal passages, the mouth, lips and tongue, and the genitals. The hands and feet are the largest energy conduits into the body and therefore contain the highest concentrations of exchange ports. So these are the most important areas to stimulate, develop, and make awareness-sensitive during early development exercises. Storage Centers The human energy body has three major vitality storage centers, where different qualities of energies are accumulated. These are quite different from the primary energy centers (major chakras) that share the same general areas, although they can be considered to be energetically related. Sub-navel Position: Midway between bellybutton and pubic line, two inches inside average body Function: Raw physical vitality energy storage Sub-heart Position: Center of chest, at base of sternum, two inches inside average body Function: Raw emotional energy storage Sub-brow Position: Between eye-socket ridges in center of brow, just inside skull Function: Raw mental and psychic energy storage Of these three storage centers, the most important and safest to actively fill is the sub- navel storage center. When this center is full, it overflows into the sub-heart storage center, Fig. 6. Close-up of typical secondary (skeletal) energy center, showing cross-section of finger joint (cutaway) Fig. 7. Three energy storage centers, plus major energy exchange port concentrations storage centers energy exchange ports"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41 which when full overflows into the sub-brow storage center. Deliberately filling the two higher storage centers first is a very unwise practice that can unbalance the energy body and significantly lower vitality levels. This not only is developmentally counterproductive, but can also adversely affect emotional, mental, and psychic stability. Filling all the storage centers is a lifetime's work. It can take months of regular energy raising before sub-navel storage levels significantly increase, because a great deal of energy is used up during early development exercises. There are no safe shortcuts. If you long for psychic abilities, practice regular trance meditation and work daily on filling your sub-navel storage center. Make trance meditation and energy raising a part of your daily life, and your energy body will develop in a natural, balanced, and healthy way. Any dormant psychic abilities will begin to manifest when the energetic conditions that allow them are created. Forcing this process causes predictable problems."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42 12. Energy Body Stimulation Five Awareness Actions Five tactile imaging actions are used to manipulate the energy body, using the same basic techniques throughout. Scratch or rub each energy center or energetic pathway as needed, to help target it and make it easier to follow with awareness alone. As well as feeling these actions on the surface, feel them happening beneath the skin and slightly inside the body. With all the above awareness actions, it is the action of feeling a point of body awareness moving on or through the physical body that stimulates the substance of the energy body. The size of the awareness actions given below are to be varied to suit the body part or energy center being worked on. Stirring Action: Move your point of awareness in a clockwise circle through the surface of your skin. This is as if you were stirring the target area with a single finger of one of your awareness hands. This action can be counterclockwise if preferred. Brushing Action: Move your point of awareness back and forth through the skin as if brushing that area with a paintbrush. Wrapping Action: Move your point of awareness around the targeted area, joint, or limb, as if continually wrapping an imaginary bandage around it. Tearing Action: Use your awareness hands in a two-handed tearing action. Imagine you are holding a small bread roll or do-nut on the skin, or just under it, and are repeatedly tearing this apart with your awareness hands, over and over. This action is mainly used on primary energy centers, but can also be used as an alternative method for stimulating secondary energy centers and groups of exchange ports. Sponging Action: Imagine or feel your awareness hands holding a large sponge, with you sponging water upward through the entire area being worked on. This is mainly used as a whole-limb action. It can be used to sponge energy up just one side of a limb, but is primarily used for raising energy through the whole of a limb or body part. Instructional Notes The NEW system does not require a deep level of relaxation, nor even a great deal of preparation. Once these techniques are learned, it is possible to raise energy at any time, even while traveling, walking, talking, working, or watching TV, etc. For the following training exercises, use light relaxation only, except where you encounter problems learning these techniques and getting energy moving during early exercises. While deep physical relaxation is not necessary for the NEW system, if you encounter difficulties, some preliminary deep physical relaxation and trance work will usually help. I recommend sitting in a comfortable chair, with your legs reasonably straight and slightly out in front, preferably with bare feet or loose socks. Do not wear tight clothes, especially on legs, as anything tight or uncomfortable will interfere with awareness targeting and energy raising. Place a pillow or cushion under feet. Do not sit cross-legged during training sessions, as this makes awareness targeting and learning how to raise energy more difficult. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, generally settle yourself, and begin. When unresponsive secondary centers or groups of exchange ports are found, do not stop your progress to concentrate on blocked areas. Work on them for the suggested length of time, then move on to the next exercise. Working around blockages in this way helps clear them. I suggest that eyes be kept closed and not be allowed to look at the target area. I have found that looking toward the target area, even from behind closed eyes, tends to dilute the effectiveness of awareness actions. Still, some of my volunteers reported having difficulty learning to focus awareness without using their eyes to aid targeting. It is permissible to use your eyes to aid awareness targeting, by looking at the area being working on, but I suggest that the use of the eyes for targeting be slowly discontinued as soon as is practical. Many of the coming exercises do not allow the eyes to be used at all, as with trance and projection techniques, etc. Fig. 8. Stirring action on kneecap Fig. 9. Brushing action on kneecap Fig. 10. Wrapping action on kneecap Fig. 11. Tearing action on kneecap Fig. 12. Spongling action on leg"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43 Preliminary Stimulation Work These exercises are designed to isolate and stimulate individual secondary centers and small clusters of exchange ports. Picking through them like this allows blocked areas to be identified so they can be cleared and strengthened. Each successfully cleared area significantly increases the flow of energies into the energy body. Individual fingers and toes do not have to be worked on every time, only in the early stages and to remove blockages. Connecting pathways in the energy body can become blocked and narrowed to the point where they become virtually disconnected, just as the physical body can malfunction in similar ways. Energy pathways can be healed and redefined by repeatedly drawing energy through and around them. The energy body, like the physical body, learns very quickly and develops a kind of energetic memory of often-repeated awareness actions. Toe Work Toes are important parts of the larger and more powerful energy structures within the feet. Each toe joint contains a secondary energy center, with four poles flowering on the skin's surface. These are connected to the heavy concentration of energy exchange ports on the undersides of the feet and toes. As energy-raising structures, the feet are bases for the largest and strongest conduits into the energy body. They are therefore important structures to stimulate and develop. One foot — usually the left — will normally activate much easier than the other . It may take many development sessions before the less-active side begins to respond. If, in the first exercise below, no sensation is felt in either big toe, this means that both of these areas are currently dormant or blocked. It does not mean the NEW system will not work for you. It will. These sluggish areas will progressively clear as more of the energy structures within the feet clear. Awareness-target the top of your left big toe. There is a fairly large secondary center in each of its joints. Give this toe a light scratch or rub along its length with your fingernail to highlight it, until it tingles slightly on top. Use the brushing awareness action and brush along its whole length, from its tip to a couple of inches past where it joins the foot. Concentrate on feeling this action inside the skin. Vary this action occasionally and brush each side of it as well, inner and outer. Keep brushing until you feel a slight buzzing or localized heaviness or pressure in that toe. Continue brushing for several minutes, or until some noticeable sensations are felt, then move on to the next exercise. Repeat the above exercise on right big toe. Use the sponging action through the whole of both big toes, one at a time. The stirring action can also be used on top of each joint, if they are difficult to activate. Try splitting awareness and brushing or sponging both big toes simultaneously. Use the brushing and sponging actions on all lesser toes, starting with the toe next to the big toe on the most responsive foot. Spend slightly more time on the less responsive foot, and on any unresponsive toes to help free them up. Using a slightly wider brushing action (width from tips of toes to just past where they join foot) and starting with your best foot again, brush across the entire tops of all toes at the same time, from side to side, from big toe to small toe, back and forth. Repeat this action on your other foot. Try splitting awareness and repeating the above on both feet simultaneously, in whatever direction is felt as being easiest and most effective. Sole Work The energy exchange ports on the undersides of the feet and toes form the outer layer of the complex energy exchange structures within the feet. The soles are therefore extremely important to energy flow into the body, and the following exercises should be thoroughly worked through for best results. Awareness-target the middle of the sole of your left foot. Scratch or rub this area if you need help targeting it. Using a small clockwise stirring action, approximately one and one-half inches in diameter (3.5 cm ), circle your point of awareness there continually. Move this stirring action slowly over the underside of your foot and its toes. Keep this stirring action moving at all times, covering that entire area thoroughly. Continue this mobile stirring action until you have covered the entire underside of your foot several times, including the undersides of all toes and the heel. This awareness action is a little like you are using a small rotating electric massager. Spend at least five minutes on each sole with this rotary action (early exercises only) or until the surface of each sole begins to respond well. Using a wide brushing action, as if painting the soles with a large paintbrush, brush awareness back and forth, from heels to toes, covering the entire underside of each foot deeply with the brushing action, one foot at a time. Try splitting awareness and repeating the brushing action on both feet at the same time. Using a deep sponging action, draw awareness from tips of toes to heel, back and forth through the whole of each foot, one foot at a time. Feel this action as filling the inside of the whole of each foot as you do this. Try splitting awareness and sponging through the whole of both feet at the same time. Fig. 13.

Main secondary centers in hand Finger centers Feet and Sensations Working on the undersides of the feet can cause very strong energy-movement sensations indeed. These can be extremely uncomfortable, even painful, especially in the very early stages of these development exercises. Unfortunately, this cannot be helped and therefore should be accepted as the price of development. Intense buzzing, tingling, tickling, and bone-deep vibrating energy-movement sensations are commonly felt. These may continue for some time, even after the awareness actions that caused them have been discontinued. This will sometimes be accompanied by nervous twitching and muscular spasming in the feet and legs. This can also be quite strong in the early stages. Occasional hot or cold burning spots and heavy patches inside the feet and legs can also be felt, indicating blocked and damaged areas. All these sensations are normal for this type of energetic development work. The degree of sensations felt indicates the degree of resistance to the energy being raised. Strong energy-movement sensations are caused by larger-than-normal amounts of energy being forced through narrowed energy pathways and conduits. This overstimulates the nerves in the skin and surrounding tissue near the affected energy pathways. Strong energy-movement resistance sensations should be ignored. If sensations become too strong for comfort, move on to the next exercise. If these sensations go way beyond acceptable comfort levels, immediately discontinue all exercises at least until the next day, to give them a chance to settle down. Sensations will always be less the next time. Strong sensations are a good energetic sign, indicating good energy flow potential in affected areas. Sensations usually ease off gradually over five or ten minutes, sometimes a little longer. Walking helps ease them. If only very mild sensations are felt, this can indicate that a good flow of energy already exists, producing significantly less resistance with reduced sensations. But if no sensations are felt at all, large blockages should be suspected, and extra work will be required to clear them. Actual physical pain is quite rare, but hot or cold or painful aching spots, plus needlelike pains, are not uncommon. These indicate particular types of energy blockages that normally reduce only gradually, as they are cleared and conditioned to the greater energy flow. It is a good idea to take extra good care of your feet and hands, at least while doing these early exercises. I recommend that this become a habit for anyone doing serious, long-term energetic development. If you have difficulty getting foot energy moving, try soaking them in comfortably hot water, then scrubbing them with a nailbrush, paying particular attention to the soles and heels. Scrub feet until they tingle slightly, then dry and rub some light body oil or cream into them. This extra attention will make you more aware of your feet, as the whole-foot tingling sensation caused by this attention will last for some time. This can help with awareness targeting. The application of essential oils, plus massage and reflexology techniques, can also help activate and clear blocked energy structures in the feet. Leg Work Each leg sweep should take approximately three seconds for each pass, up or down. This exercise is designed to stimulate the energy pathway, not to raise energy up through the leg, which is why awareness is brushed in both directions. Repeat this process for each of the following leg exercises. Use a wide brushing action on the front of each leg, one at a time. Scratch, rub, or stroke the whole leg pathway, if required to help target and trace the pathway being worked on. Move awareness from tips of toes, over top of foot and ankle, up shin to knee and on up to top of the hip joint on the front of each leg, one leg at a time. Stroke awareness steadily back and forth a dozen times or more each way. Repeat this on the back of each leg, one at a time, from heel to rear of hip joint (top of buttock), then back down again. Repeat this on outer sides of each leg, one at a time. Pay attention to taking energy from the smallest toe with this exercise, through outer side of foot to heel, to side of ankle, up to side of knee, to top of outer hip joint, then back down again. Repeat this on inner legs, one at a time: from big toe through the inner side of foot to the inner side of ankle, to inner knee, to inner groin creases at top of each leg, then back down again. Raise energy with large sponging action through the whole of each leg, feeling all of the leg. Draw awareness from toes, through ankle, and on up through knee joint to hip, then back down through the whole leg again. Try splitting awareness and doing this last exercise on both legs at once. Hand and Arm Work The energy body also exchanges and draws energies into itself through the hands and arms. Rather than overcomplicating matters, it is best to think of these energies as being simply atmospheric subtle energies, as opposed to the more earthly energies that flow into the feet and legs. The hands, like the feet, each have a heavy concentration of exchange ports in the palms and undersides of fingers. Finger Work The process for hand and finger stimulation is similar to that used with the feet, with minor differences. Some find it easier to do early finger and hand exercises if they look at each finger as they work on it. This is permissible, but please discontinue using your eyes for this purpose once the techniques are learned. First, spread fingers slightly and use a narrow brushing action to stimulate the entire length of each finger on top. Work on one finger at a time and brush from fingertips to wrists for thirty seconds each, or until they begin to respond, and longer if you so choose. Turn hand over and repeat this with each finger on its underside. Use a wide brushing action, as if you were using a large paintbrush, and stimulate the backs of each hand, covering all fingers from tips to a few inches above wrists, one hand at a time, for thirty seconds or more, even if they responded well earlier."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"45 Use a wide brushing action across all fingers, from side to side, covering all fingers. Try splitting awareness and repeating the above on both hands at the same time. Palm Work Palm work can cause intense energy-movement sensations in the palms and fingers. These sensations usually reduce more rapidly than those in the feet . Repeat the same process you used with the sole of each foot, on the palm of each hand, one at a time. First use a tight, mobile stirring action, moving this action about until you have covered the whole of the palm of each hand, including the undersides of all fingers. Use a wide brushing action, back and forth, from a few inches above the heel of hand to finger tips, covering the entire surface of palms and undersides of all fingers. Use a large sponging action through the whole of each hand, from fingertips to above wrists. Try splitting awareness and stimulating both palms, from above wrists to fingertips. Arm Work Move awareness back and forth from fingertips to shoulder, a dozen times in both directions for each of the following exercises. Take approximately three seconds over each upward arm sweep, and the same for each downward sweep. Along outer left arm, use a wide brushing action from fingertips, along back of hand to wrist, over forearm to elbow, over outer biceps to outer shoulder joint, back and forth. Repeat above on inner left arm from fingertips, palms, inner wrist, inner elbow, to armpit. Repeat on whole of left arm, using sponging action, feeling all of arm, inside and out. Repeat all above exercises with right arm. Try splitting awareness and repeating with whole of both arms at the same time.

Awareness Resistance Factor When you move awareness rapidly through the energy body, you encounter natural energetic resistance. This feels like you are dragging your point of awareness through an almost-liquid substance, which allows you to feel the substance of your own energy body. The bounce action creates a kind of ripple inside the energy body, causing energetic disruption, which forces energy to flow. This helps clear blockages and develops internal conduits. As an example (using a rapid sponging action) bounce your awareness up and down through the whole of one leg, from foot to hip, feeling it moving in both directions, as with the earlier whole-leg sponging exercise. Bounce from foot to hip and back, rapidly and repeatedly. Your body awareness is capable of lightning movements, and of flicking from one body part to another instantly, but not so when moving through the energy body in this way. Slowly increase the speed of the bounce action and you will soon feel resistance. You will find there is a natural speed limit of about half a second each way. If you move faster than this, your awareness will tend to lose contact with your energy body and start flicking from foot to hip and back, while skipping the leg in between. Once this happens, you are no longer moving awareness through the energy body and are therefore no longer stimulating it. Fig. 17. Wide brushing and stirring actions"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46 Bounce Testing Whatever part of your body you wish to bounce awareness through, first experiment with the speed, increasing the bounce frequency until resistance is encountered. Once this is felt, slow the speed a little until you are quickly and comfortably bouncing awareness through your body, while retaining the feel of contact with it. This will be the correct speed for the bounce action in that area. Do not count or time this with a watch, just feel the most comfortable speed for you in that area. Leg Bounce As above, take awareness through one or both legs, from feet to hips. First test for resistance and find the correct frequency, then bounce repeatedly from feet to hips. You will quickly develop a natural rhythm and will feel the slight dragging effect it has in your energy body. Energy-movement sensations in the bounce area are usually quite mild. Continue bouncing for at least a minute, or for as long as you wish. It's quite a pleasant sensation when you get used to it and the bounce action quickly becomes almost automatic. Try splitting awareness and bouncing through- both legs at the same time. Holding your legs together makes this last easier. Arm Bounce As above, bounce awareness through both arms, one at a time, from fingertips to shoulders and back again repeatedly. First test for resistance and adjust bounce speed to suit. Try splitting awareness and bouncing through both arms at the same time. Spinal Bounce This is a wonderful technique if you suffer back tension or spinal pain. I have a few spinal injuries myself and find this very soothing and healing. Once you master the spinal bounce, you can set it in motion and use your mind for other things. Only a small part of your mind is required to keep the bounce action going in the background. This promotes deep physical relaxation, helps ease knots of tension in the spine, as well as gently stimulating the spinal roots of most primary centers. Awareness-target the coccyx (tailbone) at the base of the spine. Move awareness along the full length of your spine to the top of your head. Bounce awareness back and forth, from top to bottom, feeling it all the way. Increase speed and adjust frequency, then slow to a more comfortable rhythm × about half a second or so in each direction. Take care to breathe naturally while doing this. The spinal bounce action tends to interfere with the natural breathing pattern. This can cause shallow breathing and intermittent breath holding. Full-Body Bounce The full-body bounce takes awareness up and down through the entire body. This can be done from any position, but is best learned while lying down with arms raised above the head. Take awareness from both feet, up through legs, torso, head, and arms, all the way to just above fingertips. Bounce awareness back and forth, from feet to fingertips. The bounce rhythm should be fairly quick, about one or two seconds each way, but whatever feels most natural is best. Try to feel the whole of your body, inside and out, with each full-body bounce. A variation of the above is with arms resting at your sides, where awareness is bounced from your feet to just above the top of your head. This is far more practical when sitting or standing. Keep in mind, after working so laboriously and painstakingly through your newly discovered energy body, that this is only the early training part. The NEW system is very progressive and, once you learn it, large parts of your energy body will quickly begin responding to single awareness actions. The smaller parts of the stimulation exercises given so far quickly combine into larger and simpler whole-of-limb stimulation and energy-raising actions. Everything starts getting easier, faster, and more effective once this happens. Fig. 18. Leg bounce action"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"47 13. Raising Energy Raising energy is an essential part of stimulating, developing, and powering the higher functions of the energy body, including out-of-body projection. This makes use of many of the skills you have learned so far in this book. Feel energy-raising actions as if you were drawing a large sponge up through each pair of limbs, as if you were sponging water up through them. Stay as physically relaxed as you can while doing these exercises, but don't worry if you tense up a little or tend to twitch a bit at times. A little physical tension will not interfere with this type of energy raising. In time you'll learn how to do this while standing, walking, and even running. With all the coming energy-raising exercises, if you cannot easily split awareness and work on two limbs at the same time, work on one limb at a time. It is much more important to be able to raise energy through one limb than to be able to split awareness. The following techniques, though, will have to be modified to suit single-limb energy-raising actions. Do not worry if one leg or arm does not appear to respond well. Usually one side of the body is more active and energetically responsive, and hence easier to draw energy through. Keep trying with the unresponsive side, and continue trying to use arms and legs in pairs while doing these exercises. If one leg or arm is all you can feel, draw energy through it but do not neglect its weaker partner. The weaker side always requires more development. A little extra time should be set aside for this during each training session. Regular stimulation slowly revitalizes inactive areas as energy pathways widen and are redefined. Leg Energy Raising There are two ways to raise energy into your body: with awareness alone or with awareness aided by breathing. The basic techniques for raising energy with awareness alone are generally used as part of a full-body circuit, or for raising energy to primary centers. They are also very useful when it is impractical to do anything more elaborate. For example, try this if you are tired and just want to raise some quick energy before falling asleep. Prestimulate feet, using the techniques learned in the previous chapter. First brush across all toes with a single action , then use the whole-foot sponging action, one at a time or both together. Continue with this until you feel some activity. Split awareness (optional) by reaching down and grabbing the energy in both feet with your awareness hands and pulling it upward with a deep sponging action. Sponge it up through the whole of both legs to hips, as if sponging water up through them. This action forces energy to flow into feet and up through legs. Take energy up through your thighs and over the front of your hips, skipping the groin area, letting it flow directly into your sub-navel storage center from each side. The sub-navel is midway between your bellybutton and pubic line and about two inches inside your body. This action does not have to be precise; the general feeling of raising and pushing energy into this area is all that is required. Develop a rhythmic drawing action, sweeping and sponging energy upward through your legs and into the storage center. Take two to three seconds over each upward sweep, or whatever feels most natural. At the end of each upward sweep, flick awareness back to your feet, ready to start over. If awareness does not split easily, use one leg at a time, alternating between them with each upward stroke. When you get a good flow of energy moving into your sub-navel, you may feel a fluttering, bubbling sensation similar to stomach wind. This is a very good sign, indicating energy is successfully being raised, converted, and stored. The exact site of this sensation varies slightly from person to person, but is usually within an inch or two of the center. Arm Energy Raising Energy can be raised through arms as well as legs. The arms are normally only used as part of a full-body circuit or for stimulating primary centers, but can also be used on their own. If you are sitting in a chair, either hang your hands by your sides or rest them palm upward in your lap. If you are lying down, hold your hands above the bed with elbows resting on the surface of the bed. Alternatively, spread your arms wide and rest them on the bed. Any position will do for this purpose and comfort is important. If you cannot split awareness easily, alternate arms and raise energy through them one at a time. Prestimulate both hands , then center awareness firmly in hands. Split awareness (optional) and draw energy through both hands, through the whole of both arms to the shoulders, and on up through to the back of the neck. This is where it will join with the energy stream being raised through the spine, as part of a full-body energy-raising circuit (see below). If this technique is being used on its own, take energy through the shoulders, down over the chest and stomach and directly into the sub- navel storage center. Use two- to three-second energy sweeps, flicking awareness back to hands at the end of each arm sweep, ready to start on the next. This technique can be combined with breathing, by raising energy through the arms during the IN breath, and flicking awareness back to hands during the OUT breath, ready for the next IN breath. Fig. 19. Leg energy raising to sub-navel center Fig. 20. Arm energy raising to sub-navel center, plus alternative method taking energy over head"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48 Full-Body Circuits Breathing creates a natural motion within body awareness, that of something flowing in and out of the body. This has a natural upward and downward , inward and outward motion to it. This motion is very useful when combined with awareness energy-raising techniques. Breathing also provides energy-raising actions with a natural rhythm. Arms and Legs The first step is to loosen up and prestimulate the energy structures in the feet, legs, hands, and arms. Repeat the above two sections on basic arm and leg energy raising as needed, until you feel some energy-movement sensations. If you feel nothing, continue with the following exercises anyway, as energy will still be drawn into and through your body even if you cannot feel anything. Two-Part Storage Circuit First, here is a simple technique to take arm and leg energy directly into the sub-navel storage center. This technique soon develops a natural rhythm that makes it very easy to do, and soon becomes almost automatic. Feel free to vary the positions of your arms and legs to whatever feels most natural. This circuit can be done while sitting, lying down, standing, or even walking, but is best learned while lying down with arms spread wide or above your head. 1. Prestimulate as needed, then center awareness firmly in both feet. 2. During the IN breath, raise energy up legs and flow it into the sub-navel. 3. Continue flowing energy into the sub-navel until IN breath is finished. 4. When IN breath finishes, flick awareness instantly into both hands. 5. As OUT breath starts, draw energy through the arms, down the chest, and into the sub-navel. 6. Continue flowing energy into the sub-navel until the OUT breath is finished. 7. At the end of the OUT breath, flick awareness back to feet again. 8. Repeat steps 2 through 7 continuously, settling into a natural rhythm. 9. If awareness cannot be split, alternate arms and legs, using one limb at a time. 10. IN and OUT can be reversed if preferred. Full-Body Storage Circuit The full-body circuit combines awareness energy raising with breathing, as with the above technique, but covers the whole body with one continual flow of energy, rather than two separate flows. This stimulates the majority of energy conduits, pathways, and energy centers in the body, including the primary energy centers. A full-body circuit should be done, if possible, for ten to fifteen minutes per day to gain significant developmental benefits from it. This can also be split into many smaller sessions, and even a minute per session is valuable. Once learned, this technique can be used to make better use of free waiting and traveling time. There is no limit to the length of time this can or should be practiced, the more often the better. If this technique is done for just a few minutes before falling asleep, the extra energy raised increases the vividness of dreams and lucid dreams. This empowers all subtle and dream bodies, thus making conscious-exit projection easier to do and to remember. The energy-raising action used in the full-body circuit can be fairly wide; it does not have to be narrowed to just the spine. Allow it to spread out as energy is raised up through your back and down over your front, narrowing it just before it flows into your sub-navel. Use slow, deep, natural breathing. Prestimulate feet and hands and bounce awareness through your whole body a few times before beginning the full-body circuit. The full-body circuit can be done in any position, but is best learned while lying on your back with arms resting comfortably at sides. During the downward sweep over the head, the energy is best taken into the mouth and down the throat, and then out onto the upper chest as it continues moving down toward the sub-navel. Otherwise the throat area will be skipped as awareness passes over the face and chin, and it contains important centers that should be stimulated. It helps if the tongue is rolled back and held gently against the roof of the mouth during the full-body circuit. Taking energy into the mouth can be omitted entirely if this is found to be too difficult or too distracting. In this case, simply take the energy down over the face and chest, skipping the mouth entirely. The mouth part of the full-body circuit should not be forgotten. Add it at a later time when you are more comfortable with it. 1. Prestimulate as needed, then center awareness firmly in both feet. 2. During the IN breath, raise energy up the legs and through the back. 3. Raise energy through arms as awareness passes where hands are resting (optional). 4. Continue raising energy up the neck to top of the head. 5. Hold awareness in the top of your head and accumulate it there until the IN breath is completed. 6. As the OUT breath starts, sweep energy over your face, into your mouth, throat, and chest to the sub-navel. 7. Continue flowing energy into the sub-navel until you complete the OUT breath. 8. At the end of the OUT breath, flick awareness back to the feet, ready for the next IN breath. 9. Repeat steps 2 through 8 while settling into a natural rhythm. 10. If you cannot split awareness, alternate and use one limb at a time. 11. IN and OUT can be reversed if preferred."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"49 Fig. 21. Full-body circuit Joining Arms into Full-Body Circuit Once you are comfortable with the above circuit, join your arms into the energy flow. This increases overall energy flow as well as drawing in different types of energies through your hands. During the above full-body circuit, as your upward-moving awareness passes your hands, draw energy through the hands and up arms as well. Raise arm energy in line with the rest of your energy from this point onward, in one fluid upward sweep. Feel your arm energy joining into the spinal energy flowing through the back of your neck. Smoothly continue this awareness action up into the crown center. Continue with the full-body circuit as given above. The only change is the addition of hand and arm energy into the flow with each upward sweep on the IN breath. Everything else stays the same. Using the arms with the full-body circuit should be considered optional. It can be omitted if you have difficulty with it, or find that this addition makes it too complicated. It is more important to have some kind of a full-body energy circuit that you can use than to slavishly follow every step of these techniques. Just do the best you can. None of the awareness actions used with these energy-raising techniques needs to be precise. A roughly approximate feeling of moving energy from one place to another in your body is quite good enough. You'll get better with practice. If you cannot easily split awareness, raise energy up alternate sides of the body, taking energy up one leg and arm to crown, then continuing as normal. With each new IN breath, change the side being used, first left then right, etc. Energy Flow and Effort As I have mentioned, a deeply relaxed physical state usually is not required for learning the NEW system. Effort can thus be put into the energy-raising actions without breaking any delicate mental state. The amount of energy that can be raised is greatly affected by the application of will. This is particularly useful when there are low background energy conditions, or for times when a greater energy flow is needed, e.g., for clearing stubborn, unresponsive, and blocked areas with brute awareness force. Apart from clearing blockages, for normal development I strongly recommend that only a normal level of effort be used. This is not only easier but is far more natural. It will encourage more even and robust development of the energy body as a whole. Too great an effort can cause too rapid expansion and growth in certain areas, which can make developing energetic structures far too delicate to be of much practical use. Forced development through excessive effort grows large but weak, temporary, and unstable energetic pathways. These will retract back to their original narrowed state very quickly , maybe even smaller than before, if not nurtured gently during development. Using too strong energy-raising efforts to unblock damaged or depleted structures within the energy body can cause continuing energy demands and high energy usage far in excess of the amount of energy raised. This can result in temporary physical exhaustion. Often, more energy is used to repair blockages than is actually being raised and stored, thus causing a temporary energy deficit. This can also cause noticeable energy-movement sensations that continue for some time after energy- raising actions have been discontinued. This is quite normal and often unavoidable. Energy-Movement Sensations I would like to make one thing very clear. Strong energy-movement sensations are primarily caused by resistance within the energy body — natural resistance to an increased flow of energy through blocked or narrowed energy centers and circuitry. Many people, during the early stages of development, will feel some very strong energy-movement sensations indeed. These sensations fluctuate , gradually reducing in severity as the energy body develops to handle increased energy flow. The energy, when it responds in the early stages, will most commonly cause a surging, bubbling, rushing-water sensation. This is especially strong and noticeable in the shins and thighs. These can be quite intense and even breathtaking at times. You may also feel strong, bone-deep tingling sensations that appear to come from deep inside the marrow of your bones. Many of my volunteers have reported they have fallen off their chairs and been unable to stand for a while, because surging energy- movement sensations in their legs have been so strong. Several peculiar energy-movement sensations, often very strong, can be caused by the NEW system. It is fairly normal, while stimulating the feet, legs, hands, and arms, to feel extremely strong buzzing and tingling sensations within them. These sensations will fade slowly with regular use and development, reducing to a warm and comfortable, gently tingling, energy flow. Levels of sensation can also be affected by other factors, such as the condition of the physical body and the strength and availability of free energy, which fluctuates daily and varies from one place to another. Common Sensations • Tingling, tickling, buzzing, and vibrating in the soles of feet and toes • Rushing-water sensation up legs and arms • Bone-deep tingling inside hands, feet, legs, and arms • Tingling energetic body-rush feelings up arms, legs, and spine • Muscular spasming and twitching • Cobweblike tickling, like ants crawling all over you • Localized stinging and prickling sensations • Aching, cold or hot spots, especially in soles and palms • Muscular cramps"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"50 Keep in mind that heavy energy-movement sensations always reduce as the energy body develops. Masters of energy raising, with highly developed energy bodies, feel only a gentle, tingling warmth as massive amounts of energy are drawn into their bodies. Look upon the lessening of energy-movement sensations as signs of real progress in energy-body development. Side Effects The NEW system, especially in the early stages, will occasionally cause temporary swellings, lumps, rashes, and even small watery blisters. In my opinion, this is caused by narrowed energy pathways having far greater than normal amounts of energy forced though them. This seems to overload some of the nerves and nerve endings in the physical body, temporarily affecting surrounding soft tissue and skin and causing these side effects. If you get any of these symptoms, treat them as you would any normal swelling, rash, or blister. Consult your medical doctor if they worry you. Energy rashes and blisters usually sting and itch quite noticeably when energy is drawn through them. These will heal very quickly if you continue regular development exercises, usually within a day or two, and will often disappear completely overnight. If your energy body does not respond at all, even after weeks of regular effort, I advise you to have a mil medical checkup by a qualified medical doctor. Energy blockages of this magnitude are not a good health indicator. This can indicate early disease conditions that have not yet become symptomatic. As early diagnosis of most medical conditions is paramount to their successful treatment, this can be an extremely valuable side benefit of energy work. Awareness Momentum After repeating any energy-raising action several times, you will find it develops a tendency to continue on its own accord. Awareness actions thus often continue after you have stopped consciously doing them. I call this effect awareness momentum. It seems to be caused by a kind of energy-body memory taking over, which shows just how easily these techniques can be learned. Continuing Energetic Demands After an energy blockage has been cleared, the energy body will often continue flowing energy through newly cleared areas. Energy-movement sensations may thus continue to be experienced for some time after stimulation actions have ceased. Energy blockages will also often clear themselves spontaneously, in response to earlier energetic development exercises. This can happen at any time of the day or night, which can cause energy-movement sensations to begin spontaneously and for no apparent reason. Energy Center Spin Primary energy centers are nonphysical vortexes of energy that look (to clairvoyant sight), like spinning wheels of multicolored light. Although secondary centers cannot so easily be observed, it is logical to suggest they may have similar attributes. The natural direction in which a center is spinning can often be felt with the stirring awareness action. If you feel resistance while stirring an energy center, try reversing the direction of that action. If the new direction feels easier and more natural, or has a more positive effect, there is a good chance that that center works better being stimulated in that way. Etheric Wrap Etheric wrap is a versatile and useful technique for clearing blockages and restoring damaged parts of the energy body. Areas that are unresponsive, tingle noticeably, feel heavy, or sting, or buzz, or bum, or act in any way different from the rest of your body, usually indicate some kind of blockage, depletion, or damage. These areas need more attention to repair and restore them. When you draw or bounce awareness through your body, you may also come upon areas that feel heavier or lighter or fuzzier or thicker, or that provide more or less resistance to awareness actions. These sensations indicate those areas need extra work to clear them. Use a wide-wrapping action over the damaged area. Imagine you have an endless white bandage of pure energy flowing from your awareness hands. Feel this bandage of energy flowing directly into the damaged area as you wrap it. Feel the substance of your energy flowing with this bandage. This action is to be varied to suit the size and position of the area being worked on. Etheric wrap is useful for getting inactive areas working. For example, if you want to etheric wrap a leg: Awareness-target your foot and begin wrapping from the toes up, as if you were carefully wrapping an overlapping energy bandage around it. Feel your energy flowing into that area, into the foot, through your awareness hands. Continue wrapping up over the foot, over the ankle, and on up the leg, all the way to the hip. Take your time over this and be careful to overlap the wrapping action all the way. Repeat this as many times as required, as this exercise cannot be overdone. Note that some energy blockages will not show up for some time. Many will only become apparent after energetic development work has become a regular practice, as the energy body becomes more energy sensitive and energy demands increase. Daily Energy-Raising Time There is no limit as to how much energy raising can or should be done, as long as this is taken only into the sub-navel storage center. The more often energy is raised, the more energy will be stored and the more energy will be available for physical, bioenergetic, and pure-energetic purposes. It is far more beneficial for long-term energetic development to raise energy gently and slowly and for longer periods of time, than it is to raise large amounts of energy in short bursts only. Rushing development creates fragile energetic structures that have little practical use, as they tend to break down when put under pressure."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"51 14. Stimulating Primary Energy Centers What have the primary energy centers (major chakras) to do with projection? Well, just as the NEW secondary system conditions the energy body and helps prepare it for conscious-exit projection, so does a little work on the primary circuit. With conscious-exit projection, energy is simply everything. During an OBE, the entire energy body, including all the primary centers, becomes active and contributes energetically toward the generation, projection, and maintenance of the projected double. Some people (those having plenty of natural ability) may not need what is given in this chapter, but experience has taught me that OBE training and preparation should be tackled in the same way as any other psychic ability. If standard energetic development procedures are applied to OBE training, results are far easier to obtain. Using today's visualization-based methods, successfully stimulating and developing the primary energy centers (major chakras) can take many years. The NEW techniques make successful primary-center activation possible even in the very early stages of development. Because of this, I urge you to be careful when using these techniques on the primary centers. The NEW techniques are far more effective than are the more obtuse visualization-based methods commonly taught. You may have heard a lot of hype about the dangers of primary energy center work and kundalini energy. I believe this comes from a lack of understanding of the energy body and how its energy centers and structures work. While there are some potentially adverse side effects, the primary energy centers and the kundalini are not energetic time bombs waiting to go off should you accidentally touch the wrong energetic button or wire inside your own energy body. If primary-center development work is undertaken with care, respect, and intelligence, there is very little to worry about. Triggering a full raising of the kundalini takes enormous preparation, effort, and self-discipline over an extended period of time. I do not believe this could happen accidentally or through simple experimentation while using the energetic development system given in this book. You may come across a few accounts telling the experiences of some very special people, where kundalini is reputed to have spontaneously arisen in response to their intellectual and spiritual development. Cases like this are rare in the extreme. I would hazard an educated guess that the chances against this happening to the average person undertaking normal levels of energetic development would be more than a million to one. Working on primary centers is only one step above working on their supporting secondary centers. Raising energy and stimulating primary energy centers is very simple. You have already learned all the skills required. There is, however, quite a bit more to learn about the primary centers before beginning any serious work on them. They are far more complex and powerful than the secondary centers, and must be treated with great respect. Make no mistake about it; mistreating the primary energy centers can be dangerous — physically, emotionally, mentally, and psychically. I have given several cautions and warnings within these pages and strongly advise these be carefully heeded. To me, primary energy centers are the major energetic organs of the energy body. When observed clairvoyantly, these may look like simple wheels or vortexes of multicolored light, but in reality these are extraordinary complex energetic structures. They are always active to some extent, even if not perceived as active. They are an integral part of all bioenergetic and pure- energetic functions of the human energy body. For the purposes of training and development, however, I mink these are best thought of as being simply primary energetic transformers. Many types of raw energies are collected through the energy exchange ports and channeled throughout the secondary system, where these energies are conditioned. These energies are then either used for bioenergetic life processes, fed into storage areas, or channeled into primary energy centers. The primary centers transform these into energies with higher pure- energetic values, as set by current energetic demands. Other than the crown and brow centers, which are directly attached to parts of the brain, primary centers have their roots within the spine. These are also attached or energetically related to major organs, glands and nerve ganglia, and are linked with each other and interconnected with the rest of the energy body's supporting circuitry. The complete energetic structure of the human energy body is as complex as its biological nervous system. One more thing before I continue: There are conflicting opinions over the number and placement of the primary centers (chakras). My own hands-on research agrees, in these matters, with the Hindu science of Tantra. For further reading on the more esoteric intricacies of chakras, according to Hindu Tantra, I recommend the excellent book by Harish Johari, Chakras — Energy Centers of Transformation. The Primary Centers For energetic stimulation purposes, primary energy centers are best imagined as circular energy vortexes roughly the size of the palm of your hand, except for the navel and crown centers, which are larger. • Base center: center point between anus and genitals (perineum) The base center has its roots in the base of the spine, but the center of its external vortex is best thought of as flowering between the anus and the genitals. This is the area that is generally worked on. It may seem as if this would be difficult to stimulate because of its location, but in practice this area is quite easy to work on. • Genital center: center point in genitals (male and female) • Navel center: center point in navel (bellybutton) • Solar plexus site: center point in solar plexus According to the Hindu science of Tantra, the solar plexus area does not contain a separate primary energy center, per se, but is related to and connected with the larger navel center below it. My hands-on exploration of the primary centers supports this view. There is, however, most definitely a large, important, and fairly sensitive energetic structure at this site. It feels and"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"52 behaves like other primary centers when worked on, and if successfully stimulated, produces similar energetic sensations. The larger size of the navel center may be part of the problem. People may simply be working on and stimulating the higher parts of the larger navel center. When the navel center is stimulated, it often causes a throbbing sensation in the solar plexus just above it. Parts of the heart center, when stimulated, can also cause chakralike sensations in the solar plexus. The sub-heart storage center — quite active in most people — is situated in the upper region of the solar plexus. Regardless, I suggest the solar plexus be treated for all intents and purposes as a primary energy center. I have therefore included the solar plexus as a primary energy stimulation site, while not listing it as a primary energy center, per se. • Heart center: center point in heart • Throat center: center point in base of throat • Brow center: center point in middle of forehead, between eyebrow ridges • Crown center: center point in middle of crown The crown center is much larger than the other primary centers. With its entire support structure, when it is fully active, it flowers and covers the whole top of the head above the hairline. All awareness actions on the crown center should therefore be much larger to reflect this greater size. All energy centers, primary and secondary, are connected with and represented in the crown center and its support structure. The crown center can be likened to being the central energetic brain of the energy body. This bears the same relationship to the energy body as does the physical brain to its physical body. Starting with Primary Centers Beginning work on the primary circuit is a significant step forward in energetic development, especially with the very effective NEW techniques given in this book. I do not recommend serious primary center development work be undertaken to any great extent until the NEW secondary system given earlier has been practiced for at least three months. The energy body must first become used to the secondary system and be given time to stabilize. All heavy energy-movement sensations, as caused by the NEW system, should be given time to reduce before primary centers are worked on. A great variety of potential problems can be avoided simply by conditioning the energy body first. This will make the energy body more robust and responsive, while generally increasing conscious control over energetic flow through hands-on experience. The lighter secondary energetic circuitry powers the heavier-duty primary energetic circuitry. The secondary and tertiary circuits need exercising, developing, and conditioning before primary circuit work can safely and effectively be done. At the very least, I suggest the NEW secondary work be concentrated on regularly, preferably daily, for a few weeks before any serious primary-center work is done. The timing is, of course, up to the individual. Some early experimentation with primary centers, say during OBE attempts, will rarely cause any problems. However, if problems occur, or if you have difficulties getting primary centers working, please return to the secondary system and spend more time on it. Continue until you can progress onto the primary circuit with more confidence. Stimulation Notes In the beginning, you may have to spend several minutes stimulating each primary center. You may also find in the early stages that some primary centers seem not to be responding well. This is normal. It is unusual to find persons with no primary center response at all, especially if they have worked successfully with the secondary system. As with the secondaries, primary centers become progressively more awareness-sensitive and hence easier to work with. For training purposes, you will not need a deep level of relaxation or the trance state. But a slightly deeper level of relaxation than that used for secondary work is recommended. Primary-center work is more effective when done during the trance state, as the energy body is naturally more active then. If you have trouble stimulating primary centers, use the full relaxation and trance techniques before each session of primary-center work. The techniques for stimulating primary energy centers (stirring, brushing, tearing, and wrapping) are the same as those used with secondary energy centers. The actions should be slightly larger to reflect the greater size of the primary centers. Adapt these as you see fit and vary the size of each action to what feels the most natural and effective. Try to feel primary center awareness stimulation actions as penetrating a couple of inches inside the body as you use them. Just as with secondary energy centers, scratch, rub, stroke, or brush the sites of primary centers, as needed, to highlight and target them with body awareness. Do away with this type of manual targeting as soon as you can. The large, whole-limb sponging awareness action is used to raise energy up through the legs to the base center. This same action is also used to raise energy up to and through all of the primary centers, as if sponging liquid energy up through the body. With all primary centers, cease stimulation actions as soon as energetic sensations are felt. There is no need to overdo primary center stimulation, especially for the purposes of projection training. Overstimulation can cause a great many problems. Once a center starts to stiffen, cramp, throb, pulse, buzz, tingle, bubble, or feels warm or cool, consider that center active, and move on. Overstimulation of primary centers is unwise, especially during the early days of primary-center work. The base center is the most important primary center to stimulate during early exercises. Unless the base center is sufficiently stimulated, energy may not flow strongly enough into the higher centers to enable any noticeable activation. I suggest that more time be spent on the base center than on any other, unless noticeable energetic sensations are felt therein. An apparently inactive base center will not stop the activation of higher centers. If you can successfully activate even one of the Fig. 22. The primary energy centers"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"53 higher centers, then energy is definitely flowing through the base center. I recommend that the genital center not be stimulated or used at all. This center is extremely sensitive and can be somewhat volatile. If the NEW stimulation techniques are applied to it, this center can become unstable and cause a great many problems. It is intimately linked with the powerful sexual energy structures within the groin and genitals of both males and females. If this center is activated, even accidentally, it can create conditions that can make it difficult to continue with further development exercises at that time... for obvious reasons. However, do not worry if you occasionally feel some mildly erotic sensations coming from this center during these exercises. Sometimes this cannot be avoided and it will not usually interfere with further primary-center work at that time, nor cause any serious or ongoing problems. Primary Center Stimulation Process This process can be done while sitting or lying down, but I recommend that the sitting position be used while learning it. Try both positions and use what works best for you. Run through the relaxation exercises once , then clear your mind with the breath awareness technique (see chapter 15) until you are well settled. You do not need to be in the trance state. Alternatively, close your eyes and settle yourself while taking ten long, slow breaths before beginning. Use a full-body circuit for a few minutes before beginning primary center stimulation. In particular, make sure you spend a little time stimulating the whole of both feet and both hands before starting. They will be providing the majority of the energy raised and used during these exercises, and it helps if you have them energetically ready. Base Center Raise and sponge energy from feet to base center, repeatedly using a deep sponging action up through the whole of both legs. (Alternate one leg at a time if you cannot split awareness.) After several upward leg sweeps, use the stirring, then brushing, then tearing actions on the base center, one at a time. Continue stimulation for several minutes, alternating awareness actions, or until energy sensations are felt When energy sensations are felt, or if nothing is felt after several minutes, continue with the next stage. Genital Center Raise and sponge energy from feet to base center again. Smoothly take energy up through the base center, sponging energy up through the genital center and on up to the navel center. (Again, direct stimulation is not advised.) If taking energy up through the genital center causes sexual arousal or other problems, avoid this center entirely by taking the energy around it. Loop it under the genital center, taking it through your body and directly to the navel center on the surface of the stomach. Adapt this to what feels most natural and comfortable. Navel Center Raise and sponge energy from feet to base center again. Smoothly take energy upward through the base, through or under the genital center, and on up to the navel center. Stimulate the navel center with the three stimulation actions. The navel center is larger than the other lower centers, so work on an area at least double in size for the best effect. Continue stimulation for several minutes, or until you feel energy sensations. When you feel sensations, or if you feel nothing after several minutes, continue to the next stage. Solar Plexus Stimulation Site Raise and sponge energy from feet to base, to genitals, to navel, and smoothly on up to the solar plexus stimulation site. Stimulate the solar plexus site with the three actions. Continue stimulation for several minutes, or until energy sensations are felt. When you feel sensations, or if you feel nothing after several minutes, move on to the next stage. Heart Center Raise and sponge energy from feet to base, to genitals, to navel, to solar plexus, and smoothly on up to the heart center. Stimulate the heart center with the three stimulation actions. Continue stimulation for several minutes, or until energy sensations are felt. When you feel sensations, or if you feel nothing after several minutes, continue to the next stage. Throat Center Raise and sponge energy from feet to base, to genitals, to navel, to solar plexus, to heart, and smoothly on up to the throat center. Stimulate the throat center with the three stimulation actions. Use the wrapping action around your throat for extra stimulation, wrapping around the entire neck a dozen times or more. Continue stimulation for several minutes, or until energy sensations are felt. When you feel sensations, or if you feel nothing after several minutes, continue to the next stage. Brow Center Raise and sponge energy from feet to base, to genitals, to navel, to solar plexus, to heart, to throat, and smoothly on up to the brow center. Stimulate the brow center with the three stimulation actions. Feel these actions as penetrating inside your forehead. Try not to let your forehead or eyes tense up as you do this. Continue stimulation for several minutes, alternating between all the above techniques if necessary, or until energy sensations are felt. When you feel sensations, or if you feel nothing after several minutes, continue to the next stage. When the brow center reaches a normal level of activity, a pulsing, throbbing sensation will usually be felt in the middle of the brow. Cease stimulation as soon as this is felt. Extra Brow Center Stimulation If no activity is felt in the brow center after doing the above, or if a high-level projection attempt is to be made, the following will provide extra stimulation."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"54 Use a deep stirring action on the left and right temples for twenty seconds or so on each, stimulating the two large secondary centers there. Then, bounce awareness smoothly from temple to temple, through the center of your head, for another twenty seconds or so. Use the wrapping action around the entire forehead, as if wrapping a bandage around the circumference of your head, a dozen times or so. Then use the brushing action across the entire forehead, from temple to temple. Finally, use the brushing action up and down from the tip of your nose to just above your hairline, a dozen times or so each way. The above process can be repeated several times for high-level projection attempts, but is not advisable for regular stimulation sessions done for development purposes. Overdoing brow center stimulation can cause brow center pain, headaches and a plethora of other physical, mental, and psychic problems. Crown Center Raise and sponge energy from feet to base, to genital, to navel, to solar plexus, to heart, to throat, to brow, and smoothly on up to the crown center. Larger actions are required for stimulating the crown center and its support structure. Start by using a wide brushing action, as if painting the whole top of your head with a large paintbrush, in all directions, covering the surface above the hairline. Next, use a large stirring action that covers the whole top of the head. Finish by using large tearing actions, as if repeatedly tearing apart a large, round, flat loaf of bread that is covering the whole top of the head. Feel all these actions penetrating inside your head. Try not to let your head, brow, or eyes tense up while doing this. Alternate these actions and continue stimulation for several minutes, or until energy sensations are felt. When you feel sensations, or if you feel nothing after several minutes, cease work or continue to the next exercise. As with the brow center, do not overdo crown center stimulation. You will usually feel stronger sensations in some primary energy centers than in others. Spend a little more time on inactive centers than on active centers to promote more even energetic balance and development. Active primary centers showing noticeable signs of activity should be left alone. Continuing Primary Stimulation Once you have completed the above primary center stimulation exercises, it helps if you keep some energy flowing gently through all these centers. You do not need to repeat the above process to do this. Using an upwardly sponging awareness action from the feet, sponge energy smoothly upward through all the primary centers to the crown center in one long sweep, then flick awareness back to your feet again. Move your awareness through all the primary centers during the upward sponging action. Do not sponge downward; just flick awareness back to feet at the end of each upward sponging action. Alternatively, this action can be done from the base to the crown center only, as long as your legs are providing a reasonable flow of energy. These two methods can be alternated for variety. Additional energy can also be drawn into the body through the hands and arms with this process, but this should be considered optional as most people find this addition difficult. Try both methods and see what works best for you. Repeat this action gently and continually for as long as is required. Another good way to raise energy through all the primary centers is to use the smoke rings trance-induction technique (see chapter 17). The full-body secondary circuit can also be used here with good effect, as can the two-part energy-raising and storage circuit (see chapter 13). Do not overdo or use too much effort with any of the above methods, as gently and steadily really is the best way to work on the primary circuit. Stimulation exercises can be returned to at any time, during any exercise or practice requiring energy usage, to increase energetic flow whenever needed. Primary Center Breathing Circuit The whole idea of the primary breathing circuit is to raise energy upward into the primary circuit to provide continual stimulation of all centers with a steady, gentle flow of energy. Raising energy upward through the whole body tends to interfere with the natural breathing rhythm. You will often find yourself breathing IN and holding your breath as you raise energy upward through your body. Breathing can thus be used with good effect to enhance energy-raising actions. Following is a very simple breathing circuit that not only enhances energy raising, but also regulates the breathing pattern. Breathe naturally at all times during this circuit and avoid shallow, stilted breathing. 1. Center awareness in feet at the start of the IN breath. 2. During IN breath, sponge energy up legs, through all primary centers, to crown center. 3. Draw through arms as energy passes where hands are resting (optional). 4. Hold awareness centered in crown center until IN breath is completed. 5. At the end of each IN breath, flick awareness to feet and hold, ready for next IN breath. 6. Repeat steps 1 through 5 continuously, for as long as required. Development Session Times In the beginning, when primary-center work is first undertaken, development sessions will tend to be fairly lengthy affairs. Just as with learning the NEW secondary system, primary-center work takes a little time to learn and do well. With a little regular practice, the time necessary to accomplish this will significantly reduce. Primary-center stimulation work can then be included in regular development sessions. This can be incorporated as a part of the full-body circuit, using the NEW secondary system, with a little primary center stimulation being done before starting the full-body circuit. The length of time the primaries are stimulated depends greatly on the type and level of development sought after, but I suggest that this level of work not be overdone. Once the techniques are learned, a half-hour session each day is quite adequate for most developmental purposes. Any more than this is overdoing things and could cause problems to arise."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"55 Primary Center Sensations Primary energy center sensations can be quite strong and variable, depending on their natural state, the level of activity, and the amount of energy flowing through them. Active primary centers can affect nerves, muscles, and surrounding flesh in many peculiar ways. Strong energetic movement in a primary center can cause the flesh around it to twitch, pulse, and/or throb quite noticeably. These sensations can often be felt with the fingertips, showing that they are real, not just subjective sensations. The condition of the secondary and tertiary supporting structures of the energy body plays a large part in the type and level of primary-center activity that can occur. If you experience uncomfortable or painful primary-center activity, or no activity at all, please return to and spend more time on the NEW secondary system, especially the full-body storage circuit, as this will help alleviate these problems. Regular work on the secondary system should not be stopped just because you have begun work on the primary circuit. You should always use the full-body circuit as the mainstay for all energetic development practices. Most Common Energetic Sensations • Localized heaviness, pressure • Throbbing, pulsing, fluttering • Cramping, heaviness, tightness • Tingling, buzzing • Hot or cold sensations It would seem logical that the heavier the energetic sensation, the more active the energy center. This is partly true, but overly strong or uncomfortable sensations are fair indicators of energy blockages and malfunctioning parts of primary energy centers, and of their supporting energetic structures. Typically, a primary energy center at a normal level of functioning will cause a fairly noticeable localized throbbing and pulsing sensation and a steady feeling of pressure. The speed and heaviness of this throbbing will vary according to the energetic demands being placed on a center. Some primary centers, however, will be found to cause some fairly predictable sensations during development exercises or projection attempts, and thus deserve special mention here. Base Center Working this center will often cause a bruised, buzzing kind of aching feeling. This may last for a few days after it has first been successfully activated, and seldom any longer. This sensation will eventually settle down to a steady and comfortable throbbing. On that note, base center stimulation exercises may appear to intrude slightly into the lower genital area, because of the proximity of the genitals to the base center. This will not generally cause any problems, as long as awareness is focused specifically on the base center. It is quite normal to feel slight tickling, tingling, or buzzing sensations in the genitals, even verging a little on the erotic side, while working on the base center. This is quite normal and is no cause for alarm. It will not usually cause any problems, as long as awareness is not allowed to drift into and become locked in the genital area — a definite no-no for the serious aspirant. Navel Center A generally comfortable warm throbbing and pulsing around the belly button, extending a few inches all around it, is normal for this center. You may also feel a fluttering, bubbling, gassy feeling of movement inside the stomach, between the belly button and pubic line and a few inches either side of there. This odd bubbling sensation is related to the workings of the sub-navel storage center, which, although a separate energetic organ, is also related to the energetic workings of all primary centers, especially the lower ones. Solar Plexus Stimulation Site This site can generate a feeling of pressure, tension, and even anxiety, and the feeling you are not getting enough oxygen. Move on to the next stage of the exercises, breathing slowly and deeply, and this sensation will usually pass fairly quickly. If this plagues you, however, reduce the amount of time you spend stimulating this area, or even skip it entirely if this persists. This is more commonly felt the first few times it is successfully stimulated into full activity, and will generally pass if development exercises are practiced regularly. Heart Center Heart center sensations can be extremely visceral and hence are the most worrying and difficult of all to ignore. Normal heart center activity feels like a throbbing in the flesh and ribs in the surface of the chest, much like the heavy heartbeat you get after exertion, but on the surface of the chest and without any shortness of breath. Anything more than this is unusual for normal development exercises. Heavy sensations can occur, though, especially if a spontaneous OBE, or near OBE, occurs. This will often happen during primary center development work, especially during the trance state. These potential extra-heavy sensations are thus well worth a special mention here. Heavy heart center sensations are at their very strongest during the exit stage of an OBE. This occurs as the projectable double is internally generated as well as during its projection. Extreme heart center sensations associated with projection indicate unavoidable energetic conflicts caused by the presence of an awake mind during the projection process. The heart can feel like it is racing, sometimes at a seemingly impossible rate. It is not the actual physical heart racing, however, but the heart center. The heart center works overtime to provide the greater amount of energy required for a conscious-exit OBE to occur. The heart center causes these heavy sensations, which makes it feel like the physical heart itself is racing. If you hook yourself up to a heart monitor during a conscious OBE exit, you will find your heart rate increases only"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"56 slightly and that this increase is mainly due to excitement. A racing heart center will not hurt or damage you at all, but it takes quite some getting used to, I must admit. The heart center, when fully active, especially during an OBE exit, feels something like this: Place one hand on your chest, with your fingertips resting over your heart. Tap your fingertips on your chest, roughly in time with a normal heartbeat — thud-thud... thud-thud... thud-thud. Increase this rate until you are thudding on your chest as fast and as hard as your fingers can move. Add some really heavy full-body vibrations, a continual falling sensation, and some really strange noises, and this is something like how the heart center may feel during a conscious-exit projection. Be warned, and be ready to accept and weather these heart center sensations during your first successful projection attempt. If you are not fully prepared for these they will cause you to panic and shock you out of your first real projection success. On the brighter side, heavy heart-center sensations always reduce during subsequent projection attempts, albeit often slowly. Throat Center When active, the pressure and throbbing in the throat center can sometimes cause mild but uncomfortable choking sensations, and even shortness of breath, as if something were touching and pressing against the windpipe. This is partly caused by the sensitive area this center is in, but also can be tied in with strong heart center activity. These sensations are mainly felt during early successful stimulation attempts during the trance state. If you bear with them, they will ease off gradually in response to regular energetic development work. If, however, choking sensations continue to disrupt development exercises and projection attempts, either reduce the amount of time spent on this center or skip it entirely. In fact, any primary centers that cause sensations that are too uncomfortable or painful should be worked on only very lightly or skipped entirely until the sensations reduce. Brow and Crown Centers You will usually feel pressure and throbbing in the brow center during stimulation and development exercises. This is quite normal. These sensations can be very strong and noticeable in some people. Strong brow center pressure sensations will usually be felt at some time during the course of long-term energetic development, especially if dormant psychic abilities are present. You will feel pressure as either localized in the middle of the forehead — as if someone were pressing a thumb hard into it — or as a tight band around the circumference of your head at the brow level. This last feels as if a wide leather belt were tied around the head and being slowly tightened by an invisible sadist. If the crown center is also involved, this pressure may also involve the entire top of the skull above the hairline. Brow and crown center pressure can be uncomfortable, even painful at times, but is generally sporadic. It will not happen every time. Strong pressure is a fairly common sign of development, and can aptly be thought of as energetic growing pains. If headaches or migraines result from this pressure, treat this as you would normally. Please see a medical doctor if pain persists. Ice packs and hot-water bottles, alternated, usually ease this type of pressure pain. The Strobe Effect The strobe effect is my term for an occasional energetic-cum-visual phenomenon that can happen at any time during normal meditation or sleep, as a delayed side effect of energetic development. A sudden flash of stunningly bright silver-white light is seen behind closed eyes, in the mind's eye, usually accompanied by a slight feeling of concussion over the whole brow and facial area, as if from an open-handed blow. The wide area over which this painless slap is felt involves the support structure in the face. The strobe feels something like it would if a powerful camera flash were set off at very close range while the eyes are open, but without hurting the eyes. Many people have contacted me over the years, extremely worried, believing they were under some kind of entity attack because they had experienced the strobe effect. They often break off energetic development because of this. But this phenomenon is caused solely by the brow center, as it strobes accumulated energy upward into the crown center. This effect is strongly related to clairvoyance and is a strong indicator that clairvoyant potential is present. Being an energy clairvoyant myself, I am all too familiar with this effect. The strobe effect marks the beginning of the energetic creation of the vision screen, which forms the visual backdrop that holds the vision stream. The vision stream is the flood of vivid mind's eye visions seen by an energy clairvoyant. Energy clairvoyance is my term for visual mind's eye clairvoyance, brought about through pure energetic stimulation during the trance state. One of the most basic functions of primary energy centers is their ability to accumulate energy, acting much like subtle energy capacitors. Once a primary center's energy accumulation reaches a certain point, it strobes its accumulated energy upward into higher centers. The strobe flash-activates surrounding energetic structures, and forges many new energetic connections, which allows for a much stronger, higher-quality, energetic flow. This enables the higher functions of primary centers, e.g., in the case of the brow center, clairvoyance and other psychic abilities. Temporary energetic connections and structures dissolve when the energy centers responsible for their creation become energetically exhausted. With the brow center, unlike all other centers, the strobe effect is extremely visible in the mind's eye. I consider this similar to how the electronic condenser in a camera flash works. When the brow center achieves a full charge, it strobes powerfully once. If the energetic flow permits, the brow center will strobe several more times. The energetic creation of the vision screen used for energy clairvoyance, however, takes a slightly stronger and more stable energetic flow than nature usually provides for. If the energetic flow is stable enough to maintain the full-energy clairvoyance process, a few seconds after the first initial strobes the brow center will begin strobing regularly every few seconds. This will quickly increase in frequency to about quarter-second intervals, speeding up to a continual blurring strobe. The vision screen will then begin to form in the mind's eye. The vision screen looks very much like an oval mirror. Imagine one about two feet high and one foot wide, hanging at arm's length in front of you in your mind's eye, bordered by dense, dark-gray smoke. The surface of the vision screen is made"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"57 up of very pale-gray textured smoke. Its surface moves and swirls slightly, with occasional sparks and flashes of light coming from within it. On this backdrop, energetic flow permitting, you see a stream of brilliant 3-D visions, often with full sound and color. Clairvoyant operators eventually learn to manipulate their vision screen, and mentally tune in to areas of interest. They even shift out of their bodies and enter the vision screen and experience visions firsthand, which can be likened to a powerfully akashic-records type of OBE. The creation of the vision screen, from the first strobe to its formation, is absolutely fascinating to watch. The strobe effect is completely natural, energetically speaking. It simply means the brow center in question is better developed than average, or has stronger natural potential. The strobe effect will never cause any harm and is a very good sign, if you are planning to develop any type of psychic ability. It also indicates a strong potential for developing high-level projection abilities. Body-Rush Sensations While doing secondary or primary center development work, it is fairly normal to experience periodic tingling adrenaline- type rushes up through the body, especially through the back and spine. These tingling body rushes are caused by energy movement resulting from secondary and primary centers generating pulsing waves of energy up through the energy body. These are not to be mistaken for kundalini-type energy spikes. Kundalini energy spikes are far heavier, often uncomfortably hot, and come with a fairly strong cramping sensation in the anus, perineum, coccyx, colon, and lower spine. These sensations are generally localized to the lower half of the spine. Normal energetic body-rush surges can be triggered by many things, including energy-raising efforts that release significant blockages, as well as by emotional upsurges. These can be likened to the surging, tingling waves of energetic feeling caused by uplifting music. Energetic waves affect nerve endings in the physical body, particularly in the spine and back muscles. This causes the tingling, surging adrenaline-type body-rush sensations. These can be quite strong, even breathtaking at times, but are normal. However, if these energy rushes are felt as particularly strong and cramping, and are felt shooting up through the lower part of the spine and stomach, and if burning heat or cold and pain are felt, stimulation should be stopped immediately. These sensations indicate premature kundalini activity. If any symptoms cause worry or continue to be a problem, I suggest you stop primary-center work and use only the secondary system. The NEW secondary system is much gender, safer, and more predictable than primary-center work. It has far fewer side effects and is a much gender system overall. You can return to primary-center work later. If you suspect that a kundalini spike has occurred, I would suggest that you take at least a three-month break from all primary-center work, to give the energy body time to adapt. Development exercises can then safely resume. Reducing Primary-Center Activity After any type of energetic work involving the primary centers it is, traditionally, thought to be very important to close all energy centers that have been opened (that is, stimulated). This is illogical and ineffectual. No localized awareness action, and no visualized action either, will be found to cause an energy center vortex or chakra to reduce activity, deactivate, or close. A visualized stimulation action (commonly called a chakra opening or closing action) will only affect the energy body if it is localized to the site of a primary energy center. It thus becomes a type of body-awareness action, albeit a fairly obtuse one. Experience has taught me that no matter how an awareness or visualized action is performed at the site of an energy center, if it has any effect at all it will cause further stimulation. I consider it illogical to think that any reversed action will succeed in shutting down or closing an energy center once it has become active. This is, in principle, a lot like fanning a spark into a flame with a stimulation technique and then trying to make this flame go out by fanning it from a different direction. Whatever the technique used, opening and closing methods both involve a similar localized action at the site of a primary center. Primary energy centers (chakras) are complex nonphysical organs, each with many subtle bioenergetic and pure- energetic functions. They should not be likened to simple mechanical devices that can be opened and closed. Primary energy centers are not just little doorways that can be opened and shut with good intentions and a little visualization. Some people may dispute this , being convinced energy centers must be deliberately closed. Be that as it may, my logic is based on solid firsthand experience: Energy centers simply cannot be deactivated or closed in this way. Those who believe they have succeeded at doing this will find that their actions are merely coincidental with their supposed result. The energy centers in question would have been deactivating on their own anyway. In most cases, primary centers begin deactivating the moment relaxation and trance disciplines are broken and normal levels of physical and mental activity are restored. The best way to deactivate energy centers is to leave them alone and stop using them. Energy centers will also cease activity when the energy body becomes energetically exhausted. This can happen when the energetic support structures in the energy body become exhausted, and are rendered incapable of supplying the energies necessary to support energetic activity. If no significant continuing energetic activity is felt in primary energy centers after a development session, they should be left alone. An attempt should be made to reduce activity in them only if continuing energetic sensations are pronounced or uncomfortable. Following is a list of ways to reduce activity in the energy body. Combinations of these actions will, under normal circumstances, significantly reduce energetic activity in the primary centers. • Reverse energy-raising actions in the legs and arms, dumping energy. • Stop focusing awareness on the energy body and its primary energy centers. • Break physical and mental relaxation disciplines. • Move, stand, talk, stretch, and restore full circulation and movement. • Curl up and go to sleep — if this is appropriate."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"58 • Hug a hot-water bottle into an uncomfortably overactive center , then go to sleep. • Alternate die above hot-water bottle with an ice pack. • Vigorously rub or slap hands, arms, and legs, to draw awareness away from primaries. • Walk, jog, swim, do aerobics — physical exercise can help. • Take a shower or two — ice cold if necessary. • Avoid any type of energetic exercise or practice until all activity has ceased. • When all else fails, EAT, and keep eating until all unwanted sensations cease. I have had a few cases where primary centers have refused to deactivate for some days after stimulation. This problem can arise when severely depleted parts of the energy body suddenly have their energy flow restored. A strong, continuing energetic demand can thus continue long after stimulation and energy-raising efforts have ceased. If this ever happens — and this is quite rare, I might add — make use of all the above-listed ways of reducing primary- center activity. I suggest that alcohol and recreational drugs be avoided, and meditation and energetic practices be curtailed. I suggest you concentrate on normal physical life and activity until the problem corrects itself, as it always will. The general rule with any type of energetic problem is to take an energetic break, for as long as is necessary. In the worst case I have ever come across, it took almost a month before energetic activity stopped altogether. This consisted mainly of pulsing and fluttering in brow and heart centers, along with frequent adrenaline-type energetic body rushes. This problem slowly eased and eventually disappeared. Note, this person also had a serious eating disorder, was fairly hyper, and was steadily losing weight at this time, and against my advice, continued to diet all throughout this episode. I think the diet factor significantly contributed to the overall energetic problems and the lengthy time this condition took to stabilize. I have found that die fastest way of slowing energetic activity is to eat large amounts of heavy food, especially heavy protein. (This is an excellent short-term solution, but long-term use will obviously cause weight gain.) Digesting a heavy meal takes a great deal of energy. After a heavy meal, the energy body diverts its resources into bioenergetic digestion processes. The energy body virtually shuts down when the stomach is overloaded. A large meal thus uses up all available energy, leaving nothing to support pure-energetic activity. For this reason, any energetic or development-related work, even simple meditation, can be a waste of time if undertaken within an hour or two of a heavy meal. This is one of the most common problems presented to me, where energetic development exercises have seemed ineffective. A light meal, or even temporary abstinence, is recommended before development exercises. If you have problems getting your energy body to respond to any of the exercises given in this book, going on a low-fat or low-protein diet for a couple of weeks, or any similar diet, can make all the difference. Potential Negative Side Effects While conceivably some risks are involved with primary-center work, I consider it quite safe to undertake at the levels given within this book, provided all procedures are followed and cautions are duly heeded. The main problems that can arise from primary-center work, apart from those already discussed, are dealt with below. The incidences of serious problems are rare. Other contributing factors, apart from energetic development, are almost always involved. Out of the hundreds of people who have consulted with me on energetic development, in person and through the Internet, only a small handful have developed what could be deemed serious problems. In all cases, I have found outside factors have been contributing to or causing these problems. Any problems that can arise through primary-center work can easily be overcome if they are recognized early and handled with a little common sense. Premature Kundalini While raising the kundalini is an extraordinarily difficult thing to do, it can be very worrying if kundalini energy begins manifesting prematurely. The body and mind must be energetically, mentally, and physically prepared to handle this level of energetic movement. Normally it takes several years of mental, energetic, and spiritual development and purification before it can be done with reasonable safety. A small number of people will, however, occasionally feel symptoms of kundalini energy stirring when they undertake serious energetic development of the primary circuit. This can result in spikes of energy shooting up through the lower spine, often accompanied by stinging and cramping sensations. This is not to be mistaken for the normal, often breathtaking, adrenaline-type energetic rushes up through the base center and spine associated with normal levels of secondary and primary energy movement. These energetic body rushes are completely normal symptoms for that type of development work. In more than two decades of personal energetic development work, because of my need to find my own way in these matters, I have experienced and lived through just about every stupid mistake and foolhardy blunder it is possible to make. Through experience, I have found that no matter how bad the mistake, or how severe its effects, it can be overcome. Taking a complete break from all energetic work, including meditation, and concentrating on real-life physical matters is the very best way to alleviate problems and undo mistakes of this nature. For example, in the late eighties when I first raised my kundalini it almost killed me, quite literally. My body experienced severe physical shock. Once I had recovered from that, the resulting onslaught of energies and impressions at work within and around me began unbalancing me in many subtle ways. I was fully aware of what was happening and why, but also intuitively knew the cure. I shut down everything for just over one year, apart from gentle meditation and prayer, and concentrated solely on my physical life, family, work, health, and intellectual pursuits. I kept my feet firmly planted on the ground at all times, until my energy body and perceptions were completely stable again. Once I was totally satisfied that everything inside was functioning normally again, I returned to my energetic and mystical practices. I found, after my energetic holiday, that everything inside worked beautifully once more-much better than before, in fact. There was no recurrence of my problems, nor has there been for the last decade."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"59 Mental and Emotional Imbalance In cases where I have come across psychological or emotional problems that appeared to have been caused by energetic development, other contributing factors have always been present. Upon investigation, I usually find that suggested procedures are being modified and cautions ignored. Either that or preexisting mental or emotional instabilities are at work, causing or contributing to the overall problem — more usually both. Because of this, I strongly recommend that people with preexisting weaknesses and instabilities in these areas think very carefully about this. These factors must always be considered before any type of serious energetic development, especially primary circuit work, is undertaken. If in doubt, please seek the opinion of a qualified therapist or medical doctor. If energetic development is undertaken regardless, I suggest that the NEW secondary system be practiced on its own for at least one year, or until such time as it is felt that primary-center work can be undertaken with confidence. It is quite possible to cause mental or psychic instabilities if the brow or crown centers are overworked, or if they are worked on to the exclusion of other development exercises. In the same way, too much work on the heart center can cause emotional problems to manifest. These same problems can also arise if my warnings are ignored and the sub-brow or sub-heart storage centers are actively filled. No matter how often or how firmly I warn people about these dangers, they often think they know best and do it their own way regardless. While I can relate to this attitude, please understand that the warnings and cautions given in this book are very carefully thought out. They are not given lightly. All are based on hard firsthand experience and have been given for very good reasons. Heeding my advice on these matters will help avoid many unpleasant side effects, mistakes, and potential problems. This, in itself, will greatly speed overall development time. In many cases, where cautions are not heeded, problems will not arise immediately, but the conditions that allow potential problems to manifest have been created. A problem may thus arise later, or occur intermittently, especially if unwise energetic practices are continued. Most people who have ignored cautions and then come to me for help fully believed that they could safely take shortcuts to psychic abilities. This was something they wanted at any cost, without having to bother about all that seemingly time-wasting and boring old development stuff. More often than not, these people paid a steep price for their lack of foresight, through slowed or indefinitely suspended development. Breaking the rules here may gain a person some quick temporary psychic abilities, but at what price, I ask. At what price? Mental, psychic, and emotional instabilities are no laughing matter. These can have devastating effects on all aspects of life. A good example came my way recently. A young man e-mailed me about some advice I'd given in one of my very early online tutorials (published on the World Wide Web several years ago) not to overwork the brow and crown centers during primary center development work. He said that, after reading this caution, he had worked exclusively on his crown and brow centers for almost a month, just to see what would happen. He was most annoyed that nothing weird had happened — while I was most relieved. This type of reckless behavior totally defies logic and common sense. Another common reason for defying my cautions, I have found, is that people take advice based on people's experiences gained through using ineffective visualization-based methods. Because of the powerful nature of the NEW system's awareness- based techniques, anyone not fully experienced with them in the long term is a totally unfit adviser, no matter what their background or experience. I say this without reservation. There are right ways and wrong ways to do just about everything, and this saying particularly applies to the many aspects of energetic and psychic development. The development exercises given within these pages nurture psychic abilities in a safe and totally natural way. If these exercises are regularly practiced and not overdone, all warnings and cautions are duly heeded, and if a little common sense is applied as required, any latent psychic abilities will soon rise to the surface. These can then be used and nurtured safely and naturally, one small step being taken at a time. There are no safe ways to rush these matters. Increased Sexual Desire It is fairly well known today that primary-center energy work has the potential to cause a plethora of energetic problems, of which greatly increased sexual desire is probably the most well known. This fairly rare genital center problem is more related to kundalini energy than to normal levels of primary or secondary energetic activity. This is a potential problem only — something to be aware of but not overly concerned about. As with all potential energetic developmental problems, this is a common-sense matter. It is easy to spot the signs and rectify matters before they can grow into serious problems. Increased sexual desire can potentially become a problem with the NEW primary center manipulation and development techniques given in this book, mainly because of the very effective nature of the techniques used. Barring accident, however, deliberate misuse and sexual energy experimentation are the biggest causes for this type of problem. Problems normally will arise only if the genital center is deliberately focused on and actively stimulated. Body awareness can thus become locked into the genital center; it can then be very difficult to shift the focus of body awareness away from that area. If this is allowed to continue, it will not usually cause any lasting damage or harm — barring sexual and energetic exhaustion, of course. The solution is to quickly move body awareness and move on to the next exercise. If, however, body awareness tends to keep flicking back into the genital center of its own accord, discontinue the session immediately, break relaxation discipline, and use the deactivation measures given earlier. Clapping hands and stamping feet are also good ways of forcing body awareness away from the genital center. If all else fails, a cold shower will normally do the trick. The ultimate cure for this malady probably is standing in a bucket of ice water, with both hands also submerged in iced water. Chakra Wonder-Workers There are people in the world today advertising their services, under many different tides, as energetic masters capable of opening primary energy centers (chakras) for other people. This service usually has a steep price attached to it, often thousands of dollars. They claim to have high levels of knowledge and ability, and that once chakras have been opened by them, psychic"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60 powers will be enabled in the recipient of their services. They claim they can save people many years of boring old development work. They offer a quick fix and an easy shortcut — for a price. Without exception, these people are frauds and charlatans, more interested in opening people's bank accounts than in opening their chakras, which they cannot truly do anyway. Activating a person's primary energy centers from the outside (often from a great distance) simply cannot be done. Persons like this, if they have any ability at all, may be able to cause a few energetic sensations in another person's primary centers (but in person only), by raising and directing energy into them. If at all possible, this would be a simple energetic transfer similar to healing. However, this will not have the intended long-lasting effect on the recipient's primary energy centers. The persons receiving this energy would feel no more by way of energetic sensations and gain no more benefit from it than they would get by raising their own energy and stimulating their own primary centers. It should be fairly clear by now that primary centers are not simple little mechanical devices that can be opened and shut with a few waves of a magic wand and some good intentions. Barring accident or natural ability, primary energy centers have to be nurtured out of dormancy and their supporting energetic structures developed and strengthened. This must be done in a balanced way or the energy body will become unbalanced, which can cause serious problems. The development of the energy body and its primary centers takes time, as long as it needs to take. Shortcuts and quick fixes are neither wise nor advisable."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61 15. Deep Physical Relaxation The first big hurdle faced by projectors is deep physical relaxation. This essential skill needs to be thoroughly learned. I cannot stress it strongly enough; of the thousands of projection-related problems I have dealt with over the years, in person and on the Internet, one skill area stands way out in front as causing the majority of problems — deep physical relaxation — or rather, the lack of it. Everyone seems to rush through learning this most important of all core skills, to get on with the seemingly more interesting stuff. Many people seem to think that because they can stay awake long enough to attain some level of trance, they must therefore be physically relaxed enough. Wrong! It is quite possible to achieve the trance state without having a deep-enough level of physical relaxation to create the conditions that allow conscious-exit projection. The trance state means that your physical body is asleep while your mind is still awake. But your body can still contain significant physical tension and muscular knots, even when fast asleep or in the trance state. A tense trance state does not allow the proper generation of the projectable double. It simply will not generate in areas containing physical tension. This can result in partial or even painful semiprojections, and a great deal of frustration. Deep physical relaxation is the foundation on which everything else rests. Without it, conscious-exit projection becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible. If you do not thoroughly learn this valuable skill, you will waste an enormous amount of time and effort trying to project before you are ready, only to fail every attempt right on the brink of the exit. More time and effort must be spent learning deep physical relaxation than with any other skill — it is that important! Relaxation improves with time and practice. It is very important to develop effective relaxation skills and good relaxation habits in the early days of development. Deep physical relaxation is quite easy to achieve, if you go about it in the right way and practice regularly. Posture and Comfort Before you begin using the deep physical relaxation system (coming up soon), please make sure you are not overtired. A sleep deficit can be a real problem, interfering with your ability to stay awake during the coming exercises — especially if you do them lying down, which I do not advise. The value of these exercises will be greatly reduced if natural tiredness is allowed to interfere with the deliberate relaxation process. I suggest that these exercises be done when you are wide awake and well rested. I also suggest that you do not practice these exercises immediately after a heavy meal, as this will tend to promote sleep rather than deep physical relaxation. If simple relaxation is a problem, bathing before starting these exercises can be a great help, especially in a hot, mineral-salts bath. Wear loose, comfortable clothing and have bare feet or loose socks, depending on the local temperature. Start by sitting in a comfortable armchair with good back, neck, and arm support, and with a pillow under your feet. This pillow is necessary because when the physical body relaxes to a very deep level, supporting muscles in the feet tend to relax and expose bones, reducing circulation and causing distracting discomfort. If an armchair is not an option, use whatever is available. Even a dining chair can be substituted, although more attention must be paid to finding the perfect balance point for your head. It is possible to use a bed, but falling asleep can be a big problem. If you must use a bed, lie on your back and hold your forearms vertical above the bed, with elbows resting on the surface of the bed. This will help prevent you from falling asleep. Good posture helps a great deal with deep physical relaxation. Do not allow yourself to slump in the chair. If you start with good posture, your body will stay well balanced. If your posture is not good, when your muscles deeply relax, your body will sag. This can cause discomfort in the spine and joints, as well as circulation problems, all of which will interfere with relaxation. Put pillows behind your lower back and neck as necessary, to make sure you are not sagging. The head must be balanced and not be allowed to sag to the back or front or to one side. Close your eyes and let your head and neck relax. Move your head back and forth slowly and you will find there is an exact balance point, between where it falls, either way, through gravity. This balance point is the perfect position for your head. If you have a pillow behind your neck, it is permissible to let it fall lightly back into the pillow. A balanced head position has the added benefit of keeping you awake, as, if you drowse, your head will tend to fall onto your chest or to the side and so wake you up. Once you have some practice at balancing your body and working on deep physical relaxation, you can use anything, even a hard-backed wooden dining chair. If you have balance, you can relax to a very deep level anywhere and anytime and in virtually any situation. Relaxing Muscle Groups I have kept the deep physical relaxation exercises here as simple as possible. All that is required is to progressively tense and relax opposing groups of muscles. If you already know a full-body relaxation discipline, you can adapt it to this one, making sure all muscle groups are covered. Warning: Proceed slowly and gently with these exercises when you first start using them. It is very easy to strain little-used muscles and tendons with any system using opposing muscle groups, especially neck muscles. If in any doubt about your ability to do these exercises safely, please consult with your medical doctor or physical therapist first. With all these exercises, pay particular attention to the relaxation part at the end of it. Allow your muscles to sink and droop and totally relax after tensing. In the early stages of relaxation training, I suggest that this system be practiced repeatedly, until a whole-body feeling of cozy warm heaviness is achieved. Near enough is not good enough when it comes to deep physical relaxation for OBE. Practicing this thoroughly will save you a great deal of time and effort later, and will make projection much easier. This system, as with any other, will become quicker and more effective the more often it is used. With regular practice, a deep level of physical relaxation can be achieved in only a few minutes."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62 Full-Body Stretch: Do this standing up or lying down, before settling yourself to begin the following exercises. Take a long, deep breath while stretching your arms and legs and arching your back and neck. Stretch yourself right out, as if very tired and having a full yawning stretch. Ten Breaths: Sit comfortably and get ready to begin. Close your eyes and relax for a minute or two, letting yourself settle down. When you are ready, take ten long, deep breaths, filling your lungs each time, then emptying them all the way out. Feel the tension draining out or your body every time you breathe out. Imagine a white cloud of sparkling energy is entering your body with each IN breath. Imagine this entering your nose and moving through your nasal passages, throat, and down into and filling your lungs. Imagine a dark cloud of tension is leaving your body with each long, OUT breath. Take your time over this. After the ten breaths, and throughout all the following exercises, if you can, keep a small part of your mind focused on your breathing, feeling it entering and leaving your body. This will help keep your mind clear, which aids deep physical relaxation enormously. Feet and Calves: Stretch back all toes and tense both feet and calves at the same time, for five seconds, then relax them. Curl toes downward and repeat, tensing both feet and calves, then relax them. Thighs: Tense both thighs, hold for five seconds, then relax them. Press down with both heels and tense them again, then relax again. Hips and Buttocks: Push buttocks backward into the chair and tense them, hold this for five seconds, then relax them. Rock hips forward slowly and tense for five seconds, then relax them. Whole of Legs: Tense all muscles in the whole of both hips, legs, calves, and feet, all at the same time. Hold for five seconds, then relax them, really letting them go. Stomach and Lower Back: Push out stomach and tense up all stomach and lower back muscles. Hold for five seconds, then relax. Suck in stomach and tense lower back muscles. Hold for five seconds, relax. Chest and Upper Back: Arch shoulders forward while exhaling and caving in chest. Tense all upper back and shoulder muscles, tense for five seconds , then relax. Push shoulders back and take a deep breath while pushing out chest. Tense all upper back and chest muscles. Hold for five seconds, relax. Arms and Shoulders: Tense both shoulders, arms, and hands, making tight fists. Tense and hold for five seconds, then relax. Curl both forearms and fists in toward shoulders, wrists curling inward. Tense and hold for five seconds, then relax. Face and Head: With eyes closed, roll head back, open mouth wide, and screw up face, tensing all the muscles in head and face. Hold for five seconds, then relax. Also with eyes closed, smile widely while screwing up whole face and eyelids, tensing all facial, scalp, and jaw muscles. Hold for five seconds, then relax. Frown deeply while screwing up face and tensing all scalp, jaw, and facial muscles. Hold for five seconds, then relax. Jaw: With head held in its balanced resting position, force lower jaw straight out. Tense jaw and hold for five seconds, then relax. Neck 1: Without tensing, arch neck forward slowly and press chin down firmly onto chest as far as it will go. Hold it there for thirty seconds, breathing normally, and then slowly relax it back to its normal resting position. (If you have neck tension problems, hold chin on chest for up to three minutes.) Neck 2: Again without tensing, slowly push head way back and firmly push chin straight up above. Keep pushing chin out but do not tense neck muscles. Hold for thirty seconds, breathing normally , then slowly relax back to balanced resting position. (Again, if you have neck tension problems, hold this position for up to three minutes.) Neck 3: With head in its normal resting position, slowly grit teeth and tense all neck muscles, feeling the tension spreading right through the entire neck and up into skull. Hold for ten seconds, then relax. Full-Body Stretch: Stay in relaxed position and give yourself a full-body stretch, as best you can. Gently stretch and tense as much of your whole body with this as you can, while taking a long, slow, deep breath. Tense and hold for five seconds or so, then deeply relax your whole body while exhaling. Check posture and readjust resting position at this point, as needed, but while holding on to relaxed state. Ten Breaths: Repeat this step thoroughly, really feeling all the tension leaving your body with every OUT breath. Really feel your whole body sinking into your chair or bed, sinking and getting heavier, warmer and more blissfully relaxed with every OUT breath. Awareness Hands Massage The head, neck, and shoulder areas are the most difficult of all body parts to deeply relax. Stress and inner tension particularly affect the muscles in these areas. This tension comes from within, so we must go deeper to remove it. Use your awareness hands to massage the tension from these areas. Feel ó our awareness hands massaging deep inside your neck and shoulders and up into your skull, as if someone were actually massaging them for you. Use your memory to re-create these awareness actions. Feel your hands penetrating deeply within the muscles and tendons and spine in your neck and shoulders. Feel your hands stroking deeply along your spine and up into and through your head. Feel all the tension leaving your body and feel it sinking and growing warmer and heavier and more deeply and blissfully relaxed. After you've been through the whole relaxation process, relax and focus on your breathing while you move your awareness hands throughout your body, searching for muscular knots, tension, or other problem areas. Note these tight areas for future reference, to save having to search for them every time. Recheck all known problem areas occasionally, during all the coming exercises, and re-relax them as needed."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"63 16. Taming the Mind The surface mind is always active while you are awake. It can be likened to a huge message and reminder pad. Its function is to keep you aware of everything that is going on around you. It chatters away constantly, reminding you of everything, constantly stating and restating the obvious; playfully making witty comments about everything while making sure you know exactly what is happening in the world around you at all times. \"Is that a car in my drive? Milk, I've got to get milk! Damn, my car's well overdue for a service! Why did she say that last night — what did she mean by that look she gave me?\" Et cetera. This is what is called internal dialogue, or monkey mind, using the more Eastern term. We don't really notice these thoughts and images as they constantly flutter through our minds, and they do serve a useful purpose in our daily lives. These are , however, absolute nuisances when you are trying to clear, relax, and focus your mind. It's like having someone inside your head constantly chattering away at you while you are trying to do serious work. You cannot concentrate fully unless you have a little mental peace and quiet in which to do it. This is part of the reason why many people can concentrate better while listening to music. Music occupies the surface mind and slows internal dialogue, thus allowing deeper levels of thinking and concentration. Most teenagers can work and study perfectly well with loud music blaring. They cannot, however, do the same in total peace and quiet because of the incessant internal dialogue. While music can help silence internal dialogue, with regard to mental training it is best considered an artificial prop . I do not advise it be used unless absolutely necessary. To deeply relax the mind and attain the trance state, where you can work with a deeper and more powerful level of mind, it is necessary to silence the constant chattering of internal dialogue. Surface thoughts also create inner tensions that reflect into the physical body as physical tension, making projection more difficult. Thought-Control Exercises Breathing Thoughts Away: Center your attention on the process of breathing, using this to hold your mind totally clear. Feel each breath entering your body and filling your lungs, then feel it leaving your body. Follow the breathing process with your mind, but do not think about it. Feel it, be aware of it, let the feeling of breathing occupy your entire mind. This exercise is enough to occupy the surface mind and to keep its rambling thoughts at bay. If you need more than this, count your breaths. Count up to ten breaths, then start over again. Mentally counting is not a breach of thought-control discipline. When you count each number, drag out the mental word over the whole of each breath. For example, follow the IN breath carefully and then count (mentally) \" Onneeeee\" (one) for the entire OUT breath. Hold your mind clear during the next IN breath and count (mentally) \" Twwooooo\" (two) for the whole of the OUT breath. While you are holding your mind clear, surface thoughts will attempt to creep back into your mind. When this begins to happen (and it always will in the early stages) quickly and firmly push them away before they have a chance to take hold and complete their message. You will get progressively better at this with a little practice. You will soon be able to detect thought pressure alone, and thus stop thoughts before they have the chance to form into actual mental words inside your surface mind. When you get to the stage where you can sense the pressure of thoughts as they are about to start, you are really getting somewhere. You can then begin pushing thought pressures away before they can form into actual thoughts. Eventually, with a little practice, you will be able to hold your surface mind totally clear, like a blank slate. The pressure of thoughts wanting to start will stay with you for some time, even after you master them. This pressure will, however, progressively ease with regular practice. Thought-Control Example A surface thought: \"Right, I better get the cat a new flea collar...\" \"Right, I better get the cat a new fl ...\" Becomes: \"Right, I better get the ca ...\" \"Right, I better ge...\" Getting better: \"Right, I bet...\" \"Right , ?...\" \"R???...\" Nearly got it: \"???...\" \" ...?...\" — This is the pressure of a thought about to start Almost there: \" ......\" — Lessening thought pressure \"...\" — Hardly any thought pressure Perfect !: \"?\" — No thought pressure at all = clear surface mind Thought-control and concentration exercises should be done daily for at least five minutes in total, and for longer if possible. This is best spread out over the day and made into several smaller exercises. (Waiting and traveling time can be put to good use.) Although this can be difficult and frustrating in the early stages, with a little regular practice the surface mind can be held clear with very little effort for extended periods of time. The Deeper Mind Once the surface mind gives in and the internal dialogue is silenced, you will experience a profound silence inside your mind that may feel a litde strange at first, a bit like sitting alone in the middle of a quickly emptying sports stadium after a big game and listening as it falls slowly into total silence as everyone leaves. You miss all the activity, and it suddenly feels strange and unnaturally quiet. This is because you are stilling surface thoughts that have been chattering away unnoticed in your mental background for your whole life. You have created a kind of forced, hollow feeling, a forced mental silence inside"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64 your mind. Holding this takes effort and concentration, which adds to the forced-silence kind of feeling. It will take some time for your deeper mind to get used to this mental silence and begin relaxing and expanding, so be patient. You will grow used to this and one day will learn to love it more than anything else . Once you have attained inner silence, you can think more profoundly and focus your mind completely on whatever you are doing. The criticism by religious groups of the practice of meditation and of clearing the mind stems, I believe, from people jumping to conclusions when they hear terms like emptiness, emptying the mind, inner silence, or entering the silence. Some religious people claim it is not safe to empty the mind, as tile devil or some evil entity may then try to enter and inhabit it. If, however, you take into account how difficult it is to empty die mind and hold it clear for any length of time, it becomes evident that this emptiness only comes through disciplined mental effort. You are blocking your own thoughts, and are thereby also blocking any other thoughts from entering your mind. In a way, meditators fill their minds with silent mental static and use this to suppress all thought. The clear mind, or empty mind, associated with meditation can more accurately be thought of as forced mental silence that has become easier through practice. I have found that the practice of holding the mind forcibly clear can be an effective countermeasure against intrusive energies and thoughts, regardless of their nature or origin. A spirit entity that wanted to invade or mentally interfere with someone would find it much easier to slide in among that person's internal mental dialogue, and hide among the meaningless chatter of an undisciplined mind. If that surface mind is held clear and silent through disciplined mental effort, there is no place left for spirits to hide. Relaxation and Concentration Great mental effort can generate great physical tension. The physical body is intimately connected with all its mental processes; whatever affects the mind affects the physical body to some extent. Learning how to concentrate and relax at the same time teaches how to divorce mental and body-awareness actions from physical actions. Being able to separate these different types of actions is extremely important for all trance, energetic, body-awareness, and projection-related techniques. The following three exercises are designed to improve concentration and mental focus. They can be done any time and any place during the day. Take advantage of travel time to and from work, waiting time, traffic jams, and any other free moments during the day when you are required to do nothing. Just take a deep breath, relax a little, and begin, standing or sitting. At least one of these exercises should be done for a couple of minutes, several times each day. The more often these are done, the faster concentration and mental focus will improve. Single-Object Awareness Pick out an object — tree, chair, picture, cloud, cat (any-thing) — and stare gently but fixedly at it. Do not focus on any part, but let your eyes gently gaze upon the whole of it. Use breath awareness to hold your mind clear while you do this, breathing your thoughts away. Hold this object in view as long as you can without shifting your gaze or allowing any thoughts to start up. Focus on this object to the total exclusion of everything else. Feel the whole of the object and feel the image of it growing inside your mind as you gaze at it. Do not allow your eyes or forehead to tense up. Continue this for three minutes, or for as long as you can. When you end this exercise, close your eyes and cover them quickly with the palms of your hands, shutting out all light. Try to hold and follow the afterimage of the object in your mind's eye for as long as you can. Try to make this afterimage grow stronger. As the afterimage fades, hold the memory of it in your mind's eye, imagining the details in the same way as you would build and hold any fantasy. As an alternative, or if you are nonsighted, hold an object in both hands and feel it. Feel its shape and texture and fill your mind with the perception image this generates, feeling this to the exclusion of all else. Any object will do. Spot Focus Pick a small speck or mark on a wall and focus gently but fixedly upon it. Hold your mind clear of all thoughts. Use breath awareness to help hold your surface mind clear. If you concentrate and stare hard, an optical effect will occasionally cause your vision to darken. Your view will go dark around the edges, getting darker and closing in until you temporarily lose your sight. Ignore this, or just blink it away without breaking concentration. Your vision will return to normal as soon as you stop concentrating. Keep your eyes and forehead relaxed and this will not happen as often. Continue for three minutes, or for as long as you can. As an alternative, hold the tip of a pencil to your finger and press gently until you can feel a tiny point of pressure. Move your finger very slightly to make this small point of pressure continue to be felt. Focus on this point of pressure to the exclusion of all else, using breath awareness to hold your mind clear of all thoughts. Afterimage Retention Relax, calm your mind, and stare fixedly at any gentle light source: the moon, a candle, a low-wattage light bulb, an open window, etc. (Of course, do not look at the sun or any light source bright enough to damage eyes. And note that these exercises, if overdone, can cause eye strain or a tension headache. If this happens, treat it as you would any normal eye strain or tension headache.) Gaze gently but fixedly at the light source for thirty seconds or so without shifting your gaze or changing your focus. Don't focus directly on it, just gaze at it. Use breath awareness to hold your surface mind clear while you do this. Then close your eyes and quickly cover them with the palms of your hands, shutting out all light. Hold and follow the glowing afterimage that has been generated in your mind's eye. Keep sight of this for as long as you can. Try to make it grow and last longer every time. If you use an open window, try to also retain the afterimage of the scenario seen through the window and not just the light, using your imagination to re-create and hold it. Manipulating the focus of your eyes behind your closed eyelids will affect this afterimage. Play with this focus until you find what helps retain afterimages the longest. As an alternative, focus on the texture of an object. After memorizing the texture, hold the afterfeel perception in mind for as long as"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"65 you can, holding your mind clear with breath awareness. Breath Awareness Please pay particular attention to this exercise, as the breath awareness technique is used extensively throughout this book. Just as we did earlier, breathe slowly, deeply, and regularly, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus your entire awareness on the action of breathing. Feel your breath entering and leaving your body. Feel the leading edge of the air entering your nose, moving in through your nasal passages, down your throat, and filling the inside of your lungs. Follow and sense and feel the air passing through the inner parts of your body. Hold your mind totally clear of all surface thoughts while doing this. Your mind must be held as a blank slate. Do not allow any surface thoughts to start up. Do not count your breaths or imagine anything with this exercise. Focus your entire attention solely on the flow of air into and out of your body. Time yourself and see how long you can keep this up without thinking any thoughts at all. Keep note of how long you can do this, as this will indicate how you are progressing with these exercises. Continue this exercise for three minutes, or for as long as you can. Once you reach the three-minute mark, you will be able to hold your mind totally clear for an indefinite period of time. The effort of doing this will progressively ease with regular practice until it becomes effortless. Color Breathing Start breath awareness, as above. Imagine your favorite bright color (anything but black, brown, or gray) entering your body with the leading edge of the air moving through your nose as you breathe IN. Imagine this color (in your mind's eye) as if the air you are breathing IN were a cloud of sparkling, colored vapor, full of life and energy. Imagine a murky cloud of discolored air leaving your body with the leading edge of your OUT breath as you breathe OUT — this being tension and waste energy. Concentrate solely on this and hold your mind totally clear of all thoughts. This particular exercise has the added advantage of causing a flow of atmospheric energy into the body and through the lungs, which is invigorating and invaluable for building both physical and mental vitality. Continue this for three minutes, or for as long as you can. As an alternative, or if you cannot imagine color, imagine your favorite scent instead, or use a real scent to focus on. Follow the leading edge of this scent as it is inhaled and exhaled. Practice Silencing the surface mind may sound very easy, but it is definitely not an easy thing to learn. It takes time and practice, but this is an absolute necessity for any kind of serious development. In the early stages of mental training, if you can silence your surface mind for more than ten seconds you are doing very well indeed. The ability to clear the surface mind is very progressive, however, and regular practice pays big dividends. Keep working on this ability regularly and your original ten seconds of mental silence will quickly grow into twenty, then thirty, then a minute, then two minutes, then more and more, getting easier all the time. Please, do not be discouraged if some of the exercises in this book seem difficult when you first try them. Learning anything new can be difficult, but everything gets easier with a Hide regular practice. Working on these skills individually will save you a great deal of time and effort in the long run. Remember, anything skipped or poorly done during the early stages of development will one day stop all forward progress. This will necessitate a return to basics in order to redo what has been skipped. Just do the very best you can with these exercises and practice regularly. You will soon find yourself making steady progress. Self-Repeating Thought Patterns Self-repeating thought pattern problems occasionally arise during or as a result of mental development exercises. This problem can happen to anyone at any time and for no apparent reason. What happens is this: A line from a song, an advertising ditty, a poem, a snatch of dialogue, worries and upsets, or anything similar will suddenly appear in the surface mind, for no apparent reason. It will begin repeating itself over and over and over, ad nauseam. To a lesser extent, this problem can also take the form of fantasy or memory images. This can be a serious, infuriating, and frustrating problem. It makes any kind of serious mental work, or even sleep, virtually impossible. This is no laughing matter. I have seen people lose days of sleep over this. I have seen grown men and women streaming tears of frustration. I have also seen children banging their heads against doors and walls trying to silence self-repeating thought patterns. This may never happen to you or anyone you know, and hopefully it never will, but in case it does, there is a solution, in four stages. Stage One: Clear your mind through sheer force of will, blank slate it, silencing the repetition and brutally holding it clear, while taking deep, powerful breaths, for as long as you can, gritting your mental and physical teeth if necessary. Whip and cudgel your mind into temporary obedience. Physical relaxation is not required for any of this. Put everything you have into this and be prepared to shed some honest mental sweat over it. Use breath awareness to help with this as needed. This first step is designed to highlight the problem thought pattern, as well as being a brutal but excellent thought-control exercise. If this fixes the problem, fine, but if the rogue thought pattern persists or resumes, continue with stage two. Stage Two: Replace the rogue thought pattern as soon as possible after it begins repeating, before it grows any stronger. Do not allow it to continue! Replace it with a simple but slightly longer thought pattern and deliberately and strongly repeat this in your mind, over and over. Say this new one aloud a few times, or sing it, as this will help to strengthen it. Concentrate on repeating the replacement until you sense the pressure coming from the original thought pattern weakening. The replacement used can be absolutely anything, a snatch of song, a verse, a ditty, a jingle, a prayer, an affirmation, etc. Something that flows easily or rhymes will work better. Once the original problem begins to weaken, change the replacement thought pattern again. Use anything but the original thought pattern for this purpose. Repeat the new repetition until the first replacement weakens. If"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 this solves the problem, fine, but if not, proceed to stage three. Stage Three: If the original problem returns, repeat stages one and two, but double or even triple the number of replacements used. Shorten these slightly and use more enthusiasm and mental volume. Take a shower and sing loudly! Try to make the last few replacements in the set tail off, using progressively shorter phrases. If any of the replacement lines begin repeating, repeat this entire process using the new rogue thought pattern as the base. This will also help to bury the original problem. Avoid the original problem thought pattern: never use it as a replacement. Stage Four: Clear the surface mind through sheer force of will and breath awareness, silencing the final repetition used. Hold the mind clear, well away from any repeating thought patterns, even replacements. Finally, relax and allow your mind to return to normal thought activity. If the surface mind behaves itself, you can stop fighting and return to what you were originally doing, or go back to sleep. But stay alert for problem thought patterns in the future and deal with them quickly as they appear. Repeat these steps as often as necessary to control the problem. As a last resort, use headphones and play music, as loud as necessary, to drown out the repeating thought pattern. This will occupy the surface mind and encourage silence. Continue for as long as necessary to overcome the repeating thought pattern. Sleep with the headphones on. Have the music on continual play or on a timer, as necessary, but do not allow the problem to continue untreated. This last method is best used for children who cannot do the above mental exercises. If the process fails and you are still plagued with self-repeating thoughts, you most likely will not succeed with any serious mental development work at this time. I suggest you give up on it and try to get some sleep, watch TV, or get some work done to take your mind off it, whichever is most appropriate. If you can not overcome this problem, it will usually also interfere with your ability to fall asleep. If this happens, please treat it as you would normally treat insomnia, and please see your family medical doctor for advice if this problem persists. The most common cause of repeating patterns, especially those containing tormenting dialogue and painful real-life images from the past, is stress and anxiety generated by unresolved internal life conflicts. Your subconscious mind is simply throwing up what it considers to be serious problems, and is demanding they be dealt with immediately. Handle these problems intelligently and the thought pattern repetition will usually disappear. If you cannot deal with this alone, though, please do not hesitate to seek professional medical advice and treatment."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"67 17. The Trance State A trance is a very simple and natural state of being, the state entered when the physical body goes to sleep while the mind stays awake. Very simply, the frequency of brain waves changes in response to the changed level of mental activity. The less mental activity, the deeper the level of trance. Normal levels of consciousness cause a lot of bioelectrical activity, which is associated with the awake activity of the surface mind, called the beta level. When the trance state is entered, this activity is significantly reduced, causing many peculiar physical and mental sensations. Changes in brain-wave activity are measurable with an electroencephalograph, or EEG, machine. The human brain has two halves, two hemispheres, each side associated with different physical and mental functions and abilities. The left side of the brain is the rational and logical problem-solving part, while the right side is the more emotional, creative, and intuitive part. I believe the trance state causes these two hemispheres to begin working together, synchronizing more strongly than they are able to in the normal waking state. The more time spent in the trance state, the stronger the bioenergetic connections between hemispheres become, and the more easily the two hemispheres can work together. While the two hemispheres are linked, the mind becomes calmer, stronger, more whole and balanced. This enhances the quality of thought, making it more profound and open to inspiration, while providing great clarity of mind — albeit in an altered state of consciousness. A deeply relaxed physical body with a clear mind holds this connected trance state longer than would naturally occur. We all experience this every night, even if only briefly, while falling asleep. Most people don't even notice this when it happens, but everyone knows how good it feels. Who does not enjoy falling asleep? Similarly, who does not enjoy entering the trance state? Trance is a delightfully blissful, comfortable, stress-free state of being, like submerging yourself in a pleasantly warm physical/mental spa or bath. While falling asleep you will find , if you observe closely, that you begin losing yourself among rambling half-thoughts and impressions. Your body starts to feel heavy and warm and cozy and your thoughts become silly and meaningless. This happens right on the borderline of sleep, just before you lose coherence altogether and fall into the seeming oblivion of sleep. The heavy-body sensation is the sign you have entered the trance state. The mental incoherence (in the case of entering the trance state while falling asleep) is caused solely by mental and physical tiredness. Once the physical body falls asleep, the center of waking consciousness transfers into the etheric body. This is best thought of as a type of inner-body projection. The heavy-body feeling of the trance state indicates that the center of waking consciousness has shifted one step away from its physical body and into the first of its subtle bodies, its etheric body. This takes consciousness one step closer to the real-time projectable double. Next time you are falling asleep, hold your forearms vertical with your elbows resting comfortably on the bed surface. This will keep you awake a little longer than normal. Observe what happens while you are falling asleep. You will experience the trance state for at least a few moments longer than usual before falling asleep, and for still longer if you are not too tired and can stay focused. If you relax and use the breath awareness technique while falling asleep, instead of allowing your mind to drift and ramble, you can drag out the falling-asleep process and stay in the trance state even longer. As a part of projection training, it is necessary to learn how to put your body to sleep while remaining mentally awake and in control — in other words how to enter the trance state and stay awake. This can be a little tricky at first, but is not at all difficult if you follow the correct procedure and get some regular practice in. The physical and mental tiredness that naturally causes the trance state while falling asleep can be replaced by a deep level of physical relaxation and a clear surface mind. If you allow yourself to react to distracting sounds during trance work, you can develop a habitual response to them, becoming easily distracted and irritated. This can seriously affect your ability to enter and hold the trance state. It may cause you to use artificial aids like music or tapes to create just the right conditions for you before you can trance effectively. This will make your trance state dependent on those conditions. A dependency like this is an unhealthy trance habit, as it makes the habitual foundations of the trance state weak and sensitive, rather than strong and resilient. If you are a beginner with no trance habits, please heed my advice on this. Accept sounds and let them wash over you, without tensing, reacting, or mentally complaining about them in any way. Accept and tolerate sounds kindly and without irritation. Look upon unavoidable distractions as valuable opportunities to test your powers of focus and concentration, as sound waves crashing gently over you. This problem will progressively ease with time and patience. The need for total quiet denies the pleasure of trance meditation outdoors, amid all the many wonderful distractions of life: water gurgling over rocks, animal sounds, wind and storm sounds, rolling waves crashing on beaches, children's sounds, and the sweet morning chorus of bird song. These are nature's gift to us all, and all can be better appreciated in a tranced meditational state. Different Levels of Trance I have divided the trance state into three basic levels, and have used sensation descriptive names (rather than the more commonly used technical terms like alpha, beta, theta, and delta) for simplicity's sake, and to help avoid confusion while working in these levels of trance. This will enable you to tell what level of trance you are in simply by noting the sensations you are experiencing. The three basic levels of trance given here are meant as a basic guide for beginners only. Light Trance Light trance is the first level of trance, very similar to the daydream state. While relaxing, your physical body starts feeling warm, cozy, and lethargic. Your eyelids suddenly feel heavy and your eyes begin to glaze over and droop. A mild wave of heaviness and warmth flows over you. Your mind takes on a mildly fuzzy quality and tends to begin drifting. You have some slight difficulty focusing thoughts, especially if you are mentally tired and need sleep. Patterns of light and color (hypnagogic imagery) are seen occasionally during the light-trance state. Mind's-eye visions may"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 also be seen if natural clairvoyant potential is present. Cobweblike tickling is occasionally felt in the facial and neck areas, caused by energy movement through the energetic support structures of the brow and crown centers. (The trance state on its own causes an increased flow of energy, hence the resulting sensations.) With this level of trance comes a mild, whole-body feeling of warm comfortable fuzziness and a slight dissociation from the physical body and the surrounding environment. Time appears to slow down a little and sounds appear to be slightly louder and from further away than they really are. Once light trance stabilizes it is easily held for long periods of time. Great internal mental clarity can be attained with it, as long as tiredness is not a problem. This is the trance state most usually attained during early-light meditations and led-group meditations. If this level of trance is accompanied by a deep-enough state of physical relaxation, conscious-exit projection becomes possible. This level of trance, while easily held, is also quite delicate and easily broken. Physical movement, even walking and talking, must be slow and deliberate to hold the light-trance state. Full Trance The full-trance state has many similarities with light trance, but trance sensations are more pronounced. Entry into full trance is marked by a quite noticeable wave of bodily heaviness and a very slight falling sensation. This comes on fairly quickly, like a warm, heavy wave flowing through you, seeming to sap your physical and mental strength as your body falls away into sleep. Concentration and mental focus are needed at this point to stop the mind from following its body into sleep. Your sense of time changes, slowing down or speeding up, depending on your level of mental tiredness. If you are tired, time tends to speed up; otherwise, it tends to slow. You become noticeably dissociated from your physical body and its environment. Your sense of background atmosphere changes noticeably the moment you enter the full-trance state. The room around you feels like it has suddenly become much larger, thicker, and emptier. Background sounds take on a muffled, faraway quality, something like they would if a cardboard box were gently lowered over your head without touching or disturbing you. You may feel a muffled, bone-deep tickling sensation in your arms and legs if you move them to ease your physical body during trance, similar to how it feels when an arm or leg falls asleep, but not at all painful. Some physical movement is still possible, but takes more effort and feels like it's happening in slow motion. If you manage to stand during full trance (no mean feat, but still possible), you can hardly feel your legs at all. If you can manage to walk (also possible), it feels like you are walking on two huge pillows that used to be your legs. Any kind of physical activity tends to erode the depth of trance, unless done in a slow and dreamy way. Sharp sounds cause an uncomfortable sensation in the stomach and solar plexus that can feel almost like a physical blow if you allow yourself to react to it. (This sound sensitivity can be reduced only by experience gained through regular trance meditation.) Your thoughts begin to feel different, more sluggish than normal yet extremely clear. This is caused by the surface mind shutting down and revealing a more profound level of mind. Holding your mind clear and focused is the real trick to staying awake and mentally functional. If you do not concentrate and stay focused, you will tend toward fantasizing and drifting off among weak and meaningless thoughts. When you first start experiencing trance states, you need to concentrate, forcibly holding your mind awake without allowing yourself to tense up physically or mentally. Hypnagogic imagery is seen behind closed eyelids, in the mind's eye, as are occasional visions. REM (rapid eye movement) activity happens sporadically; when it does, fragments of dream imagery occasionally intrude into the mind's eye. This can indicate a sleep deficit, meaning the physical mind lacks energy, has fallen asleep, and is now dreaming. Ignore REM as best you can if it starts. It normally comes and goes in bouts of a few minutes each, sometimes longer. REM feels like the eyes are fluttering and buzzing beneath their eyelids. This can be very distracting when it occurs in the trance state. If it becomes a problem, gently rub the fingers and thumbs of each hand together and take a couple of deep breaths, stretching and moving your body slightly and resettling it. This slight physical activity is usually enough to stop REM and shut down the dream mind, while allowing trance and development work to continue. This procedure also helps reduce the level of trance. When REM stops, cease all physical movement and continue with your trance meditation. You will be spending most of your time somewhere between the light-trance and full-trance states. As you gain ability and experience, this level will vary. The ability to put yourself into a full trance is very progressive, like most developed abilities. It has to be worked at, but with regular practice can be reached quickly and easily. Deep Trance Deep trance starts with the symptoms of the full-trance state, which become noticeably more pronounced as you fall into a much deeper level of trance. There are many odd sensations associated with deep trance, felt in many combinations: with whole-body coldness and a continual falling sensation being common. The deep-trance state is not dangerous. It cannot hurt you any more than deep sleep can. It is very difficult to get into the deep-trance state, even deliberately. It could not reasonably be expected to happen spontaneously or accidentally to one who has not yet mastered the full-trance state. But the symptoms associated with deep trance are often so strong that they can be frightening if you do not know what is happening. If you are ever worried that you might be going too deep, simply feel yourself moving upward, slowly moving your head, mouth, fingers, and toes, progressively restoring movement to your body until you can pull yourself out of trance completely. If movement is extremely difficult, or if you feel totally paralyzed, you have most probably projected but missed the exit out of your body; you may even have experienced vibrations earlier. In this case, concentrate on moving a single big toe. Ibis will pull back your projected double and end paralysis. If all efforts to pull out of deep trance fail, do not panic. Simply allow yourself to fall asleep and you will wake up shortly after, well rested and none the worse for wear."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69 Trance Requirements Entering the trance state requires three things: deep physical relaxation, a clear surface mind, and a mental technique. Deep Physical Relaxation: Do the full deep physical relaxation exercise (see chapter 15) until you are as physically relaxed as possible. Some preliminary physical exercise to get the kinks out of tense muscles, followed by a hot bath or shower, is advised for all beginners. Clear Surface Mind: Allow your thoughts to wind down and settle while doing the relaxation exercises, then clear your mind by focusing on breath awareness. You may find this easier to achieve if you deal with any pressing thoughts your mind may throw up at this time. Simply consider and deal with these for a few moments each and then let them go. This will greatly ease their clamoring thought pressure. Mental Technique: A mental falling technique speeds up the time it takes to enter the trance state, rather than waiting for the body to fall asleep of its own accord. Focusing on this also helps to occupy and hold your surface mind clear and awake. In all the mental falling exercises given below, use your imagination to construct the falling scenario and feel as if you were there in reality. Produce the strongest internal whole-body awareness sensation possible. Call on a memory of yourself doing something similar, or borrow a scene remembered from a movie. Use this memory to re-create the feeling of yourself performing that same action with your imagination. Feel the falling action; don't just think about it or try to see it in your mind's eye. Once you attain a level of the trance state, heralded by a wave of bodily heaviness and warmth, relax and breathe slowly and naturally. Keep your mind clear — thus holding on and settling in to the trance state — by focusing a small part of your mind on breath awareness. If you need to deepen your level of trance, continue with the mental falling exercise until you attain it. I have given several variations here. Please try them all and find the most effective one for you, or the one you most like. When you find one that suits you, stick with it. This helps to program your subconscious mind to react to the technique, helping you shift into the trance state easier and faster each time. You do not need to overdo the imagined details of scenarios used with mental falling exercises. The rock wall in the elevator shaft below, for example, only needs to be an indistinct blur moving upward. It is the downward movement or falling sensation constructed by your imagination and felt in your body awareness that causes your brain waves to slow, thereby forcing it to enter the trance state. It is not the imagined scenario in itself that does the trick. Deep physical relaxation and a mental falling technique basically trick your subconscious mind into beginning the sleep process earlier, while you are still wide awake. Elevator Imagine that you are in an elevator with one side of it — the side you are facing — open to bare rock. Feel the elevator start moving down with you in it. Imagine you can see the rocky sides of the elevator shaft passing upward as you move ever downward, falling deeper and deeper into trance as you go. Imagine that this rock shaft has an irregular texture and features you can easily see, moving upward past you as the elevator carries you down, down, down. If you like, imagine you can see a large number as you pass a floor every few seconds, and count these as the elevator moves deeper and deeper. Call on the memory of the last time you were in an elevator, or go and ride in one and memorize the sensation. Remember the slight feeling of vertigo it caused in your stomach as it started going down. Re-create this feeling ; feel it in your body awareness. Keep imagining and feeling this, while making sure you do not allow your physical body to tense up. Feel your body letting go and sinking deeper and deeper into the trance state as you ride the elevator down, down, down... Ladder Imagine that you are on a ladder. Re-create body-awareness feelings of remembered arm and leg movements, and slowly begin climbing down. Move one awareness foot and its opposite hand down one rung. Then move the other foot and its opposite hand down another rung. If this is too complex, imagine you are holding on to each side of the ladder and climbing down only with your feet, with the sides of the ladder gliding easily through your hands. Continue down the ladder one rung at a time. Feel your body moving down the ladder. Imagine a rock face or brick wall in front of you, close to the ladder. Imagine this textured face moving upward past you as you climb further and further down the ladder. Feel yourself climbing downward and falling deeper and deeper into trance with every downward step you take. Steps Imagine that you are standing at the head of a long flight of steps with a high stone wall on either side. These steps are large, imposing, and steep. Lift one imaginary foot at a time-carefully feeling yourself doing it — and take the first step down. Feel your body move downward as your feet move one at a time onto the lower step. Repeat this action and take the next step down, then the next and the next. While you are moving down the stairs, imagine you can see the textured stone walls on either side moving upward past you as you move one step at a time down the flight of steps. Continue this, slowly and deliberately, feeling yourself moving downward and falling deeper and deeper into the trance state as you go. Count the steps if you like, slowly, as if you were counting your breaths, \" Oneeee, Twoooo, Threeee\", etc., taking one step down with each exhale. Climbing down a Rope Imagine that you are hanging by your hands from a strong rope and have your legs wrapped securely around it. Your arms are very strong and there is no chance of falling. Move one imaginary hand down, then the next, climbing down the rope hand over hand, with the rope sliding easily between your legs. See the textured rope moving upward past your face as you climb"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70 down it. Continue this, feeling yourself climbing downward and falling deeper and deeper into the trance state as you go. Feather Imagine that you are a feather and are gently floating down from a great height. Feel yourself gently falling, re-creating a falling sensation in your body awareness every time you breathe OUT. Feel yourself holding position and floating in midair as you breathe IN. Feel the atmosphere around you; imagine strands of textured clouds moving upward as you fall gently through them. Continue this, feeling yourself floating gently downward and falling deeper and deeper into the trance state with your every falling breath. IN and OUT can be reversed to whatever feels most natural. Smoke Rings This versatile old favorite of mine can be done from any position, even while walking. Imagine that your feet are in the center of a dense smoke ring as thick as your arm. Imagine and feel this smoke ring rising up over your body and disappearing overhead. The smoke rings are very dense and move close to your body. Imagine that you can feel them moving over your skin as they rise. Imagine that you can see these smoke rings as they move past your eyes. The smoke rings should repeat about two seconds apart, but this can be varied to suit the individual. Feel the rising smoke rings with your body awareness, puffing regularly up over your whole body. Feel an internal falling sensation as the imaginary smoke rings rise upward. Feel yourself falling deeper and deeper into the trance state with the caress of every smoke ring as it rises up over your whole body, over and over, from feet to head. Personalized Trance Technique Imagine any scenario that you are familiar with that involves going down, or any kind of downward movement or falling sensation. This can be anything: an escalator, a water slide, a fireman's pole, a parachute jump, mountain climbing, scuba diving, high diving — anything that could induce a natural falling or downward sensation of movement in your body awareness. Trance Litany Many people find it helps to repeat a simple litany or mantra, said over and over in their head, as an accompaniment to their mental falling trance technique. This also helps keep the mind clear and well focused, and in time you will become conditioned to react to the litany. It will program you to start falling into the trance state whenever the litany is used. Repeat: \"Down, down, down... deep, deeper, deepest\", or something similar, slowly and calmly and meaningfully. Say this over and over inside your head and feel yourself falling down, down, down as you say it. You can make up your own litany, but keep it simple and downward meaning and stick to the same litany all the time. The longer you use the same litany the more effective it will become and the more conditioned you will become to it. Common Trance Problems Most common trance problems stem from the three main problem areas given below. These come mainly from our modern Western lifestyle. They must be addressed and overcome before you can successfully operate in the trance state and hold it strongly enough to achieve conscious-exit projection. Falling Asleep during Trance This very common problem is usually caused by a sleep deficit. Although you may feel fine, there is always a possibility you have not been getting enough sleep. (Most people don't.) If you have a sleep deficit, you normally have very little trouble entering the trance state, even if you do not attain a state of deep physical relaxation first, because you are mentally overtired. But you usually have trouble maintaining mental coherence and operating in the trance state once it is attained. Your mind will lack mental vitality and will be unable to hold itself together. You will tend to lose control very easily and will often just fall sleep for the main part of your trance meditation. It may be easier to induce the trance state when the body and mind are tired, but mental coherence and control during trance are very limited if a sleep deficit is present. The oblivion of sleep is the ever-present companion of the tired trancer. Overtired-ness can easily cause a natural trance state all on its own. Trance, after all, is an extremely natural thing that everyone does while falling asleep. Because of the lack of mental vitality, in this case the trance state is too unstable to allow the operator enough control to do any kind of serious work. Many people, when they meditate, find their meditations naturally end after a set period of time. They usually have very little awareness of the passing of time, or even of what takes place during the major part of their trance meditations. They remember falling into trance and feeling totally blissful for a while, before coming back to earth later, feeling relaxed and refreshed. After entering the trance state, they simply have had a pleasant trancelike nap. The obvious solution is to get more sleep, then return to trance practice wide awake and refreshed. If this is difficult, try changing the time of day you practice trance exercises. Doing trance exercises in the morning, or just after a refreshing nap, will usually solve most sleep-deficit-related trance problems. Many people wake an hour or so early each day for this purpose. They get up, do a little exercise, shower , then do their meditation, trance and energy work. They find trance meditation far more successful when done early in the morning, due to a combination of natural deep physical relaxation and the mentally refreshed state of mind brought on by a good night's sleep. Deep physical relaxation and a clear, fresh mind are essential ingredients for successful trance work. For these same reasons, projection attempts are also usually more successful at this time of day. Some people find projection easier if they go to bed early and set their alarm to wake them during the night. They wake up, holding on to the deeply relaxed state induced by sleep, and immediately attempt a projection. In this case, all preliminary exercises can be"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"71 skipped, with the projector going straight to projection technique — usually with good results. This points out just how important to projection deep physical relaxation and a stable trance state are. Inability to Enter Trance An inability to enter the trance state is usually caused by an insufficient level of deep physical relaxation, and/or by poor concentration and mental relaxation skills. Whatever your trance problem, examine it and identify weak areas. Then, return to the relevant sections of this book and repeat the necessary exercises until these problems are rectified. Practice, practice, practice, is my very best advice here. If you have worked through all the exercises in this section but find you still cannot get into the trance state, please don't give up. Go back to the beginning and start over again if you have to. Redo the lessons and exercises one at a time and don't rush them. This may seem a laborious process, but you must be patient with yourself. Everyone has a different psychological makeup and it is impossible to generalize, or to compare one person's progress with another. Do not measure your progress against the progress of another. Take your time and work at your own speed. Some people take to trance work like a duck to water, while others find they really have to work at it to achieve the levels of relaxation and mental clarity trance requires. But' you can master the trance state if you learn the individual skills and practice regularly. Falling into Trance Too Easily This is an occasional side effect of long-term development work. If a person spends a lot of time in trance, the trance state eventually becomes second nature and is then very easily attained. People with this tendency can find themselves accidentally sliding into the trance state many times each day, at the drop of the proverbial hat. If not checked, this can cause frequent dissociation from reality, which is an unhealthy way to live. This can become a serious psychological disorder and may require professional treatment if it is not addressed. A sleep deficit will compound this problem. The best way to stop accidental trance is to be aware of it and to watch out for it, especially at the times it is most likely to occur, e.g., while driving, watching TV, waiting, traveling, etc. Be ready to work against this, pulling yourself out of trance the moment you feel it coming on. Physical and mental activity focusing on the world and people around you is the best way to avoid accidentally falling into the trance state. If this problem arises, my best advice is to take a break from all development exercises and meditation, especially trance work, for a few weeks. During this break, concentrate on physical life and activity, catching up on your sleep, and doing all the odd jobs and visiting you have been putting off till later."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 18. Preparations for Projection Consciously projecting out of body is nowhere near as difficult as is commonly believed. It is simply a matter of deeply relaxing the physical body, clearing the mind, then triggering the projection reflex with an exit technique. Most people, if they are prepared to put a little time and effort into developing the necessary skills, will have no trouble accomplishing this, right up to the actual exit phase of projection. What happens from that moment onward depends greatly on their energy, self-control, balance, attitude, and intelligent planning. Trance and Deep Physical Relaxation I have found that the majority of people who fail conscious-exit projection either have a problem with the trance state (too light, too deep, or too little control) or they have neglected to fully learn and practice deep physical relaxation — more usually both. It is quite possible to enter the trance state without having a deep level of physical relaxation, just as it is possible to fall asleep with muscular tension still in the physical body. This, in itself, can cause enormous problems for projectors during the exit phase. Many people hurry through or skip the deep physical relaxation exercises, often believing they are physically relaxed enough simply because they can get into the trance state fairly easily. They do not understand that the trance state, plus tiredness resulting from a sleep deficit, can override deep physical relaxation as a requirement for entering the trance state. They go on with projection attempts thinking they are doing everything correctly, while actually not fulfilling the requirements for conscious-exit projection. This can be extremely frustrating, with unsuspected physical tension ruining what might otherwise be a string of successful OBEs. Time and again I tell people — and time and again they don't seem to hear me when I say — \"The real secret to projection is deep, deep, deep physical relaxation!\" Too simple a solution, you might say, but it's the simple truth. A light-to-normal trance combined with a deep level of physical relaxation is the best combination for a smooth and successful projection exit. A lighter level of trance than most people usually seem to attain during projection attempts allows for greater clarity of thought. This makes the exit easier and provides better control during and after the exit. Many people go way too deep into the trance state, usually because of a sleep deficit, then experience heavy REM (rapid eye movement) activity, cobwebs, and other heavy trance-related energy-movement sensations, all of which can be very distracting during the exit. The Projection Reflex When the energetic balance between the physical body, the expanded energy body, and the mind reaches the critical point where projection can occur, a built-in energetic event that I call the projection reflex triggers the full generation and extrusion of the projectable double. The first requirement is for consciousness to reflect itself into the expanding etheric body, as happens when the physical body falls asleep or enters the trance state. This causes an internal shift of consciousness into the first level of subtle body, the expanded etheric body, as it is internally generated. Normal sleep takes awake consciousness right out of the projection equation. With the awake mind out of the way, safely asleep, the natural generation and projection of the real-time double occurs gently and swiftly. The projection reflex is thus triggered naturally and causes no heavy exit sensations that might awaken the sleeper. But if the awake mind holds itself coherent long enough, in a deeply relaxed and tranced state, it can trigger this reflex with a projection technique. Once triggered, the projection reflex makes the rest of the exit automatic, and even difficult to stop. Separation Pressure To consciously project out of body, it is necessary to shift and hold a strong point of body awareness outside the bounds of the physical body, strongly enough and long enough to trigger the projection reflex. All projection techniques, if you analyze them, are designed to shift body awareness outside the physical body in some fashion. Logically, the stronger and more direct an awareness action is, the more pressure it will exert on the projectable double. The more separation pressure exerted, the more quickly and easily will the projection reflex be triggered. One of the most popular projection techniques today involves reaching out for the vibrations. As you attempt to project you reach out with your mind, imagining or visualizing yourself doing this, trying to find the vibrations somewhere outside yam physical body and imagining yourself trying to pull these vibrations into your physical body to cause projection. This is reasonably effective, although I consider the idea that the vibrations could exist apart from the physical body to be illogical. What causes separation pressure is the exterior body-awareness action of reaching out for something and pulling on it . It does not matter what is being reached out for, as long as something is being reached for and pulled on with body awareness. The vibrations technique, however, is not as effective as techniques based on tactile imaging, such as the rope technique and others given in the following chapters. Tactile imaging can be used to mimic any physical action with body awareness alone, both inside and outside the bounds of the physical body. The simpler the action, the easier it is to focus on, and thus the stronger its effect on the projectable double. Hand and arm actions are the easiest and hence the strongest actions to mimic with body awareness. The ease of use and sheer effectiveness of simple awareness hands actions is shown in the training units given earlier in this book. Most meditation and trance-induction techniques exert some degree of separation pressure on the projectable double. Whatever the mental technique, they are all designed to induce some kind of inner movement away from the physical body, causing dissociation from the physical body and loss of normal levels of waking consciousness. This is usually done through some kind of imagined or visualized falling or downward motion. Any internal downward-moving mental action will cause body awareness to shift slightly outside the confines of the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"73 physical body. This causes gentle separation pressure over a wide area of the body. These actions are usually the reverse of what is needed to trigger the projection reflex. This is more like trying to get the projectable double to fall out of its physical body under its own steam, rather than to project out. These types of actions will bring on the trance state, but will not usually trigger the projection reflex unless it happens spontaneously. The Famous Vibrations In my opinion, the famous vibrations are not the cause of projection, but a symptom of the energetic activity associated with the internal generation of the projectable double. When energetic conditions are ripe for projection, the physical/etheric body begins to internally generate its projectable double aspect. This causes some pretty major energetic activity, felt throughout the body as vibrations. But even though the buzzing sensation of vibrations is strongly felt in and by the physical body, no detectable physical vibrations are present. The physical body does not actually vibrate or buzz. This indicates that these vibrations are felt from within the etheric body only, or from within the projectable double as it is being generated, not from the physical body. Often, the vibrations start well before projection actually occurs. Vibrations often are localized to parts of the physical body, which indicates that only parts of the projectable double are being generated. For example, if only the legs and lower torso are vibrating, then only the legs and lower torso of the projectable double are being generated at that time. At times like this, projectors will often feel their legs or arms floating loose and moving about outside the bounds of their physical body. When vibrations are felt in only part of the body, those vibrating parts only have reached the deeply relaxed and energetically excited state required for projection to occur. The parts that are not vibrating, therefore, must be suspected to be unready for projection, possibly due to hidden physical tension in those areas. Many people find themselves stuck to a part of their physical body during the exit. They also often experience pain and discomfort in these stuck areas if they continue trying to force themselves out of their body regardless. I would suggest here that a lack of whole-body deep physical relaxation is the major contributing factor to this common problem. Health, Fitness, and Projection While physical fitness is most definitely not a necessary precursor for conscious-exit projection, it can be a big help. A reasonable level of fitness makes it easier to attain and hold a deep level of physical relaxation and the trance state. A healthy physical body will generally have less discomfort caused by coughing, cramps, and circulation problems. Problems like sleep apnea can also be caused or made worse by a poor level of fitness, and anything like this can have a negative influence on projection ability. Poor health and fitness do not prohibit conscious-exit projection. Some illnesses may even make projection easier. Projection techniques may need to be modified, especially the resting position used, to compensate for an illness. For example, if coughing is a problem, a more upright projection position will help ease the trouble. If poor circulation is a problem, more attention will have to be paid to bed or chair padding. For muscular or spinal cramps, the position and padding used during projection attempts will need modifying to provide better support. If a health or disability problem is severe, it may be wise to consult a medical doctor, physical therapist, or chiropractor. You don't have to say why you are seeking increased comfort. You can merely cite the desire for deep physical relaxation. Position and Comfort for OBE The resting position of the physical body during projection attempts can have a great effect on what happens before, during, and after a projection. Lying prone on your own comfortable bed in your natural sleeping position is not the ideal scenario for conscious-exit projection. We are all conditioned to start falling asleep when we get into bed — which increases the likelihood of falling asleep and losing shadow memories if projection does occur. I recommend either using another room for projection, or changing the position of the bed being used. If change is not possible, relax with your head at the other end of the bed. It is also possible to condition yourself for projection by using a low-wattage colored light, with perhaps a favorite incense. If you use these only when a projection attempt is going to be made, you will soon become conditioned to them. I always recommend a sitting or semisitting position for projection, if at all possible. It is not only easier to project from a sitting position, but it is also easier to recall a projection after the event. Sitting helps overcome many shadow memory loss problems caused by falling into too deep a sleep too early during a projection. If you have ever fallen asleep in a chair, you will notice that you do not sleep as deeply or as soundly as you would in your own comfortable bed. It is also much easier to wake up from a sitting or semisitting position, just as it is easier to stay awake while holding the trance state in the sitting position. This also makes it easier, if you have accidentally fallen asleep, to notice and react to the energetic sensations that herald the return of the projected double during reentry and reintegration. There are several ways to adapt the sitting or semisitting position to your situation and needs. Keep in mind that you are preparing for a projection, not settling down for a comfortable night's sleep. While comfort is important, the ability to deeply relax the physical body while holding the mind awake is far more important. A little discomfort can be a good thing for projection. An armchair or recliner works well for projection, as long as it has good back and neck support and you put a pillow under your feet. If you use a plain armchair, I suggest putting a telephone book or brick under the front of the chair to angle it slightly backward. This stops your head from rocking forward onto your chest and helps avoid breathing problems. Use pillows or cushions to make sure your neck and lower back are correctly supported. You can also place pillows under your arms and hands to increase their comfort. If the back of the armchair is too low and provides no neck support, position it against a wall and place another pillow behind your head to support it. Wear loose and comfortable clothing and loose socks — depending on the local temperature, of course. An oversized tracksuit is ideal. If the room is cold, it is better to use a heater"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74 than to pile on heavy covers. If insects are a potential problem, spray the room thoroughly first or use mosquito netting and insect repellent. If you cannot use an armchair, you might use a folding pool-side recliner with arms and a full-length foam mattress. Use pillows to increase the comfort of your arms, legs, and neck. Probably the easiest and most convenient method is to prop yourself up as if you were about to have breakfast in bed. You don't want to be too upright, as this can be uncomfortable. Neither do you want to lie too flat. I suggest that you try an angle of approximately 45 degrees, and then vary to suit yourself. A hospital bed with an adjustable back would be perfect, if you could acquire one. Bedcovers should not be so heavy as to cause discomfort. Use several pillows to prop yourself up in bed, or use a dense foam bolster and a few pillows. Cut a foam wedge-shaped bolster to size (quite cheap from most foam suppliers), or use a bean bag. It is important that your body be well supported and not tend to sag or slide or cramp up while deeply relaxing. Bad posture causes tension and will eventually lead to distracting pain or may require movement to ease cramps and circulation problems, either of which will break the deeply relaxed state. Disconnect your telephone or turn down the volume, or take it off the hook or set an answering machine to take calls in silence. Most background noise can be overcome by using \"white noise\". Simply mm on a radio or TV and tune it to an off station. Turn up the volume until the hiss of white noise covers background noises. I do not recommend that music be played during projection attempts, as music is generally distracting and can cause emotional responses and tension, which can ruin a projection attempt. But long-play recordings of rain or surf sounds, etc., are an acceptable alternative to white noise. Comfortable earplugs or headphones also help eliminate noise. Practicing trance exercises in fairly noisy places — say while watching TV — will, with practice, enable you to totally ignore any distracting noises, making projection possible even when total quiet cannot be achieved. Finally, since fear caused by the lack of suitable lighting is a major contributing factor to projection failure, I suggest that you use a night-light or lamp with a low-wattage bulb. Many people find themselves in gloomy darkness once they get out, and abort their OBE soon after the exit, simply because darkness makes everything appear sinister. Even a mild fear of the dark, added to the natural trepidation caused by being in the experientially unknown out-of-body environment, is a recipe for anxiety, fear, and a failed OBE. The very best way to overcome it is to project during daylight hours. Early morning, just after dawn, is probably the most suitable time for most busy or working people. By the way, the physical body's eyes must be kept closed at all times during OBE exercises and projection attempts. This may sound obvious to most people, but I've had a large number of queries over the years on this point. The projected double will gain real-time sight just before or during the exit. There is no need to open the projected double's eyes or do anything else after leaving the physical body. OBE or Lucid Dream The resting position of the physical body can affect not only the ease but the type of experience that will occur. This does not affect everyone, but it is definitely worth a mention. Many people, including myself, have difficulty projecting while lying curled up on their side. I must be either lying on my back or sitting in a chair, or any variation between these. For projection, I much prefer a recliner laid back about twenty-five degrees from the vertical. If I curl up on my side, in bed or on a recliner, I either fall asleep or have a lucid dream. For some reason, my body needs to be flat or upright for easy projection, although it does not seem to matter if my head rests straight or slightly to either side. I suspect the physical position needed for lucid dreams and OBEs may vary from person to person. This may play a significant part in early projection attempts, especially if the strength of this effect is unknown. If the resting position affects you as it does me, this could stop you from projecting. I suggest that you vary your projection position slightly after repeated failed attempts, or if falling asleep is a problem, just to see if this has any effect."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"75 19. Projection Technique Achieving conscious-exit projection requires learning a delicate mental and physical balancing act. This can be likened to a baby learning how to walk. A baby has to learn how to cope with gravity, body weight, and balance, and must coordinate many undeveloped muscles, nerves, and skills, all at the same time. The first few times babies try to stand, they totter and fall over because their brain does not know how to coordinate everything. Similarly, during early conscious-exit projection attempts, would-be projectors attempt to hold a deeply relaxed physical and mental state while trying to exteriorize their sense of body awareness, while also trying to deal with some pretty major energetic sensations. There are so many new things to do and adapt to, and these must all be done just right while so much else is happening, that it is very easy to lose control and fall back into the full waking state. Applying the skills that make up projection can take time. The brain learns to coordinate multiple tasks best through applied effort and regular practice. The more time spent trying to project, the better the brain will get at coordinating everything and the easier the whole exercise will become. Before you attempt any of the projection techniques in the following chapters, consult the training and development units earlier in this book. All the required terminology, background, and techniques are there. Projectable Body Loosening Projectable body loosening involves temporarily shifting body awareness outside the bounds of the physical body with simple awareness exercises. The following exercises are all designed to loosen up the projectable double. They also get the projector used to exterior body-awareness actions during a deeply relaxed and/or tranced state. While deep physical relaxation and trance are recommended for these exercises, they can also be done from a lightly relaxed state only and still make for good practice. The exercises are very easy to do and are capable of triggering an OBE on their own, so be prepared. If this does happen, or a partial projection is achieved, use the exercise that caused this as the basis for your main projection technique, or adapt and combine this with a similar method. With projection, if you do something that works, stick to it and build on it, as what works... works! Bounce Loosening Put yourself in the required state for projection with a deeply relaxed body and mind. Ideally, use the full-body deep physical relaxation and trance-induction techniques , then use the full-body energy circuit for a couple of minutes. Leave your primary centers alone for this exercise. Feel the room around you with your mind and imagination, and build a picture of it in your mind's eye. Using your memory, take note of how everything would look from your position if your eyes were open: where doors, windows, ceilings, walls, and furniture are. Take a good look and memorize everything before starting. Start a full-body awareness bounce action from head to feet , arms resting comfortably at sides (see chapter 12). Continue this until you are settled into a comfortable bounce speed and rhythm. Next, extend your point of awareness — the part of your awareness you are bouncing through your body — out past your head and feet until you are bouncing your awareness from the wall above your head to the wall below your feet, if lying down. If you are sitting, bounce from the floor, through your body, to the ceiling above you, then back down through your body to the floor. Repeat this as a continual bounce action. Adjust the angle of the bounce action so it is directly in line with your torso. As your awareness bounces off the wall, ceiling, or floor, use your memory-based imagination to sense what each surface would look and feel like close up. See this as if you were really there , right up close to it. Try to momentarily feel your new spatial position as it would be if you were actually there. Be aware of the spatial change and of the new position, of where your physical body, walls, doors, windows, and furniture are for that single moment as your awareness bounces off each surface. Create a snapshot of this new position in your mind's eye each time you bounce your awareness off a surface. Feel yourself being there, out of your physical body for just a moment. If you have trouble with this, stick small targets to the ceiling and walls and memorize what it is like to be up close to these targets. Re-create the image of these with your imagination in your mind's eye during these exercises. Before starting this, if you like, get up and place your face against these targets so you can really get the feel for each position. Memorize what it feels like to really be there. Momentarily re-create this feeling at the end of each bounce. Once you get the bounce action going, pay more attention to bouncing your awareness off the wall or ceiling than to feeling your awareness passing through your physical body. Once your body awareness is at work outside your physical body, the feel of your physical body must be allowed to slide gently into the background. The next stage is to bounce your point of awareness away from your body in line with your face, in line with where your eyes would be looking if they were open and looking straight ahead. If lying down, repeatedly bounce to the ceiling above you, then back down through your face to the floor beneath the bed. If sitting, repeatedly bounce off the wall opposite you, then back through your face and to the wall behind you. Again, once you get this bounce action going, allow the feel of your physical body to slide into the background and concentrate on the exterior bounce action. As I said, this bounce technique can trigger the projection reflex on its own. Bounce techniques are also useful for getting the look and feel of projection without actually getting too close to the exit. The bounce technique momentarily shifts your point of awareness outside your physical body, causing something like a brief, low-powered projection each time your point of awareness bounces off a surface. Repeat this exercise for as long as you wish, before continuing widi an actual projection attempt. Fig. 23. Two bounce actions for loosening the projectable double"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76 Breathing Loosening Put yourself in the required state for projection. Feel the room around you and take note of its spatial layout. Concentrate your awareness in your breathing action and feel yourself breathing slowly and naturally IN and OUT. As you breathe IN, feel yourself expanding outward as your lungs fill to capacity, as if your physical body were rapidly expanding outward like a balloon. Feel the room shrinking around you as you expand to fill it. At the end of the IN breath, try to feel your awareness filling the whole room to capacity. As you breathe OUT, feel yourself shrinking into yourself like a collapsing balloon. Feel the room around you expanding rapidly away from you as you get smaller and smaller. At die end of the OUT breath, briefly feel the spatial coordinates of tile entire room as being far, far away, as if you were a minute point of consciousness, a tiny spark in a giant, oversized room. Repeat this exercise for as long as you wish, before continuing with a full projection attempt. Spin Loosening Any body-awareness action that holds a point of awareness exterior to the physical body is extremely difficult to hold if kept in one place only. It is, though, fairly easy to hold a point of awareness if it is kept moving. Movement tricks the mind into momentarily accepting an exterior point of awareness. Put yourself in the required state for projection. Bounce your point of awareness, at eye level, back and forth to the wall or ceiling directly in front of you a few times. Move your point of awareness clockwise around tile room, briefly touching each wall, ceiling, and floor surface in passing. Circle the room continually, taking one to three seconds for each circuit. This speed can to be varied to suit what feels natural. As your point of awareness circles the room, feel it sliding and brushing gently over the interior surfaces of the room. Stay aware of your changing perspective in the room as your point of awareness spins around you. Feel yourself and your point of awareness spinning around the room. Try to feel your spatial coordinates changing around you, exterior to your body, as you spin. Feel yourself spinning inside your body, and feel the room around you moving as you spin. Settle into a steady spin at whatever speed you feel most comfortable with. If you continue this, your mind will at some point be tricked into believing you are actually spinning outside your body. When this happens you will feel a momentary falling sensation inside yourself, a brief sensation of vertigo that will usually happen many times while using this technique. This technique can trigger the projection reflex, so be prepared. Loosening with Imagination Please take your time over the following exercise. Do it slowly and thoroughly. Put yourself in the required state for projection. When you are really settled into yourself, imagine yourself as slowly getting out of your body and floating to the door of your room. Feel and be aware of your body still being in bed or sitting behind you as you float away. Move through your door, as if you were really projecting, and feel yourself floating away from your physical body and moving around the house, imagining as much detail as you can as you proceed. Look into a few rooms, then leave the house and walk farther afield. Go as far as your memory will take you with some accuracy. This imaginative view does not have to be perfect. Stop and briefly examine points of interest along the way. As you move, try to feel yourself actually being away from your physical body, being aware of where it would be in relation to your imagined remote location. This is difficult to hold, I know, but the movement helps, so keep moving your imaginary double at all times to ease the mental pressure. Moments will occur during this exercise when you will suddenly experience the feeling of actually being where you are imagining yourself to be. This will cause a momentary falling sensation, often accompanied by a trickle of energy up through your stomach and chest. This is a very good sign and shows you are successfully exteriorizing your awareness and are exerting a great deal of pressure on your projectable double. The trickle of energy indicates that the projectable double is being generated. Once you can imagine yourself as being out of body, you can also imagine yourself flying or instantly projecting to other familiar but remote locations, to other houses or towns. Imagine yourself floating up into the air and flying around. Imagine what this would feel like and what the world would look like from way up there in the sky. Imagine yourself instantly projecting to another place. Feel this new location, anywhere, appearing around you. To finish this exercise, see yourself projecting back into your room and watching your physical body as it awaits your return. Imagine yourself floating up to and reentering it. As you do this exercise, work on feeling yourself as being away from your physical body, and of seeing your imaginary re- created world as it would be through your projected double's eyes. This exercise can also trigger the projection reflex. If this happens during this particular exercise, you may feel projection sensations only remotely, as if from a distance. You may also feel nothing and just suddenly find yourself in your projected double, at the remote location where you are imagining yourself to be. Rope Projection Technique If you have worked through all the core skills and energy-work training units in this book, you will have learned how to use your awareness hands very well. Now is the time to put into practice all that you have learned, and use your awareness hands to climb out of your body. The rope technique optimizes the use of mental energy resources and enthusiasm by shortening the time needed to trigger the projection reflex during a projection attempt A key ingredient to the rope projection technique is an imaginary rope hanging down from the ceiling. This rope is used to exert strong and continual pressure at a single point on the projectable double. The hand-over-hand awareness action of Fig. 24. Spin loosening action"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"77 climbing the rope tricks the mind into accepting and holding a point of awareness exterior to the physical body. This stimulates the projection reflex more strongly than any other projection technique I have come across. The first step is to imagine a large, strong rope hanging down in front of you, just above your chest, in a natural position for you and for the position you are in. If you are lying down, imagine the rope end hanging over the center of your chest within easy reach of your hands. If you are sitting, imagine the rope hanging just in front of your face, with the rope end being firmly attached to the ceiling. The rope is within easy reach of your hands. Vary the position and angle of this imaginary rope to suit yourself as to what feels most natural. Center your awareness hands in the middle of your chest. Reach out with both of them and grasp the rope. Climb hand over hand strongly up the rope. Pull the rope to your chest with each climbing hand action. Feel yourself, in your projectable double, moving up the rope as you climb it. Stay aware of your physical body remaining behind as you climb out of it. Concentrate on the climbing action, but don't let your physical body respond or tense. Breathe naturally and do not hold your breath or allow it to become ragged. Hold your mind clear and focused solely on climbing the rope. Try to develop a powerful, natural, two-handed climbing action, just as you would if you were actually climbing a rope in real life. One hand reaches out while the other hand holds on. Both hands work together at all times. As one hand pulls on the rope, the other hand should be reaching out to grip the rope above it, ready for the next pull on the rope. Try not to use only one hand at a time. Using both hands together makes the rope technique easier to do and more effective. Vary the speed of the climbing action to what feels easiest and most natural for you, but do not climb too slowly. Just as with a bounce action, increase climbing speed until resistance is felt, then back off to a more comfortable speed. I find varying my climbing speed from about a half a second to one second for each completed hand action (reaching out and pulling rope in with each hand) is best for me. Feel your awareness hands as very strong and feel yourself climbing effortlessly and powerfully up the rope. Try to feel your projected double, your body, moving upward as you climb the rope. It is the exterior awareness of the climbing action that makes this technique work. The climbing action also provides a natural upward and outward movement away from the physical body. Some people may have difficulty bringing awareness hands all the way back to their chest with every pull on the rope. Some may find that one or both of their awareness hands do not obey orders. If this is the case, just do the very best you can to keep your hands moving and climbing and scrambling up the rope in any way you can. Ways of getting around many common rope-climbing problems, plus alternative projection techniques, are given in coming chapters. Many people have found it helpful to pin or tape a length of ribbon or string to the ceiling above their beds or chairs, hanging within easy arm's reach. Touch this occasionally until you get used to its position in your mind. The position and feel of the rope will grow in your awareness memory, making it easier to imagine yourself reaching out and climbing it with your awareness hands. Position your rope aid at the most natural and easy to imagine position for you. (This aid has one added bonus, if you are an animal lover — cats absolutely love it!) Rope Pressure Symptoms The first sign that the rope technique is working is a peculiar dizzy feeling, a localized energy-movement type of trickling vertigo in the pit of the stomach and in the chest. If you feel this sensation, the rope technique is exerting good pressure on your projectable double. Keep climbing and you will trigger the projection reflex — as long as you stay physically relaxed enough to allow the generation of the projectable double. As an experiment, try this short exercise now: close your eyes and take a few deep breaths to settle yourself, nothing more. Feel yourself reaching out and climbing strongly hand over hand up an imaginary rope for twenty seconds or so. Concentrate and really feel your awareness hands doing the climbing action as you do this. Use your memory and imagination to re-create the actual feeling of what it would be like to actually do this. You should feel something happening fairly quickly: a slight, localized dizzy sensation or trickle of energy in your stomach and chest. This is similar to the feeling you get when an elevator you are in suddenly starts moving downward. This slight vertigo and trickle of energy are symptoms your projectable body is coming under pressure from the exteriorized rope- climbing awareness action being used. When your body and mind are deeply relaxed and you are fully prepared for projection, the pressure caused by this action will be greatly increased and have a far greater effect. First Rope Projection — Experience For interest's sake, here is an account of my very first rope experience: I lay down on my bed in the early evening, just after sundown, thinking about the new rope technique I had been working on. I had been asked to develop a projection technique that blind people could use, specifically for people who had been blind from birth. I used the sense of touch as the foundation for the new technique, as touch and tactile perceptions are highly developed in blind people. I had, theoretically, discovered a new way of using this sense — tactile imaging, I'd called it — to exert enough pressure on the projectable double to trigger the projection reflex. It was just a working idea at this time; the next step was to road-test the technique myself to see if it could be made to work. The theory was sound and the technique should work, but was it practical? I did not do any relaxation, trance, or energetic stimulation work. I just wanted to see if the new rope technique would exert any noticeable pressure on my projectable double. I lay there for several minutes, mulling all this over in my mind while I relaxed and settled myself, ready for a short nap. Then I thought \"what the heck\", and decided to try the new rope technique out in earnest. The enthusiasm of discovery flared within me and I formed a very strong intention to project and give this new technique my very best shot. I reached out with my awareness hands and re-created in my awareness what a strong rope would feel like in my hands. I Fig. 25. Rope technique"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78 did not bother with fine details, just the bare-bones feel of holding on to something like an imaginary rope. That done, I began climbing the rope hand over hand in earnest. I immediately felt a strong sensation of vertigo in my stomach and chest. I also felt a bone-deep, tickling, dizzy type of sensation deep inside my body, most noticeably in my arms and legs. I cleared the excitement from my mind and focused all my attention on the rope-climbing action. It really seemed to be working! As I climbed, I felt a kind of energetic pressure building up inside me. I felt my body grow suddenly very heavy as I quickly slid into a solid level of trance. This was all happening way, way faster than usual. My head and chest were already starting to lift free, trying to go up the rope and follow the line of pressure I was exerting. I had never before experienced an exit quite like it! I kept climbing and my heart center began throbbing and vibrations started coursing throughout my body. I was simply amazed! I had been climbing rope for less than a minute! I kept climbing strongly and, quite suddenly, the projection reflex kicked in and my real-time double buzzed free, coming to rest floating near the foot of my bed. This had all happened so fast, I barely had time to register the changes in my body as I projected! The heaviness of entering trance, the heart center thrumming and then racing, the full-body vibrations, the exit, it all happened so quickly! I returned to my body soon after the exit and excitedly recorded the experience. This was definitely the easiest, fastest, and smoothest exit I had ever made. I tried the rope technique several times, that night and the next morning, and had no trouble leaving my body each time. It wasn't so much that the idea of climbing a rope as a projection technique was new — it's not. But the deliberate use of body awareness and the application of tactile imaging was something new. It was understanding how this worked that made it so important to me at the time. Projection Sequence It is not advisable to have only one projection sequence. Everybody has different levels of experience and natural ability. Circumstances also change; what helps one day may hinder the next. For this reason, I give three flexible rope sequences and suggest that these be alternated to suit the time a projection attempt is being made. For example, you might wake up early in the morning (the very best time for easy projection) and want to go straight to the rope technique. At other times, more work may be required to put yourself into a relaxed and projectable state. Full Sequence The time spent on each part of this sequence should be varied to suit ability, experience, and circumstances. Do not spend too long on each part if falling asleep is a potential problem. At least several minutes, however, should be spent on the deep physical relaxation part at the start — longer for beginners. I cannot overemphasize the importance of deep physical relaxation to the projection process. If you have never had a conscious-exit projection before, but have made several unsuccessful attempts, I recommend spending thirty minutes or more on deep physical relaxation. The secondary and primary energy work recommended in this procedure is an enormous help to novice projectors, especially those who have not yet made a conscious exit. Its practice makes projection much more achievable. The primary- center work can be dropped by more experienced projectors, if desired, but projection experiences will then tend to be weaker. With projection, energy is everything! Do the full deep physical relaxation exercise — ten minutes minimum. Prestimulate hands and feet and use the full-body circuit for a few minutes. Clear your surface mind and induce a light- to full-trance state. Raise energy and stimulate each primary energy center (don't overdo this). Return to raising energy with primary and secondary circuits as needed during the attempt. Loosen the projectable double with an exterior bounce technique (optional). Use the rope (or an alternative) projection technique and go for the exit! Quick Sequence The quick sequence is handy if you feel you have the energy to project but don't have the time or mental energy to go through the full sequence. Prestimulate hands and feet and use a full-body circuit for a few minutes. Run through the deep relaxation procedure only once. Induce a light-trance state only. Use the rope (or an alternative) projection technique and try for the exit! Instant Projection Instant projection is best used when you awaken in a deeply relaxed state, when vibrations are being felt, or when everything feels just right and you know you have a good chance of projecting. A good time for an instant projection attempt is when you have partially wakened in the middle of a nap, during the night, or in the morning, and are thus already deeply relaxed. Hold on to that deeply relaxed state, form a firm intention to project, and start using a projection technique. Whenever you feel vibrations — partial or whole body — immediately use your projection technique and try for the exit, no matter what you are doing or at what stage of your projection sequence you are. Whenever vibrations occur, especially whole-body vibrations, it is possible to project quickly and easily. All you need to do is make a firm decision to project, then use your projection technique. Put everything you have into this and you should get out of body very quickly. Remember to keep the projection experience ultrashort! Motivation The most important ingredients for any successful projection are enthusiasm and motivation. Without these, there will not be enough mental energy to succeed; you will either fail the exit or give up and fall asleep. It is thus very important to keep the preparation time for any projection attempt as short as possible, so it is not lengthy and mentally exhausting. One thing a new projector has in abundance is enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is pure mental energy. One thing that stands way out from all the success stories I have received is the word resolution. Resolution + Action = OBE Success. A great many people have e-mailed me over the years with projection success stories. In every case, they have been practicing the rope technique when they have suddenly decided to really do it! They have put"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"79 everything into their exit attempt and in the majority of cases have succeeded in having their first major conscious-exit projection, often on their very first attempt. This type of resolution can make that all-important difference. Make a firm decision, be brave and resolute, and just... do it! This will focus all your mental energy into a single, powerful, one-pointed effort, for a single purpose: to project out of your body! Tips and Summary Notes on the Rope Technique The feelings of localized dizziness, pressure, and energy movement caused by the rope technique should be carefully noted. Adjust your rope-climbing action with this in mind so it can be fine-tuned to have the maximum effect. If you have trouble with any part of the rope method, find the related training exercises and problem-solving sections in this book and review or practice them until you overcome the problem. Concentrate on maintaining a calm inner balance at all times during a projection attempt. Focus on climbing rope to the exclusion of everything else. Put everything you have into the climbing action and tune everything else out. Do not analyze or think about what you are doing! Watch your breathing and do not hold it or allow it to become shallow or ragged. Do nothing but climb the rope until you get out of your body. When the vibrations start, they may be localized to just one part of your body. If you focus your awareness on these vibrations, you will find you can move them, and may often be able to intensify and spread them with your awareness hands. The vibrations will respond to and follow body-awareness actions. I do not advise this during a projection attempt, however, as this will draw your attention away from the rope-climbing action. Stay relaxed and concentrate on your projection technique and the vibrations will spread naturally. They can be especially strong during early attempts — be ready for a huge buzz when they hit. Be ready for the racing-heartbeat sensation. This is a major event. It can be incredibly strong during early projection attempts, terrifying many people into aborting their long-sought-after first exit. Totally ignore this. It will not hurt you in any way. The heart center races to provide energy for the projecting double. It is not the actual physical heart that's racing. Also ignore sensations like head and brow pressure, no matter how strong or uncomfortable. The sooner you get out of your body, the sooner they stop. Ignore any noises or voices you hear before or during a projection attempt — no matter how real or loud they may appear to be. These are a type of auditory hallucination with no real substance. If you feel anything touching you or tugging at you, or even hands grabbing at you, ignore them. These are a type of tactile hallucination. None of these hallucinations can hurt you, but they can distract you — can break your nerve and focus — and lessen your chances for a successful projection, if you react to them. Keep all early successful projections ultrashort. Ten seconds out then jump straight back into your body. Please trust me on this! Your chances of recalling that projection will then be dramatically increased. A ten-second projection remembered is worth a thousand all-nighters forgotten! In many cases, just when the projection reflex is about to kick in, you might feel a sudden energetic surge rising through your stomach and chest area. This feels like a huge body rush of excitement. This sensation marks the moment of separation between the physical/etheric body and its projecting double. The projection reflex has been triggered and you are teetering right on the verge of the exit. You may or may not have experienced vibrations before or after this moment. Stay calm and try not to react to this sensation when it hits. If not handled carefully, this will throw you completely out of trance and back into the full waking state. If the above happens and everything just stops cold, leaving you groggy and tired, or maybe even partially or fully paralyzed, it is a pretty safe bet you have already projected. You have missed the exit due to the mind-split effect. Stay calm and keep your mind awake and clear; wait for your projected double to reenter. Return to the secondary full-body circuit at this time. Use this to keep your mind clear and occupied and awake until your projected double returns. The wisdom of keeping early projections ultrashort will now be demonstrated to you — if your projected double pays heed. If you feel vibrations but they just go away, and you find yourself groggy or paralyzed, again, chances are you have already projected and have missed the exit due to the mind-split effect. It then becomes a matter of trying to stay semiconscious until your projected double returns. It should not keep you waiting for too long, not if you kept the projection ultrashort. Be patient and try to recapture the projection during reintegration by keeping your mind clear. Full memories of the projection experience will flood into your mind during reintegration, if everything goes according to plan. Keep in mind that in some cases it is possible to find yourself buzzing out of body, or flying up a tube-type structure, with only very mild exit sensations being present, if any. In the majority of early projections, though, these sensations will be present and they will be major, so always be prepared for them. Some people have problems with the rope technique because they cannot stop visualizing the rope in their mind's eye. Some say they find themselves bumping up against the ceiling and cannot go any farther. Some feel a great pile of rope building up beneath them. The solution to any problem like this is simple: if visualization is causing a problem, then use visualization to create a solution. For example, imagine that a small hole beneath you is swallowing up the used rope. Or, imagine you are climbing through the ceiling and up into the sky instead of hitting the ceiling."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80 20. Technique Variations This chapter offers solutions to some common projection-related problems. It also offers rope technique modifications and alternative projection techniques that may suit some people better. I also find it helps new projectors if they try several different projection techniques during each projection attempt. This not only provides a much-needed variety of exercise for awareness hands actions, but helps prevent boredom. Using the same projection technique for long periods of time can become a trifle monotonous and may cause some projectors to lose interest or fall asleep. Also, the relaxation, trance, and energy work exercises can be done separately from an actual projection attempt. Go through the full sequence right up to the projection technique, then get up and take a short break to relax or refresh yourself. During this break, try to hold on to as much of the deeply relaxed physical and mental state as you can. Return to your bed or chair and spend a few minutes resettling and re-relaxing yourself, both physically and mentally. Once you are settled and ready, use the quick or instant projection method. If climbing the rope has a strong effect on you, the rope technique can be used on its own as a viable alternative to other trance-induction techniques. This can speed up the preparatory work required for a projection attempt. Variations on the Rope Technique One-Handed Rope: If one awareness hand does not appear to obey or feels weak or uncontrollable, the rope technique can be done with one hand only, using the hand that is most responsive. If you can manage it, have the weaker hand just hold on to the rope (as if the rope were slipping through the grip of the weaker hand), while the stronger hand does the real climbing. Feel the strong hand reaching out and pulling the rope toward your chest, then reaching out and pulling again, in a continual one-handed climbing action. Try reaching out much farther than your physical arms could. Imagine that your awareness arms are made of rubber and feel they are stretching way out as you climb up the rope. Chasm-Crossing Rope: Instead of a rope hanging down from above, imagine a strong, taut rope running across the ceiling of your room, in line with your body and just above it, within easy reach of your hands. This rope is firmly attached to strong brackets mounted on two opposing walls of your room. Feel your hands reaching out and feel yourself climbing along this rope, dragging yourself across the room toward the wall behind your head and out of your body. If you have a wall behind your bed and this puts you off, either change ends in the bed during projection attempts or imagine you are climbing through the wall. Hanging Rope: Another way to get around weak or uncontrollable awareness hand actions is to reach out and feel they are hanging on to a strong rope coming from above. Don't try to climb this rope; just feel yourself hanging on to it. When you get used to this, imagine you are being slowly winched upward by a helicopter, dragging you up and out of your body. Feel yourself being lifted and sliding out of your body, moving higher and higher. Feel yourself slowly leaving your body behind you. Feel your spatial coordinates in the room changing as you rise up and out of your physical body and through the ceiling. Water Ski Rope: Instead of a rope hanging from the ceiling, imagine you are holding the handle of a ski rope attached to a powerful speedboat in front of you. Feel yourself hanging on tightly to the handle of the ski rope, as if you were floating on your back, ready for a deep-water start. Adjust the angle of the ski rope to whatever feels most natural. Imagine you can hear the engine revving up, the excitement building, then suddenly the boat takes off and drags you out of your body in a flurry of astral spray. Rope Cargo Net: Imagine that you have a large rope cargo net hanging down in front of you, similar to the heavy rope netting used on military assault courses that is hung from poles to make a short, high rope fence that trainees have to climb. If sitting, imagine this heavy rope netting hanging in front of you within easy hands' reach. If lying down, imagine the net hanging from above you. Climb the rope netting in the same manner as described for the normal rope technique. With this method, it does not matter where your hands go, as they will always find a piece of rope to grab. Scramble up this net any which way you can, using hands and arms and legs and feet in any way that works to propel you upward and out of your body. This technique solves many awareness hands control problems, where they appear to have a mind of their own and flop and slide all over the place. Alternative Exercises and Techniques Washing Hands Exercise: Hold both awareness hands out in front and perform a washing action, as if washing your real hands and forearms with soap and water. Vary the speed of the washing action from slow to rapid and keep it at arm's length from your body. Steam Engine Exercise: Hold both awareness arms out in front of you. Imagine a circle whose diameter is the distance between your chest and hands. Circle your awareness hands around each other, following the outside diameter of this circle (something like the hand and arm actions if you were playing at being a steam engine). After a short time, the action will settle into a rhythm. Now, here comes the difficult part: after doing it for twenty seconds or more, stop and reverse the action. The awareness action momentum will force this circling to continue in its original direction, making it difficult to stop or change it. If you concentrate, you will find this can be achieved with effort. Don't worry if you fail to do this the first few times you try. Keep at it and you'll succeed. The difficulty of this exercise shows its training value. If you practice this regularly you will quickly gain better control and strength with all awareness hand and arm actions. This benefits all stimulation and energy-raising actions, including those used with projection techniques. This exercise can also trigger the projection reflex on its own. Look on this as a muscle-building workout for your awareness arms and hands. Big Wheel Method: An extension of the above method is to imagine yourself holding a large bicycle wheel upright in front of you. This wheel should fill the room, with its center hanging in space in the middle of the room between your physical body and the farthest point of the wheel from it. Prepare for projection. Feel a single point of awareness moving out from your body, from your head area, and flying upward and away from you. Push this point of awareness up and over the top part of the circumference of the big wheel, moving it all the way over and down and around and back to your body. Feel this point of awareness moving up through your body, through your base center and up through all other primary energy centers until it moves out through your head. Feel this point of awareness as being heavy and solid. Move your point of awareness around and around this big wheel until you build"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"81 up a steady rhythm. As with all bounce-type actions, vary this speed until you find the most natural speed for it. Feel the heavy point of awareness tearing upward through your body each time. You will notice as it passes through your body that this action slows, then speeds up again as it moves away from you each time. This momentary drag is caused by the awareness resistance factor that is encountered with any awareness bounce action through the body. It shows that this action is stimulating your etheric body as it passes through it. This method is quite powerful and will easily trigger the projection reflex if you can hold it reasonably steady for long enough. It does not matter if your point of awareness wavers or wiggles a bit from side to side as it circles the big wheel, as long as you keep it roughly under control and circling. Keeping it steady can take a bit of effort, but as with the above steam engine exercise, it is also invaluable for training the will to control exterior body-awareness actions. Ladder Method: A good alternative to using a rope is to imagine a strong ladder hanging from the ceiling. The lowest rung of this ladder should be within easy reach of your hands, or whatever feels most natural. Climb this ladder hand over hand, feeling yourself moving up the ladder toward the ceiling. Feel the room changing around you and your spatial coordinates changing as you climb. Feel yourself moving higher and higher up the endless ladder. If you imagine yourself reaching the ceiling, feel yourself climbing through it and beyond as if the ladder were infinite in length. Point Shift Method: Point shift is the most direct and powerful projection technique of all, although it can be somewhat difficult to learn. It requires a great deal of concentrated mental effort, in that projectors must hold their whole-of-body awareness image exterior from their physical body for some time in order to trigger the projection reflex. This is the technique I first learned and used for most of my early conscious-exit projections. Its difficulty accounted for many of the projection-related problems I had at that time. Despite this, it is extremely effective when mastered. It is well worth the effort of learning it; some people will find they'll take to it like a duck to water. I currently use a combination of rope and point shift for most of my projections. I start by using point shift, then when I am partly out, I include rope. I generally switch back and forth between these techniques many times during an exit. I find alternating techniques like this makes the exit easier and quicker. If I am projecting from a bed, I also use the rolling-out method (described later) to finish off the exit. First prepare yourself for a projection attempt in the usual way: Go through the relaxation, trance-induction, and energy- stimulation techniques, as per the full-, quick-, or instant-projection sequences — whatever is required. Feel and become aware of your whole body. Feel your body's spatial coordinates in relation to the room around you. Run your mind over where the doors, walls, windows, and furniture are in your room. Build a spatial map of this with your imagination, in your mind's eye, in your perception of yourself and the room around you. Using imagination powered by whole-body awareness, feel yourself rising or stepping out of your body, then floating or standing just out of arm's reach from your physical body. If you are lying in bed, feel yourself as floating at arm's reach above your physical body, staying in line with it and facing the ceiling. If you are using a chair, feel yourself as standing three feet (one meter) away from your physical body. Imagine, feel, and perceive as strongly as you can what it would feel like to actually be out there in front of your physical body. Hold your whole-body awareness firmly centered in your imagined exterior body in its new location. Do not try to see or feel your double as being above or in front of you; feel yourself as being above or in front of your physical body, from your projected double's perspective. This is tricky but will get easier with practice. Concentrate on sensing the changed spatial coordinates of the room around you from this new perspective. Feel and be aware of your physical body waiting behind or beneath you. Imagine and feel your projected double as already having separated from your physical body. Concentrate on holding your point of whole-body awareness inside your imagined projected double in its new location. Feel the pressure of your physical body trying to pull you back into it. Feel yourself fighting this pressure. Concentrate and use your strength of will to force your projected double to strain and fight against this pressure. Fill your mind with the single- minded, determined intention to project free of your physical body. Use maximum willpower, but do not allow your physical body to tense or respond in any way. If you are projecting from a bed, mentally grit your teeth (without tensing) and feel yourself slowly but forcefully rising away from your physical body. Force yourself to rise an inch at a time. Roll your projected double's shoulders one after the other and try to shoulder yourself higher and farther away from your physical body a bit at a time. Try to feel yourself rolling away toward the center of the room if that helps. If projecting from a chair, mentally grit your teeth (without tensing) and take one small but forceful step at a time away from your physical body. Step away an inch at a time, struggling against the force binding you to it. Feel this force steadily weakening in response to your efforts! Feel your imagined projected double's shoulders hunching and heaving and your head straining forward as you slowly but steadily tear through the force binding you to your physical body. Hold the above actions strongly enough and they will trigger the projection reflex very quickly. Do not allow your physical body to tense up while doing any of the above — this is the real trick to point shift. These are all imaginative body-awareness actions. Steam Method: Prepare for a projection attempt as normal. When you are ready, become aware of your whole body and of where it is in relation to the room around you, as in the above point shift technique. Imagine yourself becoming lighter and lighter, as if your body were turning into steam. Steam expands and rises. Feel yourself becoming bigger and lighter and, slowly but gently, rising up and out of your physical body. Feel your perception of the room changing as you rise higher. Stay aware of where your physical body is beneath you as you float free. Feel your whole-of-body awareness centered firmly inside your steam body and feel this as being just above your physical body and slowly floating free of it. Do not hold your steam body rigid. Encourage it to gently bob and sway about wherever it wants. This slight floating movement makes the steam method easier. Rolling-Out Method: Rolling out of body is a popular and reasonably effective projection technique. It makes use of a natural whole-of-body awareness movement — that of rolling over or out of bed — something you have done thousands of times. This method is especially useful if a spontaneous projection has already started, or if you find yourself partially stuck to your body during an exit attempt. When used as a main projection technique however, it leaves a lot to be desired, as it can be"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 difficult to cause a projection with this method from scratch. I consider this method best suited to assisting with difficult projections or for finishing off projections. Feel yourself rolling to the side, as if you were rolling over and out of bed. Repeat this action as many times as necessary. Get a whole-of-body awareness feeling into the body roll as if you were really doing it. Do not allow your physical body to tense or respond to this action in any way. Alternatively, if using a chair, feel the rolling action as if you were curling up and rolling out of your chair. Feel your perspective of the room changing around you as you roll. This technique is definitely worth a shot as a main projection technique if other methods have failed you. I find the rolling-out action also helps during difficult projections, say if I find myself glued to a part of my body, as occasionally happens if I have not prepared myself correctly. Rocket Method: Prepare for a projection attempt. When you are ready, imagine you are lying flat on the tip of a very large rocket. The bulk of the huge rocket is hidden deep inside a subterranean tube beneath you. Your bed or chair is firmly attached to the tip of this rocket and enclosed by an impenetrable glass nose cone. The ceiling and walls slowly fall away, disappearing all around you to reveal the stars. Feel the rocket rumble and tremble beneath you as its enormous engines fire and it slowly lifts off, taking you with it. Feel and imagine yourself slowly rising toward the stars with the great engines thundering beneath you. Feel the rocket's vibrations coursing through you and feel yourself rising out of your body and room and toward the stars. Stay aware of your physical body remaining where it is as you rise. Feel these vibrations increasing and spreading and coursing through your whole body, as the rocket blasts off and roars into the star-filled night. Boomerang Method: This technique uses a one-pointed bounce action from the brow center. It neatly overcomes the difficulties encountered when holding a point of body awareness exterior to the physical body, by using an awareness bounce action. This causes you to feel and see a brief flash of a new spatial location in your mind's eye at the end of each outward bounce action. This tricks your mind into accepting a momentary shift of a point of awareness to an exterior location. First, pick a target on the ceiling above your bed, or high on the wall opposite you if using a chair. This can be a light fixture or picture (anything) or you can affix a small paper target there instead. Stand on your bed, or stand on a chair (be careful not to fall!) and get the feel of what it's like to be right up close to this target. Lock the image of this target in your mind's eye. Get the feel of how the furniture, windows, doors, and bed all look and feel like from there while you are facing the target. Memorize what it feels like to be at the target area. Lie down or sit and prepare yourself for a projection attempt. Spend a little extra time stimulating your brow center, using the extra brow center stimulation method given earlier (see chapter 14). Hold your point of awareness firmly in your brow center, in your mind's eye. Bounce your point of awareness away and feel it touch the target, then rebound it back to your brow center in your physical body. Try to see this happening in your imagination, in your mind's eye. As you bounce outward and your point of awareness touches the target, for that single moment, briefly become aware of being at that location, as if your face were right up next to and facing the target. Feel this with your awareness and see it in your imagination, in your mind's eye. The details of this action do not have to be precise: A vague blurring feeling, the room changing and feeling yourself bouncing off the target, being there, with this perspective being momentarily highlighted in your mind's eye, is all that is required. As you rebound your point of awareness back to your physical body, feel your perception of the room suddenly change back to your brow center. Briefly try to see in your mind's eye your target across the room, as from the perspective of your physical body, from within your brow center and mind's eye. Once under way, this action causes a blurring in the mind's eye, with the target being seen and felt briefly from two different perspectives, from the physical body's brow and then from up close to the target, alternately. It is not necessary to keep close track of what happens between these points in the mind's eye. Feeling this change in your awareness and seeing it in your mind's eye is enough. Each bounce, in or out, should take about one second each way, but this speed should be varied to suit what feels natural to you. Repeat this process, continually bouncing back and forth between your brow center and your target, until the projection reflex is triggered. If you feel close to projection during this but it does not actually happen, change to another technique like rope or rolling out, to finish the exit. Driving Method: If you have ever been on a long drive, or spent a long time on a computer driving game, you may have noticed that later a shadowy but animated image of your long drive will be impressed into your mind's eye. This imagery will be much clearer if you are overtired as well. When you close your eyes and relax, the view you had, of that long road, and the scenery on either side unwinding toward you, continues to play in your mind's eye for some time. This often lasts for an hour or more if you have spent several hours driving. This effect can be used to trigger the projection reflex. All you have to do is relax and let this scenario play itself in your mind's eye while you deeply relax and allow your sense of body awareness to move along the road toward the horizon. Use the scenery to hold your mind clear of thoughts, aided by breath awareness if necessary. See the road and trees and buildings moving toward you and feel yourself moving toward them as the scene unwinds. In the back of your mind, feel your physical body being left behind as you drive toward the horizon and away from your body. If you can feel this forward awareness movement strongly enough, it can trigger the projection reflex fairly quickly. Two-Person Remote-Eye Projection Method: It is possible for a type of projection to occur while the physical body and mind are still partially awake (see chapter 5). To re-create a remote-eye projection under controlled circumstances requires some preparation and dedication. You must allow yourself to become extremely overtired, by missing a night's sleep, or by staying up very late until the wee hours of the morning, then waking your controller for the projection attempt. What is needed is not a normal level of tiredness, but a deeply relaxed state, both mental and physical, caused by overtiredness, the kind of tiredness that can make you literally fall asleep on your feet. Coffee and other stimulants should be avoided during the preparations for this experiment. When you are tired enough, lie or sit down in a comfortable position. You must not be disturbed by anything other than"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"83 your controller. For that reason, this experiment is best done fairly late at night — with the telephone off the hook. The other person, the controller, must talk to you and keep you just awake, but they must not overdo this or break your delicate mental state. The controller must also monitor you for REM (rapid eye movement) activity. The REM state is an important sign, because it indicates that you are entering the dream state while still awake. The REM state is easily detected by a continual flickering motion disturbing the eyelids. You must be gently kept awake and reasonably coherent throughout the entire experiment. The controller should gently wake you if you fall asleep, by talking to you and rubbing your arm, or even by lightly shaking you awake. You can aid this process by deliberately stimulating your brow center before and during this process. This same thing also happens if you force your tired eyes to stay open for part of the time, but your eyes must also be allowed to regularly close. If everything goes to plan, you should soon begin seeing things behind your closed eyes: patterns of light, colors, images, pictures, and scenarios. These will be hypnagogic images, lucid dreams, or clairvoyant visions, or a mixture of these. You must try to describe everything you see so that the controller knows what is happening. At some point, a part of you will project out of your body, and you will be able to give a running commentary of a projection as it happens. The mind-split will occur at the moment of separation, and your mental coherence will tend to weaken from this point. The controller must work on keeping you just awake and coherent enough to talk, but not so awake that your delicate relaxed state is altered. Perspective will often flicker back and forth between your projected and physical bodies, and even the dream state may become involved here. The heavy trance state (caused by deep overtiredness, brow center stimulation, and the partially awake state being forcibly held) can enable you to maintain a fairly stable visual connection with your remotely projected double. Once you manage to connect with your projected double, you will become aware of seeing through your double's eyes, but will not be aware of actually feeling yourself at that remote location, unless your physical body and mind are allowed to fall too deeply asleep. I suggest a tape recorder be used and turned on as soon as you begin seeing hypnagogic imagery. One of the best times to attempt a remote-eye projection is after a lengthy period of lovemaking, when a couple finds them selves deeply relaxed, maybe even exhausted, but still awake enough to be talking together in the early hours of the morning, when everything is quiet and there are no distractions. This is when spontaneous remote-eye projection is most likely to be experienced. If both partners lie talking in the near dark, with their eyes gently opening and closing, they can keep each other awake and both try for a remote-eye projection. The first one to succeed should become the subject, and the other the controller. Helping Other Projectors Out While I have heard many rumors to the contrary, I do not believe it is possible to directly assist another person out of body. I have tried many times and it does not seem to be feasible. In my opinion, if this is remembered at all by the subject, it will be sense-interpreted as a direct psychic attack, which is extremely unpleasant. It is possible , however, to awaken sleeping real-time projectors while they are out of body. When natural sleep projection occurs, the real-time body drifts out of its physical body and hovers just above it, often mimicking its sleeping position. The real-time projectors in this state are asleep, just as their physical bodies and minds are. A helpful conscious projector can then try to help by gently waking the person from real-time-zone sleep. Sleepers who can be made to focus and realize they are projecting could then interact with or become a travel partner for the conscious projector. Whether awakened projectors remember their experience or not after the event will remain to be seen. All the factors that make projection difficult to remember are still there, and still need to be overcome by awakened projectors. Without the skills necessary to project under their own steam, remembering an experience like this will be a difficult proposition at best. The best chance for success would be if the awakening comes before the sleeping projector has fallen into a deep sleep. The original projector can then instruct the other on how to maximize chances of remembering that projection. But this is still a very hit-and-miss thing. I have tried this many times with sleeping real-time projectors and, while I have managed to awaken and travel with quite a few, none so far have remembered it after the fact. As a side note, over the years many people have reported feeling hands dragging them out of their bodies, or touching them in some way during spontaneous projection exits. I suspect these people were already at least partially out of body at this time, hovering close to their sleeping physical bodies without realizing they were already out. The hands they felt may have originated from overzealous friends or even from helpful spirit beings; it's very hard to say for sure. This may also be a tactile hallucination generated by the projector's own subconscious mind, which I think is the most likely scenario. If anything like this happens during a projection (and this is quite rare, I might add), I suggest that you clear your mind of fear and go on with your projection regardless. Conscious-exit projections are way, way too precious to waste, especially in the early days while you are still learning to get out and about. You must not allow yourself to be fooled or tricked into aborting successful projections for any reason. As with all common astral noises and voices, once out of body nothing will ever be found that might have caused the original worrying sensations or problems. Look upon this type of event — as worrying as it may be at the time — as a true test of bravery. If you don't like what you find when you get out, you can always turn around and dive straight back into your physical body. This is not only the fastest and easiest way to abort a projection, but it also gives you firsthand experience with the conscious exit and reentry, which is invaluable. It also helps to keep firmly in mind during the exit — spontaneous or deliberate — that nothing can truly hurt a projected double. The original copy of mind and all memories are always safely tucked away inside the physical/etheric body, which cannot be destroyed and is not vulnerable to interference or possession merely because it is projecting. In my opinion, the physical/etheric body is far more protected during an OBE than in the awake or normal sleep state. There is really nothing to fear but fear itself."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 Calling and Meeting Other Projectors Many people have asked me how to project to, or meet, other people or projectors. I have found the most reliable way is to call the target person just before the exit. When you are in the trance state and/or close to the exit, imagine your target person. Everyone has a distinct essence of personality. This feeling can be used to tune in to and locate other people. Hold the image of your target firmly in mind and call his or her name several times, voicing this strongly in your mind. If the target person is asleep or out of body, he or she will usually hear and appear just before the exit, or be waiting close by when you finish getting out of your body. He or she will often reply audibly. This is not an actual voice, although it sounds real, but is a telepathic transmission that is heard with a kind of clairaudience, or astral hearing. If you have real-time or astral vision at this time, you may also see him or her in the room waiting for you, usually a little perplexed about why he or she is there, often not realizing he or she is out of body. If this fails, repeat the above process after the exit out of body. First, move at least twenty feet (six meters) away from your physical body , then call out to the target person aloud. Another way to target people is to tune in and project to them using the instantaneous-travel method (see chapter 24 ). Simply tune in to them and feel yourself moving toward them. This will cause you to shift to where the target persons are. None of these methods will be truly successful if you do not know the target person fairly well. Do not expect to be able to project to famous personages or to people you do not know well. On that note, it is also extremely difficult to project to people you do not like, or who do not like you. A certain level of harmony is required to make an astral connection and rendezvous. The target does not have to be living, but projecting to a deceased person's spirit is far more difficult than might be expected. If a spirit person is targeted, you may find yourself shifting to an astral level, usually one of the spirit worlds, where you can interact with your target. Your energetic makeup, development, and projection skills will have a lot to do with whether or not you are successful. Alarm Clock Aid Many people find it easier to project if they set their alarm clock an hour or two before their normal waking time, then attempt a projection. The physical body is already deeply relaxed and heavy with sleep — trance state — making projection much easier. (If you have to get up for work at a set time in the morning, I suggest using two alarm clocks to avoid oversleeping, one for projection and one for work.) Another use for an alarm clock is to use the snooze button for short projections. This is also a handy way to get around some mind-split effects by limiting the time of a projection. Set your snooze button to gently wake you at ten- or fifteen- minute intervals. When the alarm goes off, hit the snooze button and attempt a quick projection, going straight to your projection technique each time. Every time the alarm wakes you, hit the snooze button and try to recall a projection, in case one occurred, then repeat the projection attempt. The longer you do this the more chance you'll have of scoring a hit with a remembered projection fragment. As soon as you remember something, write it down. It helps if you have the alarm clock, pen, and notebook within easy reach, so you will not have to disturb your relaxed state too much while using them."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85 21. Projection Exit Problems The problems besetting new projectors are many and varied. With any recurring OBE exit problem, it is important to isolate the cause and take remedial steps sooner than later, or interest may flag and the goal of wake-induced OBE never be realized. Taking prompt action also avoids the possibility of becoming negatively conditioned by a problem, making the exit more difficult than it should be. Out of the thousands of projection exit problems I have advised on over the years, it is clear that several main problem areas exist. The following sections offer some advice on overcoming these. Climbing Problems Some people find they have difficulty using awareness hands climbing actions. Usually, one awareness hand will seem weaker and less controllable than the other, and will continually slip away from the rope or ladder, which makes everything more difficult. This problem may also affect stimulation and energy-raising actions. Persevering with awareness hands and energy-raising actions will progressively help overcome this type of problem. The more often awareness hands are used, the stronger and surer they become. Alternatively, some projection methods given here require no complex awareness hands actions. Find what works best for you and what has the strongest effect on your projectable double. Stick to what works and build on it. Using a combination of techniques that do not require awareness hands actions is probably the best way to overcome climbing problems. Torso Energy Surge The torso surge is not unpleasant. It is much like the surge of emotional energy and excitement you'd get if you suddenly won a million dollars. But it can be very distracting. Just as the projection reflex begins to kick in, a strong falling sensation combined with an energetic body rush surges upward through the stomach and chest area. The strong energy-movement sensations caused by the torso surge appear to come mainly from the lower primary energy centers. My theory is that the moment the projection reflex is triggered, some primary energy centers strobe powerfully, temporarily creating a delicate network of new energetic connections throughout the physical/etheric body. This new network creates the energetic conditions that allow projection to occur. Energy flares throughout this new network as the projection mechanism internally generates the projectable double, before its expulsion out of the physical/etheric body. The torso surge is not to be confused with the racing- heart sensation or the vibrations that are also commonly experienced during the exit, although these appear to be energetically related. The torso surge is an extremely visceral sensation and can be very difficult to overcome. It is felt within the physical body as if it were a physical sensation. It causes an immediate tension response within the physical body that causes a breach of relaxation and trance discipline, and hence projection failure. Expect this sensation to hit right on the verge of the exit. Stay calm and do not allow yourself to react to it. The physical reaction can be controlled, as long as it is not too strong. This sensation is a perfectly normal part of the projection process, and will not hurt you. The surge is far stronger during early projections, and progressively eases the more often you attempt conscious-exit projection. A side effect of projection attempts, even failed ones, is to cause widespread energetic development, as well as development of the projection mechanism. If the energetic surge is too strong to ignore, and leaves you gasping and wide awake every time, spend more time raising and working with energy during regular training sessions. This work is best done separate from actual projection attempts. If the problem continues, it would also be worthwhile to familiarize your body with a similar sensation. Seek out a highspeed elevator and spend some time in it, getting used to the sudden falling sensation every time it starts down. Close your eyes and relax while doing this and allow the sudden movement to catch you by surprise. Another way would be to spend some time on amusement park rides, especially roller coasters. For the more adventurous, skydiving, high diving, bungie jumping, or water slides may help. The physical body quickly becomes accustomed to anything it experiences regularly. The effects of the torso surge will then be lessened as the sudden tension response of the physical body to it will be reduced. Cobwebs — Energetic Sensations Cobwebs are a very common and well-known sensation — a serious problem for some people — associated with trance and energetic development. This sensation of localized tickling, itching, or stinging is usually felt on the face and neck, varying in intensity from a slight tickling or itching to a more intense stinging sensation on the skin. The most common place to get cobwebs is on the face, especially around the mouth and nose. In rarer cases, cobwebs can be experienced in other places and over much larger areas of the physical body. You can expect to get cobweb sensations at some time or another. Severe cobweb problems are quite rare, and appear to be symptoms of energy blockages and narrowed energy pathways in the connecting circuitry on the surface of the energy body, felt in the skin of the physical body. Cobwebs are caused by energy movement through the myriad smaller energy centers and connecting pathways that cover the entire body. The most common cobweb sites correspond with acupuncture points and major nerve endings in the facial area. Cobweb sensations will normally reduce only gradually as the energy centers and their connecting circuitry develop to handle the greater flow of energy caused by the trance state and projection attempts. Some cobweb activity usually is present in people with a strong or more than usually active brow center, even if the brow center is undeveloped. The face contains a powerful and complex energetic support structure for the brow and crown centers. Any increased energy flow through this structure causes at least some cobweb sensations to be felt there. The stronger the energy flow in this area, the stronger the sensations it causes. This continues until the support structure develops enough to handle the increased energy flows required by these higher centers. Even if the facial support structure and the brow and crown centers are all fairly well developed, some cobweb activity is usually still felt, especially when these higher centers are being"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 actively used during the full-trance state. The NEW secondary system helps to reduce cobweb sensations by progressively developing the circuitry of the energy body. Specific problem areas such as the face should also be targeted and deeply massaged with a suitable awareness action, brushing or wrapping, to nurture the development of those areas. Keep in mind here that rectifying serious cobweb problems can take time. Please be patient and work through this problem until it improves, and don't give up on OBE just because of it. I recommend that cobwebs be ignored as far as possible, but if they become unbearable you can scratch them. If you do, take care to move slowly and deliberately, and scratch them in a dreamy, relaxed way, so that you do not break your relaxed physical and mental states. When I get cobwebs, I look on them as a test of my concentration and ignore them totally. They usually fade after a few minutes, but occasionally I have had to scratch an intensely itching or burning one, just in case it is a feeding mosquito, which has often been the case. It is therefore wise to spray your room before trance sessions and projection attempts, to eliminate this possibility. I have come across very few people with really bad cobweb problems. In rare cases, cobweb sensations can cover the entire surface of the body. This feels, or so I have been told, like a horde of insects crawling all over your body, which sounds unbearable and probably is. Conscious-exit projection becomes impossible under these circumstances. I suggest concentrating on relaxation techniques, meditation, and energy work until the blockages in the energetic circuitry clear. Once these areas are more developed, cobwebs sensations will lessen. Primary Center Pressure Mild to intense pressure sensations are sometimes felt in the head as a result of primary energy center activity and energy movement during trance work or projection attempts. These are natural sensations, caused by some of the higher functions of the brow and crown centers, as these grow out of dormancy. Ignore pressure sensations as best you can. They are a good sign that these energy centers are responding to the stronger energetic flow caused by development exercises and projection attempts. Pressure sensations, especially when localized to the brow center, indicate clairvoyant potential. Pressure is rarely intense enough to cause actual pain, but it will often be extremely uncomfortable. Intense episodes of pressure are unpredictable and infrequent. They are more often experienced by novice projectors who have done no significant energetic development before their projection attempt. Localized Pressure Localized brow center pressure feels much like a thumb being firmly and steadily pressed into the center of the forehead. This is felt either in a small area in the center of the brow or in a larger circular area covering the whole middle of the forehead. This can vary from mild to intense pressure, and can last for several minutes or longer. More rarely, a small area of intense thumblike pressure is felt in the center of the top of the head. This last sensation is related to crown center activity and development. Tight Band around Head This feels much like a leather belt tied around the head being slowly tightened. Pressure is felt around the entire circumference of the head, in a wide band level with the brow, and all over the whole top of the head, including the whole forehead, as if the whole head were bandaged too tightly. This top-of-head pressure sensation is caused by crown center activity. Brow and crown pressure sensations are related and will often occur together. More rarely, the facial area will also be involved; this feels like the entire skull is coming under pressure. Energy center pressure can be quite uncomfortable, even painful at times. Although this is rare, it can spark strong headaches, even migraines if you are prone to them. Actual pain will be more frequent if the brow and crown centers are being worked on more than the rest of the energy body, which I do not recommend. If pain becomes a problem, the best solution is to stop all stimulation and development work. Take a break and allow everything to settle down. This may take several days or more. You can work around problem areas with energetic development exercises, but this may still cause some pressure pains to occur. In all the cases I have come across like this — including my own experiences — crown and brow center pressure pains progressively reduced once regular energetic development exercises were undertaken. You must stimulate the brow and crown centers very gently in the early stages of development. It is very important not to overwork them, especially if strong pressure sensations are being experienced. A lot of time and patience may be required to gently and safely bring these centers out of dormancy. Breathing Problems Pressure is sometimes felt in the chest and throat and feelings of choking or even asphyxiation can result from this. This can feel like you are not getting enough oxygen, or as if you are forgetting to breathe during a projection attempt. The chest and throat pressure is normally caused by primary energy center activity, but the lack-of-oxygen sensation often has another cause. Sleep apnea, a fairly common sleep breathing disorder, causes a person to stop breathing many times while they are asleep, and to gasp for air when their lack of oxygen becomes acute and wakes them. This problem is not caused by projection attempts, but is a preexisting medical condition that has not been noticed. During trance work or a projection attempt, the physical body is put to sleep while the mind stays awake. Any sleep breathing problems become much more apparent during this time because the mind is awake and thus notices them. One"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"87 possible solution to this problem, if it is not too severe, is to adjust your trance work or projection position so your head is tilted further back and your airways are held more open. Even a slight change in position can make a big difference with breathing problems like this. Please consult a medical doctor if you feel you have any type of sleep breathing disorder. These conditions, while treatable, can be dangerous if left unattended. Smoking, drinking, and being overweight worsen them. Improving the health of the physical body usually cures the condition. Stuck to Body during Exit Some people at times experience feeling themselves glued to a part of their body during an otherwise successful exit, usually at their stomach, head, or legs. This appears to be caused by an incomplete projectable double being generated, resulting in only a partial projection. There are several possible reasons for this. Heavy protein meals eaten before projection attempts appear responsible for many partial-separation problems. It takes a lot of energy to digest food; the heavier the meal, the more energy is diverted into bioenergetic digestion processes. The energy body will virtually shut down for an hour or more after a heavy meal of any kind. After this time, just having a large amount of undigested heavy protein in the stomach can cause energy centers in that area to become sluggish and unresponsive to the projection reflex. The sub-navel storage center is also situated near the lower stomach area, and energy flowing to and from this important center may become restricted while the stomach is busy digesting a heavy meal. Trying to force primary energy centers open during a projection attempt in this case can cause varying levels of discomfort, cramps, and even pain during the exit. This is easily overcome by not eating such a heavy meal so late, and by cutting down on the amount of heavy protein eaten, especially in the last meal before bed. Exit Cramps and Pain I have had many reports of varying levels of cramping and pain, from mild to severe, in the stomach or chest — and more rarely, in other areas — during projection exits. I have also experienced this myself on several occasions. The action of pulling yourself out of body using a climbing technique can sometime cause internal cramping and tugging sensations, as if the stomach, heart, or lungs were twisting and cramping. This is directly related to the projection attempt. For example, each pull on the rope can be found to cause a painful internal tugging sensation that stops as soon as the climbing action causing it is ceased. This can be quite uncomfortable, even painful, if you continue trying to force yourself the rest of the way out of your body at this time. This problem appears to be caused by inactivity in a single part of the energy body. This interferes with the generation of the projectable double in a single area. There are many possible causes for this. One possibility is continued projection efforts after a successful separation has already occurred. Continued projection efforts after projection has occurred is likely to cause problems for the etheric body, which cannot normally leave the confines of the physical body. The solution is to stop and look for projection-related symptoms. If you've felt vibrations or the torso energy surge, or if partial or full waking paralysis is present, or if some degree of real-time or astral sight is present, the chances are you have already projected. You must now await the return of your projected double. If this appears to be the case, it is worth trying to contact your projected double. Reach out with your feelings and attempt to feel yourself inside your projected double, imagining you are already out of body. This will often result in a telepathic connection and an instantaneous transfer of memories from the projected double. If you manage this, remember to still keep the projection short. Try to reenter your physical body well before it can fall into the deep-sleep state. Jewelry and Watches Gold, jewels, and other solid metal objects can interfere with the generation of the projectable double. I learned many years ago, through experience, that wearing watches, rings, or neck chains caused me problems during the exit, as well as during trance and energetic work. I have also had many reports of jewelry and watches causing problems and pain during otherwise successful projections. One young man reported severe pain in his tongue during several otherwise successful projection attempts. He was a fairly experienced projector and had never had problems before this. The pain always started as pressure in his tongue that quickly became painful and spread through his jaw and neck, becoming more and more painful as he continued toward the exit. The pain became so bad it caused him to abort each projection during the exit. I questioned him thoroughly and it came to light that he had recently had a gold stud inserted through his tongue, with the wound not being quite healed. He did not see how this could possibly interfere with projection, but, on my advice, removed the gold stud and successfully projected later that same night with no recurrence of the pain. Along similar lines, a young female projector recently reported to me that she had experienced intense pain and pressure in her chest during a conscious-exit projection. She was forced to abort her projection attempt. On her return, she found her pet rat asleep on her chest, where it normally slept. The presence of the pet rat on her chest appears to have been the cause of the pain and pressure she felt during the attempted exit. The projected double can pass through solid metal and gem-stones with ease. The presence of them on the physical body during projection attempts however, appears to interfere with the generation of the projectable double, which causes the projecting double to become stuck to its body at that area. For some reason, this also causes pressure and discomfort during the exit. This appears to affect some more than it does others, but every thing points to the presence of gold, jewelry, and other items on the physical body causing problems during the exit. It is possible that gold fillings, false teeth, and other solid items may also cause problems for some people. If you feel localized pressure and pain during projection, it is worth taking a good look at the affected area to see if any item is present that could possibly be causing it. The variable energetic makeup and"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88 levels of development of individual projectors may cause a wide range of seeming inconsistencies, with particular projection- related problems affecting some projectors and not others. Magnetic North? The direction the physical body faces during a projection attempt does appear to have an effect on the ease of the projection exit for some people — and every little bit helps. I prefer to have the top of my head pointing north if I am lying down, but if I am sitting up I like to be facing either north or south, although this may just be a foible of mine. But I have projected many times while facing east and west, lying down and sitting up, and experienced no noticeable difference. While direction does seem to have an effect on some people, it does not affect everyone equally and will not stop a determined or experienced projector. I suggest that new projectors experiment with the direction they face and see for themselves whether it makes any difference. Lunar Cycle The lunar cycle also seems to have an effect on projection exit difficulty levels, as well as on the frequency of spontaneous projections. I find the best time for OBE to be the week surrounding the full moon, with the first night of the full moon being my prime projection time. Although I have projected on every day of the month, all year round, I feel the urge to project more strongly during a full moon. Some people appear to be more affected by the lunar cycle than others. I suggest that projectors check the lunar cycle against their successful projections, especially spontaneous ones. It is also worth checking this against lucid dreams and patches of vivid dreams, as opposed to uneventful dreamless nights. This will give a clear indication of the best time of the month for them to project, and whether or not the lunar cycle is affecting them. The moon factor may also contribute to or cause many common projection difficulties like cramps and pains and partial exits, especially when there is no moon at all. Saliva Problems Many people have problems during trance, development work, or projection attempts with either an excess of saliva, necessitating continual swallowing; or a lack of saliva, causing a dry throat and mouth. Both conditions can be very distracting and will interfere with conscious-exit projection. If your mouth and throat tend to become dry during development exercises or projection attempts, first make sure you have had enough to drink before beginning so you are not becoming dehydrated, especially if you live in a warm climate. The only other thing that could cause dryness is breathing excessively through the mouth. The solution is to breathe more through the nose. Make sure the nasal passages are clear by blowing and clearing them beforehand. A slight change of position may also help if your mouth tends to fall open naturally. Snoring can also cause dry mouth and sore throat problems. When the physical body is put to sleep during the trance state and projection attempts, it often begins to snore on its own, even though the mind of the projector is wide awake. In many cases projectors will not be fully aware of this, especially if they are having problems and drifting in and out of the sleep state. The solution is to restore the sleep deficit so that falling asleep is less likely, and to change the resting position of the physical body until a position is found that does not promote snoring. If excessive saliva tends to build up, try not to think about it. Thinking about it causes you to become more aware of your mouth and tongue, which, in itself, can cause an increase in saliva flow. Avoid sweet drinks, tea, or coffee, and anything that leaves a flavor residue in your mouth that may cause saliva to flow. Brushing your teeth and using a saltwater mouthwash, then rinsing with fresh water, helps rid the mouth of unwanted tastes. Prop yourself up slightly higher if lying flat; this will help slow the tendency for saliva buildup at the back of the throat. Keep your mind off of it; swallow normally whenever you have to, in a relaxed and dreamy way. Swallowing, or moving the body to ease it, must be done at times, even during trance work and projection attempts. Minor movements like this can be done without breaking relaxation and trance disciplines, as long as they are done slowly and in a dreamy and relaxed way. Sexual Arousal Sexual arousal is a less common problem that is related to energetic activity in the lower primary centers, specifically the genital primary center. This can be very distracting, for obvious reasons. The solution is to spend more time raising and working with energy, separate from projection attempts, so the energy body can develop to the point where an increased energy flow from or through the genital center will not cause arousal. If a sex partner is available, having sex before a projection attempt can help alleviate this problem. If a sex partner is not available, imagination can be used to serve this purpose. Many people have asked whether having sex before a projection attempt will interfere with it or not. Some worry that sex may drain the energy body and make projection more difficult until it has replenished itself. In my opinion, sex before a projection attempt has more positive than negative aspects to it. Sexual fulfillment greatly eases physical and mental tension by promoting energetic balance and deeper physical and mental relaxation. It causes a lingering warm energetic glow and a state of well-being, which can be a great help with projection, especially with early attempts, as energetic balance and deep physical and mental relaxation are essential ingredients for successful projection. The main reason people think sex is energetically draining, I think, is because most people have sex at night before going to sleep. The deeply relaxed state experienced during the aftermath of sex, especially if people are already tired, will usually tend to make them fall asleep very quickly. If this is the case, I suggest you use the quick or instant projection methods to take advantage of the situation before the need to sleep becomes too urgent."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"89 In some cases, however, sex energizes people and they have trouble falling asleep for some time afterward. In this case, sex may be temporarily detrimental to projection. On the other hand, this is a very good way of temporarily overcoming tired-ness so a projection attempt can be made before the onset of sleep. When projecting after sex, though, remember to keep the projection very short, as the physical body will tend to fall into the deep-sleep state much more quickly than usual. Defective Astral Vision Defective astral vision occasionally causes problems during or immediately after the exit. I'd say about ten percent of all new projectors will encounter some kind of vision problem during their first few exits. The most common vision problems are blurred vision; one eye not working; having to squint and strain to focus; tunnel vision; partial blindness, and full blindness. The cause of all OBE vision problems is a lack of energy flowing into the projected double from the physical/etheric body. The projected double is pure energy, generated and maintained for the entire projection by the physical/etheric body. The energy flowing into it gives it life and greatly affects its functionality and abilities. The most effective method I have found to overcome vision problems is to draw energy directly from the physical/etheric body during the projection. This is quite simple to do and very effective. Use your awareness and feel yourself drawing energy from your physical/etheric body. If you can, use your imagination to see a flow of sparkling energy coursing into you. You don't have lungs and do not have to breathe while out of body, but you can use the remembered feeling of breathing to aid with this process. Re-create the feeling of breathing IN and of drawing in energy, feeling yourself sucking energy from your physical/etheric body and feeling energy flowing into your projected double. This will create a strong energetic demand in your projected double that will cause a flow of energy from your physical/etheric body to fulfill it. Once you get the hang of the energy-drawing action, you can draw extra energy into your projected double anytime you have need of it. Keep in mind here that the more energy the projected double has to operate with, the stronger and more vivid will be its experience, and the stronger and more vivid will be its memory. Here are a few more ideas and solutions that have helped other projectors with vision-related problems. All of these are done while out of body. • Ask for your sight, speaking aloud if possible, and you'll often get it. • Use your creative ability to imagine and feel light all around you. • Create a lit torch or a lamp and use it. • Use the instant travel method and shift to a well-lit destination. • The room you are in may actually be dark, so move to a well-lit room. • Leave a lamp or nightlight on while you are projecting. • Leave a lamp on in another room and shift into it after the exit. • Project during daylight hours. Disorientation and Subtle-Body Misalignment Weakness and disorientation are sometimes experienced after an OBE , especially if it has been too lengthy or has been abruptly ended. This can happen even if the conscious exit has been missed and the projector has become aware some time after the exit. This malady is popularly believed to be caused by some kind of subtle-body misalignment, where the projected double has not correctly realigned itself within its physical counterpart during reentry and reintegration. Many people today believe the projected double is a perfect copy or template of the physical body, containing a subtle copy of all internal organs. The \"body inside a body inside a body\" theory is popularly used to illustrate the way subtle bodies can separate from the physical body and hold consciousness exterior to it during an OBE. This illustration looks good on paper and does effectively show part of what happens, but it is not a workable theory when applied to some of the more complex energetic aspects of projection. Subtle-body misalignment is not, I think, a reasonable or logical explanation for weakness or disorientation following a projection. According to my understanding, the projectable double is internally generated by the etheric body, then extruded as an energetic point of consciousness that contains within it a reflected copy of consciousness. The body of the projectable double, when observed, is created and shaped by its own sense of whole-body self-awareness, but only when it or parts of it are deliberately observed. When the projected double reenters, it reintegrates with its original physical/etheric self, downloading its shadow memories in the process. The energetic substance of which the projected double was composed then effectively dissolves back into the physical/etheric body. It turns back into the raw energy from which it was made. This raw energy is instantly reabsorbed back into the vitality storage areas of the etheric body. It is believed that the astral body is simply enmeshed within the physical body during its waking state, and that it is released to pursue an out-of-body astral existence whenever its physical body sleeps. Some people even claim that the astral body is capable of becoming misaligned with its physical counterpart while in the full waking state. The reasons stated for astral-body misalignment are many, but usually involve improper or too-abrupt reentry. Some psychics and healers actually blame a patient for having OBEs at too early a stage of development, even though this may be spontaneous and totally beyond the patient's control. I think this line of reasoning has spawned a blanket excuse — astral-body misalignment — that is used whenever a psychic or healer cannot work out what is actually wrong with his patient. A more reasonable blanket explanation would be bioenergetic conflicts involving the etheric/physical interface. My reasoning here is that any subtle-body problem capable of affecting the physical body must logically stem from the etheric body. This is the closest subtle body to the physical body, energetically speaking, and therefore has the greatest effect on it."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90 22. Overcoming the Mind-Split A lifetime of projection experience, exploration, and research leads me to believe that mind-split effects are the largest contributing factor to OBE memory failure. This problem is complicated by many subtle factors, many of which can be overcome fairly easily with a little understanding and preparation, plus a few tricks. I call memories gained during any kind of out-of-body experience shadow memories. They exist for some time after reintegration, in energetic form, waiting to be triggered through mental associations into living memories. While in the shadow state, memories are extremely delicate and are easily lost, behaving much as dream memories do. If shadow memories are not downloaded into accessible levels of consciousness during the reintegration of the projected double with its physical counterpart, they cease to exist; it is as if the experiences that caused them never happened. Remembering an OBE is the most fickle part of any successful projection. To reiterate: When the mind-split occurs, a full copy of consciousness and memory stays resident inside the physical/etheric body at all times. This, the original master copy, is fully capable of independent thinking if it has the energy and training to hold itself awake. But it normally becomes semiconscious and falls asleep soon after the mind-split occurs. The copy of consciousness that was reflected into the projected double is completely independent. It is energetically generated, projected, and maintained, exterior from the physical/ etheric body. Once the mind-split occurs, it records its experiences separately. But even though the real-time double has successfully projected and is awake and aware, the physical body is left lying there, also fully aware, but usually unaware of its successful projection out of body. The projector just lies there, disappointed and heavy with trance, often partially paralyzed and pondering another seemingly failed projection attempt, maybe even going on with projection attempts that all too soon give way to sleep. The short time spent pondering a seemingly failed projection attempt is enough to form a solid memory in the physical brain for that time period. This memory thus becomes the strongest resident memory for that time period. During reintegration, shadow memories for that same time period will have a hard time overwriting these. The resident memories may be very short, dull, and boring, perhaps only a couple of minutes' worth, but these will easily replace hours of exciting shadow memories. The physical/etheric body's memories have a much stronger and more immediate connection with the physical brain. Its memories are automatically recorded as they happen and thus make more of an impression upon it. When the dream mind becomes active, it tends to weaken the integrity and coherence of the projected double. The etheric body then has to energetically support another functioning copy of consciousness , its physical body's dream mind. This causes a general weakening of all exterior copies of consciousness and all energetically recorded shadow memories. This can have a pronounced effect on the shadow memories of the real-time and astral doubles, which seem to be last on the list during reintegration. Dream memories can be very strong and immediate, and will often overwrite or mix with real-time and astral memories. Because of this, shadow memories for most people are usually remembered only as disconnected bits and pieces floating in a sea of unrelated dream fragments. Fully conscious out-of-body projection requires the physical/etheric body to be in a light-to-normal sleep state, or in the trance equivalent. Successful reentry and reintegration requires the physical/etheric body to at least partially awaken, or the projected double becomes effectively locked out of its physical body until its physical body wakes, which may take all night. During the several hours or so that a projected double can be locked out of its physical body during a normal night's sleep, it too will eventually fall asleep, as its higher-dimensional aspects are projected or become active. These higher aspects operate at much higher levels of consciousness than the physical mind or its real-time double does, and these higher aspects may only be vaguely aware they even have a physical body to return to. The thought of returning to the physical body in an attempt to salvage high-level shadow memories may be an extremely low priority to these higher aspects. As I said in the beginning of this book, I believe that the key that allows for reliable, planned, and repeatable projections out of body lies in the relationship between OBE and physical memory storage at the base level of consciousness. My research points to the key factor for successful shadow memory downloading being a small and previously unrecognized element of the trance state, something that happens naturally in those hazy few moments between the sleeping and waking states. This element is a simple flickering of consciousness. This flickering happens when the projector's almost- awakening consciousness briefly flickers between the sleeping and waking states before waking completely. This flickering can allow shadow memories to successfully download into accessible levels of memory during reintegration. While consciousness is flickering between these two states, the physical brain's memory storage vaults lie wide open, waiting but not recording. This provides a brief window through which the physical brain can receive a full shadow memory download. Miss this window and — chances are — no shadow memories at all will be downloaded into accessible levels of the physical brain. The projector then has to rely on something triggering the shadow memories before they vanish completely. Some people seem to have a natural inborn OBE memory key and can download a higher-than-average percentage of their shadow memories with very few problems. These lucky people, however, are few and far between and cannot tell us how they do it. Neither can they tell us why others fail when they diligently copy what appears to be the very same process. A well-controlled and stable trance state is not the key. The nature of physical memory storage in the human brain is to record only one set of memories for any single time period. An active mind, even during a controlled trance state, will block the shadow memory download from the projected double during reintegration. Tantalizing clues to solving the OBE memory download problem can be found when it is considered that deliberate reentry into the physical body can be extremely difficult, if not downright impossible, once the physical/etheric mind falls into the deep-sleep state, or enters the trance equivalent of it: the deep-trance state. The key to unlocking and using this briefly open memory-download window lies in knowing exactly how long it will be before a projector's waking consciousness starts to flicker. Reentry and reintegration should be timed to coincide with this hazy"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"91 flickering moment. Shadow memory loss can be minimized by creating this flickering state deliberately, by causing consciousness to flicker at regular intervals during the course of a projection. This provides brief windows through which potential shadow memory downloading can occur. It is quite difficult for the average person to re-create this flickering state without losing control and falling asleep. Synchronized timing is the best way to overcome this difficulty, done from both within and without the physical body. The projected double and its physical/etheric counterpart must work together. An attempt can then be made to coordinate reentry and reintegration at times when this window is known to be open, with the mind being artificially caused to flicker at prearranged times. The bottom line here is that the key to a successful and reliable OBE is for you to develop the ability to work with your projected double during planned projections, rather than leaving shadow memory recall to the fickle winds of chance. Working around the Mind-Split You can do several things to work around the mind-split and minimize OBE shadow memory loss. All tricks aside for the moment, improving and exercising the ability to recall dream and OBE memories is an important step in this learning process. The physical brain is capable of recalling significantly more shadow memories if it has some practice at doing this. The more often shadow memories are recalled, the easier recalling them becomes. Shadow Memory Trigger Phrases Recalling dream memories trains the mind to recapture shadow memories. Doing this is quite easy and takes only minimal time and effort. Each morning, as soon as you wake up, spend your first couple of minutes pulling back the previous night's shadow memories. Sit up on the side of your bed with your feet on the floor, or sit in the bathroom, and reach out for shadow memories and pull them back. Set your mind in search mode, as you would for some small fact you have temporarily forgotten. Keep searching and trying to pull them back, even if your mind feels a total blank. The memories are there, they just have to be triggered and dug out. Use the trigger phrases given below, over and over. • I felt these awesome vibrations and then...? • I buzzed out of my body and then...? • I floated across the room and then...? • I passed through the wall and then...? • I looked at my hands and they...? • I was just about to...? • I was inside...? • I was talking to...? • There were lots of...? • I was flying over...? • I was with...? • I saw a...? You can make up many more phrases yourself. These must be related to something you are likely to be doing while dreaming or projecting. After a planned projection, use trigger phrases related to primary mission goals. You may think you failed the OBE mission, but there is a good chance that you succeeded and just lost the memory during reintegration. Push the trigger phrases with your mind. Reach out and feel for shadow memory fragments in your memory as you say them to yourself. With each trigger phrase, imagine yourself doing what the trigger suggests. Adopt the attitude of having forgotten something you know well and are scanning and searching your memory for. Confidently expect it to pop into your mind at any moment. Try to imagine what it would be like to come out of your body while still awake. Imagine the vibrations, the rapid heartbeat, the falling sensation, then floating up and out as you buzz out of your body. Put some effort into this, and re-create it in your mind's eye as if it had really happened, because chances are it did. Say the trigger phrases out loud if you like, as this can help with the recall process. Once you can lock onto a single fragment of shadow memory, you have the key to finding and unlocking many more. This fragment may be of a projection, a lucid dream, or a dream. All are valuable, and any type of shadow memory recall makes for good practice. Concentrate on these fragments. With a little effort, your mind will start finding more and more shadow memories associated with them. Soon, the memories will start flooding back into your mind. They might be garbled and disjointed, but now they are real memories. You can sort them out and deal with them later. Some shadow memories are always accessible! You just have to trigger them, lock onto them, and drag them back, sometimes kicking and screaming. If you practice daily, your shadow memory will become progressively stronger and its memories will become easier to recall. After the initial recall attempt, for the next few hours keep a small part of your mind searching in the background as you go about your affairs. Real-life events, words, and thoughts will often provide mental associations that will cause shadow memories to surface. When a shadow memory fragment is triggered, write it down, then spend a few moments pondering and strengthening it, trying to expand upon it and find other shadow memories related to it. Keep a small notebook and pen handy. If you do not write them down or pay attention to them immediately, shadow memories usually vanish again fairly quickly. Persevere, be patient, and work at this over the long term for a few minutes each day. This is especially helpful if you seem to be continually missing the exit, with projection sensations just fading away at the last moment."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92 Recording Keywords It is important to record keywords and phrases as soon as possible after locating shadow memory fragments. Recalled shadow memories can feel vivid and substantial and you may think, \"Wow, I'll never forget this!\" but most likely you will, a few moments later. Shadow memories are transient by nature and are very easily lost. Immediately record shadow memories as soon as they surface. It is not necessary to write a complete account, as this may take too long and cause you to forget more than you record. The first thing to do when you locate shadow memories is to vocalize the experience immediately, mentally or out loud. This will help hold them long enough for you to write them down. Keep talking until you get the keywords down. Just jot down a few words and phrases to cover the memories. Once this is done you can relax and flesh them out later, using these fragments to trigger more associated memories. The more often you work at recalling and recording shadow memories, the better you will get at it. Eventually it becomes second nature. I advise you to make this a lifelong daily habit. I have been doing this for more than twenty-five years. When I wake each morning I can now skim through most of the OBEs, dreams, and visions I've had during the night, and choose any important and interesting ones for recording. Apart from the incalculable spiritual life path value I have gleaned by monitoring my dreamtime, I frequently dream innovative solutions to current real-life problems. I have learned to depend on this for guidance and inspiration. I also occasionally dream movie-length sagas. Apart from being thoroughly enjoyable (better than the movies), I have recorded some of the more interesting ones and plan to write novels based on them one day. Reentry Trigger Words and Phrases It is a great help if the projected double holds the memory of its out-of-body experience strongly in mind during reentry. To help with this, use a trigger phrase or a keyword that represents the projection experience. Pick a couple of the most memorable and interesting events from the projection and make up a short phrase to encapsulate the experience. Hold this trigger phrase firmly in mind and shout it during the reentry into your physical body. For example, during a short projection you watched your hands melt before passing through a wall, saw its inside structure, then flew over your house in the rain and came back through your roof and reentered your physical body. This can be represented by the keywords wall, rain, flying, roof, or by easier-to-remember theme trigger phrases like melting hands, flying in the rain, through the wall, or over the roof. Holding a single trigger phrase strongly in mind and literally shouting this during reentry will greatly facilitate the downloading of shadow memories into accessible levels of memory. Position and Comfort The position and comfort of the physical body during a projection directly affects the ease of staying awake and aware, and of sleeping only lightly if sleep does come. Sitting in an armchair or being propped up in a bed with several pillows, you will find, does not encourage deep sleep, or will at least slow down its onset. Being very slightly uncomfortable helps to hold the mind more alert during projection attempts. This also helps lengthen the in-between sleeping and waking state, creating a flickering semiwaking state for slightly longer than usual, which is invaluable for early, ultrashort, conscious-exit projections. Trance State Familiarity It is important to develop the ability to hold a comfortable level of trance and to be able to function within it. This must be done without falling asleep too often or too deeply, and without falling into too deep a level of trance. The longer you can hold your physical/etheric mind awake in the trance state after a successful projection (which may seem like a failure at the time) the longer your projected double can stay out of your body. This also makes the projected double stronger during this time, making for stronger and more vivid experiences and shadow memories. This alone increases the chances for successful shadow memory downloading during reintegration. If you tend to fall asleep quickly after a projection attempt (which can be quite lengthy and exhausting during early attempts) you will usually fall into a deep sleep fairly quickly. Your chances of remembering a projection are then sharply reduced. If you can hold yourself semiawake, flickering for just a few minutes longer, you can use this time with good effect. If, when you get out of body, you discipline yourself to return and reenter your physical body fairly quickly, knowing roughly how long you. are able to hold yourself semiawake, and both you and your projected double work along with this, you will have more chance of a successful reentry and a full shadow memory download for that experience. Even a brief conscious-exit projection lasting ten seconds is an extremely valuable accomplishment. It provides firsthand experience and makes projection real! The length of subsequent projections can be gradually increased, but the first successful, deliberate, conscious-exit projection and reentry is the most important one of all. This is the one that gives you something real to build on. Astral Sight Exercise Experimenting with astral sight is very interesting and valuable. Apart from its developmental value, it helps keep you awake and aware in the physical/etheric body for an extended period of time after the exit. Some degree of real-time or astral sight (seeing through closed eyelids) usually manifests just before or during a successful projection exit. If the physical/etheric body perseveres after a projection attempt, even if it seems to have failed, it also often gains this ability. The resulting point of view can be moved to observe the entire room without any corresponding physical movement. This is not only a fascinating exercise of the etheric body, but it also enables the use of another shadow memory reclamation technique: using astral feedback to download shadow memories directly into the physical brain. Concentrating on observing the room around you through closed eyelids and on improving your control over this ability helps keep you occupied and awake enough to help with reintegration. The use of real-time or astral sight improves steadily with practice. Even if you can't see much of the room around you through your closed eyelids, you will usually see something. This can vary from hypnagogic imagery to complex astral visions."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"93 You may see nothing but faint sprinkles of light. Whatever you see, observe it and play around with the focus of your eyes behind your closed eyelids, trying to bring whatever you see into sharper focus. This will help activate and improve astral sight, or at the very least occupy you until your projected double returns for reintegration. Never open your physical body's eyes or move your eyelids to check if your eyes are open or closed. Relax and trust that they are closed. If they are open your eyeballs will quickly dry out and you'll be forced to blink every few seconds. If you do not feel the urge to blink, trust that they are closed and that you are seeing with real-time or astral sight. Conscious Reentry I've noticed over the years that successful reintegration with a full memory download works much better if reentry into the physical body is done consciously and deliberately by the projected double. This must be done before the physical body falls into the deep sleep state. During an OBE most projectors become so engrossed with their new state of being, and with exploring the potential of their new environment that they forget all about their waiting physical body. They never think about reentering their physical body until they are reeled back into it when it finally wakes up, usually several hours later and with no shadow memories. They assume that they will never forget the powerful and memorable experience they are having. Assuming that an OBE will be remembered — forgetting the mind-split and the fickle nature of reintegration — is a sure-fire way of losing the memory of an experience altogether. Ultrashort Projection A consistent factor in the majority of OBE success stories I have received from people I have coached is that these projectors have listened to a simple but extremely important tip I have drummed into them. They kept their first projections ultrashort. They made a deliberate reentry into their physical bodies shortly after their exit. I cannot emphasize enough the importance and effectiveness of this. Novice projectors simply must return to their bodies before their physical/etheric mind loses track of things and falls into a deep sleep. This is the only thing that will overcome the beginner's lack of skill, discipline, and experience. That first successful fully conscious exit and a fully conscious reentry, even of an ultrashort ten-second projection, is of paramount importance to all beginners. It makes OBE achievable and experientially real to them. It fuels enthusiasm for future projections. This knowledge and firsthand experience significantly affects their personal belief system, making a lot of other things possible, empowering all aspects of future training and development. It takes a lot of mental energy to hold the mind of the projected double focused during an OBE. Most projectors only have a few short minutes, if that, before they lose focus and control over their experience and miss their prime chance for downloading shadow memories. Every minute that passes during an OBE makes it harder for the projected double to focus and function coherently. Discipline yourself to return to your body very soon after you achieve the conscious exit. For a first-time projection especially, get out, move twenty feet (six meters) away from your body, and get your sea legs; breathe in what it's like to be out of body, take a quick look at your hands and watch them melt, then dive straight back into your body — shouting your trigger phrase as you do! Then, get straight up and write down what happened. Lock those precious shadow memories into your brain! A successfully remembered ten-second projection is worth a thousand all-nighters forgotten! The most important thing for all struggling beginners is to experience that first fully conscious exit, to feel what it's like to be out of body, then to experience a fully conscious reentry. Nothing else matters! Do not attempt to do anything else the first few times out of body! Please trust me on this point and keep your early projections very, very short. You can slowly increase OBE time as you get better at making conscious reentries and downloading shadow memories. Counting Koalas Counting koalas (or any other animal or item of choice), \"One koala, two koalas, three koalas, four koalas\", etc., can be a great help during early short projections. The physical/etheric mind must begin counting as soon as it experiences projection- related symptoms, like vibrations and rapid heartbeat, and suspects that a projection may be in progress. The projected double must plan to do exactly the same thing. It must plan to reenter its physical body at a predetermined count, say at a twenty- koalas count — no longer with early projections. The physical/etheric body and its projected double must work together to make this method work. All the projected double has to do is float or dive back into its physical body at the agreed-on count. The rest of the reentry is a reflex action. The projected double must firmly hold its OBE success in mind and shout a trigger phrase as it makes its move for reentry. I suggest that the physical/etheric mind be allowed to relax and flicker, be allowed to start falling toward sleep when it gets to the twenty count, ready for reintegration. This will keep the physical/etheric mind focused and awake for the required length of time, and create a strong relationship between physical and OBE memories. Both aspects of the projector will be counting in sync and both will be attempting or expecting reentry and reintegration at around the same time. Both must work together on this. The physical/etheric mind will be expecting its projected double to return shortly after the twenty-koala count, so it can watch itself carefully for the torso energy rush and slight falling sensation that signal the reentry of its projected double. At the twenty count, the physical/etheric mind should stop counting and relax, holding its mind clear with breath awareness, while allowing itself to drift toward the sleep state. This creates the flickering of consciousness needed for a successful reintegration and shadow memory download. This flickering state should hold the physical/etheric mind aware just long enough for it to feel the energetic reentry sensations when they occur. These sensations will jolt it back to full awareness, hopefully with a full load of shadow memories. Once this has been done successfully, the koala count can be steadily increased to the limit of the ability of the physical/etheric mind to hold itself awake while counting."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 Keep in mind here that the projected double's memories may, or may not completely replace the physical/etheric memories, for that time period during reintegration. If projection is successful and this appears to have occurred, there may be no memory at all of the physical/etheric side of this joint projection effort. If the projection is successful, take it as read that this technique worked. If the projection fails, try to work out what went wrong, and keep trying until you master it. It is also well worth using the memory-recall trigger phrases and putting your mind on search after an apparently failed attempt, in an effort to pull shadow memories back to a conscious level of memory. Running Commentary and Affirmations Another valuable device that aids shadow memory recall is to keep up a running verbal commentary during projection. Talk all the time during the OBE, describing every little thing being done, seen, and experienced. This commentary helps strengthen shadow memories and makes them easier to recall after reintegration. It also helps if, at the end of the description of each item, action, or scene, you regularly reaffirm that you will remember everything. Firmly say, \"I will remember all this!\" as an affirmation to help cement that memory into the subtle energetic brain of the projected double. Planned Missions Plan projections and get into the habit of sticking to your plan. Have primary, secondary, and tertiary mission goals, and focus on these during the projection. Make these mission goals achievable within a realistic time frame so time out is not overly long. Apart from making projections more productive, this also gives the projected double something definite to focus on during each OBE, and gives the physical/etheric mind some idea of what its projected double has been doing during each projection. This last is a significant help when trying to recapture shadow memories, allowing far more specific trigger phrases to be applied to the trigger-phrase recall process. Working with the Mind-Split There are a few ways to use the mind-split to advantage, to help cement shadow memories into the physical brain during a projection, especially during reintegration. Three energetic effects are strong enough to be useful for this purpose: astral feedback, reentry torso energetic surge, and the reentry falling sensation. Astral Feedback Download To use astral feedback for a memory download, discipline yourself, once out of body, to attempt an immediate connection with your physical/etheric counterpart before it drifts away into sleep. Both sides must work together on this, and agree that the projected double will stand or float in a particular place in the room near the physical body, but no closer than seven feet from its physical body or it will usually get sucked back into it. It must try to telepathically and visually connect with its physical counterpart. The physical/etheric aspect must also reach out and try to connect with its projected double, using real-time or astral sight if these abilities are present, or reaching out with its feelings if these abilities are not present. The physical/etheric side must trust that its projected double will cooperate and be in the target area, and must reach out with all its available senses. Its projected double should be in the target area doing exactly the same thing, if everything is going according to plan. The projected double is out there somewhere nearby. With connection, all its shadow memories will come flooding back into the physical brain. An emotional connection, if made first, may cause an uncomfortable feeling of presence and anxiety on both sides. Stay calm on both sides and this feeling will not escalate. If it becomes too strong, the projected double should leave the immediate area, putting some distance between itself and its physical/etheric counterpart. It can return and try again as soon as astral feedback pressure subsides. The best way to develop real-time and astral sight is to use it as regularly as possible, so that even if this connection fails it is still a beneficial exercise. Keep in mind that, once located, the projected double may look quite different from the physical body. It is usually younger and slimmer than its original, but it may also look a little ghostly. Once both sides of the mind-split connect, projected and physical memories transfer both ways. If all goes well, this causes dual but solid memories for that single time period. Once a connection has been made, the projected double must back away from its physical counterpart within a few seconds or risk nauseating astral feedback. A connection will energize both physical and projected minds. This energy will allow a longer-than-normal projection while still enabling good control and strong shadow memories. Still, keep the rest of the projection fairly short, under two minutes, or risk losing the memory of the second part of the experience entirely. If contact can be managed without adverse side effects, with astral feedback being used to download shadow memories into physical memory storage, the projected double can return regularly during the course of a projection — say every couple of minutes — and reconnect with its physical counterpart. This will allow the duration of a projection to be lengthened considerably. Regularly reconnecting in this way allows the physical brain's memory to be topped up with the latest set of shadow memories each time. These memories will be stored in the physical brain as solid and easily recallable memories. As soon as the projected double begins experiencing reality fluctuations, I suggest an immediate reentry. This is a sign that the dream mind is becoming active and that the physical/etheric body is falling into a deeper level of sleep. If the projected double tries to weather severe reality fluctuations, it runs the risk of losing the experience from that moment onward. It may also miss out on making a conscious reentry, which is a real buzz in reverse. Reentry Torso Energy Rush When the projected double returns and reenters its physical counterpart, it causes a quite noticeable energetic surge upward through the physical body, especially strong in the stomach and chest. If the physical/etheric body is even partially awake"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"95 during reentry, the energy rush will jolt it back to full awareness. It is an upwardly moving, surging, tingling, energetic sensation very similar to the torso energy surge felt during the exit. It starts and finishes very quickly, taking from one to three seconds depending on the speed and smoothness of the reentry. A tingling adrenaline-type of energy rush moves rapidly upward through the legs and lower body, then spreads rapidly up through the stomach and chest before stopping abruptly. If you have felt projection-related sensations earlier, the reentry sensations are a certainty that the projected double has returned and reentered its physical body. This is the prime time to reach out and reclaim shadow memories. Reach out with a strong feeling of having just forgotten something, and use the shadow memory recall trigger phrases. If you are lying prone in bed, sit up, put both feet on the ground, and put some real effort into recalling the projection. The memories are there, just beneath the surface. You just have to reach inside and trigger them. Once you locate a fragment, a whole set of shadow memories will flood back into physical memory. If the projected double reenters the physical body deliberately, it can do a great deal to help with a successful shadow memory download. As with the exit, one of the biggest problems with reentry is that the projected double feels a huge, tingling energetic surge. It tingles with energy and feels a dizzy falling sensation as it is drawn rapidly back inside its physical body. These heavy sensations can easily break its concentration. In a way, it momentarily blacks out as it gives way to these sensations at the critical moment of reentry. The projected double must hold its awareness of being out of body very strongly in the forefront of its mind during its reentry. When it begins the deliberate reentry process, it must not give in to the wave of energetic sensations associated with reentry and reintegration. It must continue thinking and concentrating on being aware of what it has been doing, which is projecting out of its body. I always suggest, for every conscious reentry, that the projected double hold a trigger phrase firmly in mind and shout this as it dives back into and reunites with its physical body. This vastly improves the chances of carrying shadow memories back into conscious levels of the physical brain. Reentry Falling Sensation People often feel noticeable falling sensations while they are trying to fall asleep. This may happen several times before falling asleep, and will often cause people to gasp and catch the sides of their bed, as if to stop themselves from falling. It happens to most people who spend any length of time hovering on the verge of sleep, flickering between the waking and sleeping states. This sensation is caused by a brief projection exit and reentry. If great heaviness and lethargy are felt immediately after the falling sensation, or if real-time or astral sight becomes evident, then a projection has most likely occurred and is in full progress. If you catch the side of the bed and come immediately awake, a full reentry has most likely been experienced. There are often no other noticeable projection-related symptoms associated with this type of semisleep type of projection. The projected double slips out very easily if conditions are just right. This is a natural type of sleep projection exit and the conscious mind is not involved, being briefly asleep and out of the equation. No heavy exit sensations are therefore generated by this type of projection exit. If the falling sensation is felt, know what has caused it and immediately use shadow memory recall techniques in an attempt to recall the OBE. Hold the intention firmly in mind that if you find yourself out of body, even if only briefly, you will immediately dive back into your body, shouting a trigger phrase as you do. This might only yield a brief memory of a spontaneous OBE, but it's an easy way to gain some type of projection experience, and is definitely a very good start if you are new at OBE. If you are prone to the falling sensation, you might want to experiment by holding yourself awake longer than usual, hovering and flickering between the waking and sleeping states. An easy way to do this is to hold your forearms straight up, elbows resting on the bed. Your hands will start falling to the bed whenever you fall asleep; this will wake you up each time. This extends the time spent falling asleep and the number of times you will fall asleep. This increases the chances of capturing the memory of a brief out-of-body experience of some kind. Return and Reentry Many people worry about getting lost, or of not being able to get back into their physical bodies after a projection. According to my experience and all that I know, the silver cord cannot be severed, and the projected double cannot be permanently held or locked out of its physical body while the physical body still lives. The projected double can usually return to its physical body at any time during an OBE, simply by feeling for its body and the room around it. This transports the projected double back into or close to its physical body. However, there is one notable circumstance that can make reentry into the physical body difficult, if not temporarily impossible. If, when the projected double returns, the physical body has entered the deep-sleep state, the projected double can find itself temporarily locked out of its body, which can cause it serious anxiety, as it may believe its physical body has died during its absence. I have experienced this myself, and have advised many people to whom this has happened. This is the only circumstance, as far as I am aware, that can interfere with the automatic reintegration process. It can be a terrifying experience. The physical body will feel cold, clammy, and lifeless to the touch of its projected double. In all cases where this type of experience has been recorded, some physical event or noise — e.g., an alarm clock or telephone ringing — has caused the physical body to awaken soon after the projected double has begun to worry. This event wakes the deeply sleeping physical body, thereby reactivating the reentry mechanism and allowing the projected double to successfully reintegrate. Shadow memories from cases like this always contain a strong emotional content (often terror) that immediately floods into the physical mind as it flickers into wakefulness. This forces the complete recall of a very unsettling experience, of the type most projectors would much rather forget — which is quite ironic, really. This type of experience usually leaves the projector emotionally unsettled and disturbed, often with a long-lasting or permanent dread of any type of OBE. The very best advice I can give to anyone finding themselves temporarily locked out of their body is to trust that this is"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 quite normal and will not hurt you. Go exploring or return to the astral planes and enjoy the time you have left out of your body. You may not remember much later, but that doesn't matter, so enjoy it while you can. The most important thing here is that you don't panic. Death is a fairly extreme event, to say the least. Even if you had died peacefully in your sleep from a heart attack or something, you surely would have been at least momentarily awakened while taking your last gasping breath. If you have indeed passed away during an OBE, then there is nothing you or anyone else can do about it. However, staying calm will help you a great deal if you really have suddenly deceased. This will spare you a lot of torment and distress and will make your passing easier for you to deal with. If you look around yourself, thinking you might have died, and see no religious figures or angels, spirit friends, or deceased relatives, and no tunnel of light or anything out of theme with a normal real-time projection, chances are extremely high that your physical body is just in a deep sleep. If this is the case, it will wake up shortly none the worse for wear, as long as you don't panic and make things worse for yourself than they really are. Flicker Tape Reentry Technique The flicker-tape reentry method was designed with an eye to applying mind-split theory to overcome mind-split problems. This is particularly useful if early projection attempts are continually failing, with projectors falling asleep and having no way of knowing whether they were successful or not. I recommend that you record a simple tape to wake you very gently. This works much better than any other type of alarm. Tap a pencil lightly on a table once per second for five seconds and record the sound. This is the first level of awakening noise. This should be followed by a ten-second period of silence. Follow this with a slightly louder tapping-noise segment, once per second for five seconds, then another ten seconds of silence. This should be followed by a light chinking noise, created by tapping a pen on a glass or china cup once per second for another five seconds, then another ten seconds of silence. After this, progressively increase the level of noise, varying its source (table, china, glass, metal, etc.) in five-second segments with ten second gaps of silence, until you are rapping a spoon onto a metal saucepan fairly loudly — loud enough to definitely wake you up. A child's xylophone or recorded bird songs — anything you like — can be used to create a more interesting flicker tape. Once you have this tape made, the volume can be set to what is just right for you. To find the perfect level of noise that begins to wake you, have someone else wake you using tapping noises, as shown above. Get them to monitor your reactions carefully, especially facial expressions and movement for signs of waking, for the signs that you are flickering between the waking and sleep states. This will give them some idea of what level of sound is required to wake you. Recording this process will yield more accurate results, as this information can then be applied to making the real flicker tape. Projected Double's Part Once out of body, stay at least twenty feet (six meters) away from your physical body, if possible, to stop yourself being accidentally reeled in. If you feel pressure dragging you back into it, fight it and force yourself to move quickly away. Alternatively, have another clock in a nearby room that is synchronized with the one next to your physical body. Watch this clock and move back to reenter your body at the appointed time. Carefully keep an eye on the time and make sure you return to your body in ample time to watch the clock as it nears alarm time. Be prepared for a conscious reentry the moment it goes off. Be aware that your physical counterpart has probably fallen into a light-to-medium sleep, possibly even into a deep sleep. A successful, deliberate, and conscious reentry is now entirely up to the projected you. One clock should be placed in such a position that the projected double can easily see it while standing or floating near the foot of the bed or chair being used, without it having to get too close to its physical body. When the alarm goes off and the first set of tapping noises begins, you should be waiting nearby, ready for reentry, with a reentry trigger phrase being held firmly in mind. You must be poised and ready, waiting to feel the first tugging sensations that signal your physical body is beginning to flicker awake. Once you feel this first tugging, you should immediately slide back into your physical body, shouting your trigger phrase exuberantly! Be ready to take control as you reenter and force your physical body to wake up, remembering all, then write down your experience. Always have a notebook and pen beside you. Physical Body's Part When you, in your physical body, first hear the tapping of the flicker tape and begin to awaken, you must try not to wake up immediately. Try to ignore the noise and allow yourself to doze and flicker. Try to fall back to sleep. Waking your physical body is your projected double's job, not yours. The flicker tape will continue its tapping at regular intervals, slowly getting louder each time, with ten-second gaps of silence. Keep an eye out for the torso surge or falling sensation, either of which are signs that the projected double is reentering. When you feel either of these sensations, know that your projected double is in the process of reintegrating. If you miss this moment and just slowly come awake with no apparent memories, put your mind on search, and use OBE recall trigger phrases to pull back shadow memories. The memories are there, you just have to reach in and trigger them. The ten-second gaps of silence between each waking segment can be increased if the waking physical body does not have enough time to flicker back into a light sleep after a tapping segment has started the waking process. It must be able to flicker or fall back into a semisleep or very light sleep for this technique to work properly. In time, if you practice this technique regularly, you will become programmed to respond to the noises on your flicker tape by flickering in and out of the sleep state. This will maximize your chances of a successful planned projection and reentry with a full shadow memory download. One last way to use the above flicker-tape technique is with no projection technique being used at all. Set the flicker tape alarm for fifteen or twenty minutes after you calculate you will fall asleep. Simply set the alarm and allow yourself to fall asleep as normal, noting the time at which it is set to go off. Using the flicker-tape method is then entirely up to your projected double. It is solely responsible for waking you up and forcing a full shadow memory download by watching the clock and"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"97 using the shouted trigger phrase reentry technique. When the tape wakes your physical body, allow yourself to flicker for a while, but if you come fully awake with no projection memories, use the OBE recall phrases to assist with shadow memory recall."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98 23. Lucid Dream Backup The training exercises given in this book, especially the energetic development work, will heighten your dream, lucid dream, and spontaneous OBE activity considerably. It is a shame to waste all this energy on uncontrolled dreams, so I suggest that you use a lucid dream technique as a backup and secondary goal. This will provide some out-of-body experience by way of lucid dreaming and will help keep interest high until you succeed at having an OBE. A lucid dream is a genuine type of OBE, although the dimensional gate traveled through to achieve it is best thought of as being internal. And while it doesn't work for everyone, a lucid dream can often be converted into a real-time OBE by feeling for the physical body and returning to it, or near to it. It is also sometimes possible to project from a lucid dream into the astral planes by imagining and targeting an astral destination. Everyone dreams when asleep and most people remember some dreams, if only the occasional fragment. Some people claim they never dream, but they really mean they just don't remember their dreams. Dreaming is commonplace, but there is much more to dreaming than meets the eye. For most people, dreams are their only connection with the greater universe and their spiritual roots. I think of dreaming as a natural internal energetic process of the mind. Free of the constraints of normal waking consciousness, the subconscious mind takes over, reflecting thoughts and fantasies and creative energies into the mind's eye of the sleeping but never totally dormant mind. The dreaming process can be thought of as something like an energetically generated personal dream space, infinite in size and scope, inside me human mind. The brow center is energized during sleep, creating and hosting the dream environment, a personal dream space that also connects the human incarnation with its original animating spirit mind, the higher self. The mind's eye can be thought of as a personal link to other dimensions, a doorway to the great beyond. As the physical body and mind fall asleep, a copy of consciousness is reflected into the etheric body, and from there into the projectable double as it is generated, and later into the astral and higher subtle bodies. While this is happening, the physical/etheric copy of the mind begins sliding toward another type of projection, an internal projection into the dream environment. At the start of the process, while falling asleep, the physical/etheric mind begins losing the strength of will to form coherent and logical thought patterns. It slowly loses itself among wandering fragments of thought and subconscious impressions. It loses touch with reality and begins to experience dreams, some of which appear to be generated by the subconscious mind. This is part of a fairly well-known natural process whereby the mind works at solving problems and internal conflicts. It plays out dream scenarios and situations, and lives these internally within the safety of the dream environment. This helps the mind find peace and balance in a natural way. I think dream environments are simply other dimensions, dream dimensions that are reached via an internal mental gateway. All the action therein is played out in the mind's eye of the dreamer, or is reflected into it. Dream dimensions can be every bit as real and infinite in size and scope as any other dimension or parallel universe. Just as you cannot point to the astral dimension, so you cannot point to a dream dimension. I consider all nonphysical dimensions to be subtly related alternative gateways into related and possibly even interconnected dimensions. Lucid Dreaming With a normal lucid dream, full waking consciousness returns to you at some point during the course of a dream. You suddenly become aware you are dreaming, effectively waking up inside the dream environment. You can then take some measure of control over the dream scenario and over the course of events. Lucid dreams differ from OBEs in that they often seem much more substantial and realistic. A powerful lucid dream can be indistinguishable from reality, even if entered from the full waking state. A lucid dreamer is much more aware than a real-time or astral projector of having something like a physical body. Lucid dreamers often experience physical sensations like gravity, texture, temperature, taste, pleasure and pain. These sensations are generated by the subconscious mind from similar remembered experiences. The more powerful the lucid dream, the more real these sensations become. Lucid dreaming, real-time projections, and astral projections share a fair bit of common ground. The dreamer's center of conscious awareness often flicks back and forth many times between these states during a single experience. Often, more than one type of experience is perceived or remembered as happening simultaneously. This is caused by different aspects of the mind-split intruding on each other during the eventual shadow memory download at the end of the experience. This causes a confusing set of mixed memories, being part dream, part lucid dream, part real-time OBE, and part astral projection. Reality Checking To become lucid, you need to program your mind with a trigger to make you realize you are dreaming, so that you can take control. The best way is by forming the habit of frequent reality checks. (Reality checking also works with spontaneous OBE.) It takes time and perseverance to make reality checking a habitual action, and it will not work until it becomes habitual. But once it does, lucid dreams or spontaneous OBEs can be experienced just about every night, even many times each night. Because of this, reality checking is well worth the effort. Program yourself to stop what you are doing for a moment, in real life, and check the reality of your current situation. This is very quick and simple to do, but must be done regularly, many times each day, for it to become a habitual action. The reality-checking habit must become a habitual response to a frequent real-life event. Every time you do a reality check, look around and ask yourself • Is this situation normal? • Do my surroundings look normal?"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"99 • Do my hands look normal? • Can I float, levitate, or fly? The key to effective reality checking is a simple trigger. This trigger must be a frequent action or event that can be used several times each day. The idea is to isolate a simple action and program yourself to habitually react to this event by doing a reality check every time it happens. For example, every time you have a drink during the day, do a reality check. A few ideas for reality-check triggers: • Hands: Every time you notice or wash your hands • Drink: Every time you have a drink • Toilet: Every time you go to the toilet • Time: Every time you check the time or time is mentioned • Food: Every time you eat something Whichever primary trigger you choose, it is a good idea to in-dude drinking and going to the toilet as fixed reality-check situations. These both involve urges in the physical body and both of these urges can be felt quite strongly from within the dream or projected state. Most people get at least one of these urges during sleep every night. These urges often lead to false awakenings, where dreamers or projectors wander off to get a drink or go to the toilet, or both, not knowing they are actually out of body. They often go through the motions of drinking or of starting to empty their bladder, with their physical body still asleep in bed. So, every time you go to the toilet, turn the light switch on and off twice, to check that it is working normally. If you are projecting in real time (a false awakening), the light switch may sound as if it clicks, but the light will not go on and off and the switch will not actually move. Try passing your hand through the wall or some other solid object. Check your hands to see if they look normal, or if they melt. If you find yourself outside using a tree or a bush, which often happens when the urge to urinate is felt within a dream or OBE, check the reality of the situation before continuing. If the physical body needs to urinate and this wakes you up inside a dream or OBE, you can fight this urge and continue the experience for several minutes or so, before being pulled back into your physical body. Alternatively, feel for your body and project back into it, then get up and go to the toilet while holding on to as much of your deeply relaxed state as possible. Jot down a quick outline of your experience, just a few keywords before returning to bed. When you get back into bed, you will often be able to slip straight back into the dream or OBE state to continue where you left off. The next morning, use your notes to help reclaim shadow memories of further experiences. Hunger and Thirst It is possible to use the hunger and thirst urges to cause lucidity during dreams. It is also possible to use this to wake yourself up during an OBE, or even to cause a false awakening. A false awakening is a short real-time OBE, in which the projectors believe they are awake instead of projecting. The thirst and hunger urges are quite strongly felt from within all these states, and will often make the dream or projected double go for a drink or a snack. The first step is to program yourself to do a habitual reality check whenever you have a drink. Note if the fluid you are drinking is actually moistening your throat and slaking your thirst. If you are dreaming or projecting, no amount of fluid will do this and you will find yourself drinking a ridiculous quantity of fluid in an attempt to do so. The next step is to deny yourself fluids, and/or food, for a few hours before going to bed. Place a large glass of water and some food on a tray in your room. Put these well out of reach on the far side of the room. Behind this food and drink, place a large piece of white paper on which is printed clearly, \"You are having an OBE!\" or \"Do a reality check NOW!\" Make sure you only put this sign up before retiring or you will get so used to it being there, you will not pay any attention to it during an OBE. If you try to consume this food and drink during a dream, you'll find yourself eating and drinking dream copies of the originals. These will look and feel and taste the same but will not slake thirst nor satisfy hunger. This discrepancy can be used as a trigger. Normally, if you try to consume these during an OBE or false awakening, your hands will pass through it. The sign will alert you to the fact that you are having an OBE. When this happens, it is a good idea to reenter your physical body and write down what happened. Then return to sleep and try to repeat the OBE or false awakening. Sometimes, though, a projector's subconscious creative ability will automatically mask many aspects of the out-of-body environment. Unaware real-time projectors may inadvertently create copies of food and drink. As with dreaming, these will not satisfy hunger or thirst. This discrepancy, again, can be used to trigger realization that an OBE is in progress. Affirmations Affirmations are repeated sayings used to program the subconscious mind. These are most effective if said just before falling asleep. Before you go to sleep each night say, \"I will remember to do my reality check! \" replacing the words \"do my reality check\" with whatever your primary reality check really is — for example, \"I will remember to look at my hands!\" Do this twenty times or more before falling sleep. Concentrate on the content and meaning of what you are saying; do not just rattle it off parrot fashion. The whole idea behind this affirmation is to convince your subconscious to remind you to do your reality check during a lucid dream or OBE. Remembering a Lucid Dream After a successful reality check during a dream or OBE, you will suddenly realize you are lucid dreaming or having an OBE. Stay calm! Strong emotions like excitement can ruin an experience by waking you up in your physical body. Once you become aware, you can take control of the situation and continue from there. Once lucid, it is important to begin affirming to yourself that you are going to remember everything. This greatly improves"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"100 your chances of remembering the experience. Tell yourself repeatedly, \"I will remember everything!\" Another excellent way of strengthening this memory is to give a constant running commentary throughout the experience. Speak aloud to yourself, describing everything you see and do at all times, but still regularly affirm you will remember it. Exit Symptoms within Dreams It is quite common for a dreamer to experience the energetic sensations associated with a projection exit (vibrations, rapid heartbeat, falling sensation, etc.) from within the dream state. These sensations will often trigger the lucid dream state, making you suddenly aware of your situation. But the transfer from one out-of-body level to another, say from real-time to the astral planes, is not accompanied by the same energetic sensations as a normal conscious-exit projection. You may perceive yourself to be having a spontaneous OBE exit, and feel all the normal sensations, especially if you have been trying to cause a real OBE exit earlier. You may even be dreaming that you are in the process of attempting a conscious-exit OBE, which is not uncommon. If you become aware of projection-related symptoms during a dream or lucid dream, keep calm and do not fight them. You will experience something very much like a conscious-exit projection, but it will be your dream body experiencing it. Projection sensations felt within a dream, while they can be quite strong, are always much less alarming than they might be in the physical body. Most people will feel only vibrations, partial paralysis, and a floating sensation, as if they are levitating within their dream. They may not, however, realize they are dreaming at this time; more usually they will not. Position Effects on Lucid Dreaming and OBE The resting position of the physical body can have quite an effect on whether an OBE or lucid dream is achieved. I find that I cannot make a conscious exit while lying on my side. I must be either sitting, reclining, or lying flat on my back. If I lie on my left side, I tend to project directly into a lucid dream. Lying on my right side does not encourage me to sleep or anything else, and if I do manage to fall asleep, it is usually dreamless. While the resting positions given above may not affect everyone in exactly the same way, I suggest that their potential effects be explored. Lucid Dream Projection One of the most powerful experiences I know of results from deliberately projecting into a lucid dream environment from the full waking state, with no break in consciousness. I call this mind-blowing experience lucid dream projection, although others have also called it WILD (wake induced lucid dream). Although this is technically a lucid dream, it can aptly be called the ultimate out-of-body experience as it has many similarities with a conscious-exit OBE. A lucid dream projection is essentially no different from a conscious-exit projection. Both cause the same clarity of perception, that of operating remotely from the true physical body. The only difference of note is that lucid dream projections are far more realistic and true to life than are projections or normal lucid dreams. Sensations like gravity, the weight and feel of the physical body, its ability to taste and smell and feel pleasure and pain, the limitations of solid matter, the feeling of temperature, etc., are all indistinguishable from true-life perceptions. Lucid dream projection is particularly useful when OBE attempts continually fail on the verge of the exit. All that is required is to make a normal projection attempt. If this fails, or if you get apprehensive and do not want to go through with the full exit, simply stop what you are doing and try for a lucid dream projection instead. All the deep physical relaxation and energetic preparation for the projection attempt can be used to power a lucid dream projection. After almost triggering the projection reflex, simply snuggle down into your most comfortable, sleep-inducing position. Relax into yourself as if in the process of falling asleep. If your first position does not provide the desired results, try other positions during future attempts. Stay tranced and mentally focused while allowing yourself to drift right up to the edge of sleep. Gently observe yourself mentally while imagining a target dream environment. Hold this target firmly in mind and allow yourself to drift off into yourself, as if drifting off to sleep. If all goes well, you will slip directly into your target scenario. You will find yourself suddenly standing there fully conscious. There will be a definite continuance of waking consciousness, with no break in it at all, just as occurs with a normal conscious-exit projection. You will not just fall asleep and wake up there , you will project there directly from the waking state. The transition is sudden and breathtaking. You will feel as if you have suddenly slipped through a curtain into the dream environment while fully awake. Your target dream scenario can be anything you like, but I strongly recommend a large department store or shopping mall scene that you know personally. For some reason, this scenario makes lucid dream projection much easier to achieve. I have no idea why this works but, what works... works. Remember a scene from a store or mall with which you are familiar. Construct this scenario in your imagination until you have a clear feel and imagined view of it in your mind's eye. It also helps if you name your lucid dream's staging scene. Vocalize the target's name in your mind as you imagine its image while attempting to project there. Image this scene in your mind's eye and silently but continually repeat its name, as you allow yourself to slide deeper and deeper into yourself and toward the target environment. Once you appear at the target, try not to get distracted. Plan to move out of the store and into the mall, if you are not already there. Keep moving. Walk through the mall and look for a door or an elevator. Either of these should take you to another environment, if you want to leave the mail. Avoid sexual thoughts at all times, as this will severely affect the quality and duration of the whole experience. Before you open a door, imagine and expect to find the environment you want, or a way leading to it, on the other side. Hold this image and intention firmly in mind as you open each door. If this fails, go back inside the mall and find an elevator. Ask a dream character where the nearest one is if you cannot find one. Once inside the elevator, press a button and imagine your chosen destination ; hold this and its name firmly in mind as the elevator moves. Expect to find this destination or a way"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"101 leading to it when the elevator stops and the doors open. If this does not work, try other floors at random. If this fails entirely or you get lost, find a door leading out of the mall completely and follow your instincts from there on. Once you know where the elevator is, or where a convenient door is, you can return to it during future excursions. From there, you can quickly navigate wherever you wish. If you cannot think of a destination, either spend some time creating one in your imagination before the lucid dream projection, or explore at random. The more often you use the mall as a staging area, the easier and more reliable lucid dream projection will become. Lucid Dream Projection — Experience The true differences between a lucid dream and an OBE only become fully apparent if both are experienced very close together, which allows a fair comparison. Studying case histories simply does not provide enough data to allow this. The following account of my first lucid dream projection shows the effects of the resting position, while also highlighting what are some fairly obvious differences between lucid dream projections, OBEs, and normal lucid dreams. I awoke at about two in the morning, lying on my back with my whole body vibrating. I could feel myself about to spontaneously project. My arms and legs were already starting to float out. However, I did not want to project. I was tired and had a busy day ahead of me, and just wanted to go back to sleep. I'd been having a very interesting dream up until then and wanted to go back into it if I could. I felt heavy and sluggish but managed to roll onto my left side. The vibrations stopped immediately and the heavy sinking feeling soon left me. Happy now, I snuggled down and relaxed back into myself, concentrating on the dreamscape I had just left and the name I had given it: \"Advantage\". I hoped this would take me back into it, as this trick often seemed to work. After only a few seconds, I popped directly into the dream I'd left earlier. The transition was breathtaking. There was a full continuance of waking consciousness. I did not fall asleep and then wake up within the dream, but projected directly into it from the full waking state. I suddenly appeared in a busy, brightly lit department store, just like the one I'd been dreaming of earlier. In front of me, a dark-haired young woman was setting up a dining room display. I saw people everywhere, shopping, serving, packing shelves, etc. Everything looked and felt real, stable, and solid. It was simply mind-blowing! I jumped up and down few times to feel the weight of my body, then pinched myself, \"Ouch!\" This hurt just as it would in real life, and my body weight felt normal. I was fully dressed and could even feel the texture of my socks when I wiggled my toes inside my shoes. I glanced at my hands. They looked normal and did not melt. I tried creating an apple in my hand, but nothing happened. The dreamscape I was in did not waver in the slightest. Curious, I thought, in a normal lucid dream the environment can be altered and anything can be created by imagining it. Regardless, I was fully aware that I was dreaming. I walked over to the young woman and asked her what she was doing. She told me they were getting ready for the big day, whatever that was. I picked up a large vase of flowers from the table in the middle of her furniture setting. The china felt like real china and the flowers smelled like real flowers. I pulled a rose petal off and ate it. It tasted dry, scented, and faintly bitter, just as a rose petal should taste, but the taste did not linger in my mouth as it normally would, I tipped the vase and splashed some of the water into my hand. It felt cold and wet, just like real water. I braced myself, hoping that I was truly inside a lucid dream as I believed. I yanked the linen tablecloth from under the main table setting in the display. It almost worked, but the vase and a couple of plates smashed noisily on the floor. A few people looked, but no one seemed to care about the breakage, not even the shop assistant whose display I had just ruined. She went on unpacking and arranging things as if nothing had happened, shaking out another linen tablecloth as she busied herself resetting the table. More confident now, I walked down an aisle and pushed over several large pieces of cheap-looking pottery from the top shelf, one at a time. I looked around to see if anyone noticed. These made very loud smashing sounds and broken pieces flew in all directions. A few people looked over, but no one seemed to care. Reassured by this, I walked over to the checkouts and jumped up onto one of the benches. A few people looked at me, but no one seemed to care and no one said anything. I slipped back into my body and rolled onto my back thinking, \"Wow! That was incredible ... so real!\" I fought to control my excitement and settled back into myself again, trying to get back into the dream. This was getting really interesting. I held the store and its name in mind again and tried to sink back into it, but to no avail. The vibrations started up again and I felt myself starting to project. This time the projection reflex caught hold and buzzed me out of my body. I came to rest at the foot of my bed. The house was dim and quiet as I floated around my bedroom deciding what to do. I took a quick look at my hands. They looked strangely elongated and started melting away. Not wanting to continue the OBE, I dove back into my body and opened my eyes. I lay there for a moment, then closed my eyes and tried to get back into the dream. The vibrations started up again and another wave of falling, floating heaviness came over me as I started projecting again. I fought it off and rolled over onto my right side. The projection symptoms stopped, but I couldn't get back into my dream. I rolled over onto my left side and settled back into myself again. This position felt much better. Holding the image and name of the dreamscape in mind again, I soon found myself back there. I reappeared in the store where I had started during my last visit, several minutes ago. The same shop assistant was busily setting up the same dining display. The vase I'd broken earlier was whole again and back on the table where it had been earlier. I walked through the store, looking for signs of damage from my earlier visit. Everything I had broken earlier was whole and back on the shelves again. It was like nothing had ever happened. This was incredible! No matter what I did, the scenario restored itself. I slipped back into my body again and rolled over to my back, trying to settle myself and get back into my dream. I think my excitement had interrupted it. The vibrations started again, so I rolled over to my left side again. I was getting the hang of this now, and realized that projecting into the dream was much easier from my left side. Settling back into myself and holding the store's image and name in my mind again, I slipped back into the store. Everything was normal and I was back where I had originally started from again, with the same young lady busily setting up her dining display. She looked up and smiled as I waved, then happily went about her work. I decided to explore further afield before anything else happened, and walked out past the service desk into the mall. I walked for some time, exploring the huge mall. There were a fair number of people around. Everyone seemed very busy shopping, or preoccupied with whatever they were doing. Of note, all the children I saw were very quiet and well behaved, walking like polite little robots beside their mothers. There was some light background organ music playing and the usual noise of people quietly bustling about. A few people were talking on telephones here and there, but no one seemed to be chatting or talking to each other. People answered when questioned, but their replies were uninteresting and not very helpful. It seemed impossible to start a conversation that did not involve talking about the person's immediate task at hand. Everyone seemed to lack personality, like background characters in a movie. On the surface this dreamscape was incredibly real, maybe too real, but beneath the surface it lacked something. This looked like real life, but was definitely not the same type"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"102 of real life I am familiar with. I had decided to look for a way out of the mall and do some further exploring when I suddenly felt weak and heavy. The strength flowed out of me and I felt like I was moving in slow motion. My legs floated slowly upward as I fell ever so slowly to the floor, settling there weak and paralyzed. People stepped over and around me as I lay there, but no one paid any attention to me. I felt like a child's balloon bobbing about on the floor. I was weak and heavy and could no longer feel the normal weight of my body, nor could I feel the floor beneath me. I slipped back into my body again, coming wide awake this time. I rolled over to my back and lay there pondering the significance of these experiences. The vibrations did not start up this time, probably because I was pretty much wide awake now. It was obvious to me that my resting position had been affecting the different types of experiences I'd been having. I was far too excited and wide awake by now to do any kind of further exploration with this phenomenon, so I gave up and went to get a drink and record this experience in my journal. The type of paralysis that occurred at the end of the above experience generally indicates the physical body and mind are either too awake, too tense, or in the process of waking up. Tension in the physical body will disempower, and often paralyze, any subtle bodies that are active at the time."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"103 24. Virtual Reality Projection Virtual reality projection (VRP) is an out-of-body technique through which the subconscious mind can be tricked into creating custom-made virtual realms. This is achieved during real-time projections by passing into a picture or painting, while the mind is held empty and the gaze is held fixed and unfocused ahead. This is very easy to do once you can project, and can be a whole lot of ran to experiment with. It's also a very good way of getting into the astral planes if you are having trouble getting through the real-time zone. I discovered this phenomenon completely by accident while road-testing the rope projection technique. The projected double has enormous creative potential during any type of astral or real-time OBE. It can be difficult to deliberately create anything durable enough to be useful, though. If a sword is deliberately created by a real-time projector, for example, the sword will slowly appear, exactly as imagined. However, it will quickly fade away once the projector ceases holding its image in mind. To create anything durable, the subconscious mind must be tricked into helping. A projector is a point of consciousness with no actual size or shape. The body of the projected double is created by the projector's own sense of body awareness, and only becomes apparent when noticed or deliberately observed, with the act of self-observation affecting the appearance of what is seen. If no body is being observed, projectors revert to being a point of consciousness. This variability in size can be used to create some very interesting out-of-body special effects. Because this point of consciousness is so small, anything it approaches and observes closely can be perceived as steadily growing in size as the distance between it and the projector decreases. Consider what happens when a real-time projector passes slowly through a solid wall. Once the surface of a wall is breached and the projector's head begins passing through it, the interior of the wall becomes highlighted and can be clearly seen as if greatly magnified. If the projected double had kept its copy of normal physical size while passing through solid matter, it would not see so much texture and magnified detail. Passing into a two-dimensional picture or mirror, however, gives the illusion of passing into something much larger than it really is. The trick is to keep the surface mind clear and the gaze unfocused and straight ahead as the picture or mirror is approached. The projector then moves into the target rather than passing through it. This seems to trick the subconscious mind into creating a virtual astral realm around the projected double, identical to that shown in the picture or mirror being approached. Following is my first accidental experience with this fascinating phenomenon. First Virtual Reality Projection — Experience It was an early winter's evening. Using the new rope technique, I projected out of my body. It was fairly dark in the room, with only a crack of light from the streetlight outside coming through a chink in the heavy curtains covering my window. I floated toward the wall leading to the living room, where my mother was watching TV, and was about to pass through, when I noticed something strangely familiar in front of me. Before I could properly see what it was, I suddenly found myself in a strange new world. \"Where the heck am I?\" I thought, surprised. Still at the start of a fairly strong real-time projection, I seemed to have suddenly shifted into an astral realm for no apparent reason. This was highly unusual at this stage of a projection. I was not expecting reality fluctuations for at least another five or ten minutes. I found myself in a dimly lit and misty world. The atmosphere felt damp and gloomy but I did not feel threatened in any way. An enormous rail fence made of massive, rough- hewn timbers was in front of me. I could see a large, dilapidated timber building a short distance behind it. To the right of it I saw dim, silvery reflections, seeming to indicate a body of water in the distance. I heard muffled noises coming from beside the old building and, looking over, saw movement in the shadows. I did not feel threatened, so I climbed through the fence and walked over to investigate. The ground felt almost spongy beneath me as I waded through a low mist clinging to the ground and swirling about my legs. This world felt fairly solid compared to most astral realms. I could vaguely feel my body, the ground, and the fence as I climbed it, although these were nothing like real-life sensations. A large, roughly dressed man with an old black dog came shambling out of the shadows. The man was a giant compared to me, a roughly featured shadow looking to be at least eight feet tall. They moved across to the right and away from me, stopping near another oversized but lower fence. They stood there looking off toward the lake in the distance. I called out to them, but they didn't seem to hear me. They climbed over the fence and walked off toward the lake, slowly fading away into the mist. I went over to check out the old building. It appeared to be a huge barn with a large open door on one side and some kind of lean-to at the rear. I looked inside but saw nothing but mist and shadows. Circling the barn, I found it even gloomier at the rear, so I decided to follow the man and his dog. None of this made any sense to me and there was nothing here of interest to me, but it all seemed vaguely familiar. I could not think why. Had I been to this realm before? I gave up on it and decided to try moving to a different realm. I looked at my hands. They appeared white and unreal looking and my fingers melted quickly away into stumps. Realization dawned on me and I suddenly knew why this realm was so familiar to me. I was inside a large painting that hangs on the wall of my bedroom, left to me by my father. It is painted in autumn colors and depicts an old barn with a rough-hewn timber fence running past it. There is a small lake in the background and a man and a black dog are standing near the barn and looking out toward the lake. It is twilight and misty and fairly dim-looking overall, with lots of deep shadows. It hangs in the spot where I had tried to pass through the wall. Excited and not wanting to lose track of what had just happened, I focused on my physical body and soon found myself back in my chair. I turned on the lamp beside me and recorded the experience in my journal — just a few keywords and phrases in the correct sequence to lock it into my brain. I turned off the lamp and let my eyes adjust to the light. Sure enough, a thin beam of light fell onto the painting from the chink in the curtains. I got a small torch (flashlight, to Yanks) from my bedside drawer, wrapped an old coat around it and positioned it on the dresser under the painting so a thin beam of light fell onto the face of the picture. This highlighted the picture quite well while still leaving the room in virtual darkness. I used the new rope technique again, buzzed free of my body, and hovered near the ceiling. On the wall in front of me, now clearly illuminated in a puddle of light, was my painting. It struck me how much like a window this looked. I moved slowly toward it to see if it would happen again. The first time had been an accident, so I had doubts regarding being able to repeat the experience. I moved closer; the closer I got, the larger the painting grew. My projected double seemed to shrink until it was just a tiny"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"104 point when I got right up close to it. I moved back and forth a few times, studying this effect. I had the impression I was looking into the picture when I got very close to it, rather than just looking at it. I moved up to the painting and inside it again. Suddenly, there I was in the same misty world. This time I was on the other side of the barn near the small lake. Everything was much better illuminated this time, probably because of the light provided by the torch. I turned around, half expecting to see the glare of the lamp from my room, but saw nothing but the vague images of distant trees in far-off shadows. I felt for my body again and soon returned to it. Getting up, I recorded everything in my journal. Creating a Virtual Reality Realm To create a custom virtual realm, get a picture, painting, or poster of a pleasant scene, something bright and sunny. Hang it on the wall or ceiling, or even in another room close by. Get a small, low-powered directional lamp, spotlight, or torch and set it so that part of the poster is softly illuminated by it when the main light is off. Customize a virtual realm by affixing small pictures of objects and people you want to find there. Try to make these extras blend in by keeping them roughly in the same scale as the picture. You can use a mirror to enhance a virtual reality (VR) realm. A mirror adds depth to a two-dimensional picture, which helps create a much clearer and more realistic virtual realm. Place your picture facing a mirror so its reflection can clearly be seen therein. You do not have a body to interfere with this reflection during a projection, so the picture can be fairly close to the mirror. Dressing tables or wardrobe mirrors are ideal for this purpose. Simply stand or hang your chosen picture opposite a mirror and place a low-wattage lamp so that the picture reflects into the mirror. Or use a wallpaper mural. This can be entered directly or through its reflection. A small picture of someone living or deceased can trick your subconscious mind into creating a replica of them in a VR realm. This may be an effective way to communicate with deceased persons and spirits in a controlled and safe environment. The VR replica has the potential to attract the actual spirit of the original person, which could make meaningful communication possible. A custom-made realm will contain a great many familiar elements that you will always find there whenever you enter it. This helps enormously with overcoming natural fears associated with projecting into the unknown out-of-body environment. A safe haven is thus created, a kind of bolt-hole that can be entered whenever you become anxious during a real-time projection. A virtual realm can also be used as a staging area for projecting into the astral planes. It can be used to avoid the real-time zone completely if this is causing you apprehension. To enter the astral planes, travel beyond the limits of what is depicted or reflected inside a virtual realm. Move over that hill, behind those trees, or off the edge of whatever is depicted in the picture being used to create the virtual realm. Once you move beyond the picture's limits, you will be in an anomaly and will soon fade into or find your way into the astral planes. Where in the astral planes you end up will depend on your energetic value and angle of perception at the time of the projection. Spotlight: A simple spotlight can be made by wrapping a pencil torch (penlight) in aluminum foil and making a small hole in the foil through which light can pass. Adjust the torch to direct a thin shaft of light onto the picture being used. You do not need a great deal of light for this purpose. Picture Box: Another way of setting up a VR entrance is to use a cardboard box. A small oblong packing carton will do for this purpose. Paint the inside of the box with blackboard paint, or line it with black crepe paper so the inside is all matte-black. Affix the picture being used to the bottom of the box, face up. Leave the other end open to provide access for the projected double. Lay the box on its side and illuminate the picture by taping a pencil torch or torch bulb to the inside of the box, so its light falls onto the picture. Take care not to use a lamp that could create enough heat to ignite the cardboard box. You do not need a lot of light. The above setup can be enhanced by placing a mirror in the bottom of the box. A cheap mirror tile is perfect for this purpose. Affix the mirror to the bottom of the box and set the picture at about a forty-five-degree angle at the other end so it reflects into the mirror. Leave a gap above where the picture is set to provide access for the projected double. Set the light so it falls onto the picture and causes it to reflect into the mirror at the other end of the box. A clear reflection can then be obtained. One end of the picture box should be left open above or behind the picture so the projected double can see into it and thus gain access to the mirror at the other end of the box. The picture box setup can be put atop a wardrobe or somewhere else convenient in the room and its light turned on before a projection. It can also be hung from a doorknob, affixed to a wall, or simply put on the floor somewhere. However, it is advisable to put it as far away as possible from where the physical body will be in the room, to lessen the pressure between the projected double and its physical body. If the room being used is very small, the picture box setup can also be placed in an adjacent room. Entering a VR Realm To enter a virtual realm, project into real time and immediately move toward your chosen picture. Keep your mind clear. Do not think about what you are going to do. Gaze steadily ahead and feel yourself moving toward the picture. Stay calm and do not think about the picture or of passing through it or the wall behind it. Think of nothing as you move closer, letting the picture fill your view. The picture will appear to grow in size. Simply move up to and inside. It's as simple as that. If you want to return to your physical body, feel for it and you will be transported back to it. Look on this picture as being a doorway into another world. Fig. 26.

The Astral Form in Motion Once you get out of your body and are ready to get moving and start exploring, you may come across some perplexing difficulties with even the simplest of motions. Getting from A to in the out-of-body environment, especially in the real-time zone, is not as easy as you might think. This chapter provides advice on how to solve the most common movement and travel problems. A Mind of Its Own If your projected double seems to have a mind of its own, tends to move in directions you do not want to go, and you feel resistance when you try to correct this, it is quite possible that your physical/etheric body is having a remote-eye type of projection experience. It may be seeing through your eyes and trying to remotely control its projected double — meaning it is trying to control your movements. This problem is caused by the mind-split and can be very confusing, but has a simple cure. Move well away from your physical body; you'll find these remote-control effects progressively ease with distance. The remote-control effect seems to pretty much disappear when the projected double gets a hundred yards or more away from its physical body. The awake time of the average physical/etheric mind is quite limited during a projection. It is guaranteed to begin losing control and start falling asleep fairly quickly. Its attempted control over its projected double will thus not last very long, usually a few minutes or so at the most. Astral Momentum Most new projectors experience simple movement problems during their first few projections. Movement problems are more noticeable in the real-time zone than in the astral planes. In real time, simply moving across a room in the right direction can be a major accomplishment for a novice projector. This lack of control is quite normal, and happens simply because new projectors are unfamiliar with the real-time projected double and its environment. This is a little like finding yourself suddenly in zero gravity and not knowing how to move around properly. Some experimentation and practice is necessary. A type of momentum problem very much like one you would find in a real zero-gravity environment causes most early movement problems. This momentum causes projectors to continue moving after they have decided to stop, and may take them through walls, ceilings, doors, etc. I think this is caused by the strength of the awareness action used to cause the initial motion. If this action is too strong or is continued for too long, projectors will move farther than they planned and find they have no brakes with which to stop. If the movement-causing action is not done right, they can also move in the wrong direction entirely. Only practice teaches projectors how to get about with any degree of purpose, accuracy, and grace. Learning to move while out of body can be a very comical process — in my early childhood experiences with real-time projection, I always started by trying to navigate my way through the house to get outside. I would float and slide and blunder through walls and doors and usually end up getting stuck in the roof. Then, when I finally managed to leave the house, I'd skim along the road trying to get up enough speed so I could take off like an airplane or a bird. I would get airborne for a while by flapping my arms or using a swimming action (which really does help with flying), but could never seem to clear the surrounding trees and rooftops. Falling was interesting, as it seemed to happen in slow motion. I would feel a kind of slow and heavy impact when I hit the ground. I remember feeling something that could be likened to out-of-body concussion, and something like a vague feeling of remembered pain, but falling never hurt me or sent me back to my body, and I never seemed to penetrate the ground on impact. I would skim down the road taking a series of giant leaps, getting airborne for a while and flapping my arms like crazy, trying to will myself higher and faster. I wanted to fly like Superman, but could never quite break free of the strangely slow gravity I felt that kept pulling me back to earth every time I got airborne. Because of this, I often floated unintentionally into strange houses, blundering about like a drunk in zero gravity. I seemed to be continually apologizing to an endless number of perplexed strangers in passing, as I floated in and out of their houses. Learning to Walk Once you project, you'll find you don't really have a body as such, and therefore have no legs with which to stand or walk or run. To move, do not think about what you are going to do or how you are going to do it, just do it! Will yourself into motion by using your sense of whole-body awareness to provide the forward motion. Imagine that every direction you want to move in is downhill and that you are wearing roller skates, and you will just start rolling forward whenever you want to move. For forward motion just feel yourself moving forward. Call on the memory of what it feels like to move. Re-create this feeling with whole-body awareness. Feel what is in front of you moving toward you, as if you were already moving. With a little practice you will find yourself gliding gracefully over the surface. This is probably more accurately described as skimming. Changing direction and stopping takes a little more practice, but can be a whole lot of fun if you have the right attitude. A sense of the ridiculous is an invaluable asset in the real-time environment. Once you master simple movement, get out into the open or on a road and practice skimming along the surface at a higher speed. Imagine you are driving an automobile or motorbike. Don't try to visualize or see or create anything, just feel the movement of it. Adopt a natural driving or riding position and feel yourself moving forward as if you were actually driving or riding along the road. Feel the road and its surroundings moving toward and past you just as they would if you were actually driving. Feel yourself accelerating and braking just as you would in a real car, using imaginary pedals if you like. Turning corners, you will find, does not have the same inertia limitations as it does while driving a real car, but the habit of having to slow down to turn a corner will continue to affect you until you realize you can zoom around corners while maintaining a"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106 constant speed. Learning to Fly As with simple motion, most people encounter problems when learning to fly. It is, funnily enough, far easier to blast yourself at hyperspeed into outer space than it is to hover or fly like a bird over rooftops and trees. There is no actual gravity affecting the projected double, but there is the gravity habit to deal with. Flying is exactly the same as skimming above the ground, no matter at what height, and is accomplished in exactly the same way as simple movement. Once airborne, you notice something very like gravity slowly dragging you back to earth. This is the gravity habit, the habit of being continually aware of your body's weight and of the possibility of falling over in any given situation. Awareness of gravity is a very strong, ingrained survival instinct, guaranteed to have a strong effect on the projected double while it is learning to fly. If you persevere with flying, you'll find yourself moving along in a series of great leaps and short arcing flights. The height of these arcs will be affected by the height of your surroundings. In the beginning, you'll find your ceiling will be roughly in line with the average height of the buildings and/or trees around you. You will repeatedly sink back to earth when your motion-causing awareness action finishes and the gravity habit takes over. You will also find yourself thinking about what you are doing and wondering what happened to gravity. Thinking about flying and gravity and height is what causes flight momentum to stop, and the gravity habit to pull you down. Don't think about it, just do it! Flying can be exciting; this excitement could also cause your downfall. Excitement will stimulate your physical/etheric body, and may cause it to begin waking if it is only lightly asleep. This will either disempower the projected double, causing it to fall, or end the projection completely if the physical body wakes up. Adopt a ho-hum, dispassionate-observer kind of attitude and control your excitement. This will not only make flying easier, but will extend the length and strength of your projection considerably. In the early stages, you may start flying by skimming down the road building up speed, then feeling yourself leaping into the air while flapping your arms and feeling yourself lifting off. Don't knock it; this is a very good way of learning to fly, and is a whole lot of fun too. And, you can still have fun without allowing yourself to get overexcited. Get out onto a straight road or clearing and slain along until you feel you are moving as fast as you possibly can. Feel yourself flapping your arms and feel yourself springing into the air like a water bird taking off from a lake. Angle your vision upward slightly and feel the open air above the ground moving toward you. Keep flapping your arms and feel them propelling you faster and higher, adding lift and speed to your forward motion. Once you get the hang of flying, flapping your arms or using a swimming action still comes in handy at times. It provides extra speed and lift whenever this is needed. This also works inside the astral planes. The astral environment may be quite different from the real-time zone, but most of the basic real-time principles are still applicable, especially those concerning movement. Another technique you might like to try is to clear your mind and just feel yourself floating up into the air, feeling as if you were lighter than air. Feel yourself rising and feel and expect the ground to slowly fall away beneath you as you rise. This is also good practice for hovering. Simply feel yourself suspended in midair and feel the ground and surrounding area holding their places as you hover. All flying actions take whole-body awareness effort; in the early stages a novice projector may have to put in quite a lot of effort to overcome the gravity habit. If you continually find yourself falling back to ground, refuse to accept this and apply more willpower to feeling yourself rising upward in the direction you want to move in. Willpower and whole-body awareness effort are the only things that will overcome the gravity habit until you thoroughly convince yourself that you are no longer bound by gravity and can fly at will during an OBE. Once the internal chains that cause the gravity habit are thrown off, you'll be free to fly anywhere in the universe at any speed you desire. OBE flying is not as limited as in real life. You can fly in the air, in outer space, and even underwater. There is no resistance or turbulence underwater; it is just as natural as flying in the air or in space, although traveling speed is reduced underwater, due to the decrease in visibility. With practice you will soon get the hang of this and will find it immensely pleasurable. It is an incredible sensation, especially during the daytime: able to leap tall buildings at a single bound; capable of the infinitely variable speed of thought; able to hover like a helicopter or to sit on lonely tufts of cloud; able to fly rings around birds of the air; able to safely explore the ocean depths, playing with whales and dolphins; able to leave the earth and explore other planets, stars, and galaxies. You can explore and experience all, seeking out the new and the interesting, and going where no human body has gone before. When you get out of your body the sky is no longer the limit, it is just the beginning . .. Passing Through Solid Matter Most novice real-time projectors have some difficulty moving through solid objects like walls, doors, and windows, not to mention solid rock. Their belief system seems to play a large part in this difficulty. If they believe they can move easily through a solid wall or door and are willing to just do it, without even thinking about it, novices will be able to do so. If just believing they can move through solid matter does not work, it may mean they are not subconsciously accepting this ability. Awareness effort and willpower can be used to overcome this. There are also a few ways of tricking the subconscious mind and getting around this problem. Once it has been done a few times, it quickly becomes easier as the subconscious mind begins accepting this ability. I've listed below a few tricks that have worked for other people with this same problem. 1. Avoid windows and mirrors during real-time projections, as well as any other highly reflective surfaces, even still water that is reflecting the sky. Passing through a reflection can shift you out of real time and into a mirror-image world, into an anomaly. This is, in principle, very much like how virtual reality projection works. Once inside an"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"107 anomaly, it can be difficult to return to the true real-time zone without returning to the physical body. Use walls, ceilings, and doors, wherever possible, to maintain me real-time aspect of your projection. Even looking into a mirror or reflection is a potential hindrance to the integrity of a real-time projection. It is very easy to unintentionally slip into a reflection without noticing the shift out of real time, into an anomalous copy of it. 2. Moving through obstacles backward has helped many people overcome their difficulties passing through solid matter. Position yourself in front of the barrier or wall you wish to pass through, then turn around and simply push yourself through it backward, without looking and without thinking about what you are doing. Don't think about it; just do it! This method is also handy for passing through reflective surfaces without shifting into an anomaly. If projectors cannot see a reflection, it will not usually affect them. 3. Take a run at the obstacle by putting your head down and barging your way through it quickly, without thinking about what you are doing. 4. Find a crack, keyhole, or window and look through it. Concentrate on what you can see on the other side and feel yourself as being there on the other side. Really want to be there. Wish for it as hard as you can! In most cases you will find yourself suddenly on the other side. This is something like very short-distance instant projection. 5. Approach the barrier while keeping your mind clear. Reach out with one hand and, without directly looking at your hand , push it into the wall. Push your arm into it up to the elbow. Observe that your arm easily moves inside the wall and remember what it feels like on the inside. Your hand will feel slightly tingly and fuzzy. Will yourself to start moving forward. Push yourself forward firmly , head slightly lowered so it enters the wall first. You don't really have a head, so just feel yourself as lowering it. Keep your mind clear and do not think about what you are doing. Once you feel yourself moving through the wall, keep going and walk on through it. If you have to, claw, wriggle, or swim the rest of the way through. There is no possible way projectors can become stuck inside solid matter, so there is no possible way this could cause them harm. 6. If you know what is on the other side of a barrier, imagine yourself being there. Feel yourself being there as if you really were there and you will usually find yourself suddenly there on the other side. Make sure you imagine this destination correctly if you want to stay in real time. If you are wrong about what is on the other side, you may cause yourself to shift someplace else. 7. Use resistance and texture. While moving through the brick wall of a house, for example, you will see layers of paint, plaster, mortar, and brick, well lit and clearly defined. Try standing next to a brick wall, then slowly putting your hand inside the wall. Feel what it's like on the inside. Next, try slowly pressing your head inside the wall, just enough to see what it looks like on the inside. You will not only see and feel inside it, but you will also be able to taste and smell it. This is an incredible experience and will not hurt or damage you in any way. If you manage to penetrate a wall with your hand and head, what's wrong with going all the way and passing right through it? Speed, Distance, and Limitations While speed is not strictly a limiting factor for the projected double, the maximum speed at which it is possible to travel during an OBE appears to be set by the subconscious mind. There is a direct relationship between what appears to be a reasonable speed and the maximum speed that is actually possible. This is most likely set according to the distance seen ahead to be traversed. Speed is thus relative to the distance seen ahead. Walking Speed: Inside buildings and enclosed areas, walking speed appears natural and is quite adequate for the short distances to be traveled. A faster speed seems unacceptable to the subconscious mind and does not seem possible. Road Speed: Anything from walking speed to approximately 200 miles per hour (320 kph) seems natural on a roadway. Possible speed is affected by how clearly the distance ahead is seen. Projectors can travel much faster on an open freeway in the daytime than through the suburbs at night. Traveling speed at night in real time is also limited by available light. Flying: Anything from walking speed to supersonic speed seems natural, again depending on the height and the distance that can be seen ahead by a projector. The higher projectors get and the farther they can see clearly ahead, the faster it seems to be natural, and hence possible, for them to travel. At a great height on a clear day, several times the speed of sound seems quite natural. Underwater: Underwater visibility is far more limited than in the open air, and the speed possible is therefore much slower. Outer Space: Faster than light speed feels perfectly natural and is therefore possible. Top Speed: There is no speed limit at all. The speed of thought is infinite and the top speed of a projector is also infinite. Possible speed increases in direct proportion to the distance seen ahead to be traveled. In outer space, it is possible to see incredible distances ahead, to other galaxies and beyond. If something is seen ahead, you can be there in virtually no time. Intergalactic speed far in excess of the speed of light feels quite natural and is hence easily attained. Instantaneous Travel It is generally accepted today that if you can visualize a destination, you can project yourself there at the speed of thought. Fig. 27. A projector's eye view of passing through solid matter projector’s entry point projector’s view inside wall"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108 This method works reasonably well, but can be a bit of a hit-or-miss affair while traveling in real time. The accuracy of this method depends on whether you have actually been to your target destination, and how well you can image it in your mind's eye. If a projector has not personally seen the destination, instant projection will usually take that projector straight into an astral location resembling it — and occasionally into an astral realm totally unlike the intended destination. An astral reflection or copy of an intended location often appears to be created (or tuned in to) through the act of imagining the target. This may be based on the projector's idea of what the destination is like. Projectors may seem to arrive at their true real-time target, but will usually find discrepancies between the real-life location and where they have actually projected. For example, a group of serious projectors once told me they regularly held group OBE outings on the top of Uluru (previously called Ayers Rock) in Australia. As I have visited Uluru a few times myself and know this area fairly well in real life, I asked them to provide me with a few details about the great rock so I could verify their accuracy. They described many aspects and features that were inaccurate or were simply not there at all, like carved stone steps, etc. These projectors had most likely been traveling to an astral reflection of Uluru. They possibly created unreal extras there , filling in what they imagined it would really be like. There are exceptions with traveling instantly to distant locations the projector has never been to in real life. Some reality fluctuations, though, will usually be found at the target site. It is possible to instantly project to another person in real time, regardless of where that person might be, if you know that person well or have strong feelings for them. In this case, you can lock on to the remote location and person by feeling their personality and essence. Just knowing about a person from a magazine or film or having met them a few times is not enough. You need to know that person and be able to feel and taste their essence very well, to instantly project to them in real time. If the target person is asleep when projected to, you will either project to their actual location and see them as they really are, which is asleep in bed, or you will project to an astral reflection of their location. This copy will usually be strongly influenced by the dream mind of the target person. If the target person is in the real-time zone or astral planes, it is also possible to project directly to wherever he or she happens to be. If they are found asleep in real time near their physical body, it is usually possible to wake them up and communicate with them. Real-time projectors can have the perception of being able to physically touch other real-time projectors if they so choose. If the target person is awake (in real life) when projected to, it is sometimes possible to travel to their actual physical location and observe them in real time. This location will usually be found to be influenced by reality fluctuations, caused by the mind and imagination of the target person. These reality fluctuations may not be obvious, especially if the projector is unfamiliar with this location. The target site may therefore be overlaid with some degree of mental imagery. If the target person is in a crowd of many other people, say in a big city, mental imagery (static) from all the other people in the area will also be found to intrude on and affect the real-time environment. The clearer the target area is of other people, the clearer it will be of mental static. For example, a target person on a midocean yacht or in a remote cabin in a forest can be projected to far more successfully than would otherwise be possible. Projecting to a person well known to the projector is probably the most effective and reliable way to travel long distances while retaining some of the objective aspects of a real-time projection. Long Distance Travel Flying is the best way to travel for short- to medium-distance projections, say up to a few hundred miles. This may not sound like much of a distance when you take into account the potential speed of a projector. Even this distance, though, can be quite a challenge if the objective qualities of a real-time projection are to be held. It is all too easy to slip into an astral copy of reality while traveling in real time. Reality fluctuations are constant travel companions of any real-time projector. These will spring into existence whenever a projector relaxes or breaks focus. Strict mental control must be maintained at all times while traveling in the real-time zone. It is not practical to follow Earth's surface for long-distance real-time travel. For example, a country on the other side of the world may be around twelve thousand miles away. You would need to travel at roughly sixty times the speed of sound to reach there in under fifteen minutes. This level of speed is not natural for a projector within Earth's atmosphere, and anything close to this kind of hyperspeed will cause a projector's view to blur. Blurring causes disorientation and an immediate shift away from objective real time. The real-time objective aspects are then lost, usually for the duration of that projection. Fifteen to twenty minutes is about the maximum length of time seasoned projectors can hold themselves strongly enough in real time to be able to return for a conscious reentry before slipping away into the astral planes. Novice projectors can usually only hold themselves in real time for a few minutes. In either case, the physical body must be capable of being woken up by the return of the projected double, or reentry may not even be possible. Any long-distance real-time travel is therefore limited by how long it takes for the physical/etheric body of a projector to fall into a deep sleep. Traveling long distances in real time is like flying a superfast helicopter by the seat of your pants at night, with no instruments and only the stars and landmarks to guide ,you. Long-distance real-time projectors need to study geography, plus road maps and photographs of their target destination, as these would be seen from the air. They need to be able to recognize oceans, continents, countries, states, cities, towns, roads, and landmarks. Traveling long distance by following the surface is possible only if projectors have the time and energy to do all this and return to their physical body for reentry before slipping away into the astral planes. Orbiting Earth To project to a distant location, after all the details are memorized, it is far easier to go into orbit and reenter the atmosphere directly above the target. As the projectors approach Earth's surface, they must adjust their angle of approach, aiming for the geological features, landmarks, and roads around their target destination. This method is suited to any projection where the"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"109 distance to be traveled is over a few hundred miles, like taking a giant leap a few hundred miles straight up then back down onto the target. This is much faster than surface travel. Entering orbit for the purpose of taking giant geographical leaps is a little more difficult than it sounds. Getting up there is easy; you just feel yourself going straight up very fast. But stopping when you get high enough for the drop back down can be quite difficult. Some people, myself included, tend to blast themselves right out of the solar system, sometimes out of the galaxy as well. To avoid this, it is important to control the speed of ascent by keeping an eye on the surface and keeping a constant check on height. I find it easier to project toward the Moon or Sun first, as a way of limiting the initial leap out of the atmosphere. This provides a large visual target that can be projected to in moments. As the target can clearly be seen, speed is not limited. Once out in space, it is a simple matter to head back to Earth, reentering directly over the target and descending rapidly to the surface. In space, away from Earth's atmosphere, there are no problems with speed blurring vision and causing reality shifts. While this may sound like a lengthy process, it can actually be accomplished in a few seconds. Outer Space and Distance Limitations Over the years, I have heard many people claiming they regularly visit the planets of the solar system and other star systems. This appears to be something that could quite easily be done by the projected double, but it is difficult in practice. While the Sun and the Moon are relatively easy to find and to project to, finding other planets in our solar system is not. The solar system is an enormous area and its planets are tiny dots moving in space. They can be difficult to identify with the naked eye, even from orbit. Because our planet rotates once every twenty-four hours, while also orbiting the Sun, the positions of the planets and stars change rapidly and are never in exactly the same place twice. To project to a planet by line of sight, with no navigational instruments to show the way, a real-time projector must have a reasonable grasp of astronomy and must be able to plot the position of the target planet in relation to the surrounding stars with some degree of accuracy. Traveling to the planets of the solar system using the instant projection method does not really work. If an attempt is made to do this, even if using actual photographs taken by space craft as a guide, the projectors usually just shift into an astral realm resembling what they believe their target planet looks like. Real-time projectors need more than just a few photographs and a good imagination to project to a remote real-time location they have never been to. Several astral realms have the definite look and feel of being other planets. I think it's quite possible that over the years some fairly solid astral realms have been created and maintained by the imagination and dreams of the human race. Many projectors travel to these planetlike astral realms, believing they are traveling in real time to their actual locations. There are no limitations to distance, destination, or speed, apart from those few already mentioned. It is therefore possible to travel to the most distant star or galaxy. The speed of thought is infinite, which is really, really, really fast! Traveling at infinite speed in outer space feels like space is folding itself around you. There is hardly any sensation of forward movement apart from the millions of stars flashing by, but enormous distances are traversed in the blink of an eye. If projectors see something ahead and wish to go there, all they have to do is to feel themselves moving toward it and feel it moving toward them; they can be there as quickly as that. I occasionally go out into deep space, where galaxies are just tiny smudges in the distance, just to think and meditate and be alone. I have traveled far into deep space in an attempt to see just how fast and how far I could go, and to find the end of the universe if there is one. I have traveled way beyond the range of mortal telescopes of any type. I have seen galaxies flashing past me like streetlights blurring past the window of a speeding car at night. As far and as fast as I have gone in intergalactic space, with ever-increasing speed, I have never found any place totally devoid of galaxies and stars. Whenever I put a group of galaxies far behind me and think I am getting clear of matter and light, another faint smudge appears on the interstellar horizon. The best I have been able to do so far is to position myself between the faint smudges of far-off galaxies. The physical universe appears to be infinite in size, according to my real-time out-of- body observations. That is, unless I have been somehow traveling in intergalactic circles, which is not inconceivable. Returning from a long-distance projection, no matter how far you, as a projector, have traveled, is very simple. Reach out and feel for your physical body, become aware of it and the room around it. This will usually return you into or close to your body and end the projection in a moment. Following the silver cord back to your physical body only works when you are relatively close to it. At great distance, like in deep space, this will only give you a very rough idea of the direction home. Trying to keep an eye on the silver cord on the way home from a long-distance projection causes a dramatic reduction in speed. This method is thus rendered useless when you consider the vast distance involved and the time limitations, which must always be kept in mind during an OBE. Privacy, Ethics, and OBE An unfounded belief that out-of-body activities are policed from above continues in popularity today. Some believe that if projectors misbehave they will be stopped from having further OBEs — banned by a higher authority. Some even believe an astral police force watches out for and punishes unethical and immoral behavior. According to my experience, this is a complete myth. There are some natural barriers associated with OBE, but no ethical or moral limitations. Conscience and natural consequence are the only true behavioral modifiers. Can you imagine the mind- boggling logistics keeping tabs on several billion projectors — on planet Earth alone, every night? I have found no astral overseers policing the out-of-body environment during my many years of OBE exploration. Some of my out-of-body experiments have most severely tested this theory over the years. But nothing has ever hindered or stopped me from having further OBEs at will. While there are no actual laws governing OBE, there are some natural energetic repercussions to consider. If base emotional urges and behavior are not well-controlled, the quality of OBEs will steadily deteriorate. Deliberate misbehavior"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110 seems to affect projectors' energetic values more than anything else , lowering their potential level of astral operations. Like attracts like in a big way in the out-of-body environment, even in the real-time zone. The attraction of other like-minded projectors and beings is another natural consequence worthy of consideration. This has the effect of segregating miscreants from more civilized projectors, with each operating on different levels of the astral planes. Intentions surrounding real-time privacy issues are also important. Occasional or accidental misbehavior will not attract any noticeable consequences. But repeated, deliberate invasions of privacy and other types of antisocial behavior will quickly generate negativity in the sensitive out-of-body environment. This will progressively worsen until a more civilized approach is taken to OBE. Invading the privacy of others accidentally or through well-intentioned exploration, and not for self-gratification or unethical gain, will not generate any negative repercussions at all. I think the idea that out-of-body behavior is policed stems from some of the early books on OBE, written around the turn of the twentieth century. I am sure their authors would have realized the truth, but they seem to have worried that if the unlimited freedom of OBE were known, projectors may behave in unacceptable ways-unacceptable to them that is. They would have considered it their duty to hide the shocking truth. Motivated by Victorian morality and conscience, a \"Stop it or you'll all go blind!\" kind of blanket caution was thus given. Considering that early books on OBE have been used as reference material ever since and still are quoted in modern works, this warning continues to influence projectors today. Many versions of the astral police force myth have been generated over the years, and continue to be believed in and expanded on today — but not through personal experience, I might add."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"111 26. The Astral Planes The astral planes are, in my opinion, an energetically generated reflection of universal consciousness. They have definite form, order, and structure and are one of the true wonders of our incredible multidimensional universe. The structure of the astral planes can be clearly observed, and even used for navigational purposes, if they are approached from the correct energetic \"angle of perception\". This is my term for the angle at which a projector perceives the astral planes through the direct mind-senses of his or her projectable double. Perception angles vary from projector to projector, with tube-type and plane-type angles of perception being by far the most common. The angle of perception is set by the projectors' energetic makeup and activity during a projection, and is also affected by their belief system. Traditional esoteric theory tells us that the astral dimension contains seven major levels, or planes, each housing a plethora of lesser subplanes, internal realms, and kingdoms. The many different descriptions for this structure — Hindu, Buddhist, spiritualist. New Age, etc ., even the multidimensional theory of modern physics — often appear to conflict, mainly because of cultural and religious beliefs. I have found it impossible to verify any one version of dimensional theory as more accurate than any other . I therefore base my version of the structure of the astral planes on my own experience. Exploring and mapping the astral planes is like trying to explore a whole planet on foot, without maps or instruments. It cannot be done during any single projection. It would have to be done over a great length of time, by highly skilled projectors with good shadow memory recall and excellent organizational and recording skills. Astral planes are complex, multilayered, energetically generated dimensional environments with variable perception-based aspects. A tongue twister, I know, but accurate all the same. The way the astral planes and their contents are perceived, experienced, and remembered can be extremely variable, depending greatly on the projector's level of energetic activity at the time of projection, and on the state of their belief system, their level of consciousness at the time of projection, and the state of their base level of consciousness. All this affects how the physical brain works, and how much of what is perceived during a projection the brain is capable of storing as a recognizable memory. After all, the only thing left after a projection is the memory of it, which will be perceived, interpreted, and recalled by the base level of consciousness only. In the astral dimension, the energetic qualities of travelers' projected doubles strongly affect their angle of perception, more so even than their state or level of consciousness at the time. This is true, I believe, not only during the experience, but also afterward. It affects the memory and how it will be stored in the physical brain at the base level of consciousness, and thus, obviously, how an experience memory will be recalled after the fact. I have explored only a very small part of the astral planes, which constitute an enormous dimensional structure with many different aspects and facets. I have not finished making observations of the primary layers and their surface entrance structures, let alone tried to map out their plethora of internal subplanes and realms. But I will proceed to paint a word picture of the astral planes for you, based on how I have perceived them during my many journeys there. I believe this will provide you with a much better and more understandable look and feel than theory alone could provide. The astral planes, experienced firsthand, can be likened to the pages in a gigantic book, with lightly color-tinted gaps between the pages. These pages, or planes, appear to be hundreds of miles apart during an astral projection. The areas between planes are, I believe, something like buffer zones separating each primary astral plane from the next. These areas vary in color, but have a distinctly similar feel to each of them — a kind of thick, quiet, color-tinted nothingness — oceans of colored empty space. A relationship appears to exist between the colors of these dividing areas and the energetic colors generated by the primary energy centers (major chakras) of the human energy body. The surface of an astral plane is two-dimensional and covered with perfectly straight horizontal and vertical grid lines. This makes for a uniform checkered appearance over the entire surface. Each square on a surface contains a brilliantly multicolored geometric design, repeated endlessly in every other square. The surface of each astral plane has its own unique pattern, completely different from that of any other astral plane's surface pattern. Each astral plane appears two-dimensional when its surface is approached. However, a fully three-dimensional environment is experienced when this is penetrated. Each astral plane also contains connections with every other primary astral plane. These connections appear in the colors and patterns of the surface skin. For example, the violet/purple dot in the middle of each centerpiece of every square (see rear cover) can provide a link with the seventh and highest primary astral plane. And the four gold petals surrounding each dot can provide a link with the sixth primary astral plane. Although I have not yet fully explored its potential, the navy-blue star on which the above structures sit appears to link these with the fifth primary astral plane, the one depicted. However, please keep in mind that if projectors do not have the energetic abilities necessary to transcend the fifth astral plane, entering any of the above will take them to higher internal realms within the fifth astral plane. Experimentation is the only sure way to ascertain whether these structures can be used as doorways to higher primary astral planes. The surface of an astral plane is magnificent and awe-inspiring to behold. These structures are absolutely beyond compare in their artistic, crisp, and colorful beauty; their enormity and grandeur; and their spectacular awe-inspiring power and deep mystery. I am certain that they are logically and intelligently designed structures, much too geometrically neat and intelligently functional to be merely accidental or natural. They appear to have been designed by an intelligence far beyond ours. This illustration and its perspective are not abstract. It is based on my living memories of many conscious-exit projections Fig. 28. Astral plane scene, showing projector's view during approach"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112 and entries into the astral planes. (See rear cover for full-color version of this sketch.) This accurately represents the surface of what I believe to be the fifth astral plane and shows what the surface of an astral plane actually looks like when encountered firsthand during an astral projection. If you can stretch your imagination just a little after looking at these illustrations and the rear cover, try imagining yourself there. Close your eyes and imagine yourself hovering five miles high, looking down onto a spectacularly checkered wonder as depicted above. The following illustrations show how I perceive the primary astral planes. Astral Subplanes My journeys within the astral planes have shown me that each primary astral plane has a complex internal structure, a tangled spectrum of interconnected levels, subplanes, and internal realms, both positive and negative. Dimensionally speaking, many of the internal parts are situated at right angles to the primary astral plane holding them. This description (right angles) is to be considered abstract; there is nothing in the physical dimension to use by way of fair comparison to show how this internal structure actually works. However, the following diagrams attempt to do so in the abstract. Modern physics says that energy cannot be destroyed, but only changed. I believe that this also applies in all other dimensions. Reflected energies of consciousness, radiated into the astral planes from the physical dimension, have many forms, positive and negative, each with many subtle variations. The reflected energy contained within the astral planes originates from raw primal consciousness energy, conditioned by the minds from which they have emanated. The subplanes and lesser realms within each astral plane are parts of an extremely complex energetic filtration system. I can think of no other way to describe the mind-boggling complexity of this process. Internal energetic structures channel negative and positive energies (energetic reflections of consciousness) into different dimensional areas. This appears to be accomplished by natural forces acting as energetic attraction and repulsion mechanisms. Positive and negative energies radiate away from each other then congeal in energetically related holding areas, so that positive and negative energies generated by consciousness are separated and channeled toward the dimensional levels with which they are most precisely in tune. The astral energetic filtering process is most noticeable in the lower internal subplanes. It is not apparent at all on surface structures, nor can it so easily be perceived within the higher astral planes. Higher astral levels seem to attract and filter only refined high-level energies. These flow freely into them from coarse lower-dimensional areas that are not capable of handling high-level energies. Once filtered, these energies appear to take root and energetically contribute to the environment in the dimensional layer, area, realm, or kingdom with which they are most in tune. Positive and negative areas coexist within all subplanes and realms, holding each other dimensionally apart through natural energetic repulsion mechanisms. This energetic filtering effect can often be perceived, during a projection, as a subtle gradient of light, as a gradual brightening or darkening, or as a heaviness or lightness. Gradients of light and atmosphere exist between connected groups of related opposites. There appear to be no hard divisions between positive and negative areas. In practice, if you maintain a single directional heading for any length of time, you will perceive the astral landscape as slowly changing, for better or worse. Your will can override the natural energetic filtering mechanism, allowing you to go wherever you choose. Astral projectors will always naturally project to the astral level they are in tune with energetically, but they can move on from there into positive and negative areas with which they are not naturally in tune. In the astral planes, each connecting energetic gradient has many directions, not all of them obvious to the naked astral eye. Emotional, spiritual, and psychic directions can be taken intuitively, but they must be innate to the projector, as they are not always visibly represented in the internal parts of astral planes. The majority of visible astral plane directions have a reasonably positive outcome. If a positive direction is taken and held, a projector will generally move into a progressively brighter and lighter area, into higher-level areas. The reverse usually will not happen by accident, although it can be brought about by a deliberate act of exploration. If travelers remain focused on what they are doing and have positive-oriented minds, they have very little to worry about in Fig. 29. Seven primary astral planes Fig. 30. Exploded astral plane, showing internal structure (abstract representation) internal sub planes sub-sub planes Cut-away of single astral plane above"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"113 this respect. In practice, travelers wandering the astral planes at random will find themselves experiencing a great many varied and interesting environments. They will not come across any seriously negative areas in their travels unless they actively go looking for them. The underlying intentions and qualities of thought of astral travelers safeguard them from accidentally entering negative areas they are not in tune with energetically. I hope the above description and explanation sheds some light on the question — which I am regularly asked — of why negative areas are found within the astral planes, when the astral is at a higher-dimensional vibration than the physical universe. Positive and negative aspects are related; neither could exist without the presence of the other, as magnets could not exist without having both positive and negative poles. The opposites contained within the structure of the astral planes are not as precisely defined as are the poles of a magnet. Therefore, an often-perceivable atmospheric gradient of energetic opposites exists. Lower Astral Subplanes The lower astral subplanes (traditionally the ones to be avoided) appear to be areas where negative emotion, thought, and fantasy-generated energies have been collecting for a very long time. These areas are home to negative manifestations of the darker side of the human mind and imagination. The fringes of these areas are not dangerous, but are decidedly unpleasant. The very bad lower subplanes are dark, shadowy areas populated (more aptly polluted) with all kinds of demons, monsters, and nightmarish figures. The lowest of these dark areas could aptly be called hellish dimensional areas. If you find yourself in or near a negative area, the common-sense solution is to project away to a brighter area as soon as possible. The fastest way to move away is to strongly imagine somewhere nicer and use instant projection to shift there. Holding an image of the entrance structure firmly in mind and instantly projecting there will usually return you to the surface, without your getting lost or aborting the projection. If this does not work, fly straight up while using uplifting spiritual thoughts, prayer, or song to elevate consciousness. Fly toward the brightest area or spark of light that can be seen above or ahead. An upward direction will usually take a projector away from a negative area. Astral travelers need not pass through negative or lower astral subplanes to travel to more positive and higher astral levels. The negative areas in the astral planes are, in a way, energetically sideways to the normal planelike dimensional structure. It is quite difficult to project deliberately into a seriously bad lower subplane area — or to project into a seriously higher level or plane, for the very same reason. Energetic differences and the natural attraction and repulsion effects generally prohibit this from occurring accidentally. Every projector will have his or her own energetic limitations. The only cases I have come across where projectors have had seriously bad experiences with lower subplanes involved hallucinogenic drugs being used to precipitate out-of-body experiences. Drugs, while capable of causing out-of-body experiences, sidestep the required skills and abilities necessary for safe conscious-exit projection. This breaks many natural laws concerning projection while artificially overcoming many natural safeguards and barriers. Natural barriers are there to protect the novice from operating in dimensional areas they are not equipped to experience. Many drug users have laughed at my stance on this, saying they usually only have positive experiences. But, it only takes one bad experience, one hellish experience, to ruin your mind and your life, possibly forever. Using drugs to achieve OBE is like playing Russian roulette with a live round in the revolver. Astral travelers normally only project into areas with which they are naturally in tune. We each appear to have a natural energetic value set by our level of consciousness, a value affected by many things, including karma, life's path, current lifestyle, and past actions, as well as by natural and developed states of energetic being and potential. During a direct astral projection with no specific astral destination, astral travelers automatically project to the astral plane they are most energetically in tune with at that particular time. This plane will always bear an energetic relationship with their most naturally active primary energy centers. Long-term energetic and spiritual development thus considerably affects which astral planes a projector can attain naturally. Astral Realms and Kingdoms The astral planes can be likened to a vast ocean of reflected thought and emotion and memory that has been slowly filling since the dawn of time. Internal energetic filtration mechanisms of repulsion and attraction cause this ocean to stratify into layers. Many of these layers develop a cohesive integrity that holds them distinctly separate from any other dimensional area. These areas, traditionally called astral realms and kingdoms, are generated by pools of structured, like-minded energies, thoughts, memories, ideas, beliefs, and fantasies that have collected over time. An astral realm is best thought of as a specific environment or world. An astral kingdom is an island or city or town inside a realm: a place that has a single theme and consistent structure. Astral kingdoms are usually civilized areas containing groups of like-minded astral beings. Astral realms vary greatly in size and scope, some appearing to be as small as a country village, while others seem infinite in size and scope. Each realm has a distinct and enduring flavor and atmosphere, and its own unique environment. Many contain native astral inhabitants, with varying levels of intelligence and society. Some appear to be fairly modern structures, while others seem ancient. Astral travelers will normally experience more than one realm or kingdom each time they project into the astral planes. As the astral level to which travelers project is set by their energetic values at the start of a projection, this will normally be well to their liking. They thus will normally find themselves in pleasant areas each time, where they will always feel reasonably comfortable ; albeit often a little perplexed. For most novice astral travelers, a jaunt into the astral planes can be likened to taking a mystery flight and landing in a strange city. A city is a city, however, and although the language, customs, and laws may be different, all cities are peopled"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"114 mostly by recognizably human types. In time, as astral navigation experience is gained, it becomes possible to travel to more- specific destinations and to then explore the astral planes, realms, and kingdoms in a much less haphazard way. Real-Life Astral Regions Some parts of the lower astral areas contain approximations of real life that are often mistaken for reality, or for the real-time zone. These can be thought of as extensions of the real-time zone, containing raw energetic reflections of consciousness, both objective and subjective, that have not yet undergone any noticeable dimensional filtering and ordering. These contain a fluid and changeable mixture of landscapes and structures. While these often seem to bear similarities with the physical dimension, closer examination reveals nothing more than a fluid concoction of subjective astral reflections. Lower astral areas seem to be quite heavily affected by dreaming minds in the local area. They may be a kind of no man's land or a crossover between the real- time zone, the astral planes, and the dream dimensions. Just wandering across what appears to be your hometown, in the lower astral dimension, can take you through many different cities and countries, and often into alien places that do not exist in the real world at all. The lower astral areas are fairly dismal places. Although heavily traveled by projectors, they lack order, are usually badly lit, and seem shoddily put together, a confusing mishmash of cities, landscapes, peoples, and times, all of which appear to be in a constant state of flux. Experiences here can be quite confusing. While these areas are often heavily populated, many of the people found here appear to be half-asleep and wandering astral projectors. They are usually not aware of where they are or of what they are doing, although on the surface many seem actively engaged in performing some task or other. If wakened by another projector, they usually remember who they are but are amazed at where they are. This area is best considered a lower astral subplane, but is not truly negative, although parts of it can contain negative aspects, and anything and everything can be found there. The last time I visited this dimensional area, I found myself floating through a wide corridor, full of twists and turns and crossroads and underpasses. It teemed with people, most of them — judging from the tingly energetic reactions I got as I passed through some of them — other projectors. The place had a faintly ruddy tint to its dim and clammy atmosphere. I felt as if I was inside some giant underground maze. I stopped and spoke politely to several people, but although most were happy to chat, I could not get any real sense out of anyone. Low-level astral projectors, if they are aware, are usually hyper and overexcited. This overexuberance results from the astral experience itself, although it will rarely be remembered. On the other hand, many people in these areas do not know they are projecting. Overall, they mill around like ants with no particular purpose, talking to each other about nothing in particular. I found a few open areas with buildings and more people here and there, but there was no order and the whole place made little sense. I soon got bored with all this and aborted the projection. Voids Dimensional gaps, commonly called voids, are found around the astral planes. They are totally dark and featureless empty areas. Void areas appear to contain absolutely nothing and are thus not in any way dangerous. Entering a void area causes total sensory deprivation in a projector, a quiet blackness with no sensory input. Void areas, according to some versions of esoteric theory, lead to the more abstract causal and transcendental dimensional levels beyond the astral planes. My experience supports this theory. There is no way I know of, unfortunately, to explain or describe the process of transcendence through a void, although an altered state of consciousness is obviously the basic requirement. Voids do not appear to lead into the mental or higher levels of the standard dimensional scale. Many reasons have been given for the occurrence of a void but, by its nature, it is difficult to observe and analyze a void, let alone to try to understand its natural place in the scheme of things. Void areas appear to be null-dimensional areas containing no subjective or objective structure or form whatsoever. It is possible that voids lie completely outside the normal dimensional structure — something like black holes in the physical universe. Do not be scared if you find yourself floating in a void during a projection. There is, quite literally, nothing to be scared of. I do not know how to deliberately enter a void dimensional area. This is just something that happens occasionally. It is not something to be overly concerned about. It is possible that many void OBEs are simple astral vision problems. Many people have problems perceiving the out-of- body environment. An extreme vision problem could, therefore, cause total OBE blindness, leading the projector to perceive being in a void area (see chapter 21). Three ways to project out of a void that occasionally work: Try looking at your hands and watching them melt. Feel for your physical body and try projecting back near to it. Imagine another place and project there using the instant projection method. These methods will often take a projector to somewhere brighter and more tangible. If they fail, simply relax and enjoy it. I find void areas wonderful places for introspection, meditation, and prayer. Nothing will disturb you while you are suspended in a void. Astral Plane- and Tube-Type Structures As you advance in your ability to get about in the real-time zone, and around the first levels of the astral planes, you will Fig. 31. Exploded view of internal subplanes and sub-subplanes, showing realms and kingdoms main astral plane sub plane sub-sub plane realms kingdoms"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"115 begin to see definite structures at the start of astral-plane projections. These structures mark the entrances to different astral planes and subplanes, and can be used for astral-plane navigation. The geometry, colors, and patterns of an astral-plane entrance structure, I believe, represent its internal subplanes, realms, and kingdoms in an abstract visual way. Projectors can perceive two basic types of structures when they enter the astral planes through their surfaces: Astral Plane-Type Structure — a flat, two-dimensional plane of infinite proportions, usually first seen as if from a great height, with the plane's surface seen below extending to all horizons. The surface is covered in thin, black, neatly spaced, horizontal and vertical grid lines, making for a neat, checkered appearance. These grid lines outline squares that cover the entire surface. Each square contains a single, identical multicolored geometric pattern, repeated endlessly in every other square. Astral Tube-Type Structure — a more complex tunnel or tubelike structure, containing internal grid lines and geometric patterns, often brightly colored. The grid lines and patterns are internal, thus are not as easily viewed in their entirety as with the astral plane-type of entrance structure. Projectors also usually hear a rushing sound, musical notes, tones, and other sounds as they move through an astral tube. These sounds are, I believe, part of the obviously more complex astral tube structure. Moving through a tube usually produces a rushing sound; each exit point passed often produces a change in sound or tones and melodies or a series of complex musical notes. Projectors can use either of these structures to successfully enter and navigate the astral planes. Which type of structure is perceived appears to be set by the projector's energetic value and angle of perception at the time of projection. The similarities between astral tube-type and plane-type entrance structures indicate they share an underlying relationship. In both cases, projectors see definite astral structures containing grid lines and colorful geometric designs. Using either type also has the same result. These structures are consistent and will be found unchanged every time the same part of the astral planes is visited. It is reasonable to suggest that tube-type and plane-type structures are one and the same thing — astral-plane surface entrance structures. I further suggest that the apparent differences in these entrance structures are caused solely by the angle of approach, the energetic perception angle, used by different projectors. Projectors are approaching the same astral entrance structure from different dimensional angles — from a different point of view. These different angles of approach show projectors completely different aspects of the very same astral entrance structure. The tube-type astral entrance structure can thus be thought of as something like a rolled-up astral plane-type entrance structure, but whether rolled up or unrolled it is one and the same thing, just perceived differently, from different angles of perception. These different perception angles, I think, are caused by different patterns and levels of activity of primary energy centers within individual projectors. Primary energy center activity (chakra activity) sets the dimensional angle of a projector's approach. Which type of astral entrance structure is perceived is set by the level, quality, and pattern of energetic activity within the energy bodies of individual projectors. Projectors with strong brow or crown centers often feel themselves leaving their physical bodies through their head or brow areas; they generally perceive a tube-type astral entrance structure. Projectors with strong heart or throat centers usually feel themselves leaving through the front of their physical bodies; they generally perceive a plane-type astral entrance structure. The type of projection exit therefore gives some indication of the level on which you are operating, and, in turn, indicates the type of entrance structure you can expect to encounter. The level of primary energy center activity (chakra activity) affects the complexity of the two basic types of astral-plane entrance structures at the time of projection. For example, a projector with a naturally strong, but only lightly active, brow or crown center at the time of a projection may only perceive a very basic tube-type astral entrance structure, perhaps black and white, with no colorful embellishments or musical notes and tones. This same projector, projecting at another time when the brow or crown centers are more energetically active, may perceive a much more elaborate and colorful version of the same astral tube-type entrance structure. Another way of explaining the above is to draw a comparison between these different angles of perception using three different types of cameras. Let's say we take a picture of you first with a normal camera, then with a movie camera, then with an x-ray camera. The first picture will show you in all your glory, with your surface and face and hair all intact (astral plane- type entrance structure) in still life. The second picture will show more detail and movement, but is really just an enhanced version of the first type of picture. The third picture shows your complex internal structure and organs, minus your surface (astral tube-type entrance structure). Each camera shows essentially the same thing, but each provides a quite different view, from a different energetic angle of perception. Astral Plane-Type Entrance Structure The astral plane-type entrance structure is the one I am most familiar with. I use it more often than I do the tube-type structure, as I find it easier to find, use, and navigate with. The atmosphere above the plane, surrounding the projector, is faintly color-tinted, as if consisting of thin vapor radiating from the astral plane's surface. This color-tint is not apparent when looking directly down upon the surface, but can be seen misting all horizons. If projectors tear their eyes away from the spectacle of the surface beneath them, and turn around and look behind, they will see a colored blur as far as they can see, like looking into deep space on a clear and starless night. To enter an astral plane-type entrance structure, simply dive toward it while gazing upon its surface and keeping your mind reasonably clear. Chose a square as you get closer — any square will do — and aim for the part of its pattern you wish to enter through. The chosen square and its pattern will grow steadily larger, until it is about football-field size. The transition through the surface is quite distinct, but is accompanied by no real sensation. Once through the surface pattern, you will usually find yourself inside an astral realm, or you may find yourself temporarily in another faintly colored buffer zone, which indicates that you are approaching an internal subplane. If you enter a colored buffer zone, you must keep traveling in the same direction until you get to an astral realm. This usually only takes a few seconds."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"116 To move among the subplanes, you can change direction while inside, moving at a different angle from your original direction. If you are not sure which way to go or cannot make up your mind, any angle between straight ahead and straight up will generally have positive results. This is a bit of a hit-and-miss affair and it's usually best to explore the realm at hand, rather than risk accidentally aborting the projection while trying to shift elsewhere. Always keep in mind that like any OBE , astral projection time is limited. Time out is best linked to how long it takes the physical/etheric body to fall into the deep-sleep state. Wise projectors take advantage of what they find and explore what is at hand while they have the time to do so. This is not as limiting as it sounds, as time is quite variable in the astral environment. Time generally passes much slower there, especially in the higher astral planes, and quite a lot can be accomplished even if you only have a few minutes of real time to work with. Astral Plane-Type Navigation A fairly reliable way to navigate with the astral plane-type entrance structure is to use the surface pattern as a guide. There is a direct relationship between the individual parts of this design and the internal parts, subplanes, and realms within. The point of entry defines exactly where you will appear. Therefore, if you remember the exact point of entry and note it in a journal after the projection, you can return to a given astral realm or kingdom again and again during future projections. With a little experimentation, you can develop an astral map for that astral plane. The comers of each square contain small but distinct dots and splashes of color that look like yellow, green, orange, and red paint. Each of these appears to be an entry point into a specific internal realm or kingdom. The fifth astral-plane surface pattern centerpiece (see rear cover) is a curved, six-pointed, dark-blue star surrounded by a crisp, thin, yellow outline, topped by a four- petaled gold flower, topped by a circular purple center, set in an indigo-blue background. The background color appears to denote the level of that plane in the astral spectrum. Any part of the comer patterns or centerpiece will take you into the more structured realms within that astral plane. If the purple centerpiece is penetrated dead center, it will take you to the highest possible internal realm within that plane. The gold flower and its purple center, I believe, is what is referred to by the famous Buddhist mantra: \"The jewel in the heart of the lotus\". As with all astral entrance structures, different projectors will experience slight differences peculiar to them due to slight variations in their energetic angle of perception. But astral planes and their entrance structures are dimensionally solid and consistent structures, and will be found to be in line with the descriptions I have given. Astral Tube-Type Entrance Structure Many projectors leave their bodies by way of their heads and find themselves rushing through an astral tube-type structure, or they find the entrance to the astral tube waiting nearby after their exit out of body, leaving them the option of entering the tunnel or not. This is useful if a projector wants to spend a few minutes in real time before entering the astral planes. Personally, I much prefer the astral plane-type entrance structure, as I can find my way around a lot easier that way. I do not know any reliable way of deliberately finding an astral tube-type entrance structure during a projection. They are either found or not found at the start of it. Please do not be afraid of entering and exploring the astral tube if you come across it during a projection — no matter what you might have heard. They will not harm you in any way! Many people have reported to me that the sight of this tube is too much like the tunnel of light they have heard about, as reported by people who have had near-death experiences. They have thus refused to enter them through simple caution or fear — and missed out on the experience of a lifetime. Let me reassure you, there is no possible way you can hurt yourself. There is also no possible way you can go too far simply by using an astral tube-type entrance structure. Enter the astral tube-type structure and you immediately find yourself rushing through it. You feel a sensation of great speed and often hear a rushing sound like air whooshing past you. Grid lines and colors and patterns and tones and musical notes change as you move through it. Exits appear at regular intervals, marked by definite changes in the colors, tones, and patterns around you. Sometimes you experience brief mind's-eye visions and/or intuitive feelings of where exits lead. Use your intuition to pick an exit that appeals to you, or choose one you know from experience, or just take a wild guess and jump into one. Alternatively, just hang on, enjoy the astral tube roller-coaster ride, and see where you end up. The tube will not hurt you no matter what you do. The look and feel of the colors, patterns, and musical tones surrounding exit points inside a tube-type structure can provide a fair guide to the type of astral level or realm they lead to. Murky colors with too much black or gray, with low and discordant or unpleasant-sounding tones, for example, will most probably take you to lower astral subplanes. Lots of pretty red, orange, green, blue, yellow, purple, and gold, on the other hand, accompanied by harmonious or pleasant-sounding tones or musical notes, will take you to higher levels and realms. Simply dive into your chosen exit as you pass by it and you'll suddenly find yourself inside an astral realm. The exit is quite dramatic, like entering another world. If you memorize the patterns, colors, tones, and the look and feel of an exit, you will be able to find this realm again during later projections. More astral tube-type entrance structures may appear during the course of a single astral tube-type projection. If you want to return to the tube and cannot see it, image it strongly in your mind's eye and it will often appear somewhere close by. Alternatively, you can try an instant projection back inside it. Another way of finding it again is to reach out and feel for your physical body and try to project back near to it. The astral tube will often be found waiting near your physical body — but sometimes not. As projection time is always limited, I suggest that you explore whatever is at hand instead, rather than starting all over and wasting good projection time. Tunnel of Light Many projectors report shooting at high speed through a tunnel of light when they project, then ending up somewhere"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"117 inside the astral planes. Some people perceive the astral tunnel-type entrance structure as plain black and white with grid lines. Others perceive it as being multicolored or embellished in many other ways. It is, therefore, reasonable to suggest the tunnel of light may simply be another perception angle version of the same basic astral tube-type entrance structure. On the other hand, it is also possible that at times a brief tunnel-of-light effect can be caused by the initial blurring of stars as a projector travels at extreme velocity through the galaxy, until reality shifts and they enter the astral planes proper. By this, I do not mean that the astral planes have an actual spatial location in the physical universe. A sudden burst of great speed through the atmosphere and into outer space, however, can blast a projector quickly out of real time and straight into the astral planes, with simple disorientation causing the resulting dimensional shift. Finding Astral Entrance Structures Many projectors, though able to operate well in the real-time zone, seem unable to deliberately enter the astral planes. They may occasionally slip into astral realms spontaneously, but they are unable to perceive any type of astral entrance structure at all, which makes astral navigation extremely difficult. Perceiving some type of entrance structure (either tube-type or plane- type) is necessary for projectors to explore and return to specific astral regions, or to find their way into higher dimensional levels. On the other hand, many projectors seem unable to operate in the real-time zone. They tend to slip directly into astral realms, while also bypassing any recognizable type of surface entrance structure. I spent many early years of conscious-exit projection stuck in the real-time zone. I found it difficult to deliberately enter the astral planes, although this did happen occasionally, until I learned a few tricks to overcome this awkward dimensional hurdle. The method I use and recommend for getting into the astral planes is this: Starting near ground level, aim midway between the horizon and straight up and take off. Fly at the greatest speed possible. Start moving upward and feel and become aware of the star-filled universe spread out before you. Even if it's daylight, image this in your mind's eye as you reach out and feel for the stars beyond Earth's atmosphere. Fill your mind with the feeling of enormous distance and shoot for the stars. The incredible acceleration this causes makes your vision blur momentarily, and you may experience a brief tunnel-of-light effect. To increase accuracy, you can instead hold an image of the rear cover art of this book in your mind's eye as you shoot for the stars. The first sign you'll have that you have succeeded is the dimensional shift, which feels like a brief falling sensation accompanied by a moment of blurring disorientation. You will then either find yourself in a color-tinted area close to an astral plane-type entrance structure — (which is most likely) — or you may find yourself already inside an astral realm, which is slightly less likely. Even less likely, you may find yourself near or inside an astral tube-type entrance structure. This method takes a little practice, but does work and is fairly reliable. Once you get to an astral entrance structure, you should be able to find your way back there again. Simply hold the remembered image or the look and feel strongly in mind as you shoot for the stars. The rear cover art of this book gives a fairly accurate representation of what a real astral-plane entrance structure actually looks like. This is taken from my living memory and has been interpreted by an artist for this purpose. If you can image this strongly enough in your mind's eye, you should be able to project to this plane fairly easily. Look on this picture as a kind of astral mud-map to an entrance structure. If this method fails entirely, which is highly unlikely, you may find yourself on the other side of the galaxy, or in another galaxy. If this happens, enjoy space flight and explore. Nothing you might do can possibly hurt you, no matter how far or how fast you go. You simply cannot get lost in space. Do not worry about finding your way back to your body, either. Your physical body will pull you back if it needs to, or you can simply feel for your body and return to it. Returning to an Astral Plane The colorful geometric pattern on the surface of each astral-plane entrance structure is distinctly different from that found on the surface of any other astral-plane entrance structure. This pattern appears to be a kind of dimensional color-coding, abstractly representing the internal components of each astral plane. The different color tinting found in the open-space areas near astral planes may also correspond with the level of the astral planes being traveled. Using the known spectrum as a basic guide can give projectors some idea of where they are among the astral planes. Keep in mind that there are many colors above the normal physical spectrum that can only be perceived while out of body. Some astral colors are impossible to describe, there being nothing in the physical dimension with which to compare them. I suggest these be judged intuitively and by their beauty. It may be possible to use buffer zone colors to project to specific levels of the astral planes. This is a good start for new projectors, and definitely worth experimenting with, especially if you are having trouble getting into the astral planes. The success of this will depend on how well you can fill your mind with the chosen color during a projection. You must image the color and let it fill your mind's eye, while feeling yourself moving or falling into it, in exactly the same way as you would use the instant projection method. When you appear there, you must keep moving ahead in your original direction; hopefully, an astral-plane entrance structure will soon appear. The virtual reality projection method (see chapter 24) can also be used for this purpose. If a poster of a single bright primary color is entered, as per the VRP technique, it may be possible to cause a dimensional shift directly into the astral level associated with that color. If the surface pattern of an astral plane can be re-created as a picture, this can also be used, as per VRP technique, to project directly to the surface of that astral plane. The rear cover of this book is, again, ideal for this purpose. Skull Rock The following is an astral-plane experience of mine, showing typical astral plane-type entrance structures, as I perceive them. This projection happened at about one in the afternoon. I did no energy work, trance, or meditation before it, as I was"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118 intending to have a nap and not a projection. I was resting well, but although I was extremely tired I could not fall asleep — too much morning coffee maybe. I soon felt myself falling into trance and the first trickles of energetic movement and vibrations started spreading throughout my body. I began seeing into the real-time zone around me through my closed eyelids, so decided to go astral for a while. I exited using the instant rope technique (see chapter 19) and staggered free of my body. I literally staggered, feeling weak and having little energy or directional control. This told me I was too close to my too-awake physical body and mind. I floated with some difficulty through the wall of my room to get away from my physical body. As I passed through the wall, I felt a tingling, electrical type of buzzing and heard a definite Velcro-like ripping sound. I saw the inside of the wall very clearly and brightly lit as I passed through it. I staggered away toward the main room like a drunkard, intending to give my nephew, Matt, a good dose of goose bumps by passing through his physical body. I had very little control and felt my physical body trying to drag me back to it. I was still too close to my physical body, and was probably further weakened by making too rapid an exit without any preliminary energetic work. I decided to get out of the house for a while, thinking this should fix the problem. I staggered into the spare room and fell sideways through the window and out into the front yard. I rolled and floated over the front lawn and dragged myself away from the house. I soon started feeling better. I skimmed across the road into the park opposite the house. I waited there for a few moments, hugging a big old gum tree while I concentrated on drawing more energy into myself, feeling it coursing into me from my physical/etheric body back in the house. Much stronger now, I flew toward the beach just over a mile away, feeling better now I was airborne and well away from the house. It was a glorious sunny day with a brilliant-blue sky and very few clouds. Picking a point well above the horizon, I reached out and felt for the star-filled universe hidden beyond the blue. I willed myself to hyperspeed, increasing speed dramatically. Everything blurred as I shot myself out into space through a brief tunnel of blurred starlight. I felt a dimensional shift and found myself somewhere in the astral dimension. After I flew through darkness for a few moments, a brighter area of deepest blue, like the evening sky, appeared all around me. I came upon a vast astral-plane entrance structure. Spread out several miles beneath me, its crisp-blue surface beckoned me, covered with spectacular grid-lined patterns. This was absolutely breathtaking to behold firsthand and I hovered a while, breathing it all in. Every square of its grid-lined structure was filled with the same spectacular, multicolored geometric pattern. This was the doorway to an astral plane, to other worlds within. It spread out beneath me as far as I could see in all directions, filling my every horizon. It is difficult to describe such an enormous spectacle as lay beneath me. In the physical world there is nothing with which to draw a fair comparison. I suppose skydiving from a great height over checkered fields of farmland would be the closest to it. I was excited and awestruck by this spectacular geometric beauty. Without further hesitation I swan-dived toward the surface. A tingling rush of energy flooded through my astral body and I screamed out joyfully, as loud as I could, \" Geronimoooo... Heeeee... Haaaaaa!\" and heard my voice booming loud and clear throughout the astral dimension. As I neared the patterned entrance, I felt an almost tangible humming of power in the atmosphere around me. The square I'd picked as a target grew steadily larger and larger, but remained sharply distinct until the final moment as I plunged into it. There was no sensation of impact, but the transition was dramatic. I suddenly found myself in what seemed like deep-blue water, much thicker than the tinted atmosphere I'd just left. Visibility was extremely good, and I could see for hundreds of meters in all directions. Fora moment I thought I was in another buffer zone. Then I noticed tiny bubbles and bits of matter all around me, indicating I was indeed under water. I headed upward at a slight angle toward a lighter area that I guessed to be the surface. A sparkling movement caught my eye. Angling back down I flew to investigate. I saw a school of several enormous fish in the distance. Drawing closer, I saw these were round, flat, and brightly colored, looking much like tropical Discus fish. These were much larger than the biggest whales that ever swam the oceans of Earth. Swimming among these fancy behemoths were sharks, but the sharks were tiny compared to the enormous fish — like minnows among stately giants . One of the great fish looked at me as I flew slowly through their giant school. It watched me calmly with one great big friendly eye the size of an automobile as I floated past. I sensed intelligence, curiosity, and ... something like amusement coming from the great fish. Spiraling upward, I surfaced among lively ocean waves, and soared into a glorious indigo sky. Two suns shone down on me, one large and orange and one small and yellow. Several miles away to my right was a shoreline with a small bay lined with creamy yellow sands . Sparkling-white strips of surf rolled endlessly toward the beach, standing starkly out from the blue ocean. Jutting out from the shore on the left point of the bay was a massive pale shape. I looked closer: A skull-shaped rock with cavernous shadows for eyes peered back at me, looking to be several hundred feet high. Spinning around and taking it all in, I spied several large sailing ships of curious design several miles away. They were tall, wooden, oceangoing vessels, heavy, high, and bull-nosed in the prow, but impossibly low from midship to stern. The sails were rigged in a way I had never seen before, with V -angled masts underlined with heavy booms, looking something like giant batwing sails, stretching way out across their beams. People were crawling like ants over the decks and rigging. I dived toward them as they tacked, all turning in unison with sails and tackle cracking, spray blasting from their ornately carved bows as they heaved gamely into the lively white-crusted rollers. I landed near the ship's wheel on the high foredeck of the lead ship. I had served for several years on merchant ships as a lad, so knew something of nautical matters, but this looked and felt like no other ship I had ever seen. I couldn't work out how they angled their sails to tack properly, but they seemed to be doing just fine and were moving along at a fairly good clip. The stern of the ship was impossibly low in the water and, looking back, I could see it was loaded with cargo held down with what looked like heavy nets. Each time the ship tacked, waves washed over the nets, which seemed an odd way to store any kind of cargo. Intrigued, I floated back to take a closer look. The cargo was made up of bales of broad-leafed, green-brown spotted seaweed, fine net bags of black shellfish, and tied bundles of some kind of sea worm that looked like coils of rope lashed to wooden pallets. Everything was covered with heavy netting to keep the cargo from washing away. The wet storage area now made a lot of sense. The crew were vaguely European looking, dark haired and heavily built, tanned and dressed in rough gray shirts with brown pants cut and frayed at the knees. They had beaded rope headbands and black cloth belts rolled and knotted about their waists. As I made my way back toward the ship's bridge, I saw a woman perched near the ship's wheel on a large bale of something like wool. She was watching me, but turned her head sharply whenever I looked back at her. The only woman on deck, she seemed in charge of the ship. She was smaller and lighter than the men, wearing a seamless knee-length shift of fine off-white material tied at the waist with a wide, braided rope belt . Her dark-brown hair hung almost to her waist when it wasn't fanned out by the breeze. A small bone-handled knife protruded from under her belt. She touched this briefly as I approached her, then seemed to change her mind and folded her arms tightly. She glared at me, her almost-golden eyes glinting a silent warning. I glanced down at myself to make sure I was dressed. Fair enough, shorts and T-shirt, my standard astral garb. Sporting my most winning smile, I respectfully asked her what this world was called, but she turned her head sharply away. I moved to catch"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"119 her eye again, but she snapped her head away again. Moving closer, I proffered another smile, but she hopped off the bale and marched to a raised wooden hatchway nearby. I called after her and she half-turned and barked something at me as she disappeared down the hatch. I couldn't make out what she'd said, but could pretty much guess what it meant. Shrugging, I approached a few of the deck hands as they went about the business of running their ship. They either turned away or stood staring sullenly at the deck, ignoring me. This was most peculiar, I thought. The people in most astral realms will usually talk to you, if only to tell you what they think of your intrusion into their lives. They could all see me and I felt fairly solid here, but no one wanted anything to do with me. I felt very unwelcome and soon left the ship. I circled around the fleet for a short while before giving up on it, deciding to take a long sweeping pass over the shoreline. Landing atop the skull-shaped rock, I explored its top. It had a smooth, weathered limestone surface with an ancient kind of musty feel to it. This reminded me of a time I had played in Stonehenge as a boy, before they put the big fence all around it. I saw no one and nothing of further interest along the shore or on the rock, apart from a few peculiar furry-looking seagulls. Everything appeared very peaceful here and, apart from the unfriendly seagoing inhabitants hereabouts, I decided I quite liked the place. Knowing my time was probably short, I decided to get moving and explore some more of this realm. Lifting off, I flapped my arms for extra speed (don't laugh, this works) and took up my original trajectory, soon leaving the skull-shaped rock far behind me. Before I could go any further, I felt that old familiar weakness tugging at me as my body started dragging me back to it. The dimensional shift blurred my vision with a brief falling sensation. I fell back into my body and caught the sides of the bed as I awoke. Sitting up I reached for my journal, feeling well rested after my unexpected astral jaunt. As an example for future reference, the keywords I entered into my journal to describe the above experience were weak, stars, blue plane, patterns, swan-dive, fish n ships, skull. This is all I needed to cement the memories of the experience into my brain so they could not get lost. I then proceeded to fill in all the details. Note that the order of the keywords is used as a guide to denote the sequence of events. Navigating the Astral Realms It is not necessary to perceive an astral-plane entrance structure in order to enter realms and to move among them, although this is obviously a far more accurate way of navigating. Most people will find they can project directly into astral realms without too much trouble, bypassing any kind of entrance structure entirely. This can be likened to taking mystery flights every projection. There are many ways to get into astral realms and to move from one astral realm to another. These all cause a dimensional shift, moving the projector into an astral realm, or to other astral locations. • Imagine a place you'd like to be (instant travel). Don't be afraid to imagine a fantasy destination. For example, if you'd like to travel to the Skull Rock astral realm, as given above, re-create the illusion generated in your mind's eye by my description of it and feel yourself shifting toward it or falling into it. • Raise your energy level by drawing more energy from your physical/etheric body. Feel yourself sucking and drawing energy into your projected body. As you do this, feel your vibrations increasing. Feel yourself buzzing and humming all over with power, increasing in intensity and pitch, while feeling yourself growing lighter and rising. Feel yourself rising and shifting into the astral planes. • Fly as fast as you can, aiming midway between the horizon and straight up, while reaching out and feeling the star- filled galaxy ahead of you. Will, imagine, and feel yourself shooting through the stars at hyperspeed. • Walk into a mirror, picture, or TV screen, as per the virtual reality projection technique (see chapter 24). Use this as a staging area and fly in one direction until you find yourself in an astral realm. • Look at your hands and watch them melt away until they are completely gone. Your subconscious mind will have trouble accepting this, which will cause a dimensional shift, transporting you into an astral realm. This can also be used for shifting to another realm. • Spin around as fast as you can and attempt to disorient yourself. This will often cause a dimensional shift and move you into an astral realm, or cause a shift to another realm. Hand Glance Stabilization Your projected double's hands can be very handy during a projection — if you'll pardon the awful pun. You can not only use them to cause a dimensional shift, but you can also use them to stabilize a wavering projection whenever reality fluctuations begin eroding it. To stabilize a projection, briefly glance at your hands then look away again before they start melting. Do this as often as you need, briefly glancing at them every half minute or so if you need to. The hand-glance technique seems to send a small energetic shock wave back down the silver cord, which stimulates the physical/etheric body and mind, causing it to provide the projected double with more energy. This also appears to delay the physical body's entry into the deep-sleep state. The duration of a projection can thus be lengthened and made more memorable. This is especially effective during real-time projections. Astral Rest and Recovery Areas Many people, when they die, seem to shift into astral rest and recovery areas. Spirits rest and sleep in these areas until they recover from conditions imposed on them during their lives and are ready to progress into the spirit world proper and take more active roles in their afterlives. If you enter these recovery areas, you usually perceive a hospital-like scenario. You see spirits resting and sleeping and being cared for in a hospital-like environment. You even see nurses and doctors caring for these spirit patients. This does not mean there is an actual hospital-like astral realm where advanced spirit beings care for recovering spirits; most likely the projector's mind creates the hospital scenario. The projector's angle of perception interprets the energies contained within astral rest and recovery areas, and translates them into living metaphorical imagery. Raised energetic activity and altered states of consciousness can allow projectors to project into higher dimensional levels."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"120 All experiences of this nature must be downloaded and interpreted before the physical brain can interpret and store them as understandable and recallable memories. This accounts for the abstract metaphorical nature of all higher-level experiences. It also accounts for the difficulties inherent in interpreting and understanding them, at the normal base level of waking consciousness natural to the physical body. I have visited astral rest and recovery places many times. The hospital-like scenario and atmosphere is always similar, but each room I visit is quite different. These rooms seem to reflect the life conditions surrounding patients at the time of their passing. As I said, I do not really think there is an actual hospital floating around somewhere in the astral dimension, staffed by beings intent on nursing sick and tired spirits back to good health, although this is a beautiful thought. I believe this scenario is created by my own mind as it interprets the energies broadcast from these areas in the only way it can. This perception interpretation is done according to my mind's own learned mental associations, as well as by those set in me by the collective consciousness of mankind. As this is a healing, rest, and recovery area for the recently departed, my mind interprets this as a hospital-type scenario staffed by caring doctors and nurses. The doctors and nurses who staff and run this astral hospital do not appear to be real spirit beings. So far I have not been able to strike up anything resembling a meaningful conversation with any of them. They seem to be very two-dimensional. On the other hand, many of the people/spirits I have met there who seem to be visiting or waiting for a patient in the hospital seem to be quite real. Many spirit visitors respond and converse in a reasonably normal fashion. Spirits I have spoken with in this situation do not seem to be aware of the length of time that has elapsed since they passed over, or of many details concerning their afterlife since that time. Memories of their earthly life also seem vague, much like a half-forgotten dream. Many spirits seem to be aware only of their present reality, that of being in one place, the hospital scenario, for an indeterminate length of time. Some spirits do have vague memories of coming from other dimensional areas, but have so far given me only very sketchy details. Often they will speak of a warm, brightly lit, interesting place where they have many friends and loved ones, but with little more detail than this. The most common response I get from asking spirits what it's like where they come from is: \"It's really lovely there and everyone is so nice. I don't understand this. I'm very sorry. I know it well and can picture it in my head, but I just can't describe it to you\". The dreamlike quality of memory exhibited by visiting spirits in this astral hospital area may be caused by their being too far away from their natural base level of consciousness at the time. Keep in mind here that the natural, or base, level of a spirit is, logically, in one of the spirit worlds, and no longer in the physical dimension. It seems that any shift away from the natural base level of consciousness, either for spirit beings or human beings, causes memory translation problems. This translation problem also accounts, I believe, for the many difficulties and vagaries common to spirit communications and channeling in general."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"121 Fig. 32. Silver cord, showing attachment differences on the physical body and on the projected double 27. The Silver Cord The famous silver cord is an intricate structure of energy filaments that, like an umbilical cord, links the physical/etheric body (original copy) with its projected double, during any type of OBE, including near-death experiences ( NDEs). The silver cord forms an unbreakable energetic link between the physical/etheric body and its projected double, enabling a continual two- way telepathic, emotional, and energetic flow, not all on the conscious level. I say including NDEs as, logically, if a person survives temporary physical death there must have been some unsevered energetic linkage between the physical/etheric body and its projected NDE double. This is the only thing that would enable the reconnection of the temporarily defunct physical body with its projected double when the physical body is brought back to life. The projected double must be constantly supplied with the correct type of energy needed to support its functionality and integrity on whatever level it is operating. The amount and quality of energy flowing into the projected double greatly affects its capabilities during any type of OBE. A good flow of energy strengthens its ability for coherent thought and movement and enables a stronger memory download during its eventual reintegration with its physical counterpart. Without enough energy flowing into it, consciousness and memory become weak and muddled and control over the projected double becomes difficult. Consciousness needs a lot of energy. The presence of waking consciousness in any subtle body creates a strong energy demand, which causes a much stronger flow of energy into that particular subtle body than into any other. This tends to weaken all other subtle bodies, but allows the active subtle body to better maintain its conscious integrity and functionality. Energetic development can overcome this to some extent, but all projectors have only a finite amount of energy with which to operate. The amount of energy available to any projector will only spread so far. Silver Cord Location There is disagreement about the silver cord's existence and location. Some people claim that it is attached to the navel, some that it is attached to the brow, and others claim that it does not exist at all. My out-of-body observations show the silver cord does indeed exist, but is seen only when deliberately looked for. The attachment site of the silver cord on the physical body is extremely difficult to ascertain during projection. There appear to be several smaller cords, one extending from each of the primary energy centers (major chakras) of the physical/etheric body, as well as many smaller, wispy filaments extending from some of the larger secondary energy centers (minor chakras), especially in the torso and head areas. These appear to flow over the surface of the physical body and finally web together to form a single main cord, a couple of inches from the surface of the physical body. To my way of thinking, the silver cord is attached not to the physical body but to the etheric body. The attachment of the silver cord to the projected double appears to be at a single point only and shows no such weblike structure of smaller filaments making up a larger main silver cord. The silver cord is not always attached to the same area on every projected double. It will always be seen on the side directly facing the location of the projector's physical body, but this direction can often be quite difficult to ascertain, dimensionally speaking. There are several possible reasons for reports by many different projectors over the years of different silver cord locations on the projected double. The first is the effect belief can have on the fluid out-of-body environment, and hence on the appearance of the projected double. Beliefs are strong foundation structures for thought. They can have a strong effect on what is perceived during any projection. Just as self-image shapes the projected double, so the silver cord will usually be seen just where it is expected to be seen. If a silver cord is not believed in, and as a result is not expected, it usually will not be seen or noticed at all during a projection, even if actively looked for. I remember, during early childhood projections, seeing my silver cord as attached to my navel area. I had no beliefs that could affect the silver cord at this time, having no idea what it was — which adds weight to my observations. I have since observed the silver cord attached to three other places on my projected double: chest, throat, and brow. This positioning seems to vary according to the type of projection I am experiencing at the time. The silver cord is named for its overall silvery, sparkling appearance. It is quite beautiful. It seems to vary in size and apparent density, probably affected by the energies flowing through it at the time of observation. It usually appears to be about an inch or two in diameter. The outer covering of the silver cord glows with a faintly sparkling-silver hue, but closer inspection reveals a constantly moving, multicolored, speckled type of structure all through it. Inside the silver cord, clouds of tiny, fast- moving motes of energy can be seen flowing rapidly in all directions. This looks a bit like the moving static seen on a color TV that has been tuned off-station. Projectors touching the silver cord or passing their hands through it sometimes feel a faint tingle. In real time, if closely observed, the location of the silver cord is seen to change as the projected double moves and turns. It always stays fairly straight, never bent or kinked, and is always seen on the side of the projected double facing its physical body. This in itself can cause the silver cord to be seen as being attached to a variety of locations on the projected double. In more dimensionally removed areas, where there is no real direction toward the physical body, the silver cord is usually seen extending from the front of the projected double. Also, the level of energetic activity within the physical/ etheric body at the time affects the observation of different attachment sites. The strength and level of activity within each primary energy center vary greatly, and different primary energy centers work in varying combinations and strengths for different types of projection and projection-related activities."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"122 This is because many different types of energies are necessary to maintain the integrity of the projected double in different dimensional levels and circumstances. The strongest and most active primary energy centers will logically have more visible energy filaments extending from them. Energetic activity in the physical/etheric body is reflected into the projected double, and this very likely affects the location of the silver cord's attachment there. If a projector has a naturally strong and active brow center, for example, the silver cord will usually be most visible in that area. It will be seen extending from the brow area of both their physical and projected aspects. There appears to be a widespread belief that the silver cord is vulnerable. Many people have written to me over the years, worried about what might happen if their silver cord were somehow damaged or — heaven forbid — even severed, through a mishap or some kind of entity attack, during a projection. Many people refuse to even attempt projection because of this. These fears are totally unfounded and based entirely on the empty body assumption, which I have already dealt with earlier in this book (see chapter 3). I have never come across a single instance where this has happened, not even a near miss. I have come across nothing that would make me entertain this as even a remote possibility worthy of serious consideration. In my experience it is not possible to damage the silver cord. The silver cord, as far as I can ascertain, is invulnerable and therefore unbreakable. I have spent a lot of time out of my body, and have experimented, explored, and ranged widely. I have often found myself in some pretty extreme situations. If it were possible to be destroyed by severing the silver cord, I would certainly have died many times over. Nor can it be damaged simply because a projection is suddenly ended, no matter under what circumstances or how abruptly. Silver Cord Sighting This case history from my e-mail files shows an extremely rare sighting of a real-time sleep projector and his silver cord by another awake person. Note that the silver cord was seen here as coming from the projected double's side and not from an actual primary energy center site. The attachment site of this was most probably affected by the position of the projected double at this time (floating on his side) as previously discussed. I tried to project with your new rope technique. My wife and I watched TV in bed until both of us were drowsy and falling asleep. I then relaxed and tried to feel myself climbing hand over hand up a rope to the ceiling of my bedroom. I passed out sometime during this and do not remember succeeding with the projection, but my wife awoke later during that night to go to the bathroom. She saw what she described as a big \"teddy bear\" floating in the air a few feet above my sleeping body, connected to my side by a glowing silver ribbon. She thought she was dreaming and rubbed and closed her eyes several times, but the same image remained whenever she reopened them. She waved her hand through the teddy bear and silver ribbon several times but could not feel anything solid. Perplexed, she convinced herself it was not real and that she must be dreaming and eventually fell back to sleep again. Later that night she re-awoke and the image was gone. This case history shows the sighting of a typical sleep projection in progress. The extruded real-time body here mimics the sleeping position of its physical body, and is basically asleep and dreaming itself, albeit out of its body. This man's wife was apparently still half asleep when she saw her husband's projected double and his silver cord. She probably still had some residual real-time or astral sight ability because of this, which enabled her to make this rare observation. We all project our real-time body during sleep, but the majority of people stay fast asleep during and after this event. The projected double usually imitates the physical body, adopting a sleeping position just above it, usually within arm's reach. I have observed a great many incidences of this myself during my own real-time out-of-body investigations. If awakened by another real-time projector, sleeping projectors often wake up, but they are usually quite befuddled and confused, often believing they are really somewhere else. They tend to drift back to sleep again fairly quickly. It is frustrating trying to hold a conversation with projectors in this state as they appear to be trying to function on two or more levels at the same time."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"123 28. The Etheric Body I consider the etheric body to be composed of stable and highly structured etheric matter, rather like a complex and detailed ice sculpture compared to the more fluid types of subtle matter generated during a projection. In its contracted state (when the physical body is fully awake) the etheric body is surrounded by a dense sheath, commonly called the vitality sheath, which acts both as an energetic storage layer and as a protective barrier. It shields the sensitive interior from intrusive external energies, atmospheres, and influences. The etheric body will normally only loosen this dense shieldlike structure when it expands during sleep or during the trance state (in varying degrees, depending on the depth of trance attained). Fully expanded, it appears to begin absorbing fine energetic radiations — universal or cosmic energy? chi? prana? — from the universe around it. The energy exchange ports covering the skin of the physical body, especially in their expanded sleep state, seem to flower during this expansion and become able to absorb and condense subtle energy radiations, trickling them into the etheric body's vitality storage areas. This process of etheric body expansion and refinement leaves neither the physical body nor the original copy of mind, memory, and consciousness energetically vulnerable during sleep or projection. In its expanded state, the etheric body seems to become far more sensitive to intrusive energies, and forms something like an energetic perimeter alarm around the sleeping physical body. I believe the underlying purpose of all subtle bodies, including the very densest of them, the etheric body, is to allow the animating spirit consciousness to manifest through a living flesh-and-blood being. The subtle bodies hold the essential spirit firmly inside the physical body, thus binding it inside the dimension of matter and hard experience. Etheric matter can thus be thought of as a gluelike, bioenergetic vitality substance, binding and sustaining the animating spirit in its physical body. This allows the spirit to manifest and express itself in the physical dimension, while still allowing it to maintain firm energetic links with all of its higher levels of existence through a spectrum of higher and progressively more refined subtle bodies. Death and Etheric Matter For interest's sake, and as this relates to energetic processes pertaining to projection, let's take a brief look at what seems to happen to the etheric body, etheric matter, and the projectable double during the death of the physical body. Physical death can be considered the final projection out of body, the ultimate OBE. When physical death occurs, the real- time body is projected in its strongest possible form, far stronger than would be possible under any other circumstances. In the case of sudden death, the real-time body contains most of the living bioenergetic and pure-energetic substances that were stored within the etheric body. In a way, the etheric body projects out of its physical body along with its real-time counterpart, forming what could be called the etheric-plus-real-time body. This is a far stronger and more stable version of the normally projected real-time double. It contains a full copy of consciousness and memory (now the sole original or base-level copy) held safely within it, along with the full spectrum of higher subtle bodies, in a now fully integrated, but out-of-body, waking state. As one function of the etheric body is to safely store all memories in energetic form, when the physical body dies and the etheric body breaks free, it carries the memory of its recent physical incarnation with it. To my way of thinking, when the physical body first dies, the etheric-plus-real-time body is promoted. It now rests at the bottom of the subtle body and dimensional scale, taking the place originally held by its now-defunct physical body. It takes over the holding and maintaining of the master copy of mind and memory. It holds itself fully integrated and in the full waking state, albeit now out of its physical body and existing in the real-time zone. Because the etheric-plus-real-time body now maintains full integration in the awake state (previously an exclusive property of the physical body) there are none of the energetic conflicts or weakening mind-split effects normally associated with any other type of OBE. According to some recently deceased spirits I have communicated with during real-time projections, though, reality fluctuations can still be a problem, with other minds and energies continuing to affect the real-time environment. During the final moments of death, most of the dying physical body's etheric matter is rapidly transferred into its newly forming etheric-plus/real-time body. A transfer of residual etheric matter also appears to continue, albeit far more slowly, for a few days after death has occurred, until everything left within the physical body has been transferred into its brand-new etheric-plus-real-time vehicle. As a related side note: the destruction of the physical body by cremation, explosion, etc., at any time during or after physical death, does not appear to interfere with the transfer of residual etheric matter. Etheric matter cannot be destroyed by physical means, but the physical body can; therefore the destruction of the physical body should logically only serve to free up any residual etheric matter. This would possibly have the effect of making residual etheric matter more readily available to the etheric-plus/real-time body of the recently deceased spirit. The large amount of etheric matter (pure life energy or vitality) released during the death process sustains the integrity of the etheric-plus/real-time vehicle in the fully awake state. This holds it (plus the animating spirit) very close to the physical dimension (often) within the real-time zone. The actual duration of a spirit's real-time afterlife existence appears quite variable. I believe this is greatly influenced by the physical and spiritual vitality of the deceased person concerned, as well as by his or her level of spiritual development, psychological makeup, desires, and emotional problems. Some spirits appear to skip this intermediary afterlife stage entirely, while others appear to have a prolonged existence there. This whole process appears to give departing spirits much-needed time to stabilize and come to terms with their new state of existence — maybe even allowing for a few good-byes. Once a spirit's etheric matter and vitality are used up, it appears to experience something called the second death. It then passes out of the real-time zone for good, proceeding to the next natural stage of its existence. This is usually one of the spirit worlds, or one of the recovery or staging areas. The second death is"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"124 gentle and totally painless — so I have been told by those who have experienced it — and is in no way distressing for a spirit. It is best thought of as being just another projection, brought on by further natural changes in the energetic qualities of the etheric-plus-real-time body, naturally shifting or projecting it up to the next level. Another related side note: the second death can be delayed only if the spirit finds some way of replacing its steadily shrinking store of etheric matter. This can apparently only be done by close association (touching and hugging) with living beings with whom the spirit has an empathic relationship, leading to an etheric-matter transfer from the living into the deceased spirit's etheric-plus/real-time body. This, in essence, can be thought of as an accidental type of etheric matter feeding. In most cases (earthbound spirits and ghosts, etc.) this causes no real problems for the living. It is also usually not an intentional act on the part of the deceased spirit — although I have come across some notable exceptions to this in my travels. The sections dealing with death in this book are best thought of as showing some elements of the basic death process only. There appear to be many different ways death and the immediate afterlife process can happen. This depends greatly on the level of spiritual development and foundation belief system of the person concerned. Many people experience a tunnel of light effect as they die. This tunnel or tube-type exit from the physical body indicates heavy crown center involvement in the dying process. While difficult to prove, this type of dying seems very closely related to the tunnel or tube-type projection exit, where projectors perceive themselves as exiting their physical body through their head. The tunnel of light effect may therefore indicate a higher level of death experience. Departing spirits may, in this case, be projecting directly into one of the spirit worlds, skipping the real-time zone and other intermediary stages of death, like rest and recovery areas within the astral planes, etc. NDE A large amount of etheric matter can also be generated and projected in response to temporary physical body death, or by severe trauma where there is the strong possibility of physical death occurring. This type of event can cause a near-death experience, or NDE, to occur. An NDE happens when a person is, literally, ejected from their physical body as a result of some kind of massive trauma, e.g., car accident, bad fall, drowning, difficult childbirth, surgery, or heart attack. An NDE is similar to the death process: The real difference is that the out-of-body experience is temporary. Persons experiencing an NDE usually find themselves existing very strongly in the real-time zone, often for a fairly lengthy period. As they are so close to the physical dimension, they are usually fully aware of events happening in the real world around them. Because of the nature of NDE's, these events are often centered on their traumatized physical body. Many people, when they experience an NDE, are very scared and unsure of themselves and hence have some difficulty — quite understandably — in accepting and adjusting to what is happening to them. The sheer trauma of this type of event also ensures a strong shadow memory download during reintegration. In many cases they have accurately reported real-life events and actual conversations that occurred while the NDE projectors were clinically dead. NDEs surpass any other type of OBE in power, clarity, and memorability, because of the sudden temporary generation and projection of the etheric/plus/real-time body, which is the ultimate real-time out-of-body vehicle. (An NDE can be as clear and memorable as the normal physical waking state.) This indicates how the etheric body plays a part in OBE clarity, and memory in general. Death, OBE, and Mental Coherence These sections suggest that the base level of existence (normally the awake physical state, unless you happen to be dead) allows for the clearest and strongest manifestation of consciousness, as well as for the strongest memory retention. I thus define the base state of existence as the level where full integration of all subtle bodies can be achieved during a full waking state. For living persons, the base level of consciousness is the normal waking state in their physical body. For recently deceased persons existing in the real-time zone, the base level of consciousness is that of their etheric/plus/real-time body. Projecting away from the base level (any type of out-of-body projection) may explain the vagueness of thought that begins to plague most projectors soon after the projection exit. This can be thought of as something like progressive mental incoherence-cum-creeping amnesia. This increases in severity the farther away from the base state a projector travels, and is affected by the length of time away from the base state. This may also explain why vividly remembered OBEs are usually of fairly short duration."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"125 29. The Akashic Records I believe the fabled akashic records are part of a medium that permeates all dimensions, on all levels, and has many different aspects. They are a permanent record of every thought, perception, and event that has ever occurred, like a huge and infinitely detailed history book, where past events can be accessed, viewed, and even experienced firsthand. The akashic records can be accessed and experienced within the astral planes (during OBEs) or with clairvoyance, remote viewing, and other psychic abilities. The akashic records also contain probability energies that are records of the future. Probability energies stem from and are generated by past and present events, actions, and thoughts. These energies can be tuned in to and read, visually or otherwise, in many different ways, both in and out of the astral planes, but the akashic records are far more accessible as a searchable type of records structure from within the astral planes, where they can be searched, viewed, and experienced firsthand, even by unskilled projectors. Like the astral hospital, the akashic records are an energetic dimensional structure with no actual shape or form. The appearance of this structure is affected by projectors' angles of perception, belief systems, and creative abilities. Projectors' needs for a definite and well-known structure within which to work have created a fairly solid library-like astral structure, which has been added to and maintained over many years. The most popular structure is the traditional library scenario. Imagine a large and imposing white stone building, beautifully kept, with wide marble steps leading through several large stone pillars that mark the main entrance. This building is set well back among neatly kept lawns and gardens. Inside is a large main foyer with high ceilings. Several hallways lead off from this into different parts of the library. Sometimes a librarian will meet projectors and may guide them to the part of the library they wish to use. If not — which is more often the case — projectors must use their intuition to choose a hallway and move down it to a section of the records. If they feel nothing and all the hallways look and feel alike, they must guess. While guessing, projectors must hold their area of interest or query firmly in mind. The chosen hallway opens into a larger room full of books and scrolls. Even computer terminals can be found and used there these days. An item must then be selected for viewing and, once again, it is important the query be kept firmly in mind at all times. Projecting to Akashic Records Direct Projection: The sooner you project to the akashic records after your exit, the better, as projection time is always limited. After the exit out of body, move at least twenty feet away from the physical body and stop. Imagine the library scenario strongly. Hold the intention of visiting the akashic records firmly in mind. Feel yourself moving toward the imagined destination and feel it moving toward you. Alternatively, project into the astral planes in the usual way, while holding the intention of finding the akashic records firmly in mind. Either method can take you there. You will suddenly find yourself standing on the grassy lawn in front of the library building after the dimensional shift. Using Entrance Structures: If, after the dimensional shift, you find yourself hovering above an astral-plane entrance structure (see chapter 26), dive into it and penetrate the central part of the pattern as close as you can to dead center. This will take you to the highest realm your energetic value can attain within that astral plane. As you plunge through the centerpiece, hold the intention of seeking the akashic records firmly in mind and picture the traditional library scenario. You should find yourself there shortly after the transition through the surface. If you are using an astral tube-type entrance structure, hold the intention of finding the akashic records firmly in mind as you are Shooting up the tube. Either use your intuition to select an exit, or wait for a mind's-eye vision flash that shows something resembling a library-like structure. Alternatively, just keep this in mind and wait until the tube drops you somewhere. Hopefully, this will be at or near the akashic records. Instantaneous Travel Method: After the exit out of body, strongly imagine or visualize the library scenario. Hold this as clearly as you can and project there, using the instantaneous travel method (see chapter 25). Feel yourself moving toward your destination and feel yourself as being there. Creating a Door: Another good way of entering the akashic records is to use your creative ability to create an imposing door. This is much easier to do than it sounds; even a novice can do it. After projecting out of body, strongly image a heavy iron- studded door with massive hinges. Construct it in your mind and imagine it slowly appearing before you as you construct it from the memory of a similar door you have seen in the past. If you can, create a heavy brass sign on it that says \"Akashic Records\". Hold your intention of finding the grass lawn-fronted library steps beyond the door. If you concentrate your creative energies, this door will slowly appear in front of you, as if by magic. When you can see the door clearly, simply open it and you will usually find the traditional library scenario just beyond it. If you cannot touch or open this door, use your creative ability, imagine it opening, feel it opening, or pass through the door itself as you would pass through any other door or wall. Entering an Anomaly Another way is to enter an anomaly. Look for a false or misplaced door in your house. Hold the intention of finding the library scenario on the other side as you pass through it. If you find a corridor of some kind with more doors behind the first anomalous door, enter one of the new doors while still holding the intention of finding the akashic records beyond it. Repeat this process, entering anomalous doors each time you find one, until behind one of them you find the library scenario you are searching for. Virtual Records: You can also use virtual reality projection to gain access to the akashic records from within the real-time Fig. 33. Traditional akashic records library scenario"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"126 zone (see chapter 24). Use a picture of an imposing building, similar to the one described above, or get a picture of a real library or take one yourself, as the mental association this will cause may also help this process. Hang this picture on a wall in your room, or as per other VRP methods. Write the words \"Akashic Records\" on the building in the picture, just over the doorway. After the real-time exit, move toward and through this picture and you will usually find yourself at or near a semblance of the akashic records. This picture can also be reflected into a mirror, as per the VRP mirror technique, for added depth and realism. If using a mirror, write the words \"Akashic Records\" backward, or write them on a piece of clear plastic, then reverse it and tape it to the picture, so the words will read normally when reflected in the mirror. Using the VRP method, as you shift into the picture or mirror, hold a firm intention in mind of your desire to visit the akashic records. This should be enough to shift you into the real akashic records. Once there, proceed to enter the building as normal, and consider yourself as being in the real akashic records. Viewing Records Once you arrive at the akashic records library building, by whatever method, enter the building and expect to find inside exactly what you are looking for. As you climb the steps and enter the building, firmly hold in mind whether you are going to look at past or future events. When you get to the records room, you may find books, scrolls, or pictures on walls, shelves, desks, or tables, or even computer terminals. Alternatively you may find yourself transported to a mysterious cloudy world, as often happens to me, filled with strange symbols and living metaphorical imagery. If you use the traditional library-building method, you will most probably find books. However, these will be quite unlike normal books. Inside record books, you will see titles, pictures, images, and symbols. It usually doesn't matter which book you pick up. It matters more what your intention is when you select and open a book. You will usually see moving images and living pictures within it. Concentrate on one of these images and allow it to fill your mind, which will happen automatically if you stare at it. This will usually move you inside the page where you can experience an akashic vision — a record — firsthand. To return to the library from within a book/vision and start over, imagine and feel for the library scene you just left and you will be transported back to it. In most cases, once a record has been experienced, projectors automatically slip back into the records room as it finishes, or when they have seen enough, simply by wishing for it. Whatever method used, hold a firm intention in mind of the time period required: past, present, or future. Future events seen in akashic records are strong probabilities. They are not to be thought of as being completely unchangeable destiny. The keys to changes that could be made to affect future events will be symbolically or metaphorically represented as a part of the event being viewed. These potentially modifying elements may be subtle and can be quite difficult to recognize, but they will always be there. Unfortunately, these elements are usually apparent for what they are only in hindsight. Tuning in to Areas of Interest If you tune in to the akashic records without a, definite subject in mind, you will usually find yourself viewing one of two general subject areas: 1) Disasters: Wars, earthquakes, airline crashes, floods, fires, train wrecks, mass murder, assassinations, death and destruction, etc. Disasters have a far greater energy surrounding them than any other type of event, because of the dramatic effect they have on the lives of so many people. The energy surrounding these records makes them stand way out above everything else. In a way, they bubble to the surface where they are much easier to see. 2) Personal: The events surrounding your own life, property, and interests, and the lives of all those connected with you — past, present, and future — are also very strong. As with disasters, high-energy events will stand well out from the more mundane events. If you look into the general future, into the area of probabilities, you often experience a confusing maelstrom of symbolism and complex, multilayered metaphorical imagery mixed up with apparently real-life events. This can be very confusing at times, but a great deal can be gleaned from this, if you understand something of the underlying nature of the energetically generated metaphorical imagery you are dealing with. Metaphorical Imagery As poetry, art, and music are the twin languages of the soul, so symbolism and metaphorical imagery are the languages of the spirit above the base level of consciousness. At higher levels of consciousness, the thoughts and words used by the base level of consciousness become progressively redundant. Communications and perceptions always match the altered level of consciousness being experienced. My experience with higher levels of consciousness, through high-level meditation and projection, has shown me that the further I move away from my base level of consciousness, the more abstract and complex perception and communication become. At higher levels, perceptions, thoughts, and communications become progressively more abstract and compressed. Living, abstract metaphorical imagery is the universal language of spirit above and beyond the base level of consciousness. This is a highly compressed form of perception-based communication, where a great deal of information is packed into high- speed, multilayered telepathic interchanges, with emotional and intuitive overlays. The end result is living, abstract metaphorical imagery. The higher the dimensional level experienced, the more abstractly simplified this becomes. I say simplified, because this factor, in essence, reduces a book-length saga into a simple picture or vision that only appears to be simple on the surface. The reason it appears so simple, I think, is because much detail is lost in the translation, from high- level format to base-level format, when it is recorded as a memory by the physical brain. When the base level of consciousness receives any form of perception or communication from a higher dimensional level, or higher level of consciousness, it interprets this in the only way it can, at the base level of consciousness, in base-level"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"127 format. Complex energetic impressions and communications are thus interpreted and rendered into anything from simple pictures and abstract symbols, to living metaphorical imagery. Instead of words, sentences, and paragraphs, the end result is something like a selection of abstract art pieces appearing amidst a series of brief one-act plays, where every item, costume, word, action, and gesture has deep meaning to it. When projectors' consciousness shifts into higher dimensional levels, they take with them their base level of consciousness and understanding. This base level of understanding overrides higher levels of perception and communication natural to higher levels, which means that perceptions and communications received there cannot be completely understood. The base level is only capable of fully understanding base-level perceptions and communications natural to it in the physical dimension, at its normal level of waking consciousness. I know of no way to directly overcome this. Even if a raised state of consciousness is incorporated into a projection, eventually everything has to be downloaded, interpreted, and stored in base-level format by the physical brain as a normal memory. This factor alone, I suspect, is responsible for the extremely heavy loss of details and meaning common to any projection above the real-time zone. (The only exception is with spirit communications. Spirit beings can deliberately couch their communications at the base level of understandability, to communicate with projectors or people in the physical dimension. Any higher-level perceptions or communications that are not immediately understandable, therefore, are unlikely to be intentional communications from an intelligent spirit being.) This problem of interpretation particularly applies to information gleaned from the akashic records. The natural levels of perception and communication within the astral planes and akashic records are not completely understandable at the base level of consciousness, because information gleaned from the akashic records must be interpreted at the base level of consciousness, by the human mind and its physical storage medium, the brain. Information gained from higher sources is interpreted into something the brain believes it most closely resembles. This causes the brain to interpret high-level energetic perceptions into metaphorical abstracts, into pictures and images that most closely resemble the raw and compressed essence and meaning of what is received. Unfortunately, the end product, the memory, may appear not to make sense. (As a related side note, this line of thought suggests that ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and other ancient symbolic pictorial languages may be a high level of written communication, rather than the simple picture languages of low-level civilizations that they appear to be.) Associations and Predictions We all perceive and experience the akashic records differently, according to our energetic angle of perception and learned mental associations. The energy units representing each recorded event are stored in compressed energetic format natural to that level. When records are viewed and interpreted, they are seen as a type of in-astral mind's-eye vision experience, with overlays of emotional and intuitive impressions. How this energy affects the mind's eye of projectors depends not only on their angle of perception, but also on how their subconscious mind works. Subconscious mental associations appear to be affected by ancient symbolism embedded within the collective consciousness, even though it may appear on the surface to be contemporary mind's-eye imagery. This historical symbolism can be used to index the akashic records. For example, the reference symbol Dogs of War is easily understandable as representing the subject of war. The Grim Reaper is a symbol representing the subject of death. Thus, to find \"war\" in the akashic symbolic index, you might use the combined symbols of the Grim Reaper and Dogs of War, or other symbolic variations. You could then browse through past, present, and future wars, and related areas. Future wars are Great Big Disasters and carry a lot more energy than any other type of human-precipitated event. These are, therefore, much easier to tune in to, and thus usually appear first if you are searching within or near that subject area. This is the main reason, I think, why many prophets, psychics and remote viewers have made such doom-and-gloom predictions about the future of the world and mankind. They have accessed the akashic records either in or out of body, and have seen a stream of terrible disasters looming ahead in the near future. An Experience of the Akashic Records When it comes to indexing, viewing, and deciphering past and future world events, some knowledge of history, geography, ancient symbolism, current affairs, and world leaders is a definite help. If when I had the following vision I had been able to recognize the person I saw addressing the crowd, and had recognized the landmarks of the country, I could have accurately predicted an important future event — instead of being wise only in hindsight. After completing some experimental energy work on my brow center during a deep-trance session, I projected out of my body, passed through a brief tunnel of starlight, and held a strong intention in my mind that I wanted the Akashic Records. At one point I experienced a soundless flash of silver-white light in my mind's eye and a momentary feeling of something like concussion in my face, blinding my perceptions for a moment. This was my brow center strobing back in my physical/etheric body (see chapter 14). My brow center had strobed several times in the past hour, but this was the first time it had ever happened during a projection. When my perceptions stabilized I found myself under a flickering purple-indigo sky, knee-deep in clinging mist. It billowed all around me, forming strange misty sculptures in the air. Each of these collapsed back into the misty soup after only a few moments of life. It wasn't long before I realized that if I held or pushed a thought into the mist a shape erupted, somehow representing the thought. The longer I held this thought, the more detailed and alive-looking the shape became, filling with color and movement. Concentrating, I focused on future disasters and the mist boiled upward, humming and flashing into a sea of multicolored sparks. As the mist engulfed me, I began seeing on several levels at once. I was bombarded with glimpses of wars, earthquakes, famine, volcanoes, disease, floods, plane crashes, murders, and explosions. Visions of multitudes of people suffering and dying filled my mind and I felt their terrible pain and anguish. It was nauseatingly confusing, not to mention thoroughly depressing. These visions seemed connected with the strange mist. I felt connected with these clouds like they were a living part of me, but"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"128 everything seemed horribly mixed up. It was like trying to watch several TV channels at the same time, with the pictures superimposed. Very confusing. I cleared my mind and the onslaught of impressions slowed. This was very tricky, as I carefully focused more clearly and calmly on my original intention. The clouds boiled and hummed around me again, but much less chaotically. Deep in the clouds, hundreds of vague shapes and symbols sprouted in the field of mist around me. They flickered in and out, some clearer than others , but they kept their distance and individuality this time. I saw one piece of symbolism I recognized, The Grim Reaper, and fixed my attention on it. This quickly grew larger and more solid than the others . I floated toward it and focused on it, holding the thought of war in the back of my mind. The Grim Reaper suddenly stood up, larger than life and walked toward me — as my astral heart skipped several beats. He suddenly looked very real and threatening. The clouds darkened and the atmosphere turned sinister , filling with the clammy stench of death and decay. The Grim Reaper threw back his ugly head and laughed, roaring evilly, raising and shaking his scythe threateningly at me. In his other hand he now held a bunch of cords, which were holding several evil-looking dogs that suddenly appeared beside him. They were huge, heavy- chested, narrow-hipped, short-haired, dirty-yellow brutes with oversized snarling jaws and burning red eyes. Their sheer aggression and bloodlust was terrifying. They strained and bayed and dragged the laughing Grim Reaper toward me. These dogs appeared to be the infamous Dogs of War (another symbol come alive). I concentrated on the scene and felt myself beginning to shift again. The Grim Reaper released the terrifying dogs right in front of my face and they leapt straight at me as I shifted (most thankfully) into a spectacularly clear vision. I found myself floating above a strange city under a clear-blue sky in brilliant, cloudless sunlight. The baking sun burned through me and the air filled with pungent aromas I did not recognize. A couple of hundred feet below me, a dark-haired, swarthy, heavily built, mustached and uniformed man stood on a raised dais under two giant scimitars. I flew down to get a better look, coming to rest hovering about fifty feet above and in front of him. The swords were huge, looking to be about forty feet or more high. He was giving a charismatic speech and exhorting an enormous crowd of people in an unrecognizable language. I had never seen a crowd so large, there seemed to be millions of people here. They were dressed in robes and turbans, some looking like old rags. The crowd cheered wildly whenever the speaker made a point or stopped for breath. As I watched, one of the swords slowly changed into a large, two-handed Crusader-type broadsword with a golden crucifix engraved on the blade near the giant crosspiece and hilt. The scene continued for several minutes then faded as I willed myself to return to the cloudy akashic records structure I had just come from. I returned instead to my still-entranced physical body. I had been out of my body for almost twenty minutes. The man giving the speech, I now know, was Saddam Hussein. The scene was in Baghdad, at the Iraqi monument to the unknown soldier. This monument was, I believe, built to honor the dead of the Iran-Iraq War. I saw this future vision seven months before the Gulf War started. I did not learn who Saddam Hussein was until the Gulf War started, or where this scene would take place — until I saw my vision televised during the Gulf War. In real life, there are two giant scimitars affixed to this monument. The changing sword (from a scimitar to a crusader's sword) was morphing symbolic imagery, indicating a future probability. The crossed swords were also an easily recognizable symbol, representing the probability of a coming military conflict between East and West."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"129 30. The Akashic Pulse This chapter could be called either fantastical conjecture or groundbreaking metaphysical discovery. I leave this up to you to decide. The entire nature of OBE research is subjective in the strictest sense of the word. Be this as it may, coming up is my finest dish of food-for-thought yet. This is the best I can do. If the experiential evidence and reasoning I offer here are sound, they provide a glimpse into many complex interdimensional mysteries: universal law, karma, the akashic records, and the collective consciousness, and how these relate to the living of our everyday lives in the physical universe. The Astral Wind If you project regularly into the real-time zone, from time to time you will come across a mystifying phenomenon that I call the astral wind. The astral wind, one of the most awesomely powerful natural forces in the universe, is most dramatic and noticeable when experienced during a conscious real-time projection. It is caused, I believe, by what I call the akashic pulse. I am sure some projectors will recognize the following scenario, through clearly remembered projections, dream fragments, or through vague impressions and feelings hovering near the edge of memory. You are traveling about the real-time zone, minding your own business, when all of a sudden you are gripped by an irresistible force. You feel yourself being dragged away against your will, usually backward. It feels like you are being blown away by an incredibly strong wind, but you cannot feel or hear anything resembling a wind. Everything is quiet and there is no noticeable disturbance in the surrounding environment. The astral wind force is similar to that feeling caused by the physical body when it attempts to reclaim its projected double, but is far more powerful. There is no anxiety, no feeling of dread or weakness, just an irresistible force dragging you away. But, why does this happen, where does it take you, and what does it do to you? You may fight the astral wind for a few moments, feeling as if you are battling a silent hurricane-force wind. This grows progressively stronger until you are dragged away, seemingly by the scruff of your neck, up into the sky and the great beyond. You watch as your house and town dwindle beneath you, as you are sucked through the clouds and ... into the unknown. After what seems like a short time, you find yourself floating downward again... but into another time and place. You float down at roughly the same angle as you were originally dragged away. You may see the rooftops of a town or a city, which you may or may not recognize at the time, growing steadily larger as you fall toward it. You are deposited into a mundane setting, sometimes recognizable, maybe only a few months into the past or future — more usually the future. The astral wind releases you there for a short time, and you are free to wander about for a while — never scared but always perplexed. The entire astral wind experience may appear to be completely unrelated to you. You may see and interact with people you know, or total strangers, or both. Sometimes these other people will be aware of your presence, sometimes not. They will always be just as confused as you as to why the meeting occurred and what it means. You may witness a real-life scene from your past or future. You may feel you are just a point of consciousness without a body, an invisible spectator seeing in all directions at once. Sometimes you merge with your past or future self and see through a new set of eyes, as if you were really there. You may arrive somewhere in the distant past and observe peculiar events. You may see an old town and houses and people and events from hundreds of years ago, and wander among unrecognized streets of olden days. No reason for any of this is usually apparent at the time. When faced with evidence of this phenomenon, most OBE researchers say, \"Well... fancy that\", and immediately throw the whole astral wind thing into the \"Too Hard\" basket. The astral wind is not an uncommon event. It has been experienced and discussed by many other frequent projectors. In The Projection of the Astral Body, Muldoon and Carrington call this phenomenon \"Super-Conscious Projection\", and describe it as caused by a higher intelligence, forcibly taking the projector to a higher dimensional level for obscure reasons. Muldoon mentions one such experience of his own, where he landed in a house and saw strangers whom he claims to have met in the flesh several months later. The most popular theory is that the astral wind force is a high-level demonstration by spirit, giving the projector some cryptic proof, the purpose and meaning of which almost always eludes the projector concerned. Generally speaking, these experiences usually appear to make no sense, even in hindsight. Let's examine the logic of this theory: Just why would any intelligent being do something so apparently bizarre and meaningless? Why go to all this trouble to confuse sincere and intelligent projectors and seekers? Higher beings could quite easily give projectors clear messages and understandable experiences. They could, for example, easily create a blackboard and write a simple message on it, or show simple pictures and symbols. They would surely choose a message of some import to the projector, rather than something totally defying interpretation. I think that the astral wind is not deliberate action by a higher intelligence, but a natural phenomenon with a natural cause. But what is the purpose of the astral wind and how does it work? And how does this apply to all of us down here on Earth in the physical universe? First and foremost, the vast majority of people do not have conscious OBEs, and most frequent projectors (a very small minority group indeed) spend only a short time in the real-time zone before shifting into the astral planes. Projectors usually lose track of an astral wind experience on the astral level and remember little about it. This type of event has been explained away as some kind of forced or spontaneous high-level projection, or a projection from within a projection that shifts them to a higher dimensional level. A real-time astral wind experience is far more down-to-earth and recognizable than its astral-plane counterpart, because memories of astral wind experiences above the real-time zone appear to be greatly affected by the base level of understandability. The physical brain's translation of this type of higher-level experience apparently does not allow wholly recognizable memories to form after a projected double reintegrates With its physical body. Most frequent projectors are lucky to have two or three decent projections per month. These are always of short duration, especially the real-time parts of them. Mind-split, base-level understandability, translation, and shadow memory loss problems"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"130 cause the vast majority of projection experiences to be forgotten. This all suggests that people are not meant to be operating consciously in the real-time zone when the astral wind arrives. Their projected doubles are meant to be floating in real time, fast asleep, as in normal sleep projection. The majority of people in the world are sound asleep whenever the astral wind hits and gathers them up, so it is not surprising that astral wind experiences are only rarely reported. It is fairly obvious from this train of reasoning, that the astral wind cannot be explained away as deliberate high-level spirit contact, spontaneous high-level projection, or super consciousness. There must be a natural cause and effect at work, and even a natural purpose, behind the whole astral wind phenomenon. Doesn't all this make you wonder, just a little, about the origin and purpose of the astral wind? The tantalizing fragments of past and future events, shown in the tail ends of astral wind experiences, strongly indicate the akashic records are involved. If so, where do the akashic records come into the equation? For that matter, what are the akashic records? How do they work and why are they there at all? What is their natural purpose and function? And, what has the astral wind got to do with them? Well... I have spent many years pondering these very same questions. From Here to Akasha To quickly recap: the akashic records, I believe, do not exist in any particular place or time, nor in any particular part of any dimensional level or realm. They are generated by consciousness in an underlying, interdimensional, energetic medium that flows throughout all levels of our infinite multidimensional universe. I call this underlying medium simply akasha. Akasha is everywhere and every-when, an aspect of the ether that absorbs subtle energetic reflections radiated into it by all levels of consciousness through the act of living and existing. One aspect of akasha, the akashic records, can be thought of as being a complete energetic record of past events and future probabilities. Past events exist as lingering energetic reflections. Future records are generated by these lingering energies. The future thus exists as abstract probability energies, generated by past and present events, actions, and thoughts. The stronger the probability of a future event, the stronger the energies associated with it. Some probabilities, like big natural disasters, are so strong as to be virtually unchangeable by any possible human-precipitated modifying action. These events can thus aptly be called the inescapable energies of destiny. Past and present thoughts and actions cause reactions in the energetic medium of akasha, energetic ripples that affect future probability energies being generated within akasha. It can aptly be said, I think, that every action recorded in the energetic medium of akasha causes an equal and opposite reaction therein. This energetic action-causing-reaction mechanism has a strong modifying influence on probability energies , an effect more commonly called karma. Karma generates an equal and opposite future energetic reaction to match and balance each action. Karma is not reward and punishment, but is the long-term process of energetic balancing whereby individual consciousness units (spirits) progressively attain balance throughout multiple incarnations within the physical dimension. Karmic Law: Every action generates an equal and opposite energetic reaction within akasha. Universal Law: Like attracts like and opposites repel, but only as modified by karmic law. Influential karmic probability energies are, I believe, compounded for each individual consciousness unit (each single spirit) into something I liken to an influential akashic pool. This is something like a private energetic storage area, containing both positive and negative attributes. Positive influential karmic energies have a positive effect, and negative influential karmic energies have a negative effect, on the life of the person/spirit concerned. Karmic law sets the balance of these positive and negative energies. The akashic pool concept can be further simplified as a kind of energetic scoreboard accounting for positive and negative actions of consciousness. These are balanced against the scores of all other players in the game of life. Conditional life influences are set and applied to all players according to the rules of balance governing the universal karmic scoreboard. Probability energies do not exist just as part of a peculiar set of records that show past and future events (which is how the akashic records are normally considered). These energies also have an incredibly strong effect on the present and future. They are the energetic modifying essence of now and the future. Probability energies generate all present and future energetic conditions (life influences) according to karmic law. This mind-boggling process involves an incredibly complex, interconnected, time-spanning series of delicately arranged attractions and repulsions. Like energies attract like and opposites repel, but only as set and applied by karmic law. Karma is the underlying modifying factor of universal law, the rule-maker and scorekeeper wrapped in one. Karma and universal law work hand in hand as aspects of the same influential life-affecting mechanism. This leads me to believe they are energetically indivisible, with universal law the influential arm of karma. This is why probability energies exist, in my opinion, and why they affect us all so profoundly. Akasha is a fluid interdimensional medium, an infinite time-spanning ocean filled with the abstract energies generated by consciousness. It contains passive energetic reflections and the not-so-passive influential energies generated by karma. Akasha exists and flows through everywhere and every-when. Like a true ocean, it is full of complex tides and currents, has depths and shallows, shoals and reefs, and islands and continents. Above all else, it is absolutely bursting with life in all its wondrous varieties. The Source of all consciousness lies in the center of the universe. From this comes the living instrument of karma and the actual working mechanism of universal law, the akashic pulse. When astral winds blow through akasha, they absorb and record, compute and modify, and finally apply karma, through universal law, to all living beings in the universe. Akasha is the ether, the interconnecting interdimensional medium, the universal carrier wave that allows the regular adjustment of all life influences, down to the minutest details of even the lowliest of life forms. This absorbing, computing, and adjusting mechanism is initiated by The Source of all consciousness, from within The Great Center, as it reaches out through the multidimensional universe, generating the incredible astral wind phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"131 The Akashic Pulse But akasha is not just some strange energetic medium and carrier wave, part of which contains a peculiar collection of time-spanning records. It is a living, breathing, dynamic force that affects everyone twenty-four hours a day. It is the heartbeat of universal consciousness. Akasha is responsible for all life conditions and influences surrounding everyone's lives. It affects us all profoundly and is as much a part of us as we are a part of it. The Great Center is at the very top of the dimensional structure, the highest of all dimensional levels. It holds within it the seat of universal consciousness, The Source, that great spark of original life that thought, imagined, created, and filled the whole universe with the original energies of light and life. The aspect of The Source responsible for the workings of the akashic pulse, and for the application of karmic and universal law, can be likened to an infinitely powerful, intelligently aware, computer processor. Please forgive me for the overly mechanical description of what can be called an aspect of God. I am trying to simplify and explain the unexplainable at the base level of consciousness and understanding we are all forced to live with. The astral wind phenomenon occurs when The Source reaches out and breathes IN a subtle reflection of the life essences of all individual units of consciousness in the universe. Each projected double, sleeping or conscious, contains within it a complete energetic record of all past and present thoughts and actions. It also contains within it a set of conditional and influential energies that are regularly collected, examined, modified, and updated by The Source during the astral wind phenomenon. I call these energies consciousness seeds. Consciousness seeds profoundly affect the lives of each and every incarnated spirit in the universe. They are responsible for luck, both good and bad, in all aspects of life. These consciousness seeds are drawn in for checking, processing, and updating during what I call an akashic pulse episode. The Source checks and processes each current set of thoughts, actions, and events contained within each individual spirit. These are weighed and computed against the sum total of all past actions and thoughts, throughout all incarnations, including their effects on all other spirits. These energies are then balanced and modified, individually and in groups, according to karmic law. The consciousness seeds are thus regularly updated by karmic and universal law, according to the divine equation of balance, harmony, and spiritual growth. The Source then breathes OUT the modified essences of all projected doubles as a massive interdimensional energetic wave that I call the akashic pulse. This wave contains within it all the newly adjusted life essences of all individual consciousness units in the universe. The essences are now full of updated influential consciousness seeds, life-adjusting energetic droplets of consciousness. All this is breathed back down through the dimensional spectrum and back into the physical universe, back into the dimension of hard experience. If you are caught up by the astral wind during a real-time projection, you return to full awareness as you start falling through the clouds back toward earth. As each projected double reintegrates with its physical body, these consciousness seeds are carried into its etheric body, where they take root. Some seeds begin their energetic influence immediately, while others lie dormant, ready to surface whenever their energies are triggered by real-life events. When a coded seed is triggered, the energies it releases begin to modify the set of attractions and repulsions contained within a person. This profoundly affects how that person interacts with the environment and with all other people, because it affects how the attractions and repulsions of universal law work at the grass-roots level. This, by the way, may explain déj à vu. A powerful seed triggered in a person causes déjà vu — a strong feeling of knowing, of having seen, experienced, or done something before. I consider déjà vu to be caused by a consciousness seed's coded trigger sequence as it explodes upward through the subconscious mind. It feels like an important memory has suddenly surfaced within the conscious mind — a memory of something only now being experienced. Many people realize this at the start of the trigger event, and thus often know exactly what is going to happen next. This type of experience is most remarkable and can have a great effect on people's lives. It is much like knowing the future before it happens, then of witnessing a small part of that future as it unfolds. Life's Little Choices Life is full of little choices. Everyone makes a stream of seemingly insignificant choices every day of their lives: what we eat and drink, what bus or train we catch, what we read, etc., etc. The little choices we make — and those made for us by other people — profoundly affect our lives and the lives of others. We have freedom of choice; our lives are not mapped out like a script to be followed blindly. We have the power to change the future by choosing our paths in life as we live them, making life's little choices. And little choices can be just as important as big choices. We never know when a small choice, or a chance happening resulting from one, is going to have a big effect on our lives and the lives of others around us. Our choices are influenced by four main factors: reason, circumstantial pressure, emotion, and intuition ; but not necessarily in that order. Intuition provides the most random element of choice , often making us choose to do what we feel like doing. Often when we follow our feelings no other element is involved. This random factor is the element most affected by influential energies. These shape our lives and the lives of others, working through us and through all those around us, creating long-term reciprocating influential effects. Elemental Akasha The akashic pulse is a massive, influential energetic carrier wave. It influences our thoughts and feelings and adjusts the life influences and surrounding conditional energies affecting each and every one of us, on a personal as well as a group basis. It is a vast outpouring of universal law, the heartbeat of universal consciousness. It breathes IN and causes the astral wind to blow throughout the universe. It breathes OUT, causing the akashic pulse to flow through all time and space, permeating all dimensional realities. The infinite complexity and scope of The Source sees all. It observes and assimilates and calculates and balances and adjusts all, down to the minutest details of the highest and lowliest of lives."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"132 The Source, shown as a star at the top of the pyramid, is inside The Great Center, which is at the top of the dimensional spectrum. This is the original center of universal consciousness, the highest level of consciousness. At the bottom is the physical dimension, our reality, the dimension of hard experience, where all our lives are lived and played out at the base level of consciousness and understandability. Between these two extremes of consciousness are ascending and descending dimensional layers. Akashic pulse episodes occur, as far as I can ascertain, two or three times each twenty-four-hour period. However, I may be completely wrong here and regret that I cannot be more specific about timing. (To be more precise it would be necessary to project in real time for many consecutive twenty-four hour periods. No one can spend that amount of time out of their body and retain a clear memory of it.) At certain times during the year the astral wind phenomenon seems to be much stronger than usual. I have no firm answer as to why this is so, but suspect astrological influences may play a major part in this equation. Natural Purpose of Projection During normal sleep, the etheric body expands, refines, and generates the projectable double, which, as stated, contains a complete reflection of consciousness and all memories, both conscious and subconscious. In other words, the projected double holds a perfect copy of its physical self in subtle energetic form, one small step away from the physical dimension. The projected double can also be thought of as containing all the higher subtle bodies. As the projected double, sleeping or otherwise, is breathed IN by The Source, its denser subtle bodies are progressively stripped away like the layers of an onion as it rises up through the dimensional spectrum toward The Great Center. This is why the projected double exists separate from the physical body during sleep. It waits, sleeping or awake outside its physical body, for the next akashic pulse. When the astral wind arrives, the projected double is irresistibly drawn upward toward The Great Center, becoming more and more refined as it progresses. The coarser layers of its energetic body are progressively shed as it moves upward, until only its pure essence remains: the highest possible energetic expression of itself. This highest and purest of all energetic bodies is assimilated directly into The Source. A timeless moment later it is breathed OUT, now fully updated, and the akashic pulse carries it back down through the dimensional spectrum. It regains its coarser subtle bodies along the way, as it is blown back into the physical universe, to finally reintegrate with its waiting physical body. This happens naturally during sleep. The assimilation of adjusted influential consciousness seeds is thus not normally experienced or remembered by the conscious mind — unless it happens to a fully awake real-time projector. Real-time projectors will experience the entire astral wind phenomenon, and may also experience the abstract metaphorical imagery associated with the coded trigger sequences of updated consciousness seeds. This can happen as these seeds are transferred into their awake real-time double, before they are downloaded into the physical/etheric body. This event can cause the awake real- time projector to experience firsthand a powerful out-of-body mind's-eye vision. Because of the fluid nature of the out-of-body environment, this is usually experienced as an event rather than as a vision. I believe that this process causes some prophetic dreams. All this points to conscious OBE being an unnatural act of consciousness ; possibly even a loophole in the working mechanisms of life. But I think this is far too simple an answer when the long-term potential of OBE is considered. OBE is way too powerful and meaningful to be accidental. So it seems logical to suggest that conscious OBE may be an important part of the spiritual evolutionary process. As mankind evolves, I believe the OBE factor will steadily become a more profound and meaningful part of life, on the individual as well as on the species growth level. OBE allows for a strong experiential connection with The Source, The All, The Great I Am, with the originator of everything — tiny sparks of which rest deep within our hearts. Astral Wind Experience The following is an astral wind experience I had several years ago during a very powerful real-time projection. I was fully awake in both my physical/etheric and real time bodies, which gave me a unique perspective of the astral wind phenomenon. With time and hindsight, the results of the seeded influences involved here, and their coded trigger sequences, can be better examined and understood. It was a hot summer's night and I was meditating late in the evening. In full trance, I was raising energy and working on my higher primary centers. My body started to tingle and I soon felt whole-body vibrations, which is an occasional side effect of this type of energetic work. I decided to go with it and project. I buzzed free into the room, floating several feet in front of my physical body, and moved toward the back of the house, intending to leave through the back wall. A force like the grip of a powerful wind (all that was missing was the buffeting and howling of a real wind) pulled me backward. My other aspect, the physical me sitting in the chair, watched with great interest what was happened to our real-time double. Neither of us had any idea of what was happening or why. We decided to go with it and see what happened — not that we could do anything about it anyway. I was dragged through the wall and up into the sky at roughly a forty-five degree angle, backward and facing my house. I could not turn around and face the way I was moving. I had experienced this several times before and knew I was in the grip of a powerful phenomenon, but did not understand exactly what it was. I was not scared, as this had never hurt me, but was fascinated. I watched my house grow steadily smaller as I was dragged away by the scruff of my neck through the night sky into the unknown. I seemed to momentarily black out after being dragged through a thin cloud layer. I remember clouds flying past me as if I were skydiving in reverse. I became aware again as I was falling back to earth; it seemed like a short time later. I was facing Fig. 34. The astral wind and akashic pulse phenomenon"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"133 forward this time, but at about the same angle and speed as when I had left. The astral wind dumped me in the middle of the road in front of my house, at the end of a neat, tree-lined cul-de-sac in the suburbs. In front of me stood a large, solid-looking refrigerator, standing in the middle of the road, with a massive red brick wall standing about twenty feet or so behind it. I couldn't see the top of the wall. (In real life there is no wall or refrigerator there.) I moved toward the refrigerator. Its door was hanging partly open and its light was on. I somehow knew that it was broken, and saw it was full of old toys and junk. The next moment my wife appeared beside me. She looked at the refrigerator then glared coldly at me. She firmly said, \"Goodbye\", then turned and marched angrily away from me, walking away from our house. Just before she rounded the corner she stopped and turned, looking back at me. Her face softened a little, and with a sad little smile and a small wave, she turned and continued on her way, climbing over a small fence and walking out of sight. I stood there, stunned, looking at the desolate scene around me. I had a fair idea that the imagery meant that my wife and I were destined to split, permanently, at some time in the not-so-distant future. This staggered me, as we were happily married at the time, busily raising our four small children. The vision experience ended there and I suddenly found myself back in my physical body. I got up and recorded in my journal everything that had happened. About half an hour had passed since I had left my body. This experience, I now know, was an akashic pulse episode. I had witnessed the workings of the akashic pulse firsthand during an extremely powerful real- time projection. Any projection-related experience, vision, or dream can contain residual elements from akashic pulse episodes. Along the same line, mind's-eye visions can also be triggered in a clairvoyant when they tune in to consciousness seeds contained within the energy body of the subject they are reading. This is, very basically, how I consider personal clairvoyant or psychic readings to work. This type of mind's-eye vision visually discloses the triggers of influential seeds, as happened in the above experience. The visual equivalent of what these triggers represent can appear as simple signs and symbols (like a refrigerator) or as living metaphorical imagery blended with apparently real-life events. Real-life events seen in visions and dreams often resemble simple pantomime. They are also often seen as a series of one- act plays (a series of vision segments) with abstract modifying touches showing karmic influences and future probabilities. They are, by nature, extremely complex because of high-level understandability and base-level memory translation problems. It is possible to learn a great deal about present influences, coming events and conditions, and changeable factors by analyzing vision experiences. Possible choices and their probable outcomes, positive and negative, are very often clearly shown. ; Unfortunately, the prophetic content of visions and dreams is often way too simple and clear for easy interpretation at its face value. Did I say simple? This is more aptly described as a sophisticated blend of overly simplistic abstract representations and real-life events that can look anything but clear and simple at the time. In hindsight, though, the true meaning of a vision can be absurdly simple. This is part of the reason why a set protocol is necessary for accurate interpretation, to get around the abstract, overly simplistic metaphorical absurdity of it all. Following is an OBE-specific version of a universal vision-interpretation protocol I have been developing for some time. The nature and interpretation of metaphorical imagery is something of a passion of mine, as are its universal applications to perceptions gained through dreams and visions. This protocol can be applied and used to decipher any type of vision, vision experience, or dream, whether experienced in or out of body. Interpretation Protocol Dreams and vision experiences often have such vague, cluttered, and seemingly random content that their interpretation can be extremely difficult, if not impossible. This is why interpretation is best saved for clearer and more powerful kinds of experiences, or parts of experiences, although it never hurts to analyze the smallest and most insignificant vision segment. With a little practice, it soon becomes clear which experiences or parts of experiences warrant serious interpretation and which are best ignored. An interpretation protocol — a set procedure — helps. Keep a journal and record all significant dreams and OBE experiences. This is sage advice for anyone hungering for personal spiritual insight and progression. Dreams and visions show and teach you everything about your past, present, and future. They will guide you along life's rocky paths, if only you have the eyes to see through the infuriating simplicity of it all. Usually only in hindsight do certain vision elements become meaningful. A record of past experiences allows them to be researched and compared with other visions and real-life events. The knowledge and insights gained from repeated comparison of symbology and real-life outcomes can then be applied to present and future visions and dreams. The accuracy of this kind of prophetic analysis, based on identifiable personal vision symbology, works better over the long term. Everyone's mind works in different ways when it comes to dream and vision experiences. We all have our own personal built-in set of mental filters, made up of symbolic associations peculiar only to us. Learned mental associations, and those set within us all by the collective consciousness, are used by the physical brain on the subconscious level to interpret vision- causing energies from dimensional levels above and beyond the base level of understanding. These energies-perceived or received in their pure form during dreams, visions, and OBEs — must be translated into base-level format (standard physical brain memory storage format) before they can be downloaded to become real memories. I include dreams here, although this book is not about dream interpretation, as it is often impossible to differentiate between OBE-gained visions and dream-gained visions. Very often, during OBEs, only the tail ends or segments of clairvoyant visions and akashic pulse episodes are remembered, with everything else being lost to memory. These often seem like normal vivid dreams. Only by the process of recording and interpreting visual experiences, in the long term, can the all-important peculiarities of personal psychological associations be identified. Long-term recording and analysis allow the identification of the symbolism and imagery generated within vision experiences by the subconscious mind. In time, repeated patterns appear. These show the forms, structures, and symbology that make up the metaphorical imagery of the visions and dreams of an individual. When the basic elements of these patterns become known, that knowledge can be applied to personal vision interpretation. A great deal of valuable personal insight can then be gleaned from seemingly meaningless visions and dreams. As a bonus, the more a set"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"134 protocol is used, the more powerful and accurate it becomes as a prophetic tool and guide. Journal Layout The layout shown below can be simplified or elaborated on as required. At least a full page should be used for each experience, with space left blank at the end for hindsight notes and connections to be added later. If a vision is lengthy or complex, more than one page may be needed to break it down. In time, a more-practiced eye will allow the bulk of interpretation to be done mentally, with much less attention then being needed on a formal layout. It can be progressively simplified to reflect increased understanding. It helps if you use the same layout every time. The keywords can be added first, transcribed from the notepad you should keep beside your bed at all times. The full experience can be written, using the keywords as a guide, later in the day when you have more time. Header: At the top of each journal entry (always use a new page for each vision or dream) show the page number, full date, and moon phase in bold. On the same line, write a brief phrase to encapsulate the experience, e.g., \"Whale Watching\" or \"Disneyland\", or \"Refrigerator\". Do not be afraid to alliterate, as this helps lock it in memory. These headers make it easier to search for particular experiences at a future date. Adding the moon phase is optional, but I find this a useful reference that, over a full year, shows the times when significant visions and dreams occurred. This can be a good indicator as to when more of the same are likely to occur in the coming year, and how they are affected by astrological influences. Keywords: List the keywords of the experience on the first line, below the header, keeping the true sequence of events. Separate vision segments with a dash — like this — if more than one is involved. Full Experience: Leave a blank line, then write the full experience using the keywords as a guide — again using dashes — to indicate distinctly separate vision segments. (Leave a blank line between each of the following sections.) Setting: Briefly describe the background and setting of the vision, listing each change of background if the vision has multiple segments. Players: List all the players in the vision, in order of the importance of their connection to you and your life, as well as by the significance of the part they play in the vision. If there are many people in the vision, list those not taking active or meaningful parts in descending order, as \"Supporting Cast\" and \"Extras\". Sequence of Events: Note and mark the sequence of events, using keywords as guide. You can list these separately for a short vision, but for a longer one it is probably easier to insert these into the \"Full Experience\" section, as #1, #2, #3, by inserting numbers, especially if you are interpreting a lengthy or complex vision. Symbols: Things that seem odd or out of place are usually symbols that have deeper meaning than is apparent on the surface. Symbols can be anything: objects, animals, people, or even the way people are dressed. Often, several items will appear odd or out of place; these must all be accounted for. For example: a police officer may symbolize legal matters, whereas a firefighter may symbolize damage, danger, or urgency. An automobile, or any other form of transport, will usually indicate your life's path. A particular type of vehicle, say an ambulance, furniture van, truck, or hearse can add important meaning and indicate future events. An ambulance, for example, may indicate a coming illness. Interpret each symbol, once identified, in the most basic way possible and you'll seldom go wrong. Symbolic Actions: Any action that stands out or has meaning, or that is performed in such a way as to attract attention, is a symbolic action. Even small and seemingly insignificant actions can be extremely important. If someone passes an item, or points, or reveals something, or waves, or smiles, or frowns, or laughs, or turns away, etc., these symbolic actions hide deeper meaning. Think simple pantomime here. Usually, an important symbolic action will stand out and your attention will be drawn to it during a vision or dream. Keep in mind that the memory you have of a vision is only a very small part of the total information held within it. Any feelings or intuition you have concerning any part of a vision can be considered an important indicator that, if properly accounted for, can unearth more information and meaning. Also, keep in mind that in many cases you will find yourself central to the action. You will often be trying to do something or to get somewhere. The rest of the vision will often be built up around this central action. This, if present, reveals the central theme or thrust of the experience and generally indicates what the rest of the symbology is associated with, or can be applied to during interpretation. Symbolic Modifiers: These add meaning to symbols and symbolic actions. If, for example, someone passes an object to you, and the object is damaged or dirty, the condition of that object is to be considered a modifying element, altering its meaning. When traveling in a vehicle, the type and condition of that vehicle is an important modifying factor. If you find yourself traveling on foot, the condition of the road and the surrounding scenery will be the modifying elements to look for. Signposts: These are the most important elements to look for. They will always be there, although they may not always be as clear as the refrigerator symbol given earlier. Signposts symbolize the date stamps for coming events, something that will mark or trigger them. They may not be related in any way to the actual events. A signpost is usually something out of place that cannot be missed; there will usually be only one symbol that fits the bill, if it can be identified. For example, you may see a car battery sitting in the middle of your living room during a vision or dream experience. This would indicate that when a car battery becomes significant, the other events depicted in the vision will be active, or are about to become active. It may be something small, like a Christmas gift or birthday card. It could be anything. Connections: Note anything connecting players, objects, and events in vision to your real life. Questions: What is it in itself? What does it do? How does it symbolize a connection with my life? What is its simplest and most basic meaning? Ask these questions of each part and symbol and action , then apply common sense, logic, intuition, and — most especially — personal life knowledge to it. This will provide valuable insight into hidden meanings. Take care to give each part the most simple and basic meaning possible. Wishful thinking and jumping to conclusions will ruin any interpretation, as may ignoring the obvious. If no clear meaning can be found, simply leave a large question mark. Its meaning will often become clear only in hindsight. Do not overcomplicate the interpretation process or you will erode the meaning and"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"135 worth of any vision experience. The most important rule: Keep this line of questioning ultrasimple. Do not overlook the obvious, but also do not overlook the more subtle modifying touches. Comments and Guesswork: After applying these questions to each part of your vision, list or write your interpretation of the vision here. Apply current knowledge here, taken from past visions and dreams, plus feelings, intuition, and reason. If you have already started a symbolic index, apply what you have in it. If you are still lost as to the meaning of a vision or dream experience, take a wild guess based solely on intuition. Watch out for wishful thinking and try not to jump to conclusions; these are real killers of accurate interpretation. Hindsight: This part is to be left blank until parts of the vision pan out in real life. Once this happens, the vision must be re- checked carefully for repeating symbolism and patterns that can be used to interpret other visions. Indexing: Make a note of recurring themes, symbols, patterns, and their apparent meanings, according to past vision and dreams experiences. Once these are identified, transfer them to an index in the back of your journal and use this to enhance the interpretation protocol. The index becomes especially powerful once these items are linked with real-life events. List page numbers where symbols recur to make it easier to trace and identify particular elements. Example Interpretation — The Refrigerator Header: \"Busted Refrigerator\" (date) (Full Moon) (page number) Keywords: OBE, wind — on road, broken refrigerator, brick wall, wife angry, good-bye. Full Experience: [Already given above.] Setting: #1. OBE started inside my house. #2. On the road outside my house. Players: My wife; myself Sequence of Events: I projected; I was blown away by a mysterious wind; I landed on the street; I saw the broken refrigerator and wall; my wife appeared, looked at the refrigerator, said good-bye, and marched off; wife stopped and waved before continuing out of sight. Symbols: Road outside my home [why was I there... out on the street?]; large brick wall [a barrier or ending-or a date stamp?]; refrigerator [odd symbol, maybe a date stamp?] Symbolic Actions: Wife said good-bye; wife walked away from me; wife stopped and waved. Symbolic Modifiers: Refrigerator light was on [showing light worked?]; refrigerator appeared to be broken and was full of old toys and junk; brick wall was huge and looked impassable; wife appeared angry and coldly said good-bye to me; wife walked away from me and away from our home [indicating she'd precipitate split]; wife waved sadly back at me [indicating belated remorse?]. Signposts: Refrigerator? Brick wall? Connections: I was there; my wife was there [connected by marriage] ; I was on the road outside my home [linking these events with family life]. Comments and Guesses: Although I could not see how or why, I guessed this vision foretold that my marriage would end in the near future ; most likely date-stamped by a broken refrigerator. Hindsight: All the events depicted in this experience came true. A year after I had the refrigerator experience, my next-door neighbor built a large brick wall (eight feet high) all around his house. A few months after that, my family and I moved to another town three hundred miles south. The day we moved into the new house, our refrigerator broke down. We borrowed one from a relative while ours was in for repair. The borrowed refrigerator did not work either, apart from its door light, which did work. After ours was repaired, the borrowed refrigerator sat on our porch for almost two years, waiting to be collected. Every time I looked at it, as the children slowly filled it with old toys and junk, I remembered"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"136 the refrigerator experience. I had a feeling that when it was finally collected it could well signify the end of my marriage. For all this foreknowledge, I still could not see this happening. Our marriage had its share of the usual types of ups and downs, but seemed stable and everything appeared perfectly normal. One day, the relative came and collected the broken refrigerator. A strong feeling of déjà vu came over me and I wondered again if this meant the end of my marriage, but still could not see that anything was wrong. But exactly one week after the old refrigerator was collected, my marriage ended suddenly, permanently, and for no reason I could have foreseen. I ended up out on the street, quite literally, as the vision depicted in its simplistic metaphorical way. It seems the road I was standing on, outside my house in the vision, was also a symbol with hidden meaning to it. Looking back, aided by hindsight, the meaning of every item and action becomes crystal clear. The brick wall I saw was high and impassable, indicating a definite ending. If there had been any way to change the future events depicted, a way through, around, or over the wall would have been depicted in the vision — for example, a ladder resting against it, or a hole in the wall. By sheer coincidence, a large brick wall was built by my next-door neighbor just before we left town — or was this just a coincidence? Maybe this was yet another date stamp, or a cunningly disguised trigger, releasing influential seeds that began their effect in and around our lives at that very time. Of note, the old toys and junk in the refrigerator played a significant part in the outcome of this experience. I cannot give details of this here; it is very personal, but I can say that this symbol was extremely accurate. While the knowledge of this future event did not allow for any change in the inevitable outcome, it did make this event much easier to deal with when it happened. I was mentally and psychologically prepared for it. I therefore got my life back together very quickly after this upsetting event. And, here I am today writing this book only a few years later, which I would never have been able to do if these events had not transpired as they did. And that is most definitely food for thought... Abstract Nature of Symbolism I would like to sound a general caution here about the abstract nature of the symbols and metaphorical imagery commonly found in any vision. Misunderstanding the nature of metaphorical imagery, plus wishful thinking and jumping to conclusions, can not only generate a lot of confusion, it can cause damage to your life. If, for example, projectors see a loved one die, they may emotionally deny this and deliberately use their creative ability to change the outcome of the vision. This may happen because they simply cannot face the alternative, whatever it actually means. Emotion can ruin the importance of any vision experience. Any useful warnings or modifying elements showing ways to change or modify an outcome can be lost. For example, the full vision in its unchanged form may have contained information that had the potential to save the life in question — if it truly were in danger, that is. The dispassionate-observer approach is really the only way to handle any type of vision experience. The setting, sequence, players, symbols, actions, modifiers, and connections in any type of vision experience or dream are all meaningful aspects of it. And the emotional state of the viewer and how the experience affects them is another very important factor to take into consideration during analysis. Only experience, logic, intuition, and a truckload of common sense can teach anyone how to clearly interpret a real-life prophetic vision experience. Until this experience is gained, it is best to treat any sort of vision, especially those depicting high-interest subjects like relationships, money, or death, with extreme caution."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"137 31. OBE and Reality Fluctuations There are no simple explanations for the underlying causes of the reality fluctuations that plague real-time projectors shortly after their exit out of body. I wish there were; it would make my work that much easier. In most cases, especially with new projectors, reality starts to fluctuate only a couple of minutes after the exit. Reality fluctuations are more noticeable during real-time projections, especially inside projectors' own houses, as the details of this area are well known. Several possible factors have the potential to cause or contribute to reality fluctuations. The surface mind, if not strictly controlled, provides a continual stream of random dialogue and guessworklike thoughts. Some of this surfaces from the subconscious in response to associations triggered by thoughts, surroundings, and events. Part of the problem here is guesswork, or what is commonly called the overlay. The overlay plagues psychics, clairvoyants, and remote viewers alike: guesswork thoughts interfere with objective perception and analysis. In the case of real-time OBE, the overlay has a far more creative effect than in real life. It is much more visual, and hence will often trigger the creative powers of the subconscious mind. For example, if an object, shape, or shadow is vaguely seen during a projection, the surface mind will often guess what it is, even if the projector is not thinking about it. This can stimulate the subconscious mind into altering the object, or into creating a form to fit whatever has been half-guessed. If a projector is subconsciously fearful of the out-of-body environment, these vague shadows can easily transform into fearful images. During any type of projection, the subconscious mind holds the bulk of creative power. Once triggered, it can create complex objects and scenarios instantly, without the time and effort required to build a similar creation using the weaker creative powers of the conscious mind. The subconscious mind waits in the background, ready to leap out and create something at the drop of a hat. But there is usually no intelligent purpose in what is created. The dream mind, when it becomes active, can access the strong telepathic, energetic, and empathic links between the physical/etheric body/mind and its projected double, via the silver cord. It is therefore capable of causing reality fluctuations — something like dream-generated real-time hallucinations — around the projected double. The effects of dream mind interference are most noticeable within a hundred yards (ninety meters) or so of the projected double, and lessen with distance. The length of time it takes any projector to enter the dream state is extremely variable. The start of reality fluctuations during a real-time OBE can be used to indicate when the dream mind is becoming active. This is a very good time (recommended for beginners) to end a projection, and to attempt a conscious reentry while the physical/etheric body is still easily awakened, before it falls into a deeper level of sleep. However, as projectors gain experience and get to know their strengths, weaknesses, and limitations, reality fluctuations can be weathered and even overcome to a certain extent. Time out during an OBE can then be gradually extended, with successful reentry still being possible. With any projection attempt, the desire and effort to induce projection will often carry over into the dream state. The dream mind of a projector will often believe it is still involved in a projection attempt when it becomes active, especially if it fell asleep right in the middle of one. When it feels projection-like symptoms coming from its physical/etheric body (vibrations, rapid heartbeat, etc.), it will believe it is having an OBE exit from inside its physical body. It will then experience a false but very realistic dream version of a conscious-exit projection. The dream mind's imaginary OBE will seem extremely real to it. The real-time aspect of this dream OBE will be based on the projector's actual memories of the surrounding area. This has the potential to overlay the true real-time OBE (which is already in progress) with a false dream version of exactly the same thing. The false dream projector will always have a different viewpoint from the true real-time projector. The false projector may believe it is in another part of the house, or it may be simply facing another direction than the true projector really is. This can overlay the true real-time environment with a twisted, backward, or fluctuating scenario that will not make any sense at all to the true projector. Other minds, awake or asleep, are also capable of contributing to reality fluctuations. This can be thought of as mental static or background noise. Distance affects the strength of this type of interference. The reason for this is directly related to how the projected double becomes noticeably less affected by its own physical/etheric body with increased distance from it. Projectors operating in sparsely populated areas will notice much less background noise. Heavily populated areas have greatly increased background noise. For this very reason, serious metaphysical pursuits and magic rituals are never carried out in densely populated areas. The brow center or third eye of a projector is also capable of receiving visions during an OBE. Primary energy centers are far more active during OBE than during the normal waking state, due to the increase of energetic activity within the physical/etheric body. An active brow center during a projection can thus act as something like an untuned vision receiver. (This varies according to the level of the clairvoyant ability of individuals and is hence less frequent.) It can cause strange visions and unexplainable imagery, seemingly unrelated to the projector during a real-time OBE. Brow center activity can also cause complex visions to be experienced during OBEs. If a projector's brow center receives a strong vision during the course of an OBE, the projected double can find itself experiencing that vision firsthand, from inside the vision. In effect, a strong vision can cause a dimensional shift that transports the projected double into an astral realm. A vision experience like this will usually end the real-time aspects of an OBE for its duration. Once reality fluctuations start during a real-time OBE, it can be difficult to make sense of what is happening. I do not recommend even trying. Attempts to do so will lead to further complications and generate even wilder reality fluctuations. It is usually best for projectors to accept whatever is happening, to keep their mind as clear as possible, and to continue on with their OBE as best they can. If reality fluctuations become pronounced, though, it often helps to move away from the affected area and hope things will be more stable elsewhere. If this fails, wise real-time projectors will attempt to reenter their physical body while they still can, or risk losing the memory of that experience entirely. While energetic development can extend the objective real-time aspects of an OBE, a mixed bag of perceptions is to be expected by most real-time projectors shortly after the exit. The norm is a strange and fluid mixture of objective and subjective"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"138 perceptions, with reality fluctuations steadily increasing as the projection continues. This leaves most projectors floundering for some kind of a logical cause or explanation, which is unlikely to be found. While annoying, reality fluctuations are not bad or negative elements of an OBE. They are usually just a little on the wild and ridiculous side, that's all. Avoiding Reality Fluctuations • Focus on what you are doing at all times and don't let your mind wander. Keeping control during a projection strengthens it and makes shadow memories stronger. • Keep moving at all times and do not stay in one area for too long. • Move away from your physical body immediately after the exit and stay at least twenty feet (six meters) away from it at all times — the farther the better. • Concentrate on forward vision and turn slowly and deliberately. • Keep up a running commentary during the projection. Talk aloud to yourself at all times, describing what you are seeing and doing. If your voice does not work, say it in your mind. • Do not concentrate on any one object or scene for too long. Observe each object and scene only briefly in passing, noting it aloud, then moving along. • Glance briefly at your hands frequently, and whenever reality fluctuates, but not for long enough to cause them to melt. Each time you do this, a small shock wave is sent back down the silver cord to the physical/etheric body. This gives it a small shock that slows its entry into the dream state, thereby strengthening the projected double. • End the OBE when reality fluctuations become pronounced, while you still can. Confusing Astral Effects You do not have a real body during an OBE. You are an infinitesimally small point of consciousness, a spark created by the pure energies of your consciousness. You have no real size or shape. You are totally free of the limitations of your physical body and of all the laws of the physical universe. In many ways, the physical body and its projected double can be likened to a car battery and the energy stored within it, or to an electrical capacitor and its stored charge. If you could somehow separate one of these physical devices from its stored energy, releasing yet containing its energy in a single cohesive unit, what size would the energy unit be? What would the energy unit weigh? What would the energy unit look like? There are no real answers to these questions, as energy has zero size, zero mass, and zero weight. But the product of these questions would exist in some form and have an energy potential that could be calculated. It should, hypothetically, exist as pure energy once freed of the restraints of matter. I asked a friend of mine, a mathematical physicist, if these questions could be stated or proven mathematically, and a comparison drawn to the projected double. I received a chapter-length reply. The high-level math and physics involved are way above layman level, but the end result was that the projected double was likened to a potential well. For all that, the projected double is indeed a body of sorts, albeit an energetic one. A projector can perceive this body, but only when parts of it are deliberately self-observed. The subtle body parts that appear seem to be created by the subconscious mind. The mind of a projector does not seem able to accept the total nonexistence of its body, so temporarily creates body parts when they are looked for. Melting Body Parts If you try to look closely at parts of your own projected double during an OBE, especially your hands, you will find they start melting away very quickly, within two or three seconds. You can glance at any body part and look away again and it will appear to be fairly stable and solid, but studying any body part closely will cause it to melt. For example, if you look at your feet and then lift one of them for closer inspection, it will begin melting just as hands do. Hands, being the most commonly looked-at projected body parts during an OBE, look pale and unearthly. They sometimes even appear macabrely elongated and spectral (see figure 1, chapter 2). Do not panic if you observe this effect, as this is quite normal. It usually is seen only during low-powered OBEs. In all cases, after only a few moments of observation, the fingers will begin melting rapidly away into pale stumps. The rest of the hand and forearm will soon follow suit if the observation is continued. If you look away and then look back at your hands, the melting process will begin again from the start. Any other real physical object observed closely during an OBE will not melt. Things will change; they'll morph, disappear, reverse, and mutate into other things, but they will not melt away as body parts do. This points to the act of self-observation as the cause of the melting-body-parts phenomenon. I think the melting-body-parts phenomenon is caused by a conflict within the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind provides temporary subtle body parts, seemingly as a reflex action triggered by the act of self-observation. It knows its real physical body exists in another place, and knows it should have a body with it during an OBE. So, when the projected double looks for its body, the subconscious mind is tricked into creating temporary body parts. However, these body parts cannot be maintained in existence, because the subconscious mind cannot accept that its body is existing in two different places at the same time. Internal subconscious and energetic conflicts cause the body parts to rapidly melt away. If my reasoning is correct here, this conflict goes a long way toward explaining why the melting-hands phenomenon can have such an effect on projectors. A brief glance at the hands during an OBE, for example, causes a small shock wave between the projected double and its physical counterpart that helps stabilize the projection. A longer observation often shifts a projector from real time straight into an astral realm. This last effect is especially powerful during an astral projection and can be used by projectors to shift themselves among the astral planes, albeit at random. This dimensional shift is most likely brought about by the subconscious mind becoming momentarily disoriented because"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"139 of the conflicts arising from the act of close self-observation. This last effect is variable, though, and appears to affect some projectors more than others. This variability is most likely caused by several factors; experience, excitability, fear, and trepidation affect the strength of the shock wave that self-observation generates. The stronger the shock wave, the stronger its effect on the projected double. The melting-body-parts phenomenon is more noticeable in real time than in the astral planes or higher, although it still happens in much the same way. And, as it is one of the rare few constant factors associated with OBE and the projected double, it is worthy of much further study. Vision-Reversal Problem Vision reversal is an occasional real-time problem. In my opinion, this problem arises because the physical body has a natural frontal vision perspective of approximately 220 degrees. It can see the front half of its visible environment, but cannot see behind itself at the same time. However, the projected double is a point of consciousness with the potential to have real- time vision in all directions. I call this spherical vision, for want of a better term. The projected double does not contain functioning sense organs, nor even energetic copies of them. It is therefore not bound by the vision limitations imposed on its physical counterpart. It can see in all directions at once if it can get past its ingrained natural frontal vision perspective. This increased vision potential will occasionally cause problems when it happens accidentally. A 360-degree viewpoint is not readily acceptable by the conscious or the subconscious mind. In a similar fashion, this real- time vision problem can also interfere with the projected double's ingrained sense of left and right, which can further compound the spherical vision problem. Spherical vision can cause some very peculiar real-time effects and some pretty mind-twisting reality fluctuations. For example, frequent real-time projectors often find that their world suddenly becomes reversed during a projection, as if in some kind of mirror dimension or reversed astral realm. Everything looks the same, with the same objective qualities as normal, but everything is back to front and/or out of place. During some OBEs, projectors' visual senses have become disoriented and they have momentarily experienced a change of perspective that has reversed their left and right perspective. This can happen if they suddenly change direction without noticing the change. Their viewpoint suddenly changes, without them actually moving or rotating, as they would have to in their physical body. This action has reversed their natural frontal, left and right, back and front, up and down viewpoint. This disorients and tricks the vast creative powers of the subconscious mind into instantly remaking the environment to suit how it feels it should be. A split second of unnoticed disorientation and the OBE environment goes haywire. The diagram below illustrates the reversal of viewpoint without turning, and the strange effect this can cause. The natural sense of front and back, up and down, left and right are so deeply ingrained in us that it can have a strong effect on real-time perception, which is a direct mind sense. Note that in the diagram below that the natural sense of direction does not change when the projector's point of view suddenly turns inside out without the person actually turning. Please bear with me here, as explaining such an unnatural phenomenon as vision reversal is a real headache. The real-time projector @ is in the center of the diagram facing toward ( A ) with the door clearly perceived to be on his natural right- hand side. He has normal frontal vision with a natural left and right perspective, as in real life. The projector knows, as does his subconscious mind, that if he turns around and faces ( B ), the door and TV will be on his left-hand side, and the chair on his right-hand side, as shown above. Now, if you as the projector are facing ( A ) and you suddenly turn inside out without moving around, and without noticing this lack of movement, your viewpoint will suddenly reverse without you actually turning. Viewpoint ( A ) will suddenly become viewpoint ( B ) but without your turning around as you would in real life. Your sense of left and right has suddenly reversed. When your viewpoint suddenly changes from ( A ) to ( B ), without you actually turning and experiencing a rotation of viewpoint that your mind can accept and adjust for, the door stays in view and causes a big problem, as do the chair and TV when they suddenly spring into view. You were aware of the door on their right-hand side with viewpoint ( A ), but you do not lose sight of the door when you suddenly turn inside out and change your viewpoint to ( B ). Your subconscious mind cannot accept this sudden reversal of viewpoint. Even the conscious mind would have problems accepting this. The door seen on the right-hand side while facing ( A ) at the start of the inside-out reversal would have to vanish and reappear again on the right-hand side after it turns and faces ( A ). But, this would place the door on the other side of the room, which is clearly impossible. The TV and chair would also have to reverse positions to keep your natural left and right perspective in order, which is also clearly an impossible proposition for the subconscious mind. The new viewpoint with unchanged left and right perspective, gained by the sudden change in viewpoint without turning, becomes clearly impossible for the subconscious mind. It therefore takes the easy way out and changes the view to suit that with which it can deal more comfortably. Now, keep in mind here that what the subconscious mind can accept and what the conscious mind can accept are two completely different kettles of fish. This seemingly impossible change in viewpoint has caused the subconscious mind to creatively correct the view by reversing it, or by reversing and changing parts of it, to fit what it feels is more acceptable. The subconscious mind makes instantaneous alterations as its viewpoint changes. It either makes the real door vanish and reappear on the other side of the room, then switches the TV and chair to fit this new perspective, or more likely simply creates Fig. 35. Vision-reversal problem LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT A B"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"140 another door, another TV, and another chair for both sides of the room. You may now find that you have a room with two doors, one on each side, with a TV and a chair on both sides to match. Or, you could suddenly find that you no longer have any chair or TV — but you shouldn't complain, because you now have two doors to make up for it. The basic cause for the real-time OBE vision-reversal problem can be simulated by lying on your back with your head hanging over the edge of the bed. Clear your mind about what you are doing and do not try to work it out beforehand. Open your eyes (in real life) while upside down and quickly try to pick left and right and up and down. You can do the same thing by looking behind yourself with a mirror. This, you will find, causes a mild disorientation in your innate sense of left and right. You'll find you have to deliberately calculate which is left and right from your upside-down (or reversed) position. This slight disorientation is all that is needed to trigger the subconscious mind into creating something it feels more comfortable with. During a real-time projection, the subconscious mind will usually create something to help with what it feels is its natural left and right perspective at the moment of reversal. This is done according to the visible evidence it has before and after the change of viewpoint occurs. This generates an anomalous view of real time; once this happens, it's way too late to correct it. The subconscious mind will not accept a conscious change of left and right, and anything it has created will stay in existence for the duration of the OBE. If you understand spherical vision and happen to get reversed during a projection, you'll find it's not really a problem. You simply take what has happened into account and continue to function reasonably well in objective real time, rather than thinking you are wasting your time in some strange mirror dimension. This means that if you have plans to do something in real time, you still can. You just have to adjust for it in the best way you can. My best advice is if this happens while inside a house, leave that house through the most normal part of it you can find. Then, stay away from that house for the duration of the projection, or reenter it from another direction or side. If you go through an anomaly — through a created door, say — you'll usually find yourself in an astral realm. Real-Time Anomalies Comparing the subconscious mind's creative power to that of the conscious mind is like comparing a bank of supercomputers to a child's calculator. During any conscious OBE, this difference in creative ability can cause a great deal of confusion. This vast difference in creative power, combined with vision-and perspective-reversal problems, is the underlying cause of many OBE anomalies. Take these all together, and you have a recipe for total confusion: • Strong creative powers of the subconscious mind • Weak creative powers of the conscious mind • Sensitivity of the projected double's perceptions • Sensitivity of the out-of-body environment to creative energy • Spherical vision, with left and right perspective reversals For example: You exit your body and explore your house in real time. Everything appears normal, but as you move through your house, you suddenly notice a door in the wrong place. Noting this anomaly, you move on toward the kitchen, but find this is either incomplete or on the wrong side of the house, or both. While moving through the house you have somehow accidentally reversed your natural viewpoint, and confused your natural sense of left and right. Your subconscious mind has therefore rearranged the layout of the house to fit what it feels is more natural. This confuses you to no end. The furniture, pictures, windows, doors, etc ., all appear to be normal, but nothing is where it should be, and some parts seem to be missing completely. Moving along, you find another door where there should be no door. This door appears real, although it is in the wrong place. Once created, it may change in appearance but will rarely be uncreated. Solid doors don't have the habit of vanishing, even during an OBE, so you're stuck with it for the time being. When you turn to where the real door should be, you sometimes find the door there, sometimes not. You may end up with two or even more doors where there should only be one. If you go through the real door — the one still in its correct place — you usually find the rest of the house behind it just as it should be. But, if you go through a false door, you enter a created anomaly. This will always lead to an astral realm. The subconscious mind knows that a false door is an anomaly. It won't accept this as opening to a normal part of the house that can't possibly be there. Anomalies like these are reality fluctuations caused simply by moving about in the real-time zone. Anomalous doors can be used as fairly reliable entrances into astral realms. Enter one then continue opening other doors as you find them. These other, anomalous, doors will open into more astral realms. If you concentrate and hold in mind the type of astral realm you wish to enter as you open these doors, more often than not you will find what you are seeking."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"141 32. Higher-Level Projection Higher dimensions are similar in structure to the astral dimension, but exist at much higher levels or vibrations of consciousness. Like the astral dimension, each is a completely separate dimensional area, although they can all be said to occupy the same space. Between each level is an intermediary area, or buffer zone, similar to the color-tinted buffer zones that divide the major planes of the astral dimension, but wider and harder to traverse. Each major level of consciousness corresponds with a particular dimension, and each has a subtle body to match it. Higher levels become progressively more abstract and complex in nature, as do the levels of consciousness associated with them. We all reflect, to a greater or lesser extent, an energetic facet of ourselves into all higher dimensions and levels of consciousness, at all times, just as an aspect of the astral body is constantly reflected into the astral dimension (see chapter 2 ). The strength of these reflections, and their effect on inner and outer realities, depends greatly on the energetic development, intellect, spirituality, and natural potential of the individual. High-Level Technique To project into a higher level, aspiring projectors must first raise their energetic value to harmonize with that level. This is best done before the exit, but can also be done during a projection, and can happen spontaneously. The most effective way of reaching higher levels — barring natural ability — is through the practice of consciousness-raising meditation, energetic development, and other related spiritual practices. The generation of a high-level projectable double is affected by the level of consciousness, by the active configuration of primary energy centers, and by the quality of energies they produce. The higher-body generation process is therefore limited by the projection mechanism's ability to generate the energetic qualities required. Projecting consciously into levels higher than the mid to high astral, say past the high fifth or lower sixth astral plane, takes either a high level of skill and development or strong natural ability, or both. A projector usually needs to be proficient at both consciousness raising and energetic stimulation to do this. There are, however, ways to achieve this that take advantage of latent natural ability. Ideally, an aspiring higher-level projector needs some experience with projection. However, it is possible to begin right here and use the following procedure as a stand-alone projection technique. If you have failed at projection using other methods, try this. It may suit you and work better, even for a very first projection attempt. Note: All the skills and techniques required here are given elsewhere in this book (see parts 2, 3, and 4). 1. Stimulate feet and hands, as per NEW system, then use a full-body circuit for ten minutes or longer. 2. Use a deep physical relaxation technique, then attain the full-trance state. 3. Stimulate all primary energy centers. 4. Use extra brow and crown center stimulation exercises. 5. Raise energy through the whole body, including arms, and up through all primary centers in one smooth action to the crown center on the IN breath. Hold awareness in the crown center and feel energy flowing into there all through the IN breath and all through the following OUT breath. Flick awareness back to feet and repeat at start of next IN breath. This exercise is designed to draw and accumulate energy in the brow and crown centers. 6. Continue the above exercise for at least ten minutes, or until you start seeing a color suffusing or tinting your vision behind your closed eyelids. Purple is the best color to see for this, but any bright primary color is a good sign. If you see nothing, continue with the next part of this exercise anyway. 7. Using your body awareness, generate a continual \" Aummmm\" sound in your heart center. Imagine it and feel it growing stronger and stronger in your heart. Once this is established, slowly move this awareness sound up to the throat center, and from there up to brow center, and finally spreading to the crown center. This is a fairly deep tone, as if vibrated softly in the back of a mature man's throat. Feel it humming there and let this spread and fill the entire head. This sound may continue on its own accord, or even spread through the entire body, or it may not. If you can hold this tone without too much effort, try to continue it throughout this whole projection attempt. If this part is too difficult, try to hold the \" Aummmm\" sound in either the throat or brow center only, whichever is easiest. Just do the best you can with this for a few minutes, then proceed to the next part of this exercise. 8. From behind your closed eyelids, look for a distant point of light, or a small pattern of light that is brighter than any other you can see. This may appear as a tiny bright dot, star, or multicolored structure, or even as a geometric pattern. It may also appear as a distant scene, single or multicolored, as if seen through the wrong end of a telescope. Gently lock on to and hold this target firmly in your mind's eye. 9. Shift your awareness toward and into the target and feel yourself moving toward it. Feel yourself as being there already inside it. Imagine and feel a strong spiritual love connection with the target. Love the target and want to be there with all your heart and soul. Use the point shift technique at this point and feel yourself moving directly toward the target. Rope or other projection techniques can be added or alternated as necessary. 10. If the above method cannot be made to work, I suggest that the secondary full-body circuit be used for half an hour or more, added to step one, and that step five also be continued for half an hour or more. This is often necessary to provide the quality of energies required for a high-level projection. If, at any time during the above process, the brow center strobes, and you see a heavy flash of bright silver-white light in your mind's eye, go straight to steps eight and nine and complete the projection. When you succeed at projection using this method, you may experience any of the normal variety of projection-related sensations, or you may feel none at all and just find yourself instantly there inside your target. This method will always cause a higher level of projection than would otherwise be possible. Usually I feel a moment's disorientation, a brief upward-falling"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"142 sensation, a flash of light as my brow center strobes, then I suddenly appear wherever it is I am going. High Level Experiences The Eastern names commonly used to describe higher levels are to the average Western person fairly meaningless. Higher dimensions also do not have signposts in them saying \"Welcome to the Astral Planes — Ta... Daaa!\" or \"Mental Planes — Watch Your Mind!\" or \" Buddhic Planes — Love One Another!\" I have therefore chosen to use my own names for some of the more understandable and less abstract higher dimensional levels, as I have perceived them during some of my more extraordinary projection-cum-mystical experiences. I have entered high levels spontaneously through real-time and astral-plane projections, but normally use the high-level projection method. This includes the extra time and energy raising mentioned in step ten. Rainbow Level I project into a distant multicolored pattern seen sparkling in the distance through the purple-edged vista suffusing my mind's eye. [I find I must wax eloquent here to pass on the look and feel of this incredible place.] I fly over a rainbow bridge and float along an iridescent river until I arrive at a shore of pulsating light. Mind-blowing varieties of indescribable color abound, most not found even in the high astral planes. Thoughts appear and disappear as solid kaleidoscopic crystalline patterns of living light and sound — sparkling vivid imagery exploding like fireworks inside my mind's eye. A brief walk through strobing fields under sparkling skies raining incandescent streamers of ideas yields tantalizing glimpses of the higher abstract workings of consciousness. A stroll through an ever-growing forest of crystalline structures in a constant state of creative flux feeds my hungry imagination and I feel myself swelling greatly in size. Looking to the sky, I fall upward into a flickering maelstrom of gleaming-violet light. More and more abstract it all becomes, swiftly compounding with utterly incredible complexities, ever-changing shapes and colors and sounds. Sweet music fills the air and resonates throughout my being, plucking delicate notes on my heartstrings as my spirit soars. Never have such wondrous sounds been heard by mortal ears... with angelic voices offering song-notes my mind knows not, but that my soul knows well. I have no idea where I am or what is happening, but it is so incredibly beautiful here. It is almost painfully alive and vibrant and I feel invigorated and am empowered with an overwhelming urge to create something wonderful. A poem springs to life inside my mind! With a final mind-numbing purple explosion in my mind's eye, I fall back into my chair, wincing with stunned amazement. My mind aches and races with residual inspirational energies that only moments earlier had pumped through my entire being. If you enter this level, please do not try to rationalize or understand it, for this is way beyond mere mortal understanding. Just accept what you find there, go with the flow and enjoy it! The feel of this level is what, I believe, led the ancient Vikings to name the mythical path into Azgard the Rainbow Bridge. It truly looks and feels as if you are walking up a living rainbow bridge into a spectacular wonderland where it would be easy to imagine the gods must surely dwell. Exist here in wondering amazement. Let loose the child within you and enjoy this fairy wonderland, soaking inspiration from every passing cloud. Everything feels very real and solid here, time is more distorted than in the high astral dimension, and reality is fluid, kaleidoscopic, and abstract in the extreme. Beneath all this brilliantly colorful and changeable crystalline imagery, there is an enormous feeling of power here. There Seems to be a great deal of activity going on everywhere I look. I have glimpsed angels, fairies, and other wonderful beings. Some of these appear as beautiful animated human-looking beings, with an incredibly high-quality cartoonlike look to them. These are, I believe, high-level spirit entities that have no set or recognizable form relating to humanity. Very likely my mind's eye interprets the energies given off by these beings, giving them form and shape. This gives them a beautiful, unworldly appearance that transcends any mere mortal form, encapsulating their beautiful essence while retaining a basically human shape I could relate to. I find meaningful communication with these beings virtually impossible. Tangible warm feelings of love and understanding flood through me whenever I attempt contact, but an exchange of anything resembling words does not seem possible while operating within this dimensional level. My mind's eye, however, literally percolates with multilayered metaphorical imagery, and I am flooded with intuitive impressions at these times. There appear to be many different planes, levels and realms here; overall, it is vastly more complex and abstract than even the highest of the astral planes. Mystical Level This is a beautiful, warm, abstract level, filled with utter peace and infinite love. Soul-deep motherly patience and fatherly understanding permeate the atmosphere here. This is totally different from any other dimensional level I have ever experienced. It has the visual appearance of beautifully textured fluffy-white clouds. There are no sights or sounds here at all, other than the all-pervading, gently billowing white-fluffiness, and a gentle soul-deep humming — beyond sound, almost inaudible — that is wonderfully soothing and healing. There is no sky or ground and no ups or downs-just beautiful, fluffy-white clouds everywhere. In this dimension you very quickly relinquish conscious thoughts of individuality and begin melting into The One, into total and absolute bliss and atonement. Thought is possible here, but the urge and need to think fades very quickly. An irresistible urge draws you deeper into the bliss of total silence and the comforting soul-deep rest of infinite love. You cease being old or young, male or female here. Being here is like returning to the universal mother's womb. Once your mind becomes silent, silence becomes you and you feel as if your mind is immersed in something like warm cotton-wool and you are being cuddled by your soul-mother. You are surrounded, absorbed, and assimilated by infinite love, understanding, forgiveness, and wonderfully healing atonement. Just before you lose track of this experience, you will fully realize who you are, the greater you, but you will never be able to put it into words afterward... more's the pity. Time has no meaning whatsoever here. It has no place here at all. If you enter this world, you will never ever want to leave"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"143 it. It is impossible to generate the intention of deliberately wanting to leave this place. You could bask here forever in perfect contentment and happiness, or until your all-but-forgotten physical body drags you back, kicking and screaming. This is, I believe, the healing and resting place of the soul, which it passes through on its long journey of ascension through the spirit worlds at life's end. Spirit Level My journeys and experiences here are either in the actual spirit world, or possibly in a region bordering it. Here, spirits appear to be waiting for their loved ones. This, I have been inspirationally led to believe, is the happy place of the gathering, where the reunion of souls takes place at life's end. I have been to this level only a few rare, precious times. I always see the same basic structure and features, but the events change. The background is purest, brightest silver-white, much brighter than the Sun could ever be. Yet it is a supremely gentle light for all its incredible brightness, very soothing and healing. It seems to me to be the pure light of divine love. The ground is cream-colored, smooth and feels cool and solid underfoot, like polished textured marble. In front of me is always a large amphitheater-like structure about the size of a football field, sunk into the creamy rock with gentle slopes on all sides, looking to be several feet deep. Behind is a natural incline, rising some twenty feet above the ground. This rises in the middle, spreading out to both sides and then gently sloping away at each side of the amphitheater. The light source comes from behind this rise. I am usually standing about twenty paces or so from the edge of the amphitheater, facing across to the rise on the other side. Usually about a hundred people are spread out over the amphitheater, often clustered in small groups, appearing just as they were in the physical world, but at their most magnificent. They all look younger and fitter, but are fully recognizable. They glow ecstatically with an inner light, ablaze with the brightest of love, happiness and joy imaginable. The atmosphere here is electric and vital but at the same time deeply spiritual and serious. On this level, you can actually feel the Divine Presence as a tangible and all-pervading force. The natural level of communications here is high-level, telepathic metaphorical imaging, with an empathic, intuitive underlay. This is similar to high-quality clairvoyance, from the clairvoyant's side, but is much more powerful than anything I have ever experienced . Normal speech is superfluous. (The few words shown in this experience were not heard as normal speech.) Time stands utterly still and reality is surreal but stable, feeling more real than the physical dimension. I have entered this dimension on only a few rare occasions, each time from the deepest of consciousness-raising meditation, during what I can liken only to a mystical out-of-body experience. Each time, I have experienced extreme crown and brow center activity. On these rare occasions, mystical energy has soared to seemingly impossible heights and consumed me, carrying my spirit along with it. At the climax of this deeply mystical experience, I have seen an incredible bright silver-white light structure. This is always a great distance ahead, at the very edge of my mind's-eye vision, and I can sense it moving closer. Here is one example of my personal experience in this dimensional level. I have tried to write others, but, so far words have failed me... emotions being what they are. The sacred \" Aummmm\" sound surrounds and permeates me and I hear a long, soft, musical note slowly rising in pitch, coming from deep within the light, tugging at my very soul. I have felt this pure high note deep within my heart, calling and drawing me to it. Filling my mind with this note and fixing my mind's eye upon the light, I feel it calling me to it. With every ounce of my strength and energy I hold on to this calling and relinquish my body and life, full of mystical joy. A massive surge of tingling effervescent energy floods through my spine as my body falls away and I soar away... into the light and beyond. Momentary vertigo, a brief sensation of infinite speed through an exploding tunnel of silver-white light, and I am suddenly there. I stagger slightly, catching my balance as if I had tripped, as this wonderful place appears around me. My eyes fill with awe as I see, standing right in front of me, my firstborn son, Jeremy. He was almost eight years old when he left us. He waited politely, but threw himself into my arms like a cannon-ball the instant I looked at him, bubbling with laughter: \"You did it, Daddy, you did it! I told them you'd come... I told them you could do it!\" He looked just as he had when I'd last seen him, sparkling full of life. He hadn't aged a day, although I knew he should have grown some since I last saw him. Jeremy was beaming with happiness and chattering nonstop, his brown eyes shining up into mine. I cuddled him up and my spirit wept with the joy of seeing him again. I felt the sting of quick heavy tears burning the back of my eyes and a huge sob started way down inside me. Stifling this with an act of will, knowing my time here is short and not wanting to spoil it, I took Jeremy under my arm and quickly walked down into the amphitheater. A large crowd of people was waiting for us there. There were friends and family I had known and loved, plus many people I did not recognize. Everyone seemed very friendly and familiar, and I had the feeling I knew many of them ... from some-where or some-when. There were a great many tears of joy and lots of hugging and kissing all round. One other person I dearly wanted to see was an old sweetheart of mine. She was, as usual, jumping higher and cheering louder than anyone else. She stepped out of the crowd and hugged me, her long honey-blonde hair a bright halo tor her impish face. As our eyes met, a mind's-eye vision of startling clarity exploded in my mind, superimposed over my sight. In the vision, she was wearing a spectacular bejeweled and tasseled cowgirl suit, with fancy hat and sparkling, oversized silver guns. She was firing the guns into the air, soundless bright flashes, while she danced an Irish jig and laughed. A lot passed between us in those few moments. Her nickname in real life had been Cowboy, but she was an Irish lass at heart, born and bred in Dublin Fair City ... as she was fond of saying. I glanced at the rise backing the amphitheater. At the top of the ridge were several angels. They looked just as the master Michelangelo painted them. They were truly beautiful beings, but strangely cool, aloof, and serious. Some of them appeared to have what looked like large, folded wings at their backs; some had nothing. They had shoulder-length, curly pale-golden hair; alabaster skin; and wore full-length, flowing white robes. They were all blowing thin golden horns that looked to be several feet long. The pure high note that guided me here came from these magical horns. Stepping clear of the crowd, I walked alone into the open, looking in awe at the angels and at the brilliant light flooding down from behind them. I waved at them, but they did not wave back. The beautiful note coming from the golden horns started fading then and the angels slowly lowered their horns as one. I spun around, trying to breathe everything in all at once and lock it into my brain forever. I stood still for a timeless moment, filled with awe-struck wonder by the enormity of it all."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"144 The trumpets' note died away and the air shimmered around me in a timeless moment of profound silence. Rainbow light imploded in my mind's eye and, with a brief falling sensation, I found myself back in my physical body. I gasped and caught the arms of my chair, then wept as realization dawned on me that I was back in my body. I have never wanted to come back from that beautiful place ... and words fail me utterly at this point. The Summerland There is one more level I have experienced but not yet entered, that I would like to share with you here. I call this the Summerland. Many may think of this as heaven, or one of the heavens (also called spirit worlds), but I cannot really say for sure. It does seem likely, though. The only sources I have ever heard for these descriptions, which are consistent with my experiences, have been elderly spiritualist mediums. The term Summerland is an early spiritualist term for the spirit world — seldom used today. What I have seen and experienced of this level has always been through a rectangular doorway that appears above me. (Imagine a normal-sized door fixed to the ceiling with its door hanging open, the open part facing you, and you have the general idea.) While meditating, a powerful atmosphere of love and tranquillity pervades my room with a quality unlike any other. Kaleidoscopic colors explode ever so slowly inside my mind's eye. Awed and a little stunned at the power of this manifestation, I open my physical eyes as they are drawn to a rectangular doorway, flooding golden light into the room as its door falls slowly open. This light is not only tangible, but also very real, making normal sight possible even in a pitch-dark room. Unmoving, I peer up through the doorway in amazement. Aptly named the Summerland, it looks and smells and sounds and feels like the most wonderful summer's day imaginable. My reeling senses tell me a spectacular wonderland is just on the other side of this heavenly doorway. From all I can see, beyond the doorway is bursting with life, with trees and flowers and birds singing. I can see and hear some of these against a backdrop of blue skies dotted with fluffy white clouds. Flowers blossom slowly through at the edges, framing the doorway with beauty as they hang gracefully into the room. The smell of their perfume is indescribably intoxicating. I feel the warmth of a summer day caressing my skin as golden light bathes my upturned face and hands. Tangible feelings of love and peace and bright-eyed happiness radiate through the doorway. Vivid smells permeate the air, layer on layer of intoxicating beauty: of earth, flowers, grass, hay, leaves, wood, trees, water, and fresh country air warmed by the Sun. I sense and hear gentle waterfalls and streams splashing nearby. Sweet sounds of children playing and laughing, birds fluttering and fluting, and wind playfully gusting through the shady boughs of ancient treetops caress my ears. I ache to rise from the ordinariness of my life and be in this wondrous place, but want to prolong and not spoil what is happening. I wait... patiently. This place feels very familiar, like some lovely place I once knew well, but have now sadly all but forgotten. All I have left are distant heartfelt images and feelings tickling the very edges of my memory, and a soul-deep longing to return. These are like distant childhood memories of dreamy summer days spent traipsing along old adventurers' trails, and of long days spent in the company of beloved siblings and playmates in the faerie playgrounds of a once-enchanted forest."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"145 33. Astral Beings and Wildlife The astral dimension contains a wide variety of nonphysical energetic life forms, whose intelligence level varies enormously. The vast majority of each type appear to have their own agendas, like to keep to themselves, and in general do not like being bothered or interfered with. Not counting high-level beings like demigods, angels, and spirit masters, they range from friendly, to occasionally helpful, to playful, to neutral, to mischievous, to malicious, to downright nasty and evil. These beings appear in a wide variety of illusory forms. Some of the less-intelligent types seem animalistic and predatory by nature, much like the animal and insect wildlife found in the physical dimension: I call these last astral wildlife. Although these all appear to come from somewhere in or near the astral dimension, many are capable of operating in the real-time zone. And some of these, unfortunately, delight in tormenting projectors, especially new ones. In a way, the astral dimension can be likened to the ocean — given the fluid nature of its many internal environments, you can find absolutely anything there: fish, shellfish, octopi, dolphins, whales, sharks, barracuda, sea snakes, crabs, shrimp, jellyfish, turtles, seals, and penguins, etc., etc. Some ocean wildlife is friendly; some is harmless; some is harmful only when disturbed, annoyed, or hungry; some can be unintentionally harmful; and others are downright dangerous all the time. There are also many travelers, some even from far-off lands, found sailing, flying, or swimming (hereabouts. Although many parts of the astral planes appear to be full of life, it is fairly rare to meet up with interested beings while traveling there. But it does happen occasionally. Just about every astral plane and realm has some kind of local inhabitants. These life forms often live in specific areas or realms, and often seem quite unaware of any reality or dimensional level other than their own. They are often amazed when they meet an astral traveler. Other types seem to be well aware of other dimensions, but most seem to have little patience with projectors and tend to ignore them. In a way, approaching astral beings you do not know is very much like approaching strangers in the physical dimension. Most strangers ignore other people, even when politely asked directions or questions. Strangers will, at best, give cursory answers as they hurry away while actively trying to ignore you. Astral beings, too, don't seem to enjoy getting involved with the affairs of strangers, usually having much more important things to do with their time. While projecting, you'll also occasionally meet up with other projectors like yourself, but most of these will not even be aware they are projecting. Projectors' awareness and memories of their physical existence, of who and what they are, vary greatly. Many seem to be sleepwalking or dreaming, or are just going along with the flow of life and events in an astral realm as if they were a part of it and actually lived there. They are often quite surprised when it is pointed out to them that they can fly, etc. I suspect this variability in awareness and memory is caused by many factors, such as energetic development and activity, the amount of energy flowing into the projected double from its physical/etheric body, and whether a projector has made a conscious exit and has retained awareness afterward. The conscious exit out of the body seems to cause a much greater flow of energy into the projected double than is usually available to sleep projectors. It is also possible that the unbroken continuance of awareness provided by a conscious-exit projection removes much of the dreamlike qualities associated with existing in other dimensions. The most important thing to realize about any beings you might come across in the astral dimension is that they are not all dream beings or creations of your own subconscious mind. Intelligent or otherwise, they usually have their own life, meaning, and purpose, whatever that might be. They are, in most cases, not mere decorations to be toyed with or used by any passing astral traveler. And yet, some astral beings will converse with and even actively encourage astral travelers, especially if projectors are courteous and sincere. Like attracts like in the astral planes; if you are friendly and sincere, you are far more likely to meet beings who are also friendly and sincere. The best conduct and safety rule is to keep to yourself, be polite, and mind your own business unless approached or invited to do otherwise. And — always be ready to move quickly away if anything strange or threatening happens, or if you feel uncomfortable in any way. Only very rarely will projectors come across advanced spiritual beings, and even more rarely will they encounter angels. In my opinion, angels are a race of highly advanced spiritual beings. They most definitely exist. I have seen angels many times, in OBEs and visions, as well as with my bare eyes on a few rare and precious occasions. They are impossible to track down or find intentionally during an OBE. They are especially rare in the real-time zone and the low- to midastral planes. You occasionally come across them accidentally, especially in the high-astral and mental dimension. Angels, and other advanced spiritual beings, seem to make themselves visible only when they have a very good reason for doing so. They are definitely not the type to stop and chat in passing. Angels and advanced spirit beings, unlike most astral inhabitants, do not appear limited to any particular plane or dimension level. They have the ability, I believe, to manifest in any level, even in the real-time zone and the physical dimension. They have the ability to enfold lesser beings in their energy and temporarily transport them into other dimensional levels. In this way, they will often be seen helping the spirits of deceased people to manifest temporarily in the real-time zone, or even to help them appear visibly in the physical dimension itself. This kind of thing always has very good reasons behind it, although those reasons may not be apparent at the time. Typically, a spirit manifestation like this will begin with a strong buildup of energy in the room, accompanied by many silver motes and tiny sparkles of light. A tangible aura of power and presence spreads throughout the room and the atmosphere becomes electric. A narrow, vertical shaft of brilliant-silver light then appears and quickly expands, as if curtains of light were being drawn apart just wide enough for a person to walk through. A huge gush of brilliant-silver light, along with a tangible feeling of power, excitement, and love spills through this parting in the dimensional veil. The visiting deceased spirit then simply walks through this opening and stands just inside the room, bathed and held within this pool of light. At this time, if you have the sight and you look further back into the light behind the deceased spirit, you will usually see at least one advanced spirit being or angel standing there, as if patiently waiting a dozen or so feet behind the spirit visitor. A"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"146 deceased relative or friend of the visiting spirit will also often be seen standing just behind and to the side of the spirit visitor, often holding a hand or resting a hand on a shoulder. Astral Ceremonies Whenever projectors consciously exit their bodies, especially new projectors, there is always a small chance they may find themselves in the middle of some kind of extraordinary ceremony. These are incredibly exciting and powerful events. They are usually very nonthreatening, although they may cause some anxiety simply because of their unusual and powerful nature. These are rare, though, and catch most projectors totally by surprise. Perhaps this kind of event takes place to mark a significant milestone in a projector's spiritual development and life's path. The projector may be totally unaware of the significance of this first conscious-exit projection, but the higher spirit beings mark it as an occasion that warrants ceremony. Often a projector appears to experience internal changes during these ceremonies. This type of event can have a considerable effect on a projector's belief system and future life path. I am not suggesting that new projectors should expect anything like this to happen to them, as usually nothing will. And, if nothing does happen, please be thankful for the peace and quiet and use this time to get your astral sea legs, so to speak. On the other hand, it pays to be prepared for the unexpected at all times ... just in case something extraordinary really does happen. High-Level Contact It is possible, while out of body, to contact advanced beings in the astral planes, but this is far more difficult than most people imagine. Just because projectors can get out of their bodies and stumble about the astral planes does not mean they have instant access to advanced spirit beings or guides. For high-level contact to be made at all-in or out of body — it seems that there must be a genuine need for advice or help. High contact does not always work even then. I suspect this is because the need must be important enough to warrant such intervention. Wanting general advice on life, or having a bucketload of questions, does not seem to fit this bill. Advanced spirit beings rarely contact or allow themselves to be contacted by humans. Contact will be made when they think it is warranted — when they think the time is right. Many in our modem world feel directionless, lost, spiritually starved, isolated, and deprived. They naturally yearn for contact with advanced spirit beings to show them the way. They think that if they could only get out of their bodies they could visit these higher beings, or demand an audience, but this just doesn't work. If an advanced being needs to contact someone, it does so. Nothing that person could do would be able to miss or block this contact. People do not need to be out of body, nor psychic nor developed in any way whatsoever for high contact to occur. High-level contact will occasionally happen during a projection, and I have learned a few projection-related ways of helping this along. Projecting consciously out of body and into the astral planes will often, in itself, precipitate some level of contact with advanced spirit beings. I have found, though, that making any kind of high contact is best thought of as a long- term goal, something to be looked forward to, patiently, while making the most of your life in the best way you can; no one can do any better than that. The best way to cultivate high-level contact, and to speed this moment along a little, is through regular, meaningful spiritual service and development, complemented by energetic and psychic development, in that particular order of priority and effort. There are, however, a few projection-related ways that could encourage high-level contact. Sending Out a Request Form a strong intention and hold it in mind every night while falling asleep, especially before making a projection attempt. Visualize and voice this intention, this request, daily through prayers and meditations, or through simple thoughts during quiet moments of each day. Keep this request in the back of your mind during the day, and fall asleep with this on your mind. This will make your request known on higher levels. Symptoms of high contact may appear through dreams and lucid dreams, and not through projections. Projection Method Immediately after each real-time exit, move at least twenty feet away from your physical body and stop. Stand quietly for a moment and reverently state your request for high contact, speaking aloud or mentally. Then, leave your house and fix your eyes on the stars above. If it is cloudy, fly above them, or fly into orbit if it's daylight. Pick out the brightest star you can see, or a group of stars that appeals to you, and while holding your request strongly in mind, project toward them at hyperspeed. Feel yourself moving toward the target and feel it moving toward you. This will cause a dimensional shift into the astral planes and will, hopefully, transport you to a higher-than-normal level, where you will have more chance of finding the contact you desire. Asking for Directions Astral travelers often come across intelligent astral beings, and some will be kind and helpful. They may not have the answers the traveler seeks, but some will proffer advice or give directions, if approached with respect and asked nicely. Some astral beings often seem a bit out of place when you find them, just sitting or standing about looking very unimportant. They seem to delight in tricking projectors and testing out their true nature and intention. They may appear as a small child, an old beggar, or even an animal of some kind. They may appear as a beautiful young man or woman, often scantily clad and with a sexually provocative demeanor. This last is a severe test, as projectors must control not only their thoughts, but also their primal instincts and urges. These beings can be very hard to spot, appearing as absolutely anything, and will usually pick something a projector would least expect. If approached in just the right way, they will often be found to be far more than what they appear to be. Some are only too pleased to give advice and directions, although this will often be a bit on the cryptic side. They may not, as I said,"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"147 have the answers the projector seeks, but will often point them in the right direction, which is a very good start indeed. Alternatively, advanced spirit beings often appear as something more easily recognizable. They will thus often appear in a more traditional and acceptable guise, such as a wise man or woman, often in a form taken from the mind of the projector. Many people today believe they have a spirit guide of a particular appearance and name. An advanced spirit being will sometimes take on this guise to make a planned contact. The Priest and the Curse — Experience A good example of high-level contact came about recently when I had a serious problem. I had been studying the dynamics of psychic attack, and had allowed a fairly strong attack to continue on my person for a little too long before attempting to break away from it. I was observing the methods and tactics used by the perpetrator, and by the entities involved, and was experimenting with wards and countermeasures. It had been ongoing, on and off, for several months. The attack was complex, but my biggest problems were exhaustion and stress. I had found a significant energy blockage in my right hip, which had appeared sometime during the course of the attack. This was draining me of energy and causing a lot of pain. I was in a real mess and could feel myself getting steadily weaker. I could not even balance myself well enough to meditate properly, especially at night. To tell the truth I was getting a bit worried by the mess I'd gotten myself into. The experiment had seemed like a good idea at the time, but I would not recommend this kind of thing to the fainthearted. On a brighter note, I learned a great deal from all of this, which added significantly to my knowledge of these matters. After a great deal of effort, I finally managed to project, albeit somewhat weakly, out of my body. I immediately formed a strong request for help and projected to the stars, aiming for the brightest star in the Southern Cross. My vision blurred and I experienced a brief tunnel-of-light effect as the dimensional shift took me, before it cleared and solidified. I found myself in a candlelit room with rough stone walls and floor. Twenty feet or so in front of me sat a being, in appearance a small, thin old priest well into his eighties. He was wearing a full-length white cotton robe with a plain rope belt tied at the waist, A white skullcap covered the back of his balding gray head, his hair cut very short around this. For all his apparent age, his face seemed young and soft and his eyes sparkled with wisdom, strength, and gentle kindness. Across his lap lay a wide sash, white with gold knotted tassels and edging , with a beautiful gold crucifix emblazoned on it. Around his neck hung a simple gold chain holding a small gold crucifix. I was standing outside a wide circle of candles surrounding him. I stepped up to the circle and introduced myself, feeling a tangible sensation of love and raw power emanating from this insignificant-looking being. The priest looked up at me, his eyes twinkling with amusement as he nodded a pleasant greeting. He beckoned me to come closer and I sat facing him, cross-legged on the floor as he was. I told him my whole story and of the trouble I was in. He listened quietly, eyes half-closed, occasionally asking pertinent questions and steering my discourse. I found him very easy to talk to, and love and respect for him blossomed within me. After I was done talking, the priest sat for a while with his eyes closed then began speaking quietly, offering advice and generally clearing the air about the whole situation. I learned a great deal from this conversation and listened intently. His knowledge and wisdom in these matters astounded me. Never before had I met anyone, living or otherwise, with whom I could talk on this level. At one point, as the priest began talking about my right hip, he moved his hands and beckoned me toward him. I felt myself gripped in a powerful force. I was rolled onto my side and drawn to lie horizontally in front of the priest, facing him, floating just off the floor, suddenly finding myself naked. The priest moved his small hands over my body and finally laid them on my hip. My hip joint moved and felt like it was being turned inside out. This did not hurt but felt rather uncomfortable. The priest moved his hands slowly back and a murky-dark, roughly shoebox-shaped object, shot through with dull-reddish and orange lumps and grisly black lines floated out of my hip. He pulled this away from my skin slightly and showed me angry red and black cords extending like sticky strings into my hip, groin, and upper thigh. It was an ugly-looking thing and felt like it was attached to my nerves in those areas. When the priest moved his hands under it, I could feel nerves tugging and twanging uncomfortably, deep inside my body. He smiled with interest and said: \"Goodness, I have not seen one of these in ages. Most of them wear off after a few years, but one like this can last for generations\". \"What is it?\" I asked. \"A curse, most likely from a witch\", he decreed, \"and a powerful one at that. I would say you've had this for a very long time. You will remember how you got it one day\", he said, stopping what he was doing for a moment and looking deep into my eyes. \"And then you must come back and see me again. Luckily, being so old, it's in a greatly weakened state, although still quite active. It seems to have been altered many times, and is now working in a way it was not designed for. This has probably come about through the many attacks you have suffered during your earthly life, especially this current one. \"You have powerful enemies, Robert. Curses like this affect the atmosphere around a person, causing false attractions and repulsions in them, and in the people around them, something like a bad luck charm, only much worse. The energetic fields emanating from this device cause disruptions in the currents of universal law ; much as a steel object can interfere with the accuracy of a magnetic compass. \"Curses like this are not of your world. They are usually designed to have a particular negative effect. This is most likely the reason why the source of your current attack was attracted to you in the first place, and why she has been able to cause you so much trouble. I'll see what I can do with it\". With that, the priest reverently lifted and laid the wide sash over my hip. He then closed his eyes and began speaking softly in a tongue I did not understand, although it sounded a bit like Latin. A brilliant-white light then spouted from his hands and bored deep inside me, all around and through the strange thing on my hip. I felt nerves twanging and pricking and then a tickling, almost erotic, feeling flooded through my groin as the thing brightened suddenly and then faded. It changed visibly, filling with sparkling-white motes of light, then dissolved back inside my body. \"Robert, please listen to me very carefully. Mine is the magic that binds and releases. I cannot harm, remove, or destroy this thing for you. It is alive in its own special way and I cannot kill it for you. I can only bind it in such a way that its effects on you will be reduced to a more tolerable level. Only you can remove this, but first you must remember how you got it, who gave it to you, and, most importantly, why they would do such a terrible thing\". It felt like a great weight had been lifted off me and my hip felt tender and a little numb. The numbness spread and soon became an intense buzzing. The priest's face slowly faded as the stone room disappeared and my own room materialized around me. I slid down and gently swam back into my body. I came wide awake to find my right hip and thigh really were numb and buzzing, so I took a limping walk around the house (raiding the fridge in passing) until it settled down to a more comfortable level, I returned to bed an hour later and soon fell peacefully asleep, voicing my thanks in prayer to the wonderful being I had just met."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"148 After being under attack for so long, night after night after night, the peace and quiet and lack of activity in my room was tangible, like a healing balm to me. I awoke the next morning greatly refreshed , with no cramps or pain at all and my hip felt a whole lot better. The aftermath of this experience was that I grew quickly stronger and the debilitating effects of the psychic attack reduced considerably. As soon as I was strong enough, with a few more good nights' sleep under my belt, I broke the connection and threw off the attack completely. Thought Form or Nonphysical Life-Form? There is a popular argument, regularly put today, that all negative-type nonphysical entities are simply thought forms, created and propagated spontaneously or deliberately by the fears, thoughts, and fantasies of mankind. These are generally considered manifestations of the darker side of the collective consciousness of mankind, given form in the lower astral subplanes over an extended period of time. These are also thought of as something like independent, self-motivated thought forms. I believe that this is a simplistic way of accepting the obvious existence of nonphysical beings, as simple thought forms. It avoids the uncomfortable issues raised by the possibility that some negative life forms may have different origins and be completely independent. This last possibility upsets many people's framework of how the universe works. Entertaining this possibility seems to foster belief-system confusion, discomfort, and insecurity in many people. This also generates a feeling of helplessness when confronted by something they actively wish to discount and disbelieve in. The majority of people, I have found, do not like to believe in or talk about the existence of devils and demons, demonic realms, and other nasties that might go bump in the night. Similarly, many people disbelieve there may be any other intelligent life form in the universe: All UFO sightings are explainable as natural phenomena or weather balloons. Accepting the possibility of intelligent alien life forms, possibly with a higher level of intelligence and technology than our own, fosters deep-seated belief-system confusion, discomfort, and insecurity — simply through the many issues this possibility raises. There is a fine distinction, I believe, between real nonphysical life forms from another dimension, and simple thought forms. Many nonphysical life forms, while generally classified today as mindless thought forms, seem to originate from other dimensions entirely, possibly even from dimensions parallel to our own. The distinction between these types, thought forms or independent beings, is basically one of intelligence. Their limitations of intelligence are shown by their ability to think, adapt, and innovate. Thought forms, by nature, are mental creations, and exhibit only the behavioral traits or intelligence programmed into them during their creation. They have no innate natural intelligence with which to think, adapt, and innovate when faced with new and intellectually challenging situations. True nonphysical life forms, on the other hand, would logically have some level of natural intelligence, and would therefore be capable of some adaptation and innovation. The level of flexibility and originality exhibited would, obviously, be set by their level of intelligence. This would make classification through the observation of their reactions to stimulus at least feasible. If all negative entities are thought forms, then logically so are all positive entities, including all advanced spirit beings, spirit guides, and angels. And it cannot be said that our universe-living physical beings as well as nonphysical beings — contains only positive manifestations of consciousness. In my life and explorations I have found distinct similarities between the physical dimension and nonphysical dimensions like the astral. Each contains both positive and negative aspects, and many subtle gradients in between. This whole argument does not appear to have any reasonable solution. Neither type can be captured, examined, dissected, and properly classified, or even accurately traced back to its origins, in anything resembling a reliable scientific way. This leaves observation, experience, and reasoning as the only tools with which to form any kind of opinion. It becomes a bit of a moot point when you have to deal with astral wildlife and other nonphysical beings of any type on a firsthand basis. I will, therefore, continue to expound on this subject as I see it, according to my own observations, experience, and reasoning. Lower Subplane Wildlife The most troublesome types of astral wildlife appear to come from the notorious lower astral subplanes that contain the darker and more negative aspects of the astral planes. These can be likened to parallel shadows of the more positively oriented parts of the astral planes. While still a part of the astral planes, technically speaking, they are a distinctly separate aspect or part of it, containing all the darker qualities. Another way of looking at this is to consider this to be the night side of the astral planes. Low astral wildlife normally seem capable of operating only in dimensions similar to or lower than their dimension of origin. This is reasonable, based on the energetic limitations set by their nature and dimensional level of origin. Some of these beings do seem capable of operating in the real-time zone. (The real-time zone can be thought of as being fairly neutral territory, dimensionally speaking.) All lower types, regardless of classification or origin, appear to be predatory loners showing varying degrees of strength, intelligence, and ability. Negative beings exhibit a cold and almost insectlike nature. Higher feelings like love, compassion, and mercy are totally alien to them. This does not, however, mean they are evil; it just means they have no higher feelings. A garden spider has no higher feelings; it is not evil for killing and eating a beautiful butterfly. It is a spider and acts according to its nature; spiders feed on insects to survive. In my experience, negative types do not work well together, regardless of possible shared origins. They usually appear to be quite aggressive and combative toward each other, which results in a distinct pecking order whenever they are found together. Astral wildlife may sometimes be forced to work together, temporarily, through circumstances where they have a"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"149 common interest or need. Astral wildlife can manifest in an enormous variety of illusory and changeable forms. Regular favorites are ugly grinning monkeys, gargoyles, and harpy forms. Some seem to prefer a more traditional horned-demon look, while others go for a more contemporary appearance. These latter forms are possibly modeled on horror movies and TV shows, or even from the modem nightmares of mankind. The size and appearance of an entity, as seen by a projector, or with real-time or astral sight, gives no fair indication of its actual strength and intelligence. Many small and weak entities seem to delight in looking big and dangerous, much as an animal will fluff up its fur during a confrontation to make itself seem bigger. Stronger and more intelligent entities do not seem to bother overmuch with pretense and may even use their original form — if they have one, that is. I have seen entities the size of polar bears run screaming when \"BOO!\" is said to them. I have also seen others the size and appearance of large rats with which I would not interfere by choice. Many entities seem to choose a form taken from the mind of a projector (which indicates some degree of telepathic ability) and use it to generate the maximum possible level of fear. This is a very good reason for projectors to keep their minds clear and mask their true feelings when they encounter or are forced to deal with astral wildlife. The weaker and by far the most common types of astral wildlife, those responsible for the majority of elemental and dweller-type scare attacks (see chapter 34) seem to have little power of their own. These are fairly weak, timid creatures and their appearance is always a greatly exaggerated illusion. They generally avoid direct encounters with projectors, and usually beat a hasty retreat whenever approached by a projector with a firm or confrontational attitude. Most negative entities dislike direct attention and actively avoid being seen. Some types of astral wildlife seem attracted to, and possibly even feed on, the energetic vibrations generated and broadcast by overly fearful projectors. Continued fear and timidity on the part of a projector seems to make astral wildlife more aggressive. Their intimidating behavior is, however, always without direct attack. This indicates they are not capable of mounting a direct attack on a projector, and my experience supports this. Increased and continuing fear on the part of a projector will often attract others of the same type, thus increasing their numbers and making things generally worse for a projector. Still, the appearance of these types is quite rare. The vast majority of astral wildlife do not, I believe, have the power to directly injure a projector, but caution is always advised in these matters. It is commonly thought that nonphysical entities of any type are completely harmless to projectors, and are only capable of scaring them. While this is generally true, as with the elemental and dweller types discussed later in this book (see chapter 34), there are exceptions. Real-time, astral, and all higher bodies are virtually invulnerable, and definitely cannot be destroyed or killed. But it is possible to suffer energetic damage and weakness through intense or prolonged attack by the stronger and more intelligent types of nonphysical entities. Cases of this are extremely rare, but if the energetic substance of a projected double became damaged, this damage could reflect back into its physical body. In this case, the physical body could experience unusual tiredness. Even more rarely, swellings, rashes, and strange marks could also appear on the physical body. These are much like the swellings, watery blisters, and rashes that are an occasional side effect of energetic development work (see chapter 13), especially during the early stages when energetic pathways are being cleared and conditioned. All these symptoms heal unusually quickly, often disappearing within just a few hours. The energy body heals and restores itself very quickly if its substance is disturbed or damaged in any way. Any significant attack causing energy substance loss in the projected double has a fail-safe side effect. It causes the immediate abortion of that projection as a reflex action. Projection is a delicately balanced process involving a constant two- way energetic-cum-telepathic exchange between the physical body and its projected double. It does not take much to interfere with this process and cause it to abort, resulting in the immediate return of the projected double to the safety of its physical body. Please keep in mind here that attacks, and especially attacks causing actual energetic damage or substance loss, are rare in the extreme and not something to overly worry about. The risk is roughly equivalent to a recreational swimmer being seriously injured by dangerous marine life. For the average swimmer, injuries are fairly rare events, with the biggest danger being nothing more than an occasional jellyfish sting. Professionals and deep-sea divers, however, spend a great deal more time in unexplored and untamed ocean depths, and thus face a slightly greater risk of harm than do recreational swimmers. This also applies to frequent projectors, especially those with a natural propensity for the more occult and metaphysical aspects of out- of-body exploration. Lastly, this also applies to the more experienced projectors who actively help people suffering from psychic attacks and other such entity-related problems. To the best of my knowledge, if projectors mind their own business, stay calm, use common sense, and project away if they ever find themselves in a bad situation, they have very little to worry about. Out of all the thousands of projection-related case histories I have been consulted on, I have only come across a very small handful of situations where really troublesome astral wildlife were involved. In the majority of these cases, once this situation was confronted with a braver and more positive attitude, the problem entities, whether real or imagined, simply vanished."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"150 34. Fear and Astral Noises Fear — produced by unexpected or heavy exit sensations, by unexplainable astral noises and voices, or simply by exposure to the out-of-body environment — represents a significant barrier to OBE. Fear is a natural barrier that shields unready projectors from exposure to the out-of-body environment until they are able to cope. This especially applies to novice projectors who, although they may be keen, have a more delicate emotional disposition than they realize. Fear stops nervous and unsure projectors cold, as any good fail-safe mechanism should, until they are mentally resilient enough to cope with the pressures and strains involved with out-of-body operations. An important aspect of learning how to project is to progressively overcome all related fears. As each level of fear is overcome, the projector conquers a significant natural barrier. Facing and overcoming each type and level of fear as it appears prepares and conditions the projector for more extensive out-of-body operations — one step at a time. The Many Colors of Fear Fear related to the projection exit is a natural gut reaction caused by unusual and often extreme sensations, events, and situations. It causes would-be projectors to abort their exits time and time again, usually right on the brink of their very first, long-sought conscious-exit projection. However, most projection-related fears are born of simple ignorance. Knowledge replaces fear by making the unknown and unexpected the known and expected. The feelings that can be generated by heavy exit sensations, if not fully prepared for, can cause needless terror and panic. Bad projection experiences, if left unexamined and uncounseled, can psychologically condition projectors against future OBEs. This can significantly increase difficulty levels during future attempts, much as a tender tooth will make you flinch as you go to brush it from remembered pain, even long after it has healed. The physical body/mind remembers pain and unpleasant experiences, and quickly establishes conditioned responses to avoid any recurrences in the future. Many people have come to me with this problem, although most were thoroughly warned of what they might expect, after reading my on-line (Internet) tutorials. In the majority of cases, projectors were forced to abort their first successful exit simply because they were unprepared for the enormity of the resulting sensations. Please do not think I am exaggerating here. This is a major issue for all new projectors! I would spare you surprises and give you fair warning in advance, thereby fully preparing you for what you might have to face. You may face no heavy exit sensations at all, or none you cannot easily deal with. Some first-projection exits are quite gentle affairs. Some people just seem to pop or buzz out of their bodies with no problem. However, be warned that these lucky people are in a fairly small minority. Heavy Exit Sensations The presence of the awake mind during the separation phase of projection, even though the full-trance state has been achieved, causes major energetic conflicts between the physical/etheric body and its projecting double. This is especially true for novice projectors, whose energy bodies have not had time to develop and allow for the conscious-exit projection mechanism. Unwary projectors are usually completely unprepared for the visceral enormity of the final stages of the exit. They are usually blown away by a massive sensory overload. Many people honestly and sincerely believe they are dying, which panics them into aborting the exit in any way they can. Exit sensations are always much heavier during the first few conscious exits. However, they progressively ease during repeated attempts, as the projection mechanism begins energetically adapting and developing. This makes early projection attempts, even failed ones, something of a two-edged sword. They force the energetic development of the projection mechanism and the energy body, thereby making future projection easier. But, they can also cause intimidating stresses and strains that may create a psychological flinch response if not handled carefully, thereby making projection more difficult during future conscious-exit attempts. Understanding the mechanics and dynamics of the projection process helps overcome a great many projection exit problems. \"Forewarned is forearmed\". I intend to make aspiring new projectors fully aware of just what they might have to face. Hopefully, this hands-on knowledge will help them maintain control so they don't totally freak out and blow their first conscious-exit OBE. The positive psychological conditioning generated by a first successful conscious-exit projection, even an ultrashort one, is extremely important. There is nothing like success to empower the learning of any difficult skill. Because of the above, I advise against attempting a partial conscious exit, \"just to see what it feels like\", before committing to a full exit. A partial exit attempt will always generate much heavier than usual energetic conflicts and sensations, which can be heavier and longer lasting than with a full-blown conscious exit. A bad experience can condition and deter projectors against future exit attempts. Negative conditioning can increase not only the exit difficulty, but also the severity, of future exit sensations. Do... or do not! Project... or do not project! No in-betweens are advised. The faster you get through the exit phase of a projection, the sooner heavy exit sensations cease. When you are ready to try for a full exit, just do it and be ready to put everything you have behind it. Commit yourself, psych yourself up, and be ready to go through with the exit bravely, come what may. This attitude will also give you a much higher chance of succeeding with your first conscious-exit attempt. Be prepared for a fairly rough time during your first exit. Be prepared to weather an inner earthquake of unbelievable magnitude. I want you to be ready to handle this storm calmly and stoically if it does happen to you — and calmly is an absolute must! Be prepared to tough out the exit come what may, calmly and intelligently, knowing that it cannot hurt you and will very soon end. Heavy exit sensations can last anything from ten seconds to five minutes, depending on the speed and difficulty of the exit. However, these will always be milder, and end far sooner, if the exit phase is kept short. If you stay calm, balanced, and under control, the exit will become smoother much more quickly. Heavy exit sensations end the moment separation is complete."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"151 Projections involving the brow and crown centers, where projectors perceive themselves as leaving their body through their head, are generally accompanied by fairly gentle exit sensations. On that note, according to my research, a far higher percentage of women than men can expect to experience head-or brow-type exits. However, the majority of projectors should expect strong activity in their heart centers. Heavy exit sensations will not be experienced by everyone. Nor will they happen during every type of projection. It is far better to expect them, though, than to be caught unprepared, as happens so often to so many new projectors. To illustrate heavy exit sensations, here is a very early experience of mine. I was teaching myself conscious-exit projection and going through the same exit problems and frustrations many of you may now be experiencing. This illustrates the strongest exit sensations, I think, that any new projector could be expected to face. I have been projecting since a very early age, three or four years old, but all my early projections were spontaneous and involved no real technique or conscious effort. Later, when I became interested in OBE, I had to start at the very beginning. I had to develop all the necessary skills like deep physical relaxation, concentration, and trance. I then had to learn the conscious exit, just as many of you are learning now. I knew it was possible, having vivid memories of many childhood OBEs, but that did not make the learning process any easier or shorter. I had tried many times to project before this, but so far with only one successful exit. (But that experience was so unusual that I cannot reasonably use it here as a fair example.) I had been lying in bed for more than an hour, relaxing my physical body and trying to induce the trance state. I finally felt the heaviness of trance spread through my body, then started raising energy and stimulating my primary energy centers. I was using a fairly obtuse visualization technique here, which was all I knew at this time. I worked on each of my primary centers until I felt some sign of activity in them, then started using my new projection technique. I shifted my point of awareness out and tried to feel as if I were floating above my physical body. I worked hard on being aware of how the room changed and felt from that position, and of staying aware of where my physical body was from this new perspective, which was extremely difficult and required a lot of concentration. I held my mind clear, and strained to hold my point of whole-body awareness fixed above my physical body. A bone-deep tickling sensation spread through my body, and a kind of localized dizziness started in my stomach and chest. My heart, or rather my heart center, began fluttering noticeably; this sensation grew steadily stronger. The bone-deep tickling, dizzy sensation soon began surging and droning through my body in waves, also growing steadily stronger. This was especially strong in my stomach and chest. It soon grew into a much heavier type of whole-body vibrational droning wave. I started to feel a steadily increasing pressure all over my body. This was particularly strong around my head. The dizziness felt like a spinning or falling sensation. This quickly intensified and it soon felt as if I were caught up in some kind of insane amusement park ride. These were major weird and incredibly strong sensations. In the back of my mind, I began to wonder if I might be dying, but was also thrilled by the sensory enormity of it all and of the likelihood of OBE success. I gritted my mental teeth, determined not to let this get the better of me as it had on previous attempts, and to go through with it come what may. Strange noises faded in and out around me, like the sounds of furniture being dragged and thrown roughly and loudly about on wooden floors. I also heard the muttering of voices and occasional laughter. I ignored all this, knowing (hoping) they were just astral noises like I had read and heard of before. Incredible colors, shapes, patterns of light, and images floated across my vision behind my closed eyes. The bone-deep buzzing, droning waves and dizziness increased, accompanied by an even heavier falling sensation, as if I were continually falling backward from a great height. This falling sensation made me feel quite nauseous. The pressure around my head increased painfully, as if I had an overtight leather belt wrapped around it and an invisible sadist were slowly tightening it. By this time, my heart felt like it was close to jumping out of my chest. My body felt incredibly heavy and tight with pressure. In the back of my mind, I wondered again if I might actually be dying. The vibrations, pressure, racing heart, and falling sensations all increased until I thought I would either scream or pass out — they were so very, very strong. Loud noises thundered and crashed in the room around me, now sounding like heavy chains were being noisily dragged over corrugated iron sheeting near my bed. I ignored everything and stayed focused on keeping myself relaxed and focused on what I was doing, holding my point of whole-body awareness out in front of me. Steeling my mind, I strained to maintain control. I could now see details of the room around me through my closed eyelids, as if my eyes had opened. My whole body surged with massive, droning waves of vibrations and surging energy movement. My heart center raced like a lawnmower engine and my head felt as if it were going to be crushed under the painful pressure. Vibrations literally roared throughout my body and my heart center raced impossibly faster and faster, feeling as if my actual heart were racing. Suddenly, everything changed and I felt myself separating from my physical body. I began rising upward, buzzing out of a storm of major uncomfortable body sensations. Rising faster and smoother now, I finally buzzed free of my body. The really heavy sensations stopped the moment I achieved separation. They changed to an intense whole-body buzzing as the projection reflex buzzed me out of my body. The whole-body buzzing stopped as I came to rest near the foot of my bed. I was out of my body and free at last! I could see the room around me clearly even though it was fairly dark, with only a little moonlight filtering through the blinds into my room. It was very quiet; there was no sign of any cause for the strange noises and voices I'd heard on the way out of my body. I felt marvelous and full of energy, exhilarated by my success but strangely calm inside. A little nervously, I floated around the semidark room, getting my sea legs. I wondered what might be lurking in the shadows or waiting for me in the dark night outside. Probably nothing, but I am by nature fairly cautious. While this was basically similar to the many spontaneous projections I'd had as a child, it was also strangely different. It felt much more powerful and real. I willed myself into motion and floated away from my body and out through the wall. Outside, the moonlight cast eerie moving shadows through the windswept trees onto the cold, damp pavement. I floated out onto the road and skimmed along it. I could feel and smell and taste the dew-laden night air intensely. The world around me felt very solid and real. Picking up a little speed, I swooped into the air, flapping my arms and skimming through the tree-tops, just clearing them as I circled my home. I hovered a while, then it all came back to me, all the OBE skills I'd learned and used as a child. I spun around a few times, taking everything in before letting myself float gently down through the branches of an ancient pine tree. I could smell and feel and taste the leaves and all the bitter-dry tastes of sap and living wood and bark as I floated through the twisted trunk to the ground. Flushed with success, but for some reason feeling a little anxious, I floated back to my house and waiting body. I had no idea why I felt so anxious, especially after all the time I'd spent fearlessly out of body as a child. Maybe it was just because it was dark and creepy out here in the dead of night."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"152 I returned to my room, entering through the roof and moving down to my body. As I got closer I felt something almost like gravity pulling me toward it. As I reentered, I felt a tingling, buzzing, whole-body rush. I felt myself being sucked upward through my stomach and chest — but I felt this from my physical body's perspective, as if something were entering me. My eyes opened and I came wide awake... immensely pleased with my new success. Next time I vowed I'd stay out longer and do some exploring! Later, over a respectable snack of cheese-and-pickle sandwiches and a jug of ice-cold milk, I began filling out the second entry in my new OBE journal. Excitement and Anxiety Excitement and anxiety, combined with the flush of imminent success, can generate an adrenaline-type body rush that can ruin an exit attempt in moments. This may appear to have similarities with the torso energetic surge, dealt with earlier, but has a quite different cause. A combination of trepidation, anxiety, and sheer excitement causes a surge of adrenaline through the physical body. This instantly breaks the delicately balanced state required for projection, usually just as the projection reflex starts to cut in and the projector suddenly realizes he or she is about to have a fully conscious OBE. A great many projectors have problems with this. They work hard and do everything right and then, just as the vibrations start and the projection reflex starts to kick in, it happens again. Suddenly, they realize what is about to happen and get overexcited, thereby losing focus and control over the experience. As quickly as it began it stops right there , leaving them wide awake and cursing themselves, knowing it was their fault. Many people have the impression that once they manage to trigger the projection reflex and are about to exit their body, they have succeeded. They think they can just sit back and enjoy the experience from there on in. This is definitely not the case... so be warned. The requirements for holding a deeply relaxed physical body and a clear, focused mind do not suddenly end the moment a projector starts to exit the body. It is necessary to continue holding the delicately balanced state at all times, not only before and all through the exit, but for the entire projection. Any surge of excitement or strong emotion can abort a projection before, during, or after the exit. Uncontrollable excitement during the exit shows a lack of mental and emotional control in any would-be projector. This also has, apart from the above, the potential to cause a great many problems in the out-of-body environment. This is another aspect of the natural barrier that fear forms, which like all natural barriers has a certain fail-safe beauty to it. These safeguard unready projectors (no matter how keen) from exposure to the sensitive out-of-body environment where emotions are not quite so private, internal, and harmless. An overly excitable projector could easily run into trouble during a projection through a simple lack of self-control. The out-of-body environment is fluid and easily affected by thought and imagination, most especially by those of the subconscious mind. A slight tingle of fear, caused perhaps by a glimpse of something imagined moving among the shadows, combined with a slight fear of the dark, could easily escalate into a major fear episode. This could result in trauma and negative psychological conditioning against further OBEs. There is another, more subtle, aspect to consider, concerning the mind-split effect. Often a projection can be successful but the physical/etheric mind is so excited by the exit sensations that strong memories form in the physical brain. In this case, awareness remains firmly centered in the physical/etheric body. This can make it difficult for the projected double to download its shadow memories into accessible levels of the physical brain during reintegration. The projection side of an experience can thus be lost. This can be a major problem with new projectors who have little experience with shadow memory recall. The solution to all these above problems is to stay calm, focused, and relaxed. Keep a firm grip on emotions before, during, and after the exit and throughout the whole course of the projection. If projectors can ignore heavy exit sensations and overcome fear, anxiety, and excitement during the exit, they can also refuse to feel these after the exit. They can jump up and down and celebrate and release all their emotions once they return to their physical body! They can, in fact, use this emotional release to empower shadow memories, and make them literally more memorable during the reentry phase. It is therefore permissible, even advisable, to mentally jump up and down and shout out success — only during the reentry phase. This will help overwrite existing physical/etheric body memories for the same time period, and will cement shadow memories into the physical brain for easy recall. Once projectors have successfully passed through the conscious-exit barrier, managed to maintain self-control, and have returned for controlled reentry, they have passed an important test. They are now ready to begin learning how to operate in the out-of-body environment and to travel and explore farther afield. The Unknown and the Darkness Fear of the unknown out-of-body environment is another natural barrier all new projectors face. This is an experientially unknown environment. It is quite natural to feel some measure of trepidation, even a little healthy fear. New projectors may have read many stories about what this is like, but they have never truly experienced it for themselves. Many children are afraid of the dark. Their parents tell them there's nothing to be scared of. They open the wardrobe doors and prove there is nothing lurking there or under the bed. After all that, children still fear the unknown and all-encompassing darkness and demand a nightlight. This is natural caution turned into fear by imagination, simply because they cannot see in the dark and hence don't know what's really there. This is very much like what can happen in the back of new projectors' minds, fed by imagination, when they first get out of body. The unknown qualities and changed aspects of the once-familiar environment, plus the rumors, horror stories, and movies can scare them witless. This can easily break their nerve and ruin their focus, time and time again ruining otherwise successful projections, driving them back into the perceived safety of their physical bodies. Some courage is definitely required during an OBE, especially when sojourning into the real-time environment at night. These fears must be quashed before they can take root and start interfering with the OBE. Always remember that the sensitive out-of-body environment is greatly affected by emotion, and like attracts like in a big way. If fear is allowed to grow, then a more fearful or even sinister aspect can be added to the out-of-body environment,"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"153 manifested around projectors by the creative ability of their own subconscious mind. Even if deep inside some genuine fear is felt, it is strongly advisable not to allow it to surface in the conscious mind. Be positive and brave and act as if you are totally fearless. Face the unknown out-of-body environment bravely! If you cannot do this, you really should not be projecting. Always remember that nothing can hurt you while you are out of your body. The projected double is an energetic being and therefore virtually invulnerable. It can swim in molten lava or fly through the middle of a supernova without getting a scratch. Cultivate becoming a calm and dispassionate observer at all times, fearless in mind and spirit, and you will soon become unafraid of the out-of-body environment. This attitude will help you progressively overcome any genuine fears you may have, even little ones, through the accumulation of personal out-of-body experience. This turns the unknown into the known and familiar, which progressively reduces fear levels. Mind-Split-Generated Fear In the real-time zone, especially, fear can cause compounding and tangible feelings of presence, dread, and mindless terror to be generated and compounded between the physical/etheric body and its projected double. This is an emotional energetic interaction related to waking paralysis and astral feedback. It is not caused by an independent source. This feedback will progressively intensify and compound if nothing is done about it. The stronger the emotion, the stronger the feedback, especially if the projector is operating close to the physical body in the real-time zone. This effect pretty much disappears if you put some distance between yourself and your physical body. Leave the house and keep on moving until the feeling subsides. Mental focus and control, plus a calm and dispassionate observer attitude, stop emotional feedback from starting and reduce the likelihood of other potentially negative problems manifesting. Primal Gut Reaction Probably the most difficult type of fear for any new projector to overcome is the primal gut reaction caused by energies generated by the physical/etheric body during the projection process. During the conscious exit, or the spontaneous exit in which the projector becomes aware during the exit, the body and mind of the projector experience strong, full-body sensations caused by energies normally only generated during the sleep state. The presence of waking consciousness magnifies these energetic sensations greatly; the conscious mind has no experience with these energies and therefore has nothing to fall back on as it tries to get used to them. Projectors experience a fearful gut reaction, a strong sense of wrongness and great danger all around. I believe this is caused by the primal fight or flight response. Projectors sense danger, but as no source of danger is apparent , they intuitively sense flight as being the only option for survival. This primal survival instinct floods the projector's mind with overpowering primal fear. Most new projectors will have to deal with some level of primal fear during early OBEs. This fear progressively eases as they gain experience, but some level of fear is usually always present. This fear forms a strong natural barrier to OBE. Your ability to master your fears and plow through this barrier shows you have passed a significant test and are ready for OBE. Dweller on the Threshold The infamous dweller on the threshold type of experience, plus astral noises and voices, are probably the most well-known manifestations faced by some new projectors. The dweller phenomenon is, I believe, another aspect of the natural barrier that fear creates. This must be faced and dealt with bravely before new projectors affected by this problem can operate freely out of their bodies. The dweller type of manifestation, while well known, is definitely not a universal OBE-related problem that everyone has to face. Far from it. My research shows that a dweller-type manifestation will trouble less than one in twenty new projectors, and then only during their first few OBEs. Astral noises and voices, however, will intermittently bother most new projectors. Please do not expect this to happen when you first get out of your body. Worrying about this could easily cause your own subconscious mind to manifest it. I think this is what happens in most cases, considering the sensitive out-of-body environment and the effect that fear can have on it. The dweller can happen in a great many variations, but is usually a combination or variation of the following: Immediately after exit, you find a shadowy, menacing humanoid shape, usually all featureless black with burning red eyes. It may just stand there motionless, or it may take a few steps forward and make threatening gestures. It may be silent or may breathe heavily and loudly. It may snarl, growl, giggle, or laugh. It may even speak and order you back into your body, often by name. It may threaten you with doom and gloom if you continue with your projection. The classic dweller monster never attacks or harms a projector. I have not had a single report of a dweller so much as touching a projector. It is an illusion. It should be confronted and ordered away, or totally ignored, or both. My best advice is to be brave, march right up to it, glare at it, and as loudly as you can order it to (#*&) off! Then, turn around and leave the area, totally ignoring it from then on. It will not be there waiting for you on your return. I have given here what may appear to be some fairly extreme examples of the dweller type of experience. These examples are pretty standard, though, and are not exaggerated in the slightest. I much prefer to prepare new projectors for what they might have to face, rather than to play all this down and have them taken by surprise in the middle of the exit. The dweller on the threshold is a bully! Like all bullies, when bravely confronted, the wind is taken from its sails, and it either runs or is reduced to harmless ranting and raving. Logic suggests that if the dweller were indeed a genuine threat capable of causing actual harm, it would not just stand and threaten. It would attack immediately, making use of the element of surprise and of the fearful state of the projector. Dwellers would most certainly not consistently warn and scare projectors back into their bodies before the exit with astral noises and voices, not if they were genuinely interested in harming them, or if they were capable of doing so. All this indicates that they are probably afraid of projectors and have no real power with which they could harm them."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"154 I believe that some dweller types of experiences can be considered manifestations of a projector's own subconscious fears. At other times, interfering low-order astral wildlife appear to be responsible, possibly attracted by the projector's own fears and by the energetic vibrations these produce and broadcast before and during early projections. I have not come across any evidence or experience, mine or anyone else's, to support the idea that the dweller is any type of personal watcher or guardian angel of projection. I have never experienced any type of being that fits this bill. The watcher being or guardian idea, I think, stems from the widespread belief that the physical body is left empty and vulnerable during projection. I have never faced a true dweller type of experience. My mother, though, had dweller experiences during her first few conscious-exit projections, many years ago when I was still in my teens. Being a spiritualist, my mother actively ignored these beings when they appeared, and kept repeating the Twenty-third Psalm until they left her alone, as she had been instructed to do by her church. For her, the dweller manifestation appeared as many small, ugly, monkey-sized beings that growled and sniggered and clutched at her as she was leaving her body. When this happened she repeated her prayer and actively ignored them while continuing along her way, soon leaving the area and the elementals far behind. They were not there when she returned to her body some time later. I have heard the same story from many other spiritualists and found they were all in some way instructed that this was to be considered normal. They were told to expect these elementals to be there when they first got out of body. This brings me to consider that psychological conditioning may be partly responsible here, and that the dweller will sometimes manifest as a form the projector either consciously or subconsciously expects. The projected double is an extremely powerful being, even if a projector does not know this and has no idea how to use its defensive or offensive capabilities. The projected double of a living human being, with all its enormous resources, is definitely not to be trifled with. Negative entities can sense this potential and are naturally wary of all projectors and most especially of strong real-time projectors. I think the above provides some very real clues as to why these negative types go to all this trouble to inhibit novice projectors in the first place. I think that any new projector about to consciously project into the real-time zone causes negative entities in the local area to panic. They then do everything in their power to stop them from projecting, simply because they fear the potential consequences. I consider all elemental and dweller-type manifestations to be illusions. The sources of these illusions may vary, but if generated by an independent source there must, logic suggests, be a reason for it. In the case of negative entities, everything points to this being a widespread push against projectors that appears to have been going on for a very long time. Knowing this, I suggest that all new projectors do not give these negative types the pleasure. A little competition is said to be healthy, and every new projector let loose in the real-time zone adds one more potential soldier to the ranks of the good guys. Always keep in mind, no matter what happens during a projection, that projectors never leave their physical body empty and exposed during any type of OBE. The physical body always safely contains the original copy of mind and memory. The physical/etheric body is never, ever, left empty, exposed, unguarded, or vulnerable. Having an OBE does not expose you in any way, shape, or form, to any kind of interference you would not otherwise be vulnerable to during your normal waking and sleeping states. Astral noises and Other Things That Go Bump in the Plight Astral noises may be heard during the exit, with scary voices and things going bump in the night, like chains dragging, sinister giggling and muttering, evil laughter, and nasty growling and snarling. These intimidating sounds are a type of audio illusion; they have no substance and are therefore no threat. They are a big distraction, though, and must be totally ignored before and during the exit. Astral noises are quite common during the exit, but always cease the moment the exit is complete. It is much more common for new projectors to hear astral noises and voices than for more seasoned projectors. I rarely hear them these days, but used to hear them regularly during my early years of conscious projection, about every fifth projection. Strange noises are often heard as a prelude to OBE, usually right on the verge of the exit, conscious or spontaneous, just as the projection reflex is about to kick in and buzz the projector out of body. Be ready to deal with these when they happen. This may appear to contradict what I said earlier, but I have found astral noises so prevalent that their likelihood does not seem to be affected by suggestion. A great many people who have approached me with astral noise problems had never previously heard about astral noises. They did not expect them, but they happened anyway. I have already mentioned some of the scarier types of astral noises, but think they deserve more thorough mention. The types of noises vary enormously. They can be very loud and incredibly real. You may hear bells ringing, sirens wailing, heavy chains dragging and rattling across corrugated iron sheeting, the sounds of someone smashing their way into your house with sledge-hammer blows, the sound of many people talking noisily, racing engine noises, chain saws, knocking and banging on your bedroom door, even the sounds of children playing and laughing or crying or pleading for help. You may hear your name being called loudly and clearly, sometimes by a voice you know well. This voice will usually report some kind of an emergency in your house, or simply demand you get up as there is something important you need to attend to right there and then. They are so real you may decide (if not prepared) to abort your projection and find out just what the heck is going on in your house. \"What timing\", you'll think, \"just when I am right on the verge of my very first OBE\". These noises will usually appear to be from fairly close by, often from just outside your window or bedroom door, or even from inside your room. You may think your locality has gone completely nuts and decided to do some late-night road repairs just outside your door, withjackhammers and chain saws going full bore; they can be that loud and that real. I have been tricked out of the conscious exit many, many times, especially during my first few years of conscious-exit projection."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"155 Astral Voices A loud and aggressive astral voice may order you (often by name) to stop what you are doing and return to your body immediately, or face a terrible doom. The dialogue and timing of this voice(s) will vary greatly from experience to experience, but the main thrust will always be the same: to intimidate you into aborting your projection. You may also hear a voice talking to another voice about you, loudly discussing and criticizing you for your stupidity for trying to leave the body, intimating strongly that this is a very dangerous thing to do, or that this is a very dangerous time for it. \"Look at him! Doesn't he know anything? What the hell is he up to now? Look at what he's doing... oh no ... how stupid can he be!\" Et cetera. This onslaught of negative input causes projectors to begin seriously doubting themselves. They begin to worry that they might indeed be doing something foolish or dangerous. But these distracting and intimidating voices never harm projectors and should be totally ignored. Once the exit has been made, these voices will stop immediately and no cause for them will ever be found. Two Possible Causes for Astral Noises I believe there are two possible causes for astral noises: Accidental: It is possible that natural sounds and voices are picked up by the heightened senses of the projecting double, as it tunes into parts of the local real-time or astral environment during the prelude to the exit. The random nature of these noises suggests they may only be heard when there is activity in the local real-time or astral area to cause them. The state of your energy body, specifically your active configuration of primary centers at the time of projection, may also play a part. It is possible that some projectors sporadically develop a type of clairaudience, the ability to hear into the real-time zone and astral dimension and to hear spirit voices and sounds, as well as the voices of other projectors. Where simple astral noises and voices are heard, and the projector is neither directly nor indirectly referred to, this is the most likely scenario. Deliberate: Another possibility is that some astral noises are deliberately produced and telepathically aimed at projectors by low-order astral wildlife. These noises appear to be a very cleverly designed audio illusion, a sneaky distraction designed to worry or trick a projector into aborting an imminent exit. This trickery and deceit is well in theme with the whole apparent purpose of elemental and dweller-type manifestations. If this is indeed the real source of astral noises, then they are simply an audio scare alternative to the more visual dweller- type manifestations. Where the projector is addressed or called by name, or indirectly referred to in any other way, this is the most likely scenario. Dealing with Astral Noises Any and all astral noises must be totally ignored during the exit stage of an OBE. These harmless sound effects will distract and disrupt your balance and keep you from projecting if you pay any attention to them. This is especially so when it comes to being pestered or called by someone inside your own house. No matter what you hear and no matter what is said, totally ignore it! The chances of any real emergency happening right at that particular moment, when you are on the threshold of an OBE exit, is remote in the extreme. Think about it. If there were a real emergency, someone in your house would surely enter your room and wake you up. They would physically shake you awake if you were really and truly urgently needed. On top of this, if someone were actually banging on your door, the real noise from this would instantly shock you out of the trance state. Friends and family members also will not usually just stand on the other side of a closed door, pounding and shouting through it, especially late at night or in the early hours of the morning. If you continue with your projection, you can go and check to see if there is a real emergency in your house, as your projected double. If anything is really happening and you are truly needed, you can then simply return to your body, reenter it, and deal with the situation moments later. I have projected countless times while ignoring astral noises and voices. Everything is always dead quiet when I finally get out of my body. There is never anything there waiting for me that could have caused all the earlier noise and kafuffle. This shows that astral noises and voices are not directly related to the more visual elemental and dweller-type scare manifestations. Just because you hear astral noises and voices, it does not mean any kind of visual scare manifestation will follow this if you continue with the exit. I have been caught out by astral noises many times over the years. It is absolutely infuriating! I've learned to ignore most astral noises when they happen, but they still catch me out occasionally; they can be that convincing. Clutching Hands and Other Annoyances Before or during the exit, you may feel cold and clammy hands grabbing and clutching at your body. You may even see fleeting images of monstrous faces leering and snarling at you. You may hear these shadowy beings apparently scuttling about the room. These hands never hurt projectors; they can only scare them. They are a type of sensory illusion and should be ignored. No cause for them will ever be apparent once the exit is completed. Before or during the exit, you may feel, see, or hear an annoyance; a small animal, often a dog or a cat, may jump onto your bed and start washing your face, or start scratching and snarling, or annoying and distracting you in some other way. A variation is a friend or relative coming into the room, or trying to get into the room. This person promptly begins distracting or annoying you in some way: demanding you get up immediately or entering the room and touching or even tickling you. This is an illusion, and should be ignored, as hard as this might be at the time. OBE Hitchhikers A rare type of OBE problem that affects approximately one in two hundred projectors at some time in their life — a real- time or low-astral problem — is an OBE hitchhiker, which can happen to seasoned projectors as well as novices. After the exit, you become aware that some being is holding on to you from behind. You often see a pair of arms encircling and holding on to"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"156 you. This being may be silent or may speak and make threats or threatening sounds. It will often answer if spoken to. You may feel you are being carried around by it, or you may feel you are carrying it yourself. If it answers at all, this being will usually give short, cryptic, negative, or nonsense replies, which may or may not contain threats. It may even state it is there to help you in some way-do not believe this. You will usually be able to turn around and see your hitchhiker. You will often see a rough-looking male face with glaring eyes. When looked at, it may abuse you loudly or scare you in some other way. Alternatively, it may do and say nothing at all. It may even appear to be asleep or unconscious when looked at. In case you are concerned about missing a chance of beneficial spirit contact: a simple way to test a spirit (to tell a good spirit from a bad spirit) is to politely but firmly ask it to leave and return another time when called on. A good spirit will understand and leave immediately, and will return another time when called on. A bad spirit will either point-blank refuse or will make up some excuse, e.g., that they know what's best for you. The consensus among projectors is that these hitchhikers are attracted to fear. They are most likely to appear at times when projectors become fearful or anxious during an OBE. In some cases, you have only to think of the hitchhiker briefly and it will appear. The wisest preventative measure is to control fear and not think about the hitchhiker in any way, not even for a moment. Drive all thoughts of it out of mind and focus on the OBE at all times. Providing you are courageous enough, a good way of dealing with this situation is to bravely confront or attack it. Do not listen to it no matter what it says. Demand it leave immediately and threaten dire consequences if it does not obey. If this does not work, create a baseball bat or other weapon of choice and use it to beat the manifestation until it leaves. The created weapon should be held firmly in mind so it does not melt away while being used. This procedure should be repeated during any future OBEs if it reappears. Chapter 35, \"Astral Self-Defense\", provides details on the creation and use of astral weaponry. If the above does not work, or if you are too timid for a confrontation, or if the manifestation repeats, denying its existence will sometimes work, although this generally takes longer. Totally ignore it and deny its existence. Actively disbelieve in it and unmake it with creative ability. Imagine and see its arms fading away and feel the rest of it fading out of existence behind you. An alternative is to make it burst into flames with creative ability and try to burn it away. Shape-shifting can also be used and the shape of the projector changed to unhorse or better deal with the manifestation. Small is usually more effective than big here, but both should be tried. If you can hold the shape of a bee or wasp, you will often lose the hitchhiker in the process. The use of any level of creative ability is often enough to drive off a hitchhiker, as this seems to intimidate astral wildlife. Passing slowly through walls and other solid objects can also help. Look at this as scraping off the hitchhiker onto the wall as it is penetrated. Another idea is to project into the nearest church or house of worship. As this type of manifestation is a real- time or low-astral problem, projecting directly into higher levels of the astral planes will lose the hitchhiker in the dimensional shift. If all these methods fail, I advise that you seek out the services of a good practicing shaman (see bibliography). I have referred projectors with this type of problem to shamans many times, and the results have always been positive. Overcoming Fear Fear is a natural defense mechanism. True bravery is the ability to control fear while continuing to function in a reasonably normal fashion. Bravery is not the ability to feel no fear at all. One of the greatest causes of out-of-body fear is the tendency most projectors have to project late at night before sleeping. An OBE can definitely be a bit on the creepy side during the dead of night. But some people find themselves surrounded during an OBE with at least enough light to see by, even on the darkest of nights. This light, generally localized to the projector's immediate area, is called astral light, and is generated by the projector's subconscious mind. It can usually be brightened simply by willing it to brighten. The out-of-body environment is sensitive to the mind of a projector. Feel the light brightening and will it to happen. Look for this brightening and expect the area around you to brighten. See the shadows fading and everything becoming clearer and more distinct. The area around you will soon become much brighter; this brightness will follow you wherever you go. Expect it to follow you and it will. Everything will then be much less gloomy and intimidating. The simplest and most effective way to reduce fear is to project during daylight hours. Instead of taking an afternoon power nap, you could have an afternoon OBE. You'll get the same amount of rest, but will have a great deal more fun. There is nothing at all creepy about projecting in daylight, and there is a great deal more to do and see during daylight hours. If you do not have the opportunity to project in daylight hours, I suggest an immediate shift into the astral planes shortly after the exit. The astral planes are very interesting places to be and are generally well lit. There is nothing at all creepy about the astral planes; often you will find yourself in full sunlight once you arrive there. Some type or level of fear usually will continue to plague new projectors until their self-control is better suited to OBE. In time, repeated exposure to the out-of-body environment removes its unknown qualities, causing fear levels to drop significantly. Out-of-body endurance and functionality will also steadily improve as personal experience is gained. This gives projectors progressively more and more freedom. There is nothing wrong with having some fear when you project. Fear is healthy and forces you to be cautious. A little fear and caution will keep you alive and kicking much longer than foolhardy bravery will. As long as you can control your fear and don't let it consume you, it will serve you well. I still feel a little trepidation and anxiety whenever I leave my body. I never really know what I'll find each time I go out. I will probably always feel this healthy respect, even though I have projected countless times and can control myself extremely well. I know what to do and what to expect, but when it comes right down to it there is always a little anxiety at the back of my mind. This is especially so with an exit in the dead of night, when the real- time world is always a little on the creepy side. Control yourself and be as brave as you can and just do your level best, no matter how scared you really feel inside. No one can do any better than that, my friends."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"157 Religion and OBE Many people worry that they are violating some religious law if they project out of their bodies. They worry there might be a line of text in the Bible or some other holy book that forbids it, and that they might thus be doing something detrimental to their soul. As far as I am aware, there are no direct warnings given in the Bible or any other holy book, anywhere, which clearly prohibit or warn against projection. I do not intend to get into a religious debate over this. I am sure that many good people in the world would delight in correcting me on this matter, and cite biblical text that could be construed into meaning projection and OBE are bad things. But religious opinion against OBE comes not from personal experience and an investigation of the evidence, but from what I believe to be unrelated textual interpretations. This type of argument is therefore best considered as being uninformed conjecture. Everyone in the world projects in some way or other whenever they sleep. There are no exceptions to this rule. This includes all the people who decry the practice of projection on religious grounds. The vast majority of people simply do not remember it, or as sleep projectors have nothing to really remember apart from an occasional dream. There is nothing occult or mysterious about OBE. It is a completely natural function. And, as everyone does this unconsciously anyway, what logical reasoning could there possibly be showing this perfectly natural activity should not also be done consciously? I sincerely apologize if I have upset anyone here. No offense is intended. I believe our Creator designed and made us exactly as we are, with a bioenergetic body that naturally generates the energies required to project during sleep. We are all inherently capable, with a little practice, of deliberately stimulating the generation of these same energies. And, we can also learn how to simulate the natural sleep state by entering the trance state (body asleep + mind awake) so we can leave our bodies consciously. If we were not all meant to have the ability to function out of body, then why were we all born with the innate ability to do just that? Did God make a mistake when God gave us, one and all, our bioenergetic and pure-energetic aspects, along with our inherent projection capabilities? I do not happen to think so. I believe God is perfect, as are all God's creations, and that God is incapable of error."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"158 35. Astral Self-Defense Whether or not you believe in astral wildlife or nonphysical entities will depend on your beliefs and personal experience. Many people claim that these things, if they even exist, are probably just harmless thought forms. They claim this even though they have no real experience in these matters, and have never had to deal with this kind of situation firsthand. Intellectual belief becomes a bit of a moot point if you have to deal with this kind of thing in person. Regardless of belief and of whether or not anything threatening or potentially dangerous is ever seen (and usually nothing ever will), it is psychologically comforting and fortifying for projectors to have some idea how to protect themselves if they should ever need to do so. I don't like to dwell on negative possibilities, but here are several methods of self-defense during an OBE. The projected double — especially the real-time double — is an extremely powerful being when compared to nonphysical entities. It has a strong and renewable energy source ; the physical/etheric body, constantly supplying its energy requirements. It also has the ability to change its size and appearance, and has innate creative ability with which to forge tools, armor, and weapons. All jokes aside, an aware projected real-time double does not have to put up with the unkind ministrations of others. It is capable of protecting its integrity in any situation, up to and including extreme energetic confrontation. The personal freedom and integrity of any projected double, if even slightly aware of its true potential, is not only a God- given natural right, it is enforceable. You only have to be a little bit brave and do what you are naturally capable of and most astral wildlife will beat a hasty retreat. Those that do not run immediately will find themselves outmatched by the constantly renewable energetic potential and versatile creative ability of the projected double. Astral Matter The question of whether or not astral matter exists is moot when operating in the out-of-body environment. Astral matter is the ether, the underlying substance of which all subtle dimensions are composed, including the real-time zone. This is extremely sensitive to consciousness, and reacts to thought energy in the same way as physical matter reacts to force. Astral matter can be molded by thought into any shape or form imaginable. Thought creations can be so perfect as to be indistinguishable from reality. One way to describe the nature of astral matter, especially when dealing with thought-form creations, is to draw a comparison between astral matter and unexposed photographic film. When unexposed film is exposed to light energy, focused by the lens of a camera, an image is burned onto the film when the photosensitive chemicals coating the film react to light energies. The quality of the camera's lens and the quality of the film and paper it's printed on, plus the skill of the operator, determine the quality of the resulting image. When astral matter is exposed to thought energies, focused by the lens of the mind, an image begins to form, caused by the reaction of sensitive astral matter to focused creative thought energies. The thought form's complexity, strength, and durability depend largely on the strength and duration of the creative thought generating it. The strength and skill of the creative mind determines the quality and durability of the resulting creation. Created Thought Forms The ability of the projected double to deliberately create thought-form objects is fairly well known. Maintaining the existence of a thought-form creation for any length of time, however, depends largely on the creative strength, skill, and experience of the projector, and by the nature of the dimensional level in which they are operating. In the real-time zone, for example, it is more difficult to deliberately create lasting thought forms, as this is a much less fluid environment than is the astral dimension proper. Objects can be deliberately created, but this takes a lot more time and effort than it does in the astral planes. Real-time creations tend to fade away fairly quickly, when compared with the more durable creations possible in the astral planes. A created thought form can be absolutely anything: a person, an animal, an object, or even a complex scenario or panoramic view. Many magical, pagan, and shamanistic practitioners spend a great deal of time and effort doing just this. They create and maintain buildings, temples, workshops, tools, weapons, and even helper beings for their craft. When a new thought form is created, it will usually start to decay and melt away fairly quickly, often almost the moment its creator ceases working on it. For example, if a novice projector creates a new sword in the real-time zone, it will take shape over several seconds. As the projector focuses and constructs it with imagination, it will slowly appear. However, once the effort used to generate it ceases, the sword will begin melting away. To hold an item in shape, a projector must hold the awareness of that new item in mind at all times until it starts to set and becomes more durable. The longer this is done and the more often the same item is generated, the more durable it will become. The short-lived nature of new thought forms does not, however, stop a novice projector from creating effective weaponry. Energy bolts, for example, only need to be held in existence for a very short time to be effective. The difficulties of creating lasting thought forms in the real-time zone do not affect the subconscious mind's creative ability in the same way. It has vastly greater creative powers than the conscious mind. If the subconscious is tricked into a creative act it will usually hold its creation in shape, often for the duration of that projection. Creative power can be used with devastating effect in the out-of-body environment, to deter and even damage troublesome astral wildlife. Anything created in the out-of-body environment is relatively solid there. As it is composed of the same basic substance as the environment itself, it is thus capable of directly affecting the contents of that environment. The effectiveness of a created object also depends on how much of a projector's energy is imparted into it during its creation. Projectors must feel a part of their own substance flowing into any item they create. This strengthens it and makes it more effective and enduring. The traditional approach to astral combat weaponry is for a projector to visualize and create a sword and armor. The armor"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"159 offers protection and the sword is used as an offensive or defensive weapon. Swords, when created, must traditionally be blessed with the power of God before they are used. This increases their effectiveness dramatically; I recommend this be done before engaging in astral combat. Energy bolts can also be created and launched at offending astral wildlife. These are made to explode on contact. To use an energy bolt, construct a glowing-white ball of energy about the size of a golf ball with your imagination. You should feel some of your own energy flowing into this as you create it. This should be made to appear just in front of you and then quickly launched at the target. You should move the energy bolt with your mind as soon as it forms, feeling and seeing and imagining it as moving rapidly, expanding as it flies toward the target. This is made to explode sharply and loudly on impact by imagining and feeling it exploding as it strikes. With a little practice, an energy bolt can be made in a fraction of a second, with this process being rapidly repeated to create an energetic barrage. Energy beams and flames can also be created and made to shoot from the tip of a sword, although this takes more concentration and practice. Another way to fire energy bolts is to create a rocket launcher and use this to shoot explosive energy projectiles. Imagine and create the rocket launcher by holding its shape and image firmly in mind. Concentrate on this until it forms in your hands, feeling a part of yourself flowing into it as it forms. Alternatively, simply feel yourself as holding one without actually trying to see it. This weapon is fired with the mind, by feeling it as firing and imaging a bright projectile shooting from it and exploding on impact. You should feel a part of yourself going with each rocket fired. You always have plenty of energy to spare; it is constantly being resupplied by your physical/etheric counterpart. Any type of energy bolt will cause damage to entities, disrupting their substance and draining them of energy. The color used for projectiles can be varied and any bright color but black or gray can be used. White is the easiest and most popular color, but many people prefer to create energetic weaponry using their favorite color. As creating complex items can be difficult, I suggest new projectors focus on one simple object at a time. Creating a single weapon like a sword, or simple energy bolts by creating and using them one at a time, are probably the easiest ways to start. The distraction of creating and holding in shape multiple items may cause some items to fade, thus defeating the whole point of the exercise. If a simple sword is all a projector can manage to create, then the projector should use this on its own and not attempt creating fancy armor. Staying aware of the shape and feel of any created object will prevent it from fading, unless it has a shape and solidity of its own that does not take any effort to hold. The Creative Act To create a thought-form object, clear your mind and focus completely on what you are creating. Construct and hold the desired object with your imagination and see and feel this object as if it were already in existence. Hold its image firmly in mind at all times; fill your mind with the shape of the desired object and hold this while it forms, feeling a part of yourself flowing into it. Will the object into existence and keep focused on it until it is fully formed. In the astral dimension, a created object will spring into existence in very short order and with little conscious effort. Creation in the real-time zone, however, requires more effort and time. A created object will tend to fade into sight over several seconds, depending on the projector's effort and creative skill. If the desired item tends to melt away quickly, more effort will be required to hold it in existence, just as with shape- shifting. If a more-lasting object is planned, one that can be used during every projection, some time should be spent re- creating the same object at the start of every projection. In the beginning, keep created objects as simple as possible and use exactly the same mental recipe every time. Created objects — thought forms — slowly become more solid and take less time and effort to create every time they are remade. In time, you will find your created items waiting there for you whenever you project, or you will be able to call them into existence with a simple thought when required. They will then stay in shape, requiring little conscious effort to hold them in existence. An interesting phenomenon associated with sword, armor, and weapons creation is that fine detail and workmanship often appears on them, as do variations in size and style from what is actually imaged during the creative act. The end product may look quite different from the mental recipe it sprang from. It is fairly easy to hold the basic shape and details of a sword in mind while creating it, but delicately etched patterns, filigree, complex runes, scripting, diagrams, elaborately bejeweled handles, and sparkling energy fields are most definitely not. These additional details appear to be provided by something other than the mental recipe the creation sprang from. There are two possible reasons, I think. It is quite possible the projector's subconscious mind plays a part in this, prettying up a created sword as it forms. This seems unlikely, however, because if the subconscious mind were at work here it would most likely create the whole sword in the first place. The creation would then be much more durable and have less of a tendency to fade away. More likely, the projector creating the sword (totally unawares) actually owns the sword that appears. The projector may have a long-term association, possibly through past-life connections or long-term astral ownership, with that particular sword. This same sword is thus summoned into existence by the projector's attempt to create a sword from scratch. Astral combat experiences like these show some of the enormous potential of the projected double. It is quite capable of looking after and defending itself — if the projectors realize they are capable of doing so. As I said earlier, the projected double is a very powerful being. It does not have to meekly put up with the unkind ministrations of troublesome astral wildlife of any kind. This may be the reason why astral wildlife in general seem to actively avoid direct encounters with real-time projectors. I would hazard a guess these beings either know or can sense the energetic potential of real-time projectors and that they are naturally afraid of them. This may be why they go to such great lengths to unnerve new projectors and scare them back into their bodies, often causing them to give up OBE altogether. Every aware projector is a serious threat to them and to their way of life. Think about it: if enough aware projectors were allowed to roam around the out-of-body environment at will, the bad"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"160 guys might have to vacate the real-time zone and return to whatever dark dimensional backwater they originated from. Receiving a sword and armor when requested is the sign that a projector has long-term connections in the astral planes and higher, of which they may be totally unaware. It may also mean they have in some way passed the test and been promoted to active astral duty, so to speak. Asking for your sword should ideally be done at the very start of a real-time projection, after moving away from your physical body. You should raise your hand and ask aloud, with deep sincerity and reverence, for your sword. If you are ready for it, you will receive it. It is as simple as that. If your first request is not answered, try again the next time you are out, and keep on trying until you are ready. Shape-Shifting It is also possible to change your size, shape, and appearance in the sensitive out-of-body environment. Shape-shifting is quite possible during a real-time projection, but is of course easier to hold in the astral dimension proper. You can become whatever you think and feel you are. You can also be as big as you like by simply feeling yourself expanding and growing, until you tower over whatever it is that has had the temerity to annoy you. You can then step on it, kick it, or hit it with your oversized fist or created weapon of choice. Alternatively, you can feel yourself changing into a large predator — like a lion, wolf, elephant, eagle, even Tyrannosaurus Rex. Awareness of any new shape must be held firmly in mind and whole-body awareness at all times. It can take some effort to hold a new shape for any length of time. The secret behind successful shape-shifting is much like the secret of learning how to be a successful tree in a drama class. Learning any new shape is like learning how to play a new part in a play, and thus takes regular practice. Creative imagination and the ability to maintain a changed sense of whole-body self-awareness are the only limitations in shape-shifting. I suggest all new shape-shifting projectors choose one shape and stick with it until they learn how to use it. As with any thought-form creation, the new shape will become progressively easier to use with practice."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"161 36. A Few Last Words If the enormous implications of the mind-split and the akashic pulse are considered, some of the more elusive complexities of life and consciousness can more easily be grasped, and even understood a little. I ask you this: Which is more real, the physical body or the subtle perfection of its projected double? Each is capable of independent thought and action, with each being fully capable of standing alone and stating, \"I think... therefore I am!\" So which is the more real? If the multidimensional nature of human consciousness is accepted, as can be experienced firsthand through the simple duality of the mind-split at close range, a great many complex issues and questions arise. These suggest the very real possibility that multiple copies of the same mind can simultaneously exist on many dimensional levels. This opens the way to a greater underlying possibility on a higher level of consciousness: that multiple incarnations of a single spirit may occur at the same time, living through many different physical bodies simultaneously. If considered, this points to an even greater possibility: that of there being an underlying spiritual kinship between every living being on this planet. In the truest sense of The Word, I believe we are all brothers and sisters beneath our fleshy exteriors. We are all intimately connected and related, all one in the light of the Great White Spirit shining from the heart of our multidimensional universe. If you ponder a while on the workings of the akashic pulse, it is reasonable to suggest that ultimately we all share a common source and destination, regardless of race, religion, or gender ; even of species for that matter. Each of us is an integral part of The One, with all of us sharing the same spiritual roots. We also share an incredibly complex interconnected relationship through the delicate balancing ministrations of karma, as energetically applied through living universal law when astral winds through akasha blow, profoundly affecting all our lives. And what of death, I ask you? What of that last great journey into the unknown that each one of us shall assuredly undertake one day? What of death? Death is the final projection out of the physical body, that last outward-bound journey at life's end. The only difference between any living projection and the final one is the lack of having a physical body to return to at the end of it; because there will be no end to it. We will then stand free and unfettered by limitations of fleshly ignorance , all boundaries lost, with more freedom and ability than we ever imagined during any living projection; truly a projection unlimited. And, if you have had some experience with conscious-exit projection already, you will not be doing anything you have not done before. The fear and sting of death can thus be greatly eased, with the possibility of life continuing after death transcending mere possibility, growing into a very real probability. The realization of life after death is much easier to accept through personal experience, through the living experience gained through OBE. We can then go gently — nay, stride boldly — into that dark night! I believe untold potential lies dormant within the human race, individually and collectively. I have enormous hopes and see a bright future for our race. I believe that somewhere in our growing understanding of the profound energetic unity of our collective human spirit, and of its profoundly enmeshed interdimensional nature, we will find greater meaning to life itself. I dream that one day we shall find the key to unlock this greater potential, thus freeing ourselves from the slavery of flesh and beginning to understand the true nature of this reality we all share. This can lead us to a profound understanding of ourselves and of each other and of all other life forms in the universe. More importantly, this may lead us a little closer to the greatest understanding of all — The Meaning of Life. Before closing, I would like to thank you for reading my book and to leave you with one last thought-provoking morsel: If you begin to understand your creative potential as it is liberated during an OBE, where you become a true creator in your own right, could you begin to accept your own personal relationship with an infinitely more creative mind?

Also see: Akasha, Akashic Pulse Episode, Akashic Records, Astral Wind, Consciousness Seeds, The Source. Akashic Pulse Episode: A regular cosmic interdimensional event, the frequency of which is unknown at this time. It begins with the Astral Wind collecting the projected doubles of all conscious beings in the universe, including those of sleepers, and transporting them to the highest dimensional level for adjustment by the Source, according to Karmic law. This event ends when the Akashic Pulse returns everyone back to their physical bodies, all then containing new or updated consciousness seeds.

Akashic Records: An infinite, never-ending, interdimensional, energetic echo field, containing perpetual echo's generated by each and every act of consciousness, in energetic form. Levels of The Akashic Records can be accessed and perceived (viewed) in various ways during an OBE, with the most common being the traditional \"library\" scenario. While The Akashic Records are generally considered to be a structured esoteric repository of all knowledge, they are (according to the author) a natural, life-related, interdimensional phenomenon, an energetic medium that can be \"accessed\" and \"perceived\" in an \"apparently\" structured way. i.e., as containing detailed records of all past events; plus future probabilities generated by these, that can be perceived as \"viewable\" events. Past and future events can even be experienced \"first-hand\" during an OBE, with the projector entering a record/vision and becoming an invisible spectator. Also see: Akasha, Akashic Pulse Episode, Akashic Records, Astral Wind, Consciousness Seeds, Karma, Karmic Law, The Source, Universal Law.

Astral Noise: A harmless but often disturbing phenomenon. This is best described as being an auditory hallucination, where a projector hears loud noises and even voices around them, during the prelude to an OBE exit. Also see: Astral Sight, Astral Wildlife, Dweller On The Threshold, Elementals. Astral-Plane Entrance Structure: A perception-based entrance structure, through which the internal parts of an astral plane can be entered. There are three main types: tube-type, plane-type and the tunnel of light. Which type is perceived by a projector during an OBE, is greatly affected by their energetic makeup at the time of their projection. Also see: Angle Of Perception, Astral-Plane Surface Skin, Energetic Makeup. Astral Planes: The structured part of the astral dimension, which is reputedly divided into seven distinct levels (commonly called astral planes) with each of these containing many sub-levels and parts. Also see: Astral-Plane Entrance Structure, Astral Realms and Kingdoms, Astral Sub-Planes. Astral-Plane Surface Skin: The surface skin of an astral plane. This is an infinite, two dimensional, grid-lined structure. Its surface is divided into neat squares, with each square having a base color and an elaborate centerpiece pattern, repeated endlessly in every other square. Also see: Angle Of Perception, Astral Plane Entrance Structure, Astral Planes, Energetic Makeup. Astral Projection: An OBE, where the projector enters and operates within the astral dimension, or astral planes. Also see: Astral Planes, OBE, Real-Time Projection. Astral Realms and Kingdoms: Distinct internal parts of the astral planes, with each having a set environment and theme. Varying greatly in size, from that of a small country village to an entire world or larger, these are sometimes inhabited by astral beings of varying intelligence. Astral Sight: The visual sensory ability of the projected double during an OBE. Also used to describe an ability of the physical body to see into the astral dimension ; which is a type of clairvoyance. This ability is often experienced by projectors during the prelude to an OBE, or during projection attempts where no actual exit is achieved. Also see: Astral Noise. Astral Sub-Planes: Internal levels and parts contained within a single astral plane. Astral Wildlife: Any energetic being or inhabitant of the lower astral planes, having a low order of intelligence. These beings are harmless to projectors, although many types have a mischievous, animalistic or negative disposition. Their power is limited to inducing fear in projectors, through various types of illusion, trickery and deception. Although best thought of as a rarity, these beings are occasionally found in the real time zone — mainly during the night, as they seem to avoid daylight.

Body Awareness: The sense of physical body awareness, the tactile sense of touch and feel, and the awareness of space occupied by the physical body. Also see: Awareness Hands, Mobile Body Awareness, Tactile Imaging. Bounce Action: Where a point of body awareness is moved rapidly through the physical/etheric body to cause widespread stimulation in the etheric body. Also see: Awareness Resistance Factor. Breath Awareness: Similar to an old Zen technique, where the breathing action is focused upon. Breath Awareness is used to empty the mind and hold it clear for extended periods of time, for meditation, trance work and astral projection. Brow Center: A primary energy center (or major Chakra) situated in the brow, between the eyes. Also called The Third Eye. Also see: Chakras, Primary Energy Centers. Buffer Zone: An in-between area, or zone, dividing two distinct dimensional levels. Chakras: Eastern term, also called Psychic Center, Energy Center, or Primary Energy Center. Cobwebs: An irritating, tickling, sometimes slightly-stinging, energy-movement sensation, that feels like cobwebs or tiny insects are touching the surface of the skin. Often felt during the trance state, this is most commonly felt in the facial area, although it can occur anywhere on the physical body. This is caused by energy movement through and over the skin of the physical body, which can over-stimulate nerves in the skin, causing mild irritation. Also see: Energy-Movement Sensations, Vibrations. Complications Of Consciousness: Complications and conflicts caused by a nonphysical spirit incarnating in a biological being. Also see: Astral Feedback, Energetic Conflicts, Mind-Split, Mind-Split Effects. Consciousness Seeds: Influential droplets of energy, or seeds, deposited into the physical/etheric body after an Akashic Pulse Episode.

Also see: Akashic Pulse, Akashic Pulse Episode, Akashic Records, Astral Wind. Déjà-Vu: A type of precognitive experience, a feeling of inner knowing, of having seen, done or experienced something before an actual event. This phenomenon is (according to the author) a common side-effect of Akashic Pulse Episodes. Also see: Akashic Pulse Episode. Dream: Dreaming is an internal mental process of the physical body, that normally occurs after it has fallen asleep. While the author classifies dreaming as an internal mental process, dreams take place in another set of dimensions, dream dimensions, which are no less real than any other dimension, i.e., The Astral Dimension. Lucid Dreams also take place in dream dimensions. Duality: The sensation of realizing you are existing in two separate bodies, the physical body and its projected double, during an OBE. Duality is caused by the mind-split effect, and is usually only realized when perceptions are received from both bodies simultaneously. For example, you project and begin operating at a remote location from your physical body, but you are still aware of some sensory input, usually sounds and tactile senses, coming from your physical body. The center of consciousness will also often flicker back and forth, between the physical and its projected double during an OBE. Also see: Mind-Split, Mind-Split Effects, Remote Eye. Dweller On The Threshold: A harmless but disturbing (often frightening) manifestation, where a projector is confronted by a dark, threatening being, immediately after they exit their physical body during an OBE. Also see: Astral Noise, Astral Wildlife, Elementals . Elementals: Harmless beings with little power and very low intelligence. Often having a monkey-like appearance and mischievous nature, these beings seem to delight in frightening and tormenting novice projectors, through trickery and illusion, especially during their first few conscious exit projections. Also see: Astral Noise, Astral Wildlife, Dweller On The Threshold. Energetic: Extensively used throughout this book. With no viable option the dictionary meaning of this word is \"bent\" to cover energy (Energetic) manifestation of the human energy body, and of its various subtle bodies, including its projected double: i.e., Energetic value, Energetic activity, Energetic aspect, Energetic function, et cetera.

Also see: Energetic, Bioenergetic, Pure-Energetic. Energetic Angle of Perception: See: Angle of perception. Energetic Conflicts: In the context of this book, meaning any energetic, empathic or telepathic conflicts between the physical/etheric body, and its projected double. Also meaning the energetic conflicts caused by the presence of awake consciousness, during a fully conscious OBE exit. Energetic conflicts are responsible for heavy exit sensations, e.g., rapid heartbeat, heavy vibrations, throbbing, pressure and adrenalin-like body rushes, often experienced by novice projectors during early OBEs. Also see: Astral Feedback, Complications Of Consciousness, Exit Sensations. Energetic Makeup: The energetic quality, value and relative strength of a projected double. This is strongly affected by the active configuration of the primary energy centers (or major chakras) during an OBE. This sets the capabilities of a projected double. It also limits its level of operations to dimensional levels in tune with its energetic value at that time. Also see: Angle Of Perception. Energy Body: See Etheric body. Energy-Movement Sensations: As energy is generated, transformed, accumulated, and moved about the physical/etheric body, nerves within the physical body often become over-stimulated. This causes a variety of tingling, buzzing, throbbing, pulsing and fluttering sensations, often felt as sweeping through the physical body in waves, or as whole body adrenalin-like rushes. Also see: Bioenergetic, Cobwebs, Vibrations. Etheric Body: The subtle body most closely associated with and enmeshed within the physical body. Also often called the energy body, etheric sheath, vitality sheath, vitality body, or perispirit. The etheric body can also be said to be the essential glue-like substance, that binds an incarnating spirit to the flesh of their physical body. Parts of the etheric body can be seen with clairvoyance (or auric sight) as extending an inch or so out from the physical body, as a band of pale-blue or off-white mist. Also see: Energetic, Etheric Matter. Etheric Matter: The nonphysical energetic substance of the energy body (or etheric body). This can be caused to exist in a variety of different forms, and is best thought of as being something similar to ectoplasm, but is generally invisible to the naked eye. This can be seen with clairvoyance or auric sight, and will also often inexplicably appear on photographs, as pale, indistinct, cloudlike shapes and figures. Also see: Etheric Body, Thought Forms. Etheric/Real-Time Double: The base-level energetic vehicle (or subtle body) generated during a Near Death Experience (NDE), after the physical body has become temporarily deceased. Also the state of existence experienced immediately after physical body death ; which is usually within the real time zone. Also see: Etheric Body, NDE, Real-Time Body, Real -Time Zone. Exit: In the context of this book, often meaning \"The Exit\" of the projectable double, as it leaves the confines of its physical body during an OBE or astral projection. Exit Sensations: The often heavy energy-movement sensations, experienced during the exit phase of an OBE, e.g., rapid heartbeat, vibrations and pressure. Heavy exit sensations are often experienced by novice projectors during early projections. These always gradually ease, as experience and development are gained by a projector. Also see: Cobwebs, Energetic Conflicts, Energy-Movement Sensations, Vibrations. Flicker Technique: A technique designed by the author, to help overcome OBE memory-loss problems. An OBE reentry technique, where consciousness is allowed to flicker between the sleep/awake state at a predetermined time. A brief window is thereby artificially created, by the flickering state, through which OBE memories can be downloaded into accessible levels of memory. Also See: Memory Download, Shadow Memory. The Great Center: Top level of dimensional spectrum. Also see: The Source. Inner-Body Projection: The internal transfer of waking consciousness into the Etheric Body, as the trance state is entered. This also occurs while falling asleep. Also see: Trance State. Internal Dialogue: Surface mind chatter caused by random thoughts, also called monkey mind. Also See: Surface Mind. Karma: In the author's opinion, Karma is what is referred to as Sin in the Holy Bible. Karma is the accumulated influential force generated by all past acts of consciousness, positive and negative, of good and bad deeds. Through Karma, a spirit is enabled to obtain the real life experiences it requires to progress spiritually (through living experience), via multiple incarnations into the physical dimension. Karma allows a spirit to maintain a healthy spiritual balance, life after life, and helps avoid the possibility of soul corruption. Karma is not a process of reward and punishment. Karma provides spiritual harmony through a process of enforced spiritual balance. Also see: Karmic Law, Universal Law. Karmic Law: For every act of consciousness performed by an individual, an equal and opposite reaction is generated, which is eventually inflicted upon them in turn by Karmic Law. This is aptly expressed by the popular sayings: \"What goes around comes around\" or \"as you sow so shall ye reap\". Also see: Karma, Universal Law. Koala: A Koala is a small, herbivorous, tree dwelling, bear-like, pouched mammal, found on the island continent of sunny Australia; commonly called a Koala Bear. Kundalini: Kundalini is the traditional Eastern name for what is called: \"the master circuit\" within this book. Kundalini is the strongest of all human bioenergetic circuits — the ultimate bioenergetic expression of being. When this is fully activated (when Kundalini rises), a powerful, internal, snakelike energy movement is felt, often accompanied by a painful burning sensation. This \"snakelike\" force is felt as uncoiling three-and-a-half turns inside the physical body, in an upward and"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"165 clockwise direction: hence the Eastern term often used to describe this profound energetic phenomenon: \"The Serpent of Fire\". Lucid Dream: When a dreamer becomes aware, or wakes up inside a dream, they are said to be \"lucid dreaming\". Lucid Dream Projection: A technique whereby a W.I.L.D. or Wake-Induced Lucid Dream, can be achieved as an alternative to a full OBE exit. Memory Download: In the context of this book, meaning the downloading of OBE memories into conscious and recallable memory storage levels, of the physical/etheric body/mind. Failed memory downloading occurs when OBE memories are downloaded into subconscious and unconscious levels of memory. This is the primary cause of the vast majority of failed OBEs. Without the memory of it, an OBE did not take place ; not according to the conscious mind and its recallable memories, after a failed memory download, or failed OBE. Also see: Shadow Memory. Metaphorical Imagery: Within the context of this book, this term particularly applies to live action visions and OBE vision experiences, viewed or experienced first-hand during an OBE. These contain layered metaphorical symbols and symbolic actions, full of hidden meaning, often disguised as apparently real life scenes, during visions and out-of-body vision experiences. Mind-Split: The splitting of consciousness into two identical parts, that occurs during any type of OBE. The mind-split occurs at the beginning of any OBE, prior to the exit of the projected double out of its physical counterpart. There are two bodies during an OBE (one physical and one subtle or energetic — the projected double). Two minds (one physical and one energetic) therefore exist. Each of these function independently for the duration of an OBE, until reentry occurs where they reintegrate, becoming one mind again. Also see: Mind-Split Effects. Mind-Split Effects: In particular, the effects the mind-split has upon OBE memory recall. The commonly felt sensations of dual existence, that of existing in more than one place at the same time, during an OBE. Also meaning the telepathic, energetic and empathic interactions and conflicts, that occur between the physical body/mind and its projected body/mind. Also see: Astral Feedback, Complications Of Consciousness, Energetic Conflicts, Memory Download, Mind-Split. Mobile Body Awareness (MBA): The ability to move and focus body awareness at different locations, on or within the physical body. Also see: Awareness Hands, Body Awareness, Tactile Imaging. Near-Death Experience (NDE): Where a person temporarily dies and experiences a powerful OBE, until they are resuscitated. Also see: Etheric/Real-Time Double. Out-of-Body Experience (OBE): Where consciousness is perceived as existing and operating outside of its physical body. Also called OOBE, projection, or astral projection. Physical/Etheric body: Combined physical and etheric bodies. In particular, where these are experiencing the trance state, where the etheric body has become active and expanded slightly. Also applies to the physical/etheric body during an OBE, after the projected double has already parted. See also: Etheric Body, Inner-Body projection, Mind-Split, Trance State. Primary Energy Centers: The major bioenergetic organs, or energetic transformers, of the energy body. Also see: Chakras. Projectable Double: Internally generated real time double, prior to its projection out of its physical/etheric body; where it then becomes the projected double. Projected Double: The energetic vehicle (or subtle body) housing a functioning, energetic copy of a projector's mind and memories, outside of their physical body during any type of OBE. Projection Mechanism: The energetic mechanism that generates and then ejects the projectable double, outside the bounds of its physical body, during the OBE or projection exit. Also see: Exit, Projection Reflex. Projection Reflex: When the projection mechanism gets to a certain stage, the energetic point of no return is reached. The ejection of the projectable double outside the bounds of its physical body, then becomes a reflex action. An OBE cannot be aborted once the projection reflex has been triggered. Also see: Projected Double, Projection Mechanism. Pure-Energetic: A construction based on \"Energetic\" relating in particular to high-level energetic (energy) functions and manifestations, of the human energy body, that do not specifically apply to its physical body. For example, the higher energetic (energy) functions of the energy body and its primary energy centers (major chakras) cause psychic abilities. A psychic ability is thus a Pure-Energetic function, or Pure Energy manifestation, of the human energy body. However, Pure-Energetic manifestations will often cause Bioenergetic sensations, felt as physical sensations, i.e., the typical throbbing and buzzing emanating from active primary energy centers (major chakras). Pure-Energetic can also refer to energetic functions and manifestations of subtle bodies above the human energy body, i.e., the astral body. Also see: Bioenergetic, Energetic, Energetically, Etheric Body, Primary Energy Centers. Real-Time Body: The subtle body (or energetic vehicle) that houses a projector's reflection of consciousness, mind and memory during an OBE, and holds it close to the physical dimension in the Real-Time Zone. Also see: Real-Time Projection, Real-Time Zone. Real-Time Projection: An OBE, where a projector exists in a direct reflection of reality, where they have the perception of being an invisible person in the real world, observing real life events as they happen. Also see: Real-Time Body, Real-Time Zone. Real-Time Sight: Similar to Astral Sight, but where the projector sees into the real time zone around them. Also related to clairvoyance, this ability is often experienced during the prelude to an OBE, or during a projection attempt where no exit is"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"166 achieved. This is often mistaken for normal optical sight, but where the projector is seeing through their closed eyelids and bed covers. Also see: Astral Sight. Real-Time Zone: The closest nonphysical dimensional area to the physical universe. A buffer zone separating the physical universe from the astral dimension proper. The real time zone is neither in the astral dimension, nor in the physical dimension. It is a nonphysical dimensional environment that contains a direct reflection of reality, as reality happens, i.e., in a real time frame. Also see: Real-Time Body, Real-Time Projection. Reality Fluctuations: Fluctuations in the out-of-body environment, changing what is perceived as being real or normal at that time, into something that is known to be false or inaccurate. Reentry: When the projected double returns to and reenters its physical counterpart at the end of any type of OBE. Also see: Reintegration. Reintegration: The automatic energetic process, whereby the projected double is reintegrated with its physical/etheric body. Also see: Reentry. Remote Eye: A mind-split effect. This phenomenon is a type of OBE, but where the projector remains partially awake and ambulatory. A weak version of the mind split occurs, and type of a low-powered OBE happens. The OBE side of this type of experience is perceived by the partially awake physical body of the projector, as a vivid mind's-eye vision of an OBE in progress, from the projected double's perspective, but where no actual OBE exit has been noticed. Also see: Duality, Complications Of Consciousness, Duality, Mind-Split, Mind-Split Effects. Rope: A OBE projection exit technique, using Awareness Hands to climb an imaginary Rope. Also see: Awareness Hands, Tactile Imaging. Secondary Energy Centers: Minor energy centers (minor Chakras) that support the primary energy centers. Also see: Chakras, Primary Energy Centers. Shadow Memory: Any dream or OBE experience memory, gained by any subtle or dream or projected body while it is separated, or while it perceives itself to be separated, from its physical body. Also see: Memory Download. Silver Cord: The energetic, telepathic, empathic linkage that connects the physical body to its projected double. This is often seen as a sparkling Silver Cord, extending away from the projected double during an OBE. This is usually only seen when it is deliberately looked for. The site of attachment on the projected double varies, according to its energetic makeup at the time of projection. Also see: Energetic Makeup. Sleep Projection: Natural sleep projection occurs whenever a person sleeps. The projected double is projected outside the physical body during sleep, often floating just above it and mimicking the sleeping position of its physical body. Alternatively, a sleep projector may travel the astral planes for some time before falling asleep. Also see: Akashic Pulse Episode, Astral Wind. The Source: The Supreme Being. The central creative consciousness of the physical universe. The Source is the original spark of consciousness that creates and maintains the universe, and all that lies and lives within it. Also see: The Great Center. Storage Centers: In the context of this book, these are called the sub-navel, sub-heart and sub-brow energy storage centers. These are the major energy storage areas of the energy body, with each storing a different type of energy. Strobe Effect: When a primary energy centre accumulates a critical charge of energy, it strobes powerfully. When the brow centre (or brow chakra) strobes, it causes a brilliant flash of silver-white light to be seen in the mind's eye, and a feeling of very-light concussion to be felt, in the whole facial area. Surface Mind: The most commonly used part of the human mind, that can be said to hold the short-term working memory. Used for light thinking and internal mental speech, it spontaneously generates a constant stream of random thoughts and impressions. This part of the mind is responsible for the ceaseless internal mental dialogue found within an untrained or unfocused mind. Also see: Internal Dialogue. Tactile Imaging (T.I.): The active use of focused body awareness, to manipulate and stimulate the energy body, to raise energy into it and stimulate its energy centers. T.I. is also used for projection techniques. Also see: Awareness Hands, Mobile Body Awareness. Tertiary Energy Centers: Tiny, pore-like energy centers found all over the body, like the pores of the skin. These are heavily concentrated in several areas, e.g., palms of hands, soles of feet, mouth and genitals. These exchange energy with the environment, and energetically support the functions of the larger secondary and primary energy centers. Also see: Chakras, Primary Energy Centers, Secondary Energy Centers, Storage Centers. Third Eye: See, Brow Center. Thought Forms: Energetic objects, thought creations, created by a sustained thought or act of consciousness, and then existing for a limited time in the out-of-body environment. Thought forms are best considered as being composed of structured Etheric Matter. Thought forms can take any shape: human, animal or inanimate object. Reputedly, they can be programmed to react to stimuli, to perform independent actions, and even to take on a limited kind of pseudoconsciousness of their own. The length of time a thought form can exist, depends largely upon the strength and duration of the thought used to create and maintain it. Also see: Etheric Matter. Torso Energy Rush: The adrenalin-like energetic body rush, felt by the physical body as rushing upwards through its legs and torso, as its projected double begins to exit or reenter it. Also see: Energy-Movement Sensations, Exit, Projection"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"167 Mechanism, Projection Reflex. Trance State: The altered state of being entered when the physical body falls asleep, while the mind stays wide awake. The trance state has many levels and uses, with each level being related to a level of sleep. Altered states of consciousness are attained, by staying awake and varying the level and focus of the trance state. Also see: Inner-Body Projection. Light Trance: Similar to the Alpha trance state. Full Trance: Similar to the Theta trance state. Deep Trance: Similar to the Delta trance state. Trigger Word or Phrase: A descriptive word or short phrase used during the reentry phase of an OBE, to help strengthen OBE memory recall. Also see: Memory Download, Reentry, Reintegration, Shadow Memory. Universal Law: The incredibly complex set of attractions and repulsions and conditional influences, that emanates from every conscious being. Like may attract like and opposites may often attract, but only as set by karmic law. Also see: Akashic Pulse Episode, Consciousness Seeds, Déjà vu, Karma, Karmic Law. Vibrations: In the context of this book, meaning strong, usually whole-body, energy-movement sensation, that are felt as vibrations in the physical body. This is associated with the internal generation of the projectable double, at the start of an OBE. Also see: Energetic Conflicts, Energy-Movement Sensations, Exit, Projection Mechanism. Virtual Reality Projection (VRP): V.R.P. is a technique whereby a custom made astral realm can be created and then entered. Wake Induced Lucid Dream. (W.I.L.D.): A term coined by S. LaBerge (see bibliography). A deliberately induced lucid dream, from a deeply relaxed but awake state, where there has been no discernible break in consciousness. A W.I.L.D. dreamer enters a dreamscape directly from the full waking state. Although technically a lucid dream, this is possibly the most powerful type of OBE possible. Also see: Dream, Lucid Dream, Lucid Dream Projection. Waking Paralysis: Also called sleep paralysis. Disassociation between the physical body and its mind, often causing total physical paralysis to occur. In the author's opinion, this is a powerful mind-split effect caused by OBE. The mind literally wakes up inside its disassociated, paralyzed physical body while a powerful OBE is still in full progress.
