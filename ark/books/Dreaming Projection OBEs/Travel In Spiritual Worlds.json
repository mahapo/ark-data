Spiritual travel is a form of out-of-body experience done vol untarily to achieve a spiritual goal. In order to have an out -of-body experience, the soul or consciousness of the individual must temporarily leave the physical body. During out-of-body experience, the physical senses shut down. When this occurs, an entirely new world opens up to the individual. Spiritual travel is a special type of out-of-body experience where the individual's awareness is heightened, and he or she is able to make decisions and direct the experience. The spectrum of experience afforded by spiritual travel is very broad and can include a wide variety of psychic and spiritual states. In most cases, the spiritual traveler is able to clearly remember the experiences and learn from them. Spiritual travel is sometimes called transcendent or ecstatic experience because it deals with the \"inner\" senses rather than the physical senses. It also deals with states of being s eemingly independent of the physical world. The Purpose of Spiritual Travel The goal of spiritual travel is my stical or transcendent religious experience. The reason for an interest in spiritual travel is that it provides a unique means of approach ing these distant and extraordinary states of religious awareness. It does this by exposing the spiritual seeker to a series of lessons about the natu re of identity, and the freedom of the soul to travel in various non-phys ical environments. These lessons gradually introduce the spiritual trav eler to a variety of psychic and spiritual states containing increasi ng degrees of individual freedom, and spiritual awareness. In addition, sp iritual travel provides an inner laboratory where the seeker can ex periment with techniques and methods of moving through the more lim ited psychic states of awareness and into these distant spiritual realms. Near-Death Experience as a Limited Form of Spiritual Travel One common form of spiritual travel seen in the modern West is near-"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"death experience. The concept of ne ar-death experience was developed by Dr. Raymond Moody Jr. in his book Life After Life in 1975. In near- death experience, a person comes cl ose to death due to sickness or injury, and the person's soul tempor arily leaves the physical body. In the early stages of a near-death experi ence, the spiritual traveler usually views his or her lifeless body and the surrounding physical environment from a short distance away. This is usually followed by a shift of awareness to a non-physica l environment in the later stages of the experience where the traveler encounte rs a spiritual guide or \"being of light\". Near-death experience is a limited form of spiritual travel in three respects. First, it occurs s pontaneously as a result of a medical crisis rather than voluntarily as part of a spiritua l search. Second, t hough the individual seems to exercise some control over out-of-body movements in the physical environment, the more religi ous and other-worldly elements of the experience are usually controlled by some outside force such as a guide. This guide directs the near-d eath experience without any request or permission from the traveler w ho has little power over what occurs. Third, near-death experience while many times uplifting and life- changing is usually limited to a series of repeating states or stages, and is not as broad or wide-ranging as spiritual travel experience. Fortunately, it is not necessary for an individual to undergo a near-death experience (medical crisis) to have a spiritual trav el experience. Spiritual travel is a tool for the spiritual seeker. An individual can engage in a spiritual practice de signed to induce spiritual travel experiences . It is possible for the advanced spiritual traveler to control the contents of a spirit ual travel experience.

Phrases like \"s piritual freedom\" and \"increased"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"awareness\" sound vague and diffuse. Ho wever, I believe when one reads the many firsthand accounts of spiritual travel experience listed at this site, the meaning of these phrases becomes much more clear and concrete. I challenge the reader to read on, and learn more about one of the great mysteries of life - the phenomenon of spir itual travel. Surfing the Mantric Wave Mantras are a common method used to reach des tinations during spiritual travel. Mantras in my limited experience are a somewhat advanced fo rm of spiritual travel suited to those who are capable of traveling in a disembodied state (without bod ily sensations or body image). Practicing mantras during spiritual travel has the effect of moving the soul through different inner spaces much like a surfer rides a wave. They provide a definite sense of continuous forward movement with the mantric vibration or current acting as the basis of propulsion. The author will attempt to describe elements of travel by mantra but as with most deeper experience, the words simply fa il to convey the experience. One curious thing about travel by mantra is th at though the mantra is being silently chanted by a single voice (the practitioner's inner voice), the mantric sounds often seem \"larger\" and more all pervading than sounds a single voice could normally produce. Instead, they sound as if they are being intoned by a c horus of voices. This creates the sense that the traveler is not riding the mantric wave or current alone. The wave therefore seems more like a bus than a single passenger car with many beings ridi ng together through a common environment experiencing the same scenery. In my experience, mantric spaces usually have no horizon and as such are more like moving through an underwater environment than moving through a normal atmosphere. The spaces have different textures, densities, and em otional qualities which create varying background sensations that permeate the space. These qualiti es naturally also determ ine the sensations of those traveling through the space. The visual component may also vary but a complex visual field of changing patterns and colored lines (sometimes in 3-D) is one cl ass of imagery that is familiar to me. The author has experimented with different mant ras but the one that seem ed to work best was the one that had been practiced for many hours in normal meditation. Much positive emotional and spiritual energy had been poured into this sound duri ng meditation, and the mantra seemed to function like a batt ery storing the spiritual energy. As a charged religious symbol , it therefore had the power to move me into and through radically altered states of consciousness when other less familiar mantras had much less effect when practiced while out of the body. My intuitive sense is that those who are more familiar with disembodied states of light and energy use mantras the way we in the physical world use vehicles to take them to many destinations in the inner worlds. However, mant ras are used to traverse dimensions in the psychic and spiritual worlds ra ther than streets an d highways in the physical world. Many of these mantric roads are ancient pathways created by spiritual e xplorers eons ago. Another function of mantras somewhat unrelated to spiritual travel is that mantras can link individuals with gurus, entities, and gods. The empowered mantra given to a disciple during a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"spiritual initiation when repeated can act much like dialing the number of a being in the inner worlds. The being may not always answer but the line is there, and communication can occur over the line once the lin k is established. The question also arises as to what mantra to us e in spiritual travel. In general, the mantra or prayer chosen needs to come from the spiritu al tradition the practitioner follows. For those with a yogic orientation, using simple Sanskrit ma ntras (sometimes one syllable) is effective since they are sounds that are understood to originate in high spir itual planes, and will therefore draw the practitione r towards those points of origination. Names of deities or buddhas, or names of respected livin g or inner spiritual guides can also be used as mantras. This is especially true if the practitioners has an inner or outer relationship with one of these beings. Simple prayers such as the \"prayer of the heart\" from the Eastern Orthodox tradition, or phrases from Psalms or the Lord's Prayer can also be repeated, and they can function as mantras. Again these names or phrases will act as powerful symbols since they usually have very positive spiritual associa tions for a person practicing th e religious tradition connected with these deities, guides, or prayers. Once the person has even a little experience with riding these mantric waves, he or she is presented with a new way of being that is not easily forgotten. The me thod of using mantras to travel is an advanced form of spiritual trav el since it requires consid erable concentration. It is good to be able to experience this method of travel but the r eal challenge is to catch the wave, and then ride it long enough and with enou gh determination and skill to reach spiritual states of cosmic light and sound. This is the goal of the true spiritual traveler who by wisdom or by grace hopes to touch the infinite. Travel by mantra is perhaps the be st way to direct the soul toward specific destinations in the psychic and spiritual universes. The experience of travel by mantra also justifies using the term spiritual travel rather than more generic terms like meditation or contemplation. This is because the phrase spiritual travel is much mo re phenomenologically descriptive of the actual experience than these other two less specific terms. As with all spiritual travel practices, it is impor tant to emphasize that mantras should be used only for ethical purposes that further the prac titioner's knowledge, or for helping and healing others. Tibetan Dream Yoga The tradition of Tibetan Dream Yoga described by Evans-Wentz in Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines (London: Oxford University Press, 1935) is a good example of a practice that uses conscious visualization of sacred images or symb ols to bring about mysti cal states in dreams. Dream yoga is one of six subtypes of yoga elab orated by the Tibetan guru Marpa and passed down by his well-known disciple Milarepa. The practice has a number of steps, which permit the individual to gradually gain increasing amounts of control in the dream state."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"First, the individual must become luci d or wake up in the dream state. Second, the dreamer must overcome all fear of the contents of the dr eam so there is the realization that nothing in the dream can cause harm. For instance, the lucid dreamer should put out fire with his hands and realiz e fire cannot burn him in the dream. Next the dreamer should contemplate how all phenomena both in the dream and in waking life are similar because they change, and that lif e is illusory in both states because of this constant change. Both the objects in the dr eam and objects in the world in the Buddhist's worldview are therefore empty and have no s ubstantial nature. This is the stage of contemplating the dream as maya , and equating this sense of maya with everyday experience in the external world. ** Fourth, the dreamer should realize he has cont rol of the dream by changing big objects into small ones, heavy objects into light ones, a nd many objects into one object. He should also experiment with changing things into th eir opposites (i.e. fire into water). After gaining control over objec ts and their transformations, th e dreamer should realize that the dreamer's dream body is as insubstantial as the other objects in the dream. The dreamer should realize that he or she is not the dream body. While this realization is very difficult in normal waking existence, presumably it is quit e obtainable in the dream since the dreamer who has control over dream objects could, for instance, alter the body's shape or make the dream body disappear all together. Finally, the images of deities (Buddhas, Bodhisattvas , or Dakinis) should be visualized in the lucid dream state. These figures are fre quently seen in Tibetan religious art ( thangkas ) and used in meditation. They are said to be linked to or resonate with the clear light of the Void. They can therefore serve as symbolic doorways to this mystical state of being (the Void or clear light). The dreamer is instructed to concentrate on these symbolic images without distraction or thinking about other things so th at the revelatory side of these symbols will become manifest. We will note here that some of the early pract ices of dream yoga where the yogi tests and alters the dream reality were done spontaneously by the author before being introduced to the formal practices of dream yoga. Some exampl es of the practices done are listed on the Spiritual Navigatation page . ** Note: The notion that dreams and everyday experi ence are similar in nature is best understood by Westerners by examining the conc ept of \"idealism\". The philosophy of idealism says that all experience is deliver ed to the individual vi a the brain and nervous system, and is therefore a pr oduct of the mind. Idealism (better termed \"ideaism\") characterizes all sensation as i ndirect mental representations or \"ideas\" rather than direct experience of an external or objective world. Without the brain and nervous system, such experience would not exist. All experience, bo th ideas and sensations are therefore metal phenomena. In this way, everyday material exp erience is very much like dream experience. . "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Charged Symbols Paul Tillich, the 20th century Protesta nt theologian, defined a symbol as something that points beyond itself . Symbols are unique mental objects wh ich have no fixed referents. They can be contrasted with signs which have fixe d meanings. Symbols are described as layered, multi-valent, multi-dimensional, or multivocal (Victor Turner's term). Their personal meanings and interpretations evolve to refl ect the evolution of th e individual, and the meanings of cultural symbols that are shared evolve as the culture changes. Symbols are complex because they have different meanings that change as they are explored. The figure of Christ has meant different things to different people at different times. For instance, Christ was characterized as a warrior during the crusades going in to battle to defeat the unbelievers. In the early 20th century, he was characterized as a businessman and the perfect salesman and marketer, a union organize r and a friend of the working man during the rise of unions, and a strong athlete who coul d fast and control his desires through physical and mental discipline as preachers focused on th e masculine virtues of Christ. Jesus is both the ideal capitalist and socialist depending on differing interpretations. In the early medieval period, Christia n Neoplatonists saw Christ as the logos or \"divine mind\". Here, God the Father was infinite bei ng or awareness which supplied the light and power of creation. Jesus as logos was the set of archetypal patterns or templates that took this power and created the \"world soul\" or Anima Mundi realm where living things such as plants, animals, and humans came into being. The Holy Spirit was God's presence that infused matter and living things. These th ree abstract entities were \"per sonalized\" by later Christians, and became the basis for the three persons of the trinity. For many early Christians, Christ symbolized the divine intellect and salvation was attained through wisdom rather than faith. This abstract and universally creative function of Christ diffe red greatly from the incarnate Christ who served as the ethical model for th e path to salvation popul ar in more modern interpretations. These examples all illustrate how broadly the symbol of Christ has been interpreted over time. Symbolic statements such as \"Christ is the Light of the World\", \"In the beginning was the Word\", and the necessity of having faith the si ze of a mustard seed also have different possible meanings and interpretations. Literal in terpretation of such statements renders them absurd, and metaphor is a dangerous slippery sl ope that threatens those who believe the Bible or other holy book must be literally true. Symbols are dynamic as they grow and reinvent themselves. Symbols can be looked at as ha ving a spatial dimension. As one layer of meaning is peeled away or shed, another comes into view from behind the first one. Symbols also have a volume dimension. They are receptacles that \"h old\" meaning and power for the individual. The more power they hold, the more they become holy and a focus for prayer and contemplation. As they gain power, they also provide motivation and inspiration for religious individuals and groups."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"A symbol is multivocal because it communicat es different things depending on where the individual is on his or her spiritual journey. Symbols may be said to speak to people in much the same way that sacred scripture becomes like a living thing when religious people are able to enter into a kind of contempl ative dialogue with the text. Symbols also have a vitality dimension. Symbols ar e in a sense alive. When a symbol fails to hold power, it becomes dead or meaningless. Religions can be looked as sy stems of symbols. Whole cultures evolve as newer symbol systems replace older ones. No one believes in the Greek or Babylonian gods any more. They are part of dead symbol systems (and therefor e dead religions). Many of the symbols from mainstream religions such as Christianity a nd Buddhism derive from religious narratives describing the activities of founde rs of these religions and thei r disciples. For instance, the life of Christ is turned into a set of symbols in the Catholic Ch urch's stations of the cross, which distill the major events in the life of Chri st into a set of fourteen images. The Buddha's life is also captured in a set of images docum enting his adventures in some Tibetan Thangkas, and the incarnations of the god Vi shnu appear in depictions of th e \"ten avatars\" in Hinduism. A charged symbol has power and is alive with meaning. Symbols may be charged spontaneously, and have power when first en countered. This often happens in religious conversion where an individual finds him or hersel f irresistibly attracted to a religious figure or symbol system, and converts to a new religio n. Symbols may also become charged as an individual uses them in prayer and medita tion, and directs attention and positive emotion towards them as part of a spiritual discipline or search. Such charge d symbols can be very valuable when the individual directs atten tion towards them duri ng spiritual travel. One extraordinary thing about sp iritual travel is that religi ous people who adopt a spiritual practice involving contemplative prayer and meditation do not have to wait until death to perceive the power of the symbols that they employ in their practice. They can get glimpses of the value and power of these symbols here and now which can be very motivating and inspiring. Contemplating a charged symbol while in an out-of-body state can be much like stepping into a whirlwind of powerful forces. The individual is pick ed up and carried to mysterious and extraordinary st ates of consciousness with the symbol acting as the method of transport. The symbol can function as the ke y that opens the door to a sacred reality. The Downside of Losing Symbolism One trend seen in modern religion is the idea that there is one literal interpretation of scripture on which all reasonabl e people will agree. Passages from sacred texts are many times highly symbolic and multidimensional containing many possible interpretations. However, scriptures are being fl attened and frozen into a single interpretation by authorities that know, for instance, what the Bible lite rally means. The other common levels of interpretation including the allegorical, ethical, and mystical interpretations are denied and suppressed. The first result of such an approach is that the authority of preacher s who claim to know the correct interpretation is vastly increased. Th e twin doctrines of literal interpretation and inerrancy (the Bible is one hundred percent true, perfect, and without error) give vast authority and credibility to those professiona ls who preach the true word. The individual believer's power is in equal measure lessened."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The second result of this con cept of literal interpretation is that it leads to an over simplification of religion where only a short list of \"fundamentals\" are deemed important. This occurs because the same confidence that leads people to claim to know exactly what the Bible means also makes them certain that they know which parts are most important, which parts can be ignored, and what needs to be done to gain salv ation. In this environment, simplified stripped down religion tends to become a formula. Here a personal relationship with the divine is reduced to uttering a prescribed set of phrases, which when spoken sincerely and correctly become a ticket to heaven. Salvation is achieved by employing a simple ritual formula. When such formulas are treated like life preservers thrown to the drowning, they are grasped so tightly by the individual that they become an excuse for some to stop growing spiritually. The formula for salvation is repeated over and ov er again as if it were some sort of magic charm for luck and protection. Once the formula is accepted, the practi ce of religion becomes primarily the task of getting othe rs to subscribe to and repeat this same formula. Thus we see the emphasis on evangelism. Being certain about one's salvation because ther e is faith that sins are forgiven lays the foundation for a happy life and a joyous self-confi dence. It is difficu lt to fault anyone who seeks such assurance in their sp iritual life. The people who seek this kind of security and the church leaders who try to provide it are sincere and honest in their effort s to create a viable religious tradition that can sta nd against the many challenges to religion posed by the modern world. However, there is a hidden or dark side to such an approach. When one has the ultimate answer which is distilled in this simple formul a, why continue to seek and ask questions? For some, spiritual growth or the process of sa nctification becomes irre levant and unnecessary. For others, when salvation is cer tain, religious practices can be put aside. Still for others, when forgiveness of sin is assured, ethics can be put aside, and this ca n be very dangerous. If all sin is forgiven, committing anothe r sin is not such a bad thing. This is especially true if the ultimate goal of the sin has a higher purpose. This \"end justifies the means\" type of morality has been responsib le for much of the evil and suffering in the world because it sugar coats evil making it appe ar virtuous, and having some religious or idealistic goal. The more grandiose the goal, th e greater the dishonesty and cruelty. Thus we have religious \"stealth candidate s\" who lie about their true vi ews running for political office and judges seeking court appointments that avoi d answering questions that will give a true picture of who they are and what they think. We also have religious leaders making claims that Christianity is a religi on of war and vengeance, who advocate torture of enemies while they claim to follow Christ who told them to \"l ove their enemies\". On a more subtle level, we have clearly biased religious authorities with limited educational backgrounds making dubious pronouncements on matters of history and science. Certainly not everyone takes these approaches but many seem to be attracted to these fundamentalist traditions because of them. Modern religions that take the twin approaches of the certainty of salvation and of all sin bei ng forgiven are seeing increased membership. The richness and beauty of religious te xts become sterile and dry as monolithic interpretations are accepted by whole church councils, denominations, and congregations. Agreements arise on what and how people must believe in the name of group unity, or faith,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"or security, or salvation. Some protestant denominations that protested the authority of the Catholic hierarchy in the reformation so that each individual could become his own priest have now taken on different aut horities in the form of church conventions or charismatic preachers who tell them the true and only interpretation of the Bible. Formerly congregational churches where the local church members decided doctrine are being pressured by interchurch hi erarchies to adopt the true interpretation or be expelled. Authoritarianism is ascendent, and the individua l is expected to adapt and conform to the group. Fortunately, Bible study group s, where people are sometimes encouraged to discuss differing interpretations, run counter to this trend. These group interpretations have the virtue of clarity and simplicity, and can be very helpful, but they are only a point of departure on an individual spir itual journey, and not a final destination. Those who tell people who are at the beginning of a journey that they have already reached their final destina tion do them a great disservice. These group interpretations also have the dis tinct down side of crea ting tendencies towards a \"fortress religion\" where everyone who does not believe the proper interpretation becomes a threat or an enemy or of the devil. Religi ous communities, which should be cohesive based on bonds of love, can shift the basis of this co mmunity to bonds of fear and hatred of the outsider. Having the correct relig ion combined with its correct interpretation has been the basis for many religious wars in the past, and could easily become the basis for another wave of cultural and religious wars in the future. It is the deeply symbolic nature of religious texts and imagery, and the inability of some religious people to accept th e pervasive ambiguity of a re ligious life based on shifting meanings and interpretations, that is the sour ce of these fundamentalis t revivals. In this situation, scripture becomes history and its symbolic doorways can become closed and locked. The revelatory nature of symbols requires that their meanings change in order for the symbols to function as doorways to the sacred. The literalist is continually ca ught in confusion trying to make clearly symbolic statements sound literal and fighting to give them only one interpretation. Ironically, the Book of Revelation which is among the most highly symbo lic books in the Bible is one of the most important texts for most Christian literalists. Similarly, those who treat the Bible as a kind of divinatory text which predicts what has happe ned in the recent past, and what will happen from now until the rapture are on very shaky ground. The dense forest of symbolism which must be crossed to understand, for instance, who is the Antichrist, what country will produce him, and the states that will be at war during th e end times is anything but literal. People who claim a literal interpretation as they wade thr ough a sea of symbolism seem to simply have forgotten what the term literal means. The literalist is also largely cut off from th e power of sacred symbols and therefore from religious experience. This bei ng the case, the individual turns to external authorities for guidance. Faith-based religions which rely most ly on external authorities are excellent places for the autocrats and the power hungry to gain foll owers because it is easy to gain the trust of those that consider faith a saving virtue. Religious language is easily learned and easily manipulated, and con artists have been us ing religion for centuries to swindle the unsuspecting."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Perhaps even more dangerous is the sincere but confused religious pers on who as a political leader uses religious ideals to convince others to support polic ies motivated by ethnic, class, nationalistic or personal ambition. Medieval history describe s a long series of popes, bishops, judges, inquisitors, muftis and ayatollahs em ploying crusades, church courts, jihads, and pogroms to carry out war, torture, murder, and mayhem in the name of religion. Mixing politics and religion sooner or later creates a toxic brew. Those who believe the two should be mixed need to look closely at current and pa st theocratic governme nts and the injustices they promote. Religious people with political pow er often take on a tribal iden tity, and tribal societies often persecute outsiders and look upon them with distain. Tribalism is corrupting to religious people because it focuses their attention on their enemies instead of their ideals. To become a member of a tribe is to have one's identity defined by what one hates or fears most. To identify with a tribe is to surrender the religious life to the secular, and become truly \"of the world\". Sadly, it usually takes many years for those who mix politics and religion to notice the corruption and cynicism it breeds in their ranks. Eventually th ey discover they are not the victors but rather the losers w ho have sacrificed their religiou s ideals and values on the altar of political power and expediency. The lack of personal religious experience forces the individual to substitute various things for the ultimate reality as God becomes distant a nd weak, and requires defenders and religious warriors. The \"render unto Caesar \" biblical quote is completely ignored as religious leaders seek to become \"players\" on the political stage with \"a seat at the table\" of power figures. Religious individuals come to distort religion • by focusing on the rapture and the end-times, and how those outside the faith will suffer during this period • by joining \"culture wars\" to fight the forces of evil that are believed to threaten society • by falsely claiming to be threatened minorities and demanding special protection and consideration when th ey are, in fact, members of a majority with considerable political power • by distorting science and investigating theologically based theories that can never be disproven • by transforming religious congreg ations into political action committees • by rewriting history to support a religious world view based on nationalism and the pride of be ing a nation \"chosen by God\" • by making claims about the Bible being against abortion when the concept of abortion is not menti oned in the Bible at all (although Exodus 21:22 says that if men cause a women to have a miscarriage, then they have to pay a sum of money to the family - they are apparently not accused of murder for killing the unborn child but of theft of an object of value, and are required to pay a civil penalty in the amount determined by a judge to compensate the family). • by forcing religious rituals and proc lamations into secular schools and courtrooms"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"• by claiming that abortion is killi ng an \"innocent child \" when nothing is clearer in Christian th eology (from both Augustine's Catholic doctrine of original sin and Calvin's Protestant doctrine of \"total depravity\") that the child (born or unborn) has original sin - the child is therefore not innocent but inherits the \"sin of Adam\" and is thus guilty) • by claiming that state-supported religion is fair when the vast majority of funds go to one's chosen religi on, and the money is given with no audit requirements to determin e how the funds are spent This external and highly politicized approach to religion fills the void left when direct spiritual experience is impossible, and reli gious symbols become signs devoid of real spiritual power. For the spiritual traveler, religi on is much more than having the right beliefs, or a supportive community who all believe th e same thing as you. It is about employing belief and ritual to generate charged religious symbols which can open up deeper layers of realty so that faith matures into direct spiritual experience. Breaking Out of a Lucid Dream by Experimenting with Matter I woke up in a dream, and looked around trying to decide what to do next. I was in a dimly lit room and the environment had little to interest me. I decided to try to experiment with the \"matter\" in the environment. I walked over to a plaster wall and pushed against it knowing it was not physical, and was therefore subject to unusual beha vior. As I pushed, my hands and then arms penetrated the wall followed by the rest of my body. I was stan ding inside the wall, my body merging with the \"material\" structure of it. There was a slowness and heaviness to movement while merged with this object similar to be ing under water but offering more resistance. It was a curious and surprisingly energetic sensation as if my atoms and the wall's were buzzing around and energizing one another. The altered state of consciousness was a pleasant and novel experience which I perceived as a fo rm of expanded consciousness. For those who are a little less da ring, these travelers can expe riment with putting a hand or arm into the wall to get a feel for both the buzzi ng energetic quality of the sensation and the plastic nature of the dr eam's material form. Entering fully into the wall is one way to erase one's dream body which is something sometimes done in dream yoga as a step toward s freeing oneself from the limitations of the dream state. This kind of experience is a small example of the kinds of education that occur as the traveler encounters new realities in the inner worlds. Doing a Spiritual Practice During Spiritual Travel I found myself awake in a dream and decided to experiment. I sat down to meditate and quickly decided on a spiritu al practice to see what effect it would have."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"I repeated the mantra OM only two or three times out loud in my out-of-body state. Almost immediately, the whole atmosphere became char ged, and I experienced a floating sensation. I vividly felt my body begin to radiate a strange invisible power as if I became a powerful transmitting tower for some invisible radian t energy. The mantric sound echoed all around like a great echo chamber. A short time late r, I was back in my body lying in bed. Breaking Out of a Lucid Dream by Experimenting with Gravity Flying and the feeling of defying gravity is one of the joys of spiritual travel. One of the ways of breaking out of a limited stat e (especially a lucid dream) du ring spiritual travel is to experiment with the freedom of flying. I suddenly woke up in a dream and was determined to change my state of mind and take advantage of the possibilities. I started running a nd as I ran, I began taki ng larger and larger steps. Soon I was leaping ten or twenty feet per step until finally I was airborne and no longer contacting the ground. I was amazed to see gold en fields, sections of trees and rural landscape with great clarity while moving at ex hilarating speed with the air whistling past me. At a certain point, I was skimming the treet ops feeling the top bran ches just touching me as I flew past. I was flying over woods a nd fields brightly l it with golden light. I had chosen a creative method of leaving the ground and had gained a level of freedom that would probably not have occurred had I stayed in the initial lucid dream environment. Another easier way to initiate flying is to find a high spot such as a cliff or the roof of a building and simply jump off it. This works s uprisingly well but it re quires the traveler to have overcome the fear of being hurt in th e inner worlds. It takes some time to be comfortable and secure enough to initiate flying in this way. Breaking Out of a Lucid Dream using the \"Skipping\" Method One method of meditation usable in spiritual travel is the practice I call \"skipping\". This involves shifting (or skipping thro ugh) environments during spiritual travel. This method of meditation is quite dynamic and is possible b ecause in the psychic ar eas, thoughts have much more power than they do while in a normal waking state when the physical senses and body consciousness seems to weigh them down (this is why it is important not to think negative thoughts while in an out-of-body state). When \"skipping\", the traveler can literally ju mp from one space or world to the next. The experience is much like tuning in a station on the radio. The person symbolically moves the tuning dial (some symbolic action like a nod of th e head or shutting and opening the eyes will do) with the intention of changing states (stations). The tr aveler must have associated the symbolic act with the expect ation of movement earlier a nd be prepared to use it. When the act is performed, there is static or noise (a intermediary state of formlessness and disorder) for a second or two as the transition takes place. Then the traveler \"lands\" on a new station (i.e. in a new environment). The next step is to direct the movement toward some desired state or place. This requires discipline, patience, and practi ce.

The Difficulties of Pursuing a Shamanic Path for Non-Native Americans Many Americans are interested in practicing sh amanic or Native American tribal traditions partly because they emphasize personal religious experience rather than faith in a distant God. The author of this site st rongly supports and encourages an interest in personal religious experience. Much of the religious experience pr esent in these shamanic traditions can be classified as spiritual travel. However, atte mpts by persons who are not members of these tribal groups to participate in these traditions are problematic. This is because the vast majority of native pe ople in these traditions will tell you that a person must be born into these tribes to properly practice the tradition. This is not an arbitrary or selfish statement on their part. There are good reasons that justify such claims. These shamanic traditions are tightly bound up with a group of tribal ancestors who have an interest in guiding and protecting the tribal members. If a non-tribal member wants to contact ances tors, who will he or she contact? There is no tradition of being helped by an cestors in the Jud aeo-Christian traditi on. So the question arises: \"With which ancestors are these mode rn-day non-Indian shamans in contact?\" It is theoretically possible for the tribal ancestors to \"adopt\" a non-native pe rson into the tribe, but why would they wish to do so? Certainly a non-Indian person cannot \"adopt himself\" into the tribe (i.e. claim new ancestors) anymore th an a child can walk into the house down the street and tell the resi dents he or she in now their son or daughter. In addition, the shaman's role of healer a nd priest is based on a close-knit long-term relationship with a tribal group which trusts his or her judgmen t and skill. A group of people who show up at a \"shamanic workshop\" do not constitute a legitimate and cohesive community that resembles the tribes of indige nous peoples. So what gr oup is it that looks to these contemporary shamans for spiritual direction and spir itual vitality? Other religious groups have a means of accepting new members that were not born into them through the process of conversion. Medieval Christianity has th e tradition of be ing baptized and becoming part of the mystical body of Christ, and the communion of saints. Mainline protestantism allows a person to adopt Jesus as a personal savior to become \"saved\" or \"born again\" and become a part of the church. Hinduism and Buddhism both have the traditio n of initiation where a disciple accepts an individual as a guru and joins a lineage which in so me ways is like a family. However, non-tribal members attempting to join a Native American tradition are going against the grain of that tradition. Such a c onvert is subject to be ing labeled a \"plastic shaman\", and will likely be resented by the true members of the tribal group. This is especially true if the practicione r makes money from the practice."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"These tribal traditions have many attractive elements and it is understandable why many would wish to be involved in them. However, if one is interested primarily in spiritual travel, there are other ways to pursue this interest apart from using these shamanic methods and imitating tribal groups. The Geography of Spiritual Travel or Soul Travel Once there is acceptance that the soul may be able to leave the body and travel to other places prior to physical death, the question arises: \"Where can the spiritual traveler go on these inner journeys?\" In spiritual travel, states of consciousness (the places the traveler may visit during spiritual travel) may best be understood using the metaphor of geography. When the subject of spiritual geography is studied and debated, the goal is to produce an accurate map of consciousness. There are spiritu al groups that develop these maps of the spiritual universe such as the Theosophical, Tibetan Buddhist, Sufi, and Indian Sant Mat Traditions. They do this in part to help th eir followers understand the world or plane from which a given experience originates by pl otting its location on their cosmological map. It is probable that early Christ ians had such spiritual maps as is evident in the bible where Saint Paul mentions a man who was rapt up to the third heaven in 2nd Corinthians 12. A third heaven strongly implies a first and second h eaven which differ in some way, and a map or hierarchy that describes the relations hip of each heaven to the others. Many times, religious groups also develop such maps because they are interested in describing where the soul can go after death. In general, I have not found these maps to be of much help in understanding my own out-of- body experience. Here, I suggest a relatively simple three level hierarchy of spiritual travel experience which I have found to be more useful. The basic areas the spiritual traveler may visit while ou tside the physical body are the physical world , the psychic worlds , and the spiritual worlds . The physical world is the easiest to explain since it a ppears much as it does when looked at from an everyday physical persp ective. While people in an out-of-the-body state are not restrained by gravity, and cannot interact w ith physical objects because they are not embodied, many of the visual and auditory elem ents of the experien ce remain the same. A good description of a travel experience in th e physical world is from the Sioux medicine man Black Elk who fell unconscious during br eakfast one day and had the experience described on the page titled Black Elk's Description of Crossing Over the Atlantic . There are also a number of detailed descriptions of sp iritual travel in the physical world in the Near- Death Experience section of this web site. More difficult to describe are the psychic worlds which are so varied th at one can talk about them only in the most general terms. They c onsist of such abstract elements as imagery, sound, thought, memory, identity, emotion, and di fferent degrees of limitation. On the near end of the psychic spectrum, there are areas that are all but id entical with everyday"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"experience in the physical world. On the far end, th ere are, for instance, radical alterations in personal identity involving immersion of the soul into powerful environments composed of raw emotion. The soul can also, for example, encounter exotic areas where it becomes aware of some of the collective memo ries of past civilizations. These psychic areas can also range from very positive, beautiful, and joyous to very negative and hellish. We can speak of dream environments as the most common and familiar examples of a psychic world. I call these areas psychic because thought has great power to build, mold, and change them. For instance, when the traveler enters dream environments in full consciousness, he or she discovers how plasti c and malleable they can be on one hand and how real and physical they appear on the other. This site contains many examples of the psychic states encountered during spiritual travel. Even more difficult to describe are the spiritual worlds . These are the areas of mystical experience. The most accurate descriptions ar e the poetic ones that attempt to describe infinite joy, light, love, knowledge , bliss, or emptiness. Slightly below the mystical areas are the places where the mystical light is reflect ed and refracted. These are the paradises of jeweled skies, rivers of nectar, mountains of flowers, and similar kinds of organic and crystalline imagery. Here, there are also divine currents of music in celestial oceans of sound. The deities with their vast awar eness and various attributes are waves, eddies, or vortices on the surface of this vast ocean of consciousness. They preside over their individual paradises and control access to them. The sections on Sacred Light and Sacred Sound describe these spiritual areas. These mystical states are the ultimate goal for the true spiritual traveler. All Aditions for this Section : States of conscioussnes From: Heaven and Hell Emanuel Swedenborg, Heaven and Hell (New York: Swedenborg Foundation Press, 1962), pps. 111-112 The phrase state of consciousness has a special meaning for the spiritual traveler, and requires some added explanation. The followi ng passage which was written by the 18th century thinker Emanuel Swedenborg attempts to define what is meant by this phrase. Swedenborg was a complex man who was part scie ntist, part inventor, part spiritualist- medium, and part sp iritual traveler. Here he talks about how the concept of \"space\" (or location) in the outer world must be redefined to mean \"state\" in the inner spirit ual world. Swedenborg uses the phrase \"state of the interiors\" in his somewhat difficult eighteenth century English (translated from Latin) instead of our phrase state of consciousness but the two appear to have the same meaning."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The language is dense enough to require some a dded translation into modern English prose. My translations will appear in italics following Swedenborg's original text. Swedenborg writes: 192. All changes in place in the sp iritual world are effected by ( are the result of ) changes in state of the interiors ( state of consciousness ) , which means that change of place is nothing else than change in state. In this way I have been taken by the Lord into the heavens ... and it was my spirit that so journeyed while my body remained in the same place. Such are all movements by the angels; and in consequence they have no distance, a nd having no distances they have no spaces, but in place of spaces, they have states and their changes. 193. As changes of place are thus effected it is evident that approaches are likenesses of the state of the interiors, and separations are unliken esses; and for this reason those are near each other who are in like states, and those are at a distance who are in unlike states; and the spaces in heaven are simply the external condi tions corresponding to the internal states. For the same reason, the heavens are distant from each other, also the societies of each heaven and the individuals in each society; and furtherm ore, the hells are entirely separated from the heavens, because they are in a contrary state. ( 193. As changes of place that re sult in nearness are the resu lt of similarities in state of consciousness and separations are the result of di ssimilarities in state of consciousness, for the same reason, those near each other are in similar states, and thos e at a distance are in dissimilar states; and the spaces in heaven are simply the external conditions corresponding to these internal states of consciousness. For the same reason, the he avens are distant from each other, as are the societies of each he aven and the individuals in each society; and furthermore, the hells are enti rely separated from the heavens, because they represent a contrary or dissimilar state of consciousness. ) This quote expresses the very important anal ogy between space and st ate that is usually difficult to understand by those who have not ex perienced spiritual travel. In the inner spaces, there is the soul or awareness, and an infin ite number of directions in which the soul may travel. It is important to reali ze that to be oriented in the i nner worlds, the individual must plot a course and follow it rather than simply drift. Moving from pl ace to place is actually moving from state to stat e in this context. Swedenborg gives us remarkable insight into th e nature of the inner world by clarifying the important relationship between places and states.

The Travel Analogy in Spiritual Travel While the literature of mysticism describes many different \"states\" of religious emotion and divine awareness, the travel analogy brings with it a whole different set of associations than the term state. State implies something static where a particular layer of the mind or cosmological space is entered and maintained. The term travel focuses not only on states but also on stages and transitions between mental or spiritual states. The spiritual traveler moves between spaces or states sometimes in a continuous movement, and sometimes in rapid transitions in a step ‐ like fashion. The term travel further tries to capture the feeling of movement experienced by those who travel outside the body. Many experiences have a feeling of movement and acceleration similar to the one experienced by those who tr avel in the physical wo rld. Spiritual travel"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"experiences also sometimes contain the imag ery of flying over spir itual landscapes, and walking through ethereal rooms. Such experien ce may contain the normal sensory cues we associate with physical environments (depth perception, atmospheric pe rspective, vanishing points, etc.) Thus, the travel analogy tries to capture the dynamic ri chness of the inner worlds of perception. It attempts to do justice to the ch anging geographies and textures of these inner spaces. It is also able to do so without the limitations of the more static \"state-based\" terminology. Clearly, the travel analogy breaks down when th e person enters the more extreme states of mystical awareness. However, even in these st ates of infinite light and cosmic nothingness, there is usually some series of different stat es leading to the advanced state which is beyond all qualities and descriptions. This is evident in the spiritual travel experiences presented in the Sacred Light section of this site. A classic example of spiritual travel is the story of Buddha's enlightenment from a second century CE text, the Buddhacarita by Asvaghosa. Buddha, prio r to his experience of enlightenment, reexperienced his thousands of previous lives during th e first watch of the night. The text says he reme mbered his previous lives \"as if living them over again\" . On the second watch, he saw the workings of karma and reincarnation, and nature of causality in the world. It was not until the fourth watch th at he actually achieved enlightenment. The fact that he entered fully into his past lives strongly sugge sts that he was out of his body, and unaware of the surrounding sensory environm ent during this period of remembering. He spent the entire night \"traveling\" through a whole complex of inner states to finally reach the state of Nirvana at dawn. LEAVING THE BODY, Three Kinds of Transitions In order to do spiritual travel, the soul or cons ciousness of the traveler must temporarily leave the physical body. This usually means shutting off all physical sensations and entering completely into an inner environment. Th ere are three basic ways of doing this. Conscious Transitions Out of the Body: The most dramatic method of leaving the body is to go directly from a waking state into the inner world. This usually happens during meditation but may happen spontaneously while relaxing, such as while lying in bed. Waking Up in a Dream (Lucid Dreaming): By far the most common method of spiritual travel occurs when the traveler \"wakes up\" in a dream. The sense of waking up brings with it a kind of excitement which is accompanied by a feeling of increased awareness, self determination, and concentration. It is also usually accompanied by a wonderful sense of freedom and possibility. The traveler feels himself to be free of the limitations of the physical body ."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Bilocation or Alternating Awareness of Inner and Outer Environments: An unusual form of spiritual travel involves the ability of shift back and forth between the outer world of the senses, and a separate inner reality. Doing this at sufficient speed makes the spiritual traveler capable of being in touch with two separate realities, or seemingly in two places at once ‐ thus the term bilocation. To control this ability requires a great deal of skill, and such control usually only occurs in advanced practitioners. All Additions for this Section: C ONSCIOUS T RANSITIONS OUT OF THE BODY There are a wide variety of psychic and spiritual states that can result from leaving the body consciously. The traveler can find him or herself in either formed states (those containing objects) or amorphous states when leaving the body in this way. Let us first discuss the states where the traveler immediately encounters forms upon leaving the body. Entering Formed States Consciously One type of conscious transition occurs when the traveler simply disconnects the inner spiritual self from the physical body, and moves out and away from the physical body consciously. This \"disconnection\" happens fr equently in near-death experience where the injured person moves a short distance fr om the physical body and observes it. This method of slipping out of th e body has little drama associated with it except for the fear aroused in the individual who does not unders tand what is happening. Robert Monroe describes his experiences as follows: In 1958, without any apparent cause, I began to float out of my physical body. It was not voluntary; I was not attempting any mental feats. It was not during sleep, so I couldn't dismiss it as simply a dream. I had full, conscious awareness of what was happening, which of course only made it worse. I assumed it was some sort of hallucination caused by something dangerous ‐ a brain tumor, or impending mental illness. Or imminent death. It occurred usually when I would lie down or relax for rest or preparatory to sleep- not every time but several times weekly. I would float up a few feet above my body before I became aware of what was happening. Terrified, I wo uld struggle through the air and back into my physical body. Try as I might, I could not prevent it from recurring. Robert Monroe, Ultimate Journey , (New York: Doubleday, 1994), pps. 2-3 The above experience does not meet our full crit eria for spiritual travel since it was not done voluntarily, but it does illustrate a way of moving directly out of the body from a waking state"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"with which some are familiar. In this case, the forms the travel er encounters are the objects in the immediate physical environment. Another way of entering into a physical envi ronment more intentionally is by practicing a visualization while lying in bed. Here, one repeadedly visualizes twisting one's body around and sitting up in bed. After many tries and much effort, the experience of actually sitting up while being in an out-of-body state can occur. Th e surprise that result s from actually leaving the body in this way is such that one is us ually drawn right back into the physical body almost immediately. When one is able to stay out of the body for longer periods in similar situations there is still the sense of lightness, excitment, and concentration. However, there is also an accompanying feeling of being like a ghost wanderi ng through darkened rooms and ajoining hallways. The experience of being out of the body in the physical world (i.e., in one's house) at night is generally not all that interesting or inspiring. Another way to move out of the body from a wa king state is to practice a form of meditation where one's attention is placed on the space betw een the eyebrows while maintaining a strong expectation that one will leave one's body. An ex ample of this kind of conscious transition is illustrated in the experience titled Transitioning From Physi cal to Psychic States . The traveler can also move directly into a vi sualized space that is very much like a dream environment maintaining continuous awareness of th e transition into this space. This type of experience is illustrated by the Entering a Visualized Space description at this site. Though the experience talks about being in a light sleep when the transition took place, the author has had a very similar experience where during a waki ng state, a visualized image turned into a three dimensional environment. All these experiences are unlike sp iritual travel that begins in the dream state where there is a period of unconsciousness between the waking stat e and the dream state, and the traveler wakes up in the dream to begin spiritual travel. Sometimes the traveler's transition to formed environments will involve dynamic movement, and the traveler will enter the environment soaring above fields and cities, taking in vast panoramas. In many cases, the body image of the traveler is more or less identi cal to his physical body but this is not always the case. A common experience is for the tr aveler to become a \"point of consciousness\" or a \"unit of awareness\" with no sense of a body which takes up space. Here the traveler identifies him or herself as pure obser ver or witness, and is like a disembodied set of ears and eyes. Sight and hearing are the two senses that usually dominate during spiritual travel. Entering Amorphous States Consciously Moving consciously into amorphous states is more difficult to de scribe. These states are usually areas of intense experi ence where the dominant reality is that of light, sound, vibration, motion or emotion. Going from a waking state or semi-waking state into an amorphous state is usually the most dramatic kind of spiritual travel experience. In one type of amorphous transition, the traveler suddenly senses a powerful vibration or sound and is caught up in th at energy. This is"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"sometimes accompanied by a feeling of being drawn or propelled by this vibration at tremendous speed through a dark space. This experience seems very similar to the descriptions of the \"tunnel\" associated with near-death experience. Numerous people who came very close to death (no heartbeat or respir ation) have near-death experiences where they have described different types of sounds or vibrations which propelled them at seemingly great speed through a dark tunnel or corridor. Sometimes, there is a feeling of being catap ulted out of the body. In these cases, the vibrations usually start at a low pitch and con tinue gaining in frequency and power until they become almost explosive in their intensity. In other cases, there is the fee ling of the inner sounds or vibr ations but not th e experience of movement and acceleration. Sometimes such sta tic experiences involve hearing spiritual music or sounds, and can be quite ecstatic. All these experiences ar e amorphous in the sense that there are no forms or objects to orient the traveler like there are in the physical worl d. He or she must use meditation techniques to steer in a desired direction. Amorphous States That Lead to Formed States The above mentioned inner sounds along with inner lights (men tioned below) can sometimes act as a means of transition between waking e xperience and some formed inner world. In the movie \"The Wizard of Oz\", the scene of Dorothy flying in her house toward Oz may help in understanding such a tr ansition. Dorothy's house (ego or inner self using a Jungian interpretation) is seized by a whirlwind and carried spinni ng through the clouds. There is a great flurry of movement followe d by the landing of the house in a strange place where all is suddenly quiet. The inner transi tions the author is attempting to describe have much in common with Dorothy's experience. The type of experience described in section titled Meditation on Inner Lights illustrates in a general way an experience which contains an amorphous stage followed by a formed stage. In this case, the traveler is drawn out of the body consciously while meditating on an inner light. Here is a transition involving inner light which st arts from a waking state, moves initially to an amorphous state of energy and movement, and then to a formed state of stability. This stable state is usually a quasi- physical environment. However, the ability to concentrate and direct the attention in a meditative way is so metimes required to break out of the tunnel-like experience into a stable state. Sounds which occur during conscious transitions out of the body are usually very powerful, and may result in the obliteration of the body im age. The author has found that the nerves which inform the person of his body's weight, si ze and position in space seem to largely quit functioning when the sound occurs. Some of the sounds which occur are of a spiritua l or mystical nature ra ther than transitional sounds that carry the traveler to a different pl ace. These \"higher\" sp iritual sounds are of a"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"heavenly nature and are ecstatic beyond descri ption. They are therefore one of the final destinations of spiritual travel rather than a means to some other place. Some sample sounds one may encounter are th e sounds of a speeding train, a loud buzzing, a flute, or the sounds of nature like the roar of a waterfall. As an example, Gopi Krishna describes an experience he had that began with a powerful spiritual sound. These sounds or vibrations are of such intensity that they seem to pass right through the body, overpowering the other senses. Here we have an example of ch ange of identity during spiritual travel where the individual literally merges with the sound. Any of the spiritual travel e xperiences listed on other pages in this site may result from conscious transitions out of the body, but the ab ove mentioned kinds of transitions are the ones with which the author has some familiarity. This section illustrates conscious transitions out of the body which may occur spontaneously, due to an accident or injury, or as a re sult of deliberate action and intention during a meditative exercise. The key here is that there is no loss of c onsciousness during the transition between the waking state and the sp iritual travel or out -of-body experience. W AKING UP IN A D REAM A common way of initiating spiritual travel is waking up in a dream. While this may be something that occasionally occurs to many people, it has a special value for the spiritual traveler. This is because the spiritual traveler has usually developed skill at directing inner experience through meditation or visualization exercises. He or she can therefore use the lucid dream (a dream where the dreamer wakes up and realizes he is dreaming) as point of departure for a journey into various realms of expanded freedom and awareness. In general, a spiritual travel experience which begins by waking up in a dream has an advantage over other methods of leaving the body because it is usually a gentle method of entering into the inner world. Th e powerful forces that one so metimes encounters in direct transitions out of the body from a waking state ar e avoided. It is also comfortable because the traveler avoids the formless side of spiritua l travel which can be a shock to those not experienced in these areas. The traveler usua lly finds the dream environment familiar and non-threatening. However, there is also a disadvantage to th is method. Dream environments are usually so much like physical environments that the travel er tends to assume he or she has the same limitations in the inner world that exist in the p hysical world. It takes discipline and effort to break out of the dream environment and find more interesting and rewarding places to explore. The Spiritual Navigation page gives some methods that can be used to break out of dream environments so that the lucid dreamer can begin spreading his or her wings and become a true spiritual traveler. Some additional examples of spiritual travel in dream environments can be found in the Psychic States section of this site."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"B ILOCATION AND S PIRITUAL T RAVEL The way of leaving the body that I am least familiar with involves the subtle shift in attention away from the senses and concentration on some non ‐ sensory image or state. The thing that distinguishes this from normal imagination is the uninterrupted or continuous nature of the inner experience and its clarity or three ‐ dimensional quality. In this kind of spiritual travel, the experiencer can instantaneously shift back to the physical senses with no resistance or time required to regain normal waking sensory experience. This kind of spiritual travel is perhaps a more advanced form since it a llows for integration of inner and outer experience. Here the line between spiritual trav el and normal waking experience becomes less firm. The shift between the two can take place anywhere. This is perhaps the least dramatic form of spiritual trav el, but also the most useful for the purpose of bringing the knowledge of the inne r world to the outer world. This ability the shift back and forth between tw o completely separate existences, one in the body and one out of the body is sometimes called bilocation. I do not us e bilocation to mean having two physical bodies as some authors do, but only to describe the ability to perceive two separate worlds. Bilocation at the end of a Spiritual Travel Experience This experience illustrates bilocation in the form of only partially returning to the body while mantaining an awareness of the inner world. Bilocation at the beginning of the Experience This experience shows the difficulty of discussing bilocation. It describes the contradictory feeling of being \"in the body\" while also being \"not in the body\". Now Subdivisions: Transitioning From Physical to Psychic States I will never forget one early spiritual travel experience. I had been thinking about the possibility of doing spiritual travel and read ing books on the subject. I was about twenty years old. I was visiting a fr iend in Brooklyn, New York lying on my back in meditation staring into the blackness at the space between my eyebrows. A couch in his basement playroom was my bed for the eveni ng. The room was completely dark. Suddenly, I was standing up vibrating in the blackness. I did not get up but was instantaneously standing and found myself in a \"non-ordinary\" stat e of heightened awareness. I wanted to see where I was to verify that I wa s out of my body. At that point I half walked, half swam (space seemed to be a fluid medium ) to the edge of the room to try and get a glimpse outside through the patio door. When I a rrived at the door I could feel the glass hard and cold upon my hands but could se e almost nothing in the darkness."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"I pressed hard on the glass and to my amazeme nt, my hands followed by the rest of my body passed right through it. I experienced a painfu l scraping feeling along each part of my body as it passed through the door. The strange e xperience of passing through this dense matter disoriented me and as I looked around, I was in a totally different environment. It was a pastoral scene of a field of golden grain but the light was so mehow not like the light in a physical environment. Something about it was to o intense and too brig ht as if the objects shown with their own internal lig ht rather than merely reflec ting the light of the sun. There were two horses peacefully grazing in the field perhaps fifty yards away. After about ten seconds gazing at the scene, I was almost instantaneously back in my body lying on my back reflec ting on the experience. Entering a Visualized Space From: How I Learned Soul Travel Terrill Wilson, How I learned Soul Travel (Minneapolis: Eckankar Publishing, 1987), pps. 61, 62 Waking early one morning, I decided to try concentrating on the blackness of my inner mind screen in the vicinity of the Spiritual Eye. I gradually slipped back into sleep, and during the early stage of sleep became partially conscious of a colored picture on the inner screen. The two ‐ dimensional still ‐ picture showed a young lady standing in the middle of a blacktop road in an outdoor, countryside landscape. The picture grew steadily larger as I concentrated, and I felt a slight suction in the vicinity of my Spiritual Eye. Instantly I found myself standing on the road. The young lady with her back towards me came alive, and started walking away from me. It was like zooming into a stop action movie; everything suddenly came to the life the moment I joined the world. My first impulse was to do something, anything to keep my mind occupied, and hopefully stay out of the body as long as possible. My surroundings included a light ‐ blue sky and rolling, grassy hills dotted with a few shrubs and trees. The blacktop road stretched in front of me in a straight line as far as I could see. Without paying any mind to the lady walking away from me, I jubilantly raised my inner body arms and jumped off the ground, to begin flying over this earth ‐ like terrain. However, my exhilarating flight ended abruptly when I suddenly lost control and was pulled away into the blackness, moments later, ending up back inside my physical body. Meditation on Inner Light: Contemplating inner lights can be a method of leaving the body. Those who are familiar with meditation on the energy center usually known as the spiritual eye located between the eyebrows may be familia r with the cobalt blue light that sometimes appears in the inner field of vision. It usually appears as a amorphous blob of light slowly changing shape with blue concentric circles emanating from it slowly. The circles expand hypnotically resembling something akin to broad smoke rings e xpanding from a central source."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"This kind of light (whether blue or another color) can serve as a focus of meditation either while sitting in disciplined meditation or while dosing off to sleep. On occasion, the light can draw the travel er out of the body and he or she will be instantaneously flying at a fant astic rate of speed through a powerful force field following the light. It seems that the light recedes as the tr aveler moves towards it with its center still radiating the rings. Such experience demands a tenacity to hold on to the center of concentration since the powerful forces can be di stracting. If the traveler is able to maintain concentration, the scene will tend to shift to a stable environment like a dream environment. However, unlike a dream, the traveler will be fully conscious and able to direct the experience from that point. The point here is to illustrate the importanc e of meditation on these inner lights and to know that the appearance of imagery of this sort can be a form of \"inner invitation\" to do spiritual travel. A Powerful Spiritual Sound From: Kundalini: Path to Higher Consciousness Gopi Krishna, Kundalini: Path to Higher Consciousness (New Delhi: Orient Paperbacks, 1992), pps. 6-7 Suddenly, with a roar like that of a waterfall, I felt a stream of liquid light entering my brain through the spinal cord. Entirely unprepared for such a development, I was completely taken by surprise; but regaining my se lf-control, keeping my mind on the point of concentration. The illumination grew brighter and brighter, the roaring louder, I experienced a rocking sensation and then felt myself slipping out of my body, entirely enveloped in a halo of light. It is impossible to describe th e experience accurately. I felt th e point of consciousness that was myself growing wider surrounded by waves of light. It grew wider and wider, spreading outward while the body, normally the immediate obj ect of its perception, appeared to have receded into the distance until I became entirely unconscious of it. I was now all consciousness without any outline, without any idea of corporeal appendage, without any feeling or sensation coming from the senses, immersed in a sea of light simultaneously conscious and aware at every poi nt, spread out, as it were, in all directions without any barrier or material obstruction. I was no longer myself, or to be more accurate, no longer as I knew myself to be, a small poin t of awareness confined to a body, but instead was a vast circle of consciousness in which the body was but a point, bathed in light and in a state of exultation and happiness im possible to describe. Bilocation at the end of a Spiritual Travel Experience My only experience with bilo cation involved a complete break with normal sensory consciousness (spiritual travel ) followed by reestablishing of a tentative contact with the bodily senses. I was initially out of the body in dream-like world but then became able to sense events occurring in the phys ical world. I was able to shif t my attention back and forth between the inner and outer worl d quickly enough so that it was very similar to being in two places at one time- thus the term bilocation."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"In this experience, I was only able to perceive non-visual sensory input fro m my body since any physical movement on my part or visual input from the eyes would be likely to blot out the inner experience. Advanced practitioners may have the ability to do bilocation while walking down the street. I have read such claims but have not had the expe rience myself. Bilocation at the beginning of the Experience From: Lucid Dreams J. H. M. Whiteman, The Mystical Life (London: Faber and Faber, 1961), p. 60, Cited in C. E. Green, Lucid Dreams (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1968), pps. 39-40 While lying in bed and apparently awake, I perceived a visual ope ning with a circular boundary, within which there was presented a scene in bright sunlight an d vivid colours. It appeared to be a park, with many people walking peacefully about. At the same time I was aware of my physical body lying on its back in be d, but not altogether as if I were in that body. It was as if I was apart and watching th e physical body watching. Again appearing to think in the physical body, I conceived a wish to transfer consciousness to a free personal form. Immediately I rose and walked forward towards the opening. The opening appeared to enlarge itself gradually, but before entering w holly within it I has to pass over a patch of sandy coloured ground, as if bared for excavation. It seemed to represent a gulf between the two spheres of existence. Passing through, however , I reach the park and mix with the people. There is difficulty in experiencing details, as if the eyes were out of focus and cannot be brough under steady control... SPIRITUAL TRAVEL VERSUS DREAMS Spiritual travel is different from dreaming in a number of important ways. In spiritual travel, the traveler's awareness is he ightened and the traveler is able to direct the experience if desired. This is unlike dreaming, in which the dreamer's awareness is dulled, and the dreamer lacks initiative. In most dreams, the dream drama unfolds as if controlled by some outside force with little or no control exercised by the dreamer. In spiritual travel, the traveler is also aware that he or sh e has left the physical body and the world that is encountered is not the physic al world. In normal dreaming, however, the dreamer believes the dream to be real as if he or she is acting in the physical world. This explains the great fear in nightmares where any threat is perc eived as a threat to the physical body which could result in death. Since the spiritual traveler's awareness is clear and concentrated, there is usually no difficultly remembering the experience. Many pe ople have trouble remembering their dreams because most dreamers experience a dulle d form of awareness during dreams. Following a spiritual travel expe rience, very seldom does the traveler fall back into a dream state or unconscious state. The intensity of sp iritual travel does not le nd itself to immediately"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"reentering sleep or dreams. In most cases, there is an awareness of retu rning to the physical body, and the person awakens immediately af ter a spiritual travel experience. Though spiritual travel may begin by \"waking up in a dream\" (lucid dreaming), the dream drama usually stops as soon as the dreamer awakens. The symbolic content of a dream usually stops immediately when the lucid dream be gins, and the dreamer senses that he or she is now in control of the dream's events. Spiritual travel also provides a much broader range of experience than is present in dreams. The lucid dreamer with the right training can use the lucid dream as a jumping off point to explore a wide variety of spirit ual and psychic states not avai lable in dreams. Once one inner reality is entered consciously, it is relatively easy to enter another be cause the lucid dream state is much like being in an elevator in a building. The dreamer who learns how to push the correct buttons can trigger a transition to a different floor or plane of reality. Lucid dreaming is only one of the ways that spir itual travel can be initiated. Spiritual travel may also begin during meditation, or as a resu lt of a traumatic shock to the body. The fact that a spiritual traveler can go directly into an inner world vi a meditation without the loss of consciousness that occurs when spiritual travel begins from the dream state seems to indicate that spiritual travel states are independent of and not to be identified with the dream state. The dream state is only one of a set of doorways which can be used to reach spiritual travel states. One of the difficulties of distinguishing a normal dream state from a lucid dream state is that there are degrees of lucidity. Sometimes there is increased awareness in a dream where the dreamer believes he has awakened but then goes on to act in a way that is uncharacteristic of someone who is completely awake. Awakening completely means that the dreamer react s to dream situations in the same way he or she would react if awake in the physic al world. Sometimes this semi-waking state manifests as an inability to act to change th e dream. Here there is a strong sense of waking awareness which is accompanied by a passive attitude of acceptance and powerlessness. Another form of semi-waking consciousness oc curs when the dreamer has limited access to normal memory and cannot recognize familiar persons or situations. Here, the dreamer has a subset of his normal memories and cannot react normally to the dream situation because of these missing memories. This semi-waking consciousness muddies the di stinction between normal dreaming and lucid dreaming. True lucid dreaming has a crystal clar ity that somehow feels even more powerful than the usual clarity of waking awareness, and it is this kind of lucid dream state that is easily distinguished from a normal dream state. The spiritual material page illustrates just how clear and convincing th e reality of lucid drea ming is by describing how reality testing is done with the objects in the lucid dream. Another important point to note is that spiritual practices a ffect dreams. The contents of dreams often echo significant activ ities performed in the waking state. Therefore, spiritual practices done in waking life on a regular basis will sometimes lead to the dreamer spontaneously repeating such practices in drea ms. This will likely result in waking up in the dream and can even precipitate powerful spiritu al experiences. Even when the practices are not having obvious results in a waking state, the openness of the dream state can permit such"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"practices to produce the out-of-body states that they are intended to produce while awake in dreams instead. Finally, it is not necessary wake up in a dream to do spiritual travel while asleep. Many of the experiences at this site occurred spontaneously while the traveler was asleep without actually beginning in a dream. Adopting a sp iritual practice that emphasizes spiritual travel will tend to produce such spontaneous travel experien ces where the sleeper \"pops into\" out-of-body states while asleep without first being in a dream. Having tried to describe the diffe rences in analytic terms, it is necessary here to state that none of these distinctions really capture s the qualitative differences between normal dreaming and spiritual travel or lucid dr eaming. The quality of awareness is just different in ways that seem impossible to describe. One thing th at can be said is that this \"difference\" in consciousness sometimes inspires awe and fascination. There is also many times the direct and immediate sense that one's soul is composed of spiritual energy w ith much potential. It only awaits thought to activate that potential ener gy and direct it towards some end. It is up to the traveler to train his or her mind and increase the ability to concentrate to be able to direct this energy towards some desired state of consciousness or new form of knowledge. It is important to understand the differences stated above so as not to confuse spiritual travel with dreams. However it may be difficult to convince someone who has not done spiritual travel that it is different from dreami ng no matter how many dis tinctions are drawn. SACRED LIGHT & SACRED SOUND The experience of sacred light can be found in all the world's great religious traditions. Perhaps the most famous example in the West of this phenomenon was the biblical account of Saint Paul's vision of light that occurred while he was on the road to Damascus (Acts 9). Mircea Eliade, the historian of religions, write s in his thematic study of comparative religion The Two and the One : Now all experiences of the supernatural light present this common denominator: anyone receiving such an experience undergoes a change of being: he acquires another mode of being which gives him access to the world of the spirit ... even in a Far ‐ Westerner of the nineteenth century, a meeting with the light indicates a spiritual rebirth. Experience of the sacred light when perceived in sufficient depth radically alters the world view of the experiencer. The following paragraph from Richard C. Bucke's 1901 classic book Cosmic Consciousness attempts to explain this altered view of the universe: Like a flash there is presented to his consciousness a clear conception (a vision) in outline of the meaning and drift of the universe. He does not come to believe merely; but he sees and knows that the cosmos, which to the Self Conscious mind seems made up of dead matter, is in fact far otherwise ‐ is in very truth a living presence. He sees that instead of men being, as it were, patches of life scattered through an infinite sea of nonliving substance, they are in reality specks of relative death in an infinite ocean of life. He sees that the life which is within man is eternal; that the soul of man is as immortal as God is; that the universe is so built and ordered that without any preadventure all things"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"work together for the good of each and all; that the foundation principle for the world is what we call love, and that the happiness of every individual is in the long run absolutely certain. The person who passes through this experience will learn in a few minutes, or even moments, of its continuance more than in months and years of study, and he will learn much that no study ever taught or can teach. Especially does he obtain such a conception of the whole , or least of an immense whole , as dwarfs all conception, imagination, or speculation, springing from or belonging to ordinary Self Consciousness, such a conception as makes the old attempts to mentally grasp the universe and its meaning petty and even ridiculous. The following set of experiences show some ways in which the sacred light is encountered during spiritual travel. Each illustrates how pe ople encounter ecstatic states where they lose contact with the physical senses and enter entirely into anot her space which is one of the defining characteristics of spiritual travel. Encountering the Light during a powerful near ‐ death experience Renee Paraslow recounts her contact with the sacred light during her Near ‐ Death Experience which occurred in 1968 (prior to the publication of any works on the subject of near ‐ death states). Experiencing \"seas upon seas of light\" in an ascent to heaven The Sufi mystic Bayazid ‐ i Bistami who lived in the ninth century and was a proponent of \"intoxicated\" Sufism describes seas upon seas of spiritual light as he approaches the throne of God in a Mi'raj (the Muslim term for a saint's or prophet's ascent to heaven) Paul Twitchell, the 20th century leader of Eckankar, describes a lengthy experience of spiritual light during spiritual travel This spiritual travel excerpt describes the culmination of a series of spiritual experiences where the writer Paul Twitchell has been shown a series of worlds leading up to his current state of light devoid of matter or form. Robert Monroe, the author of a number of books on Out ‐ of ‐ Body Experience, asks his guide to show him an area of extreme love during spiritual travel Monroe, an American writer who traveled to hundreds of OBE states, had a set of guides he referred to with the generic term INSPECs (intelligent species). He believed it would be a great help if he could get a feel for a place or state where there was a massive amount of love. His guides directed him to the following experience in response to his request. Monroe is especially adept at describing the \"unknowable\" nature of deeper religious experience. Thomas Merton's Experience of the sacred light Thomas Merton was a Trappist monk, and one of the Catholic churches' best known writers on the contemplative and monastic life in the 20th century. Here, Merton describes an experience of celestial light which he had in a Catholic church in Havana when he was 25 years old, and comments on its availability to all people. There is some ambiguity about how"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"transcendent Merton's experience is since it is unclear if he lost touch with his physical senses. Ramakrishna's experience of the goddess Kali as an \"ocean of light\" during spiritual travel At one point, the 19th century Indian saint Ramakrishna became frustrated, feeling he could not live any longer without seeing the Goddess Kali. He demanded that the goddess appear to him. He threatened to take his own life with a ritual dagger (from the hand of the Kali statue). At this point, he described how the goddess appeared to him. The 20th century Indian writer Gopi Krishna's first experience of the Kundalini energy as sacred light Over a period of years, Gopi Krishna developed the ability to sit for a period of hours in concentration without any discomfort. The following account, which took place in 1937, describes his first Kundalini experience which occurred while he was visualizing \"an imaginary lotus in full bloom, radiating light\" at the crown of his head. Static Awareness in a Dynamic Field Sacred light has many textures and variations, and is many times characterized as perceiving the whole cosmos in a single perceptual event. Here, an analogy is presented showing a way that awareness of sacred light gives insight into the structures of the universe. Paramahamsa Yogananda's initiation experience of spiritual light Yogananda, a 20th century Indian teacher, describes an experience of spiritual light which occurred when he received initiation from his guru. A spontaneous experience of Sacred Light Some experiences of sacred light come out of nowhere like bolts of lighting. Sacred Sound Shabda (or Nada ‐ Brahman) is a spiritual musical sound that can be heard during yogic meditation and is believed to have a spiritually transformative power. This belief in the spiritual nature of both the inner spiritual sounds of meditation and physical outer sounds of mantra and chanting (shabda is associated with both) is a common one throughout India today. Both kinds of sounds have a special power for the spiritual traveler. The emphasis on inner spiritual sounds or a \"current of sound\" is seen especially in the Sikh and Radha Soami traditions in the Punjab, and was a common theme in the poetry of a popular medieval saint named Kabir who was born in Varanasi in the fifteenth century. Kabir is highly respected by these groups and his poetry has been elevated to scripture by being included in their holy books. Unfortunately, it is taboo in many of these tr aditions to speak or write about personal religious experience. It is therefore difficult to find autobiographical exam ples of this kind of religious experience except indirectly in the poe try of various saints fr om northwest India."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The theme of sacred sound can also be seen in the ideas of such popular Hindu teachers as Swami Sivananda, Guru Maharaj Ji, Parama hamsa Yogananda, and Rajneesh (Osho). We have already mentioned the experience of s ound that is associated with helping the soul leave the body on the Conscious Transitions Out Of The Body page, but here we will look at sounds which accomplish something equally import ant. This new class of sounds move the soul through different states of be ing once it has left the physical body. The view that the universe cont ains waves or currents that can be perceived as sound which move between the two poles of existence is a common theme in the Shabda Yoga traditions. The first pole is in the higher spiritual planes of being where the templates for all life forms and the templates that define the basic order of the material world are said to exist. The second and opposite pole is manife station, and the physical world as we normally perceive it. These traditions claim that on one hand there is a flow of creative en ergy or spirit issuing from the first pole that is res ponsible for the material order and evolution we see around us. The consciousness present in life forms is sa id to depend on this outward expanding spiritual flow. In this world view, the uni verse is being constantly creat ed or recreated, and refreshed or renewed by this outward flow. On the other hand there is also said to be a returning flow which reverses creation, and draws or carries the traveler back from the second pole or material world to his or her origins in the spiritual realms. The salient point of this discussion lies in the fact that the spiritual traveler who can perceive these returning currents of sound can learn to catch the returning wave, and ride it back to higher planes of being. This is the reason for our interest in these sound currents. They serve both as the mechanism of travel, and a compass orienting the traveler pointing the way through the psychic plan es and into the sp iritual planes. The ability to tune the soul to perceive the sounds of Shabda mu st come first, and the ability to catch them, and metaphorically ride them is a more advanced stage. The advanced stage involves transitioning from immersion in a sing le \"lower\" sound associated with a psychic state represented by, for instance, the sound of drums or thunder to the higher sounds of flutes, violins, or vinas which are associated with different heavenly or spiritual worlds. Developing one's spiritual hearing is a process that takes time and effort, and is a worthy goal on the spiritual path. It is also a skill that is sometimes ignor ed or overlooked. The spiritual traveler needs to take a special interest in this form of spiritual development to truly understand the kind of freedom and knowledge that spiritual travel can offer. The following experiences and poems describe so me sample encounters with sacred sound in spiritual travel. Kabir's spiritual sky Kabir, the medieval Hindu ‐ Muslim mystic poet describes his experience of spiritual travel in poetic form. He begins with a reference to a world where sacred music fills the sky.

A World Composed of Musical Sound Encountering a musical space during spiritual travel. Mantra Meditation During Spiritual Travel Simple spiritual practices such as mantra meditation (repeating sacred words or sounds) can have dramatic effects when practiced during spiritual travel even when the same practice has little or no effect when done during normal meditation. Phil Morimitsu describes becoming one with Spiritual Sound At the final stage of a detailed guided spiritual travel experience, Morimitsu is shown the pure worlds of Spirit by his guide. Kabir Describes the \"unstruck sound\" in another Poetic Verse Here, Kabir writes about listening to inner spiritual sounds that take the form of conches and bells. Paul Twitchell describes traveling with his guide to the Anami or nameless world Like many mystical experiences, this one contains a mixture of the elements of sacred light and sound.

She had the experience after she became unconscious following an allergic reaction to some food she ate. Here she has just come out of \"the tunnel\" and into contact with the spirit of her dead uncle with whom she communicates. Following this, she enters into the Sacred Light. The entire text of this experience can be found in the Near ‐ Death Experience section of this site."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"As I came to the end of this place, I wondered if I would be alone, and just like that I was with, I was one with my uncle just like we were two lights that were put together one red and one blue that made purple light, and I was aware of things about him that I had never been aware of in life. I didn't spend much time with him and I didn't know him well. He lived in the south and I lived in California But it was a very joyful reunion and I became aw are that he was concerned that I was there because he communicated to me instantaneously that my mother could not stand the loss of a child, and he was confused, and yet he kne w that everything was as it should be. From that point I became very a ttracted to the light and this a ttraction was like an irresistible magnet... I loved that light, and the love was what was pulling me home. I moved past my uncle into what I can best define as a sea of li ght. It was as if every atom in the universe had been electrified with color and light and sound, but more than that with totally unconditional love. And it was a welcoming to me, and I dove into this ocean with each moment, with each movement, feeling more rapture and more joy an d more just absolutely unspeakable love. As I moved through this sea, I became aware I was moving to th e center of the sea of light which I perceived to be, how could I say this, as if you were a gnat and you were flying into the sun, and that is the perspective th at I had for this sea of light. And then in an instant, again like a clap [of th e hands], I entered into this light and I became one with this light, and of th is light, and no longer an indi vidual, no longer a person, but simply a part of this light. I became like the phoenix. I was destroyed, and it was the most blissful, the most excruciatingly be autiful moment that I could imagine. It seemed to me to be the apex of all existence to get to the point where one was no more. One simply was a part of this light. After being in this state for what seemed to be a time beyond time, I was gathered again together like sands from the s hore as an individual and I was ca lled to recount for my deeds. Experiencing \"seas upon seas of light\" in an ascent to heaven From: The writings of Bistami, a Sufi Mystic While I was asleep, it seemed to me that I as cended to the Heavens in quest of God, seeking union with God most glorious, so that I might abide with Him forever, and I was tested by trial - God displayed before me gifts of all kinds, and offered me dominion over the whole heaven and yet I turned aside my eyes from th is ... Then I ascended to the Second heaven and saw winged angles who fly a hundred thousand times each day to the earth to look upon the saints of God, and their faces shone like the sun ... An when God Most High realized the sincerity of my desire to seek Him, He turned me into a bird, and I went flying, past kingdom after kingdom, and screen after sc reen, and plane after plane, seas after seas, veils after veils, until behold, the angel of the Footstool of God me t me with a pillar of light and said to me \"Take it\" and I took it, and lo, the heavens and all that were therein sought refuse in the shadow of my gnosis, and sought light in the lig ht of my longing, yet a ll the angels seemed but as a gnat compared with the all-absorb ing concern with the search for God. So I continued to fly, until I reached the Footstool of God, and lo, was met by angels, whose eyes were as the number of stars in the heavens, and from each eye shone forth light, and those lights became lamps, and I heard sounding forth from each lamp, \"Glory to God\", and \"There is no God but God\".

And when the Most Glorious perceived the sincerity of my desire to seek Him, He called to me and said: 'Oh my chosen one, approach onto me , and ascend to the heights of my glory, and the planes of my splendor, and sit upon the carpet of my holiness, so that thou may see the the work of my grace in my appointed time. Thou art My chosen, and My beloved, and My elect among the creatures'. And I be gan to melt away at that, as l ead melts (in the heat of the fire). Then He gave me to drink from the Fountain of Grace in the Cup of Fellowship, and transformed me into a state beyond description, and brought me near unto Him, and so near did He bring me that I became nearer to Him th an the spirit to the body. And I continued thus until I became even as souls of men had been in the state before existence was, and God abode in solitude apart, without created existence or space or direction or mode of being, may His glory be exalted and his Names sanctified.

You might say it was a mirage, a hallucination, a trick of this world. But then I did see it. The light of God! It was standing above all in the center of the world; the light was fuzzy, shiny and bright, not too bright, just enough. It hung in the center of the landscape within the empty space of this wo rld, a great mass of light, so immense that I cannot describe it, gleaming in the gulf of space. While watc hing it I began to pray, not in words but in impressions. The scene passed and I felt myse lf moving gradually, a motion of going into something, a flowing like water. That is the clos est description I can give. In a sense I was the same fluid as an atom of spirit. Yet it was motionless with an impre ssion of watching, feeling the flow and the deep motion in every fiber of myself. The impulse went through me that the journey had ended. This was liv ing in God. The music was k eened, high and thin, as if coming from within myself. There was no seein g, no hearing, no feeling, just the knowledge that I was part of the absolute - just the in telligence that has power and freedom. Freedom! Yes, this was it. I never had this before. This was wonderful; the freedom to move as desired anywhere at any time. Then I knew that it wa sn't the music that was heard but a suspension above me like an almost palpable thing; it fa ded, spiraled upward and became a part of the sound. Again it was there. It was the softest s ound of breathing. I waited. \"Who is there?\" I sent out the vibratory comma nd. The wave hung in the either. it moved out and came back like a bolt from space but I shook it off and wa ited. The light became very strong around me and I knew I was standing in the center of it, suspended in space, an atom within the light atoms; there was no distinguishing them. Nothing!

Thomas Merton's Experience of the sacred light From: The Seventh Story Mountain Thomas Merton, quoted in Burnham's The Ecstatic Journey , (Ballantine Books, 1997), p. 199 But what a things it was, this awareness, it was so intangible, and yet it struck me like a thunderclap. It was a light that was so bright that it had no relation to visible light and so profound and so intimate that it seemed like a ne utralization of every le sser experience. And yet the thing that struck me most of all was that this light was in a certain sense ordinary - it was a light (and this was most of all what took my breath away) - that was offered to all, to everybody, and there was nothing fancy or strange a bout it. It was the light of faith deepened and reduced to an extreme and sudden obviousness. Ramakrishna's experience of the goddess Kali as an \"ocean of light\" during spiritual travel From: Ramakrsna Kathamrta Mahendranath Gupta, Ramakrsna Kathamrta translated by Swami Nikhilananda as The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna (Mylapore: Sri Ramakrsna Math, 1952), Book 1, p. 15 When I jumped up like a madman and seized [a sword], suddenly the blessed Mother revealed herself.

As far as the eye could see, the shining billows were madly rushing at me from all si des with a terrific noise, to swallow me up.

Entirely unprepared for such a development, I was completely taken by surprise; but regaining my se lf-control, keeping my mind on the point of concentration. The illumination grew brighter and brighter, the roaring louder, I experienced a rocking sensation and then felt myself slipping out of my body, entirely enveloped in a halo of light. It is impossible to describe th e experience accurately. I felt th e point of consciousness that was myself growing wider surrounded by waves of light. It grew wider and wider, spreading outward while the body, normally the immediate obj ect of its perception, appeared to have receded into the distance until I became entirely unconscious of it. I was now all consciousness without any outline, without any idea of corporeal appendage, without any feeling or sensation coming from the senses, immersed in a sea of light simultaneously conscious and aware at every poi nt, spread out, as it were, in all directions without any barrier or material obstruction. I was no longer myself, or to be more accurate, no longer as I knew myself to be, a small poin t of awareness confined to a body, but instead was a vast circle of consciousness in which the body was but a point, bathed in light and in a state of exultation and happiness im possible to describe. Static Awareness in a Dynamic Field A number of years ago, I was doi ng spiritual travel while medita ting, and I entered a state of extreme knowledge and bliss. The best I can de scribe the experience is that I became a node of energy in a vast electrical sea of incandescent blue lightnin g. It was as if my consciousness were a central point where hundreds of bolts of lightning crossed one another superimposing their energy on the single area of space that I occupied. In the midst of these luminous electrical arcs, my consci ousness stood motionless and sere ne, unchanging and continuously aware. The state was beyond thought, beyond imagination, beyond ecstasy, and beyond heaven. It was a static kind of knowing c oupled with the dynamic movement of the surrounding powerful energy field. My attempt to make out some kind of imager y beyond the lightning itself showed only an occasional glimpse of a triangle. This triangle was akin to the pyramid on a one-dollar bill, which represents a human eye emanating spiritual light. I seemed to be in communion with the electr omagnetic forces of the cosmos understanding intuitively their interpenetration of the many layers of the universe. I was the electricity of the nervous system in the human body, the flash of charged particles from a sunspot pouring into the solar system, and the high-energy electr omagnetic waves propagating though space. I was identified with the flashing and surging electr ical energy of the cosmos. I perceived this energy as a kind of connective tissue permeating and unifying all structures, both mental and physical."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The state contained a vast knowi ngness, an awareness of certain relatedness, a wisdom that arises from awareness not broken up by thought or image, not sliced and demarcated by time, a monumental stillness surrounded by the contin uous movement and surging of the energies of being itself. My consciousness seemed to interpenetrate all form and thereby have unrestricted awareness of its stru ctures, not in analytic terms, but as gnosis. Gnosis is the Greek term meaning knowledge that comes through identification with the object known. Such knowledge is inscrutable and can only be alluded to by analogy. One analogy that comes to mind is of a chemis t who studies the frozen water molecule and it crystalline variations. Such a person knows the shape of the mo lecular bonds, and the various angles of the water molecule's la ttice structure in great detail. After much investigation, such a scientis t might come to spontaneously see how the variations of structure can generate small atom ic crystalline shapes. These, in turn, each combine to create larger and larger crysta ls. Eventually, such a person might come to intuitively understand the minor variations of millions upon millions of snowflakes as they are created and destroyed in a snowstor m, each one unique, but each one based on a fundamental set of basic angular bonds cr eated from the simple water molecule. Similarly, to enter into the ener gy of the \"ground of being\" is to sense a knowledge of all the forms that energy interpenetrates, an d all the forms it gives birth to. In the end, such a state is mysterious, unimagi nable, indescribable, and one that cannot be remembered but one that creates mental and em otional echoes that cannot be forgotten. The experiencer feels the need to express it in some form - in poetry, or prose, or artwork. But there is also the realization that the attempt will fail. Such failure is like an artist who tries to create fine line drawings with a broad brush designed to paint houses. The outlines may be there but finished work falls far below the goal.

A flood of ineffable bliss overwhelmed my heart to the innermost core. It was late in the afternoon of the following day before I could bring myself to leave the hermitage. A spontaneous experience of Sacred Light From: The Author's Archives "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"I was lying in a light sleep on the couch in a college library and as I awoke, I spontaneously entered a state of great light. It was as if th e atoms in the material world all simultaneously exploded, converting their mass to quanta or light . I was reminded of fireworks that have a primary exploding core which sends out comets which themselves explode, and the process repeated until the light was so overwhelming that all space became an ocean of light. As the light grew even more intense, I sensed an emptiness within it. The emptiness is similar to the dark after-image a person sees after having stared at the flash when his picture is taken. The brightness was so great that the process of perception temporarily broke down, leaving a void in its place. During this experience, whic h lasted for only a few seconds, my sense of self was dissolved and a indescribable feeling of intense fullness and exhilaration replaced it. The shock of being transported to this state and then back to the couch was tremendous. I jumped up from the couch as if I had been thro wn into freezing water while asleep. I started to cry out but was able to catch myself before my vocal chords came into play. My breathing was fast and shallow and my heart was pounding. Around me were people sitting or lying on couches and chairs reading, taking notes, and dozing. My sudden movement had not attracted much attention. The stillness of the library lounge was so different from what I had experienced that I wanted to tell everyone ar ound me that the appare ntly dull, quiet, low- energy, mostly lifeless universe in which we liv e has a secret blazing core that usually goes unperceived. Kabir's spiritual sky From: Songs of Kabir Translated by Rabindranath Tagore, Songs of Kabir (York Beach, Maine: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1991), pps. 66-67 There the sky is filled with music: There it rains nectar: There the harp-strings jingle, and there the drums beat. What a secret spendor is there, in the mansion of the sky! There no mention is made of the rising and setting of the sun. In the ocean of manifestation, which is the light of love, day and night are felt to be one. Joy for ever, no sorrow, no struggle!

Kabir says: \"There I have witn essed the sport of One Bliss!\" A Dream Experience Transformed by Sacred Sound From: The Author's Archives"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" I dreamed that I was walking around my base ment and there was a party going on. As the party was ending, I decided to help clean up a nd started picking up things off the floor. No sooner had I begun, than I started both h earing and feeling flute music coming from within my body. I immediately realized I wa s out of the body. The music was a kind of harmonious jazz flowing without repetition. It increased in volume until I felt like a flute being played by some mysterious musician. It had a sweet fee ling of joy, airy with some accompanying light issuing from the body as if a by-product of the sound. The sound resonated my entire being overwhelming the sense of a limited self. Using a Jungian interpretation, my childhood ba sement was a symbol of the collective unconscious which sometimes contains objec ts and events from cultures outside the individual's personal experience. The part y was everyday experience which many times leaves trash and disorder in its wake. The act of cleaning it up was symbolic of purification which led to a mystical breakthrough, a nd the peak experience that followed. After the experience, I thought of the Persian poet Rumi , who was like the reed of God. When the wind of God blew, Rumi the reed vibrated creating a ho llow flute-like sound. God was the actor and Rumi was simply the inst rument through which God expressed himself. \"The reed\" is also the name of one of Rumi's most famous mystical poems. The Wonders of Shabda When it Manifests as a Flute From: The Author's Archives An unforgettable experience occu rred when I heard the flute sound as spiritual music one night while traveling out of my body. The form of the flute sound I experienced was a slow drawn-out version of the first four notes of the old 1960's \"Star Trek\" theme from the television show. The notes came in the form of a rich and resonate flute which seemed to fill all space. The sense of freedom and joy that this music brought with it were indescribable. The limited self was completely gone replaced by the spiritual music that permeated the vast sky of that world. This experience of sound was partly symbolic si nce the words that follow these introductory notes in the television show ar e \"Space, the final fr ontier ...\". However, the \"space\" being referred to in my case was not physical space but the inner space of the spiritual worlds which is according to the philosophy of spiritual travel truly \"the fi nal frontier\" of human exploration. Exploring physical frontiers has its own element of fascination. Physical frontiers are, however, pale refl ections of the spiritual frontiers within the deeper self which are accessible via spiritual travel. Shabda's Manifestations From: The Author's Archives"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" One manifestation Shabda is compared with the sound of a speeding train. Based on my limited experience with this state of being, co mparing this state of consciousness with the sound of a train is appropriate in more ways than one. As with other types of Shabda , the experience consists not onl y of sound but also has a strong kinesthetic component. One not only hears the s ound but it is as if one were standing on the platform as a mighty locomotive passes. The plat form shakes and trembles as the train roars past. The sound together with its trembling manifestations permeates the body and the world. Like other forms of Shabda, it blots out and overpowers the body image and draws the individual into a w holly other space. It is not a state of bliss but one of pre ssure and power with an underlying feeling of purification. It is as if the self were being burnished or sand blasted undergoing purification perhaps in preparation for high states of being. A World Composed of Musical Sound From: The Author's Archives I was asleep a few years ago when an extraordinary event occurred. I do not remember being in a dream and do not recall any transition out of an earlier state but I was suddenly out of my body. I found myself in a world composed entirely of orchestral music with large numbers of strings and woodwinds filling the space. I had no visual sensations at all sensing only darkness if I attempted to view the environm ent. The unusual thing was that I had not the slightest interest in the visual element because I was taken up by the music that so completely filled me. I was soaring as the both the atmosphere and myself were permeated with this mysterious symphonic music. There was no body, and no mind or thoughts. The fullness and richness of the sound had a strong component of ecstasy or bliss which made the quality of the experience difficult to relate since listening to similar music in the physical world does not have near the same effect. This was truly a heavenly world. The experience went against everything I had been led to believe as a child about the kind of limitations that we expect we have as embodied beings. I concluded we have access to a much broader range of experience while alive than many of our religious leaders assume. The experience also confirmed to me the acc ounts of some of the great composers like Mozart, who claimed he \"heard\" his symphoni es inwardly and simply wrote then down without having to actually \"compose\" them. Ha d I a composer's training, I believe I could have transcribed the melody into sheet music.

I sat down to meditate and quickly decided on a spiritu al practice to see what effect it would have. I repeated the mantra OM only two or three times out loud in my out-of-body state.

I vividly felt my body begin to radiate a strange invisible power as if I became a powerful transmitting tower for some invisible radian t energy. The mantric sound echoed all around like a great echo chamber. A short time late r, I was back in my body lying in bed.

I had caught up. But the movement stopped. The only way I could describe it, was that th e whole inner universe had a bi gness to it, and there was a gigantic rocking and shaking going on. But it wasn't just me that was shaking, all of the inner universes were shaking until, when it all st opped, there was nothing . . . but wait - there was something different. I was the atmosphere, if you could call it that. There was the faint sound of the ECK [spirit], a pure but piercing single, high-pitched sound. It wove in and out, but this was different from the ECK so unds I had heard on other planes. I was this sound! At first it was almost painful - the pure pi ercing of It - but as I grew accustomed to It and stopped resisting It, It became soothing. My norma l sight was gone.

A giga ntic spirit sun that manufactured its own spiritual atoms and electrons poring them into that continuous stream of light. \"I will take you into the sun of light - into the truth of trut hs,\" he said. \"We go by becoming one with this current upon which we now ride.\" Then suddenly there was nothing of ourselves excep t the consciousness of joy, light and bliss.

PSYCHIC STATES, The Vast Reality of the Psychic Worlds The psychic worlds are so varied that one can only describe them in the most general terms. They have also been called the supernatural worlds, or intermediate worlds by writers who describe their own inner journeys. Traveling in the psychic worlds is sometimes called shamanic journeying by those inte rested in indigenous societies and their methods of spiritual travel. The psychic worlds can range from very positive, beautiful, and joyous to very negative and hellish. Here I will note that my own experience with these negative areas is very limited and I therefore rely on other author's claims to b ackup this assertion about the hellish states. Many spiritual leaders claim that enlightenme nt can come without any involvement with these psychic areas and warn against any contac t with these realms. This is partly because contact with the psychic planes is associated with psychic ab ilities such as predicting the future and telepathy. Such skills have the pot ential of giving the psychic person power over"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"others, and can be valuable commodities that can be used to make money. These psychic skills therefore offer great temptations to leave the spiritual life behind. Attempts to turn spirituality into a busine ss though many times well-intentioned are fraught with difficulty, and a significant portion of th e New Age subculture has become a gigantic mall with countless shopkeepers se lling their spiritual wares. However, spiritual travel only seeks to open the individual to new vistas and is by itself of little help in controlling other people, or in improving the trav eler's wealth or position in society. These kinds of new vistas serve as preparation for entering the mystical Oneness which is both the source and final destinati on of all life. Therefor e, the author views encounters with these psychic ar eas as stepping stones to the sp iritual areas, and important parts of a spiritual education rather than thre ats to the seeker that might lead him or her astray. The Western approach to some Eastern trad itions focuses on long periods of meditation where over a period of years the seeker's restless mind is quieted. Using the Buddha's life as a primary example, the tremendous struggle and peri od of mental discipline is then followed by a grand leap to enlightenment where suddenly a ll confusion and ignorance is left behind. This is the sudden enlightenment approach. However, in my experience, the spiritual search is much more like learning a craft where the student takes multiple small steps over a period of years which gradually lead to mastering the craft. This gradual approach is consistent with the spiritual travel approach and is also consistent with the way most hu man beings learn any new field. Spirituality is like playing the piano where the process of learning is sometimes dull, and involves discipline and repetition. However, the piano sonata which finally results from all the practice is sublime and transcends the musi cian, the practice involved, and the instrument on which it is played. All the seeker needs is to have few spiritual travel experiences to conclude that in spiritual trav el, the Whole is much greater th an the some of the parts. The psychic planes are the areas of creativity and individuality. They represent a gradual expansion of identity where the traveler disc overs not ultimate freedom but a widening of consciousness to include greater wisdom and freedom. There is a gradual stretching of identity to include awareness of more and more ways of being. The ability to travel outside the body consciously and explore th ese areas represents a form of freedom and individuality that is unimaginable to those who have not experienced it. The following examples attempt to show a range of states on the more positive end of the psychic spectrum. Monroe's Experience of joining with a Collective Consciousness in the Psychic Worlds Mystical literature is replete with stories of mystics claiming to instantaneously learn libraries of information from a single encounter with the inner reality. In this quote, Robert Monroe describes a spiritual travel (OBE) experience where his consciousness is joined with a series of other beings to form a vast reservoir of collective knowledge and experience. The experience comes close to describing what the psychologist Carl Jung called the \"collective consciousness\" of humanity. This collective consciousness was the locale of archetypal or"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"collective symbols which represent the collective experience of the human race. However, Monroe's experience seems to go beyond Jung's theory, and asserts that the collective consciousness holds the experience of other intelligent non ‐ human species as well. The latter parts of the experience transcend the psychic area and border on a mystical experience. A Classic Example of Entering a Dream ‐ like Psychic World This experience is a common one where a spiritual travel practitioner meditates on the way into sleep. In this case, the individual concentrates on a flat image that becomes three ‐ dimensional as he leaves the body to enter a psychic space represented by the picture. A Description of a \"Heavenly\" Psychic World during Spiritual Travel This experience describes the world of Sat Lok (\"place of light or purity\" in Sanskrit). The more distant psychic worlds have many fascinating heavenly qualities and features which are illustrated in this travelogue. A Description of a Spiritual Travel experience which involved \"exquisite touch\" Emanuel Swedenborg describes his experience of being \"carried away by the spirit to another place\". A Description of Supernatural Flight in Spiritual Travel Annada Thakur was an Indian visionary who considered the dead Indian saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa of Dakshineswar to be his inner guide (in this account Ramakrishna is called Thakur, or Lord). Annada had been sick and had been musing about his desire to see something of hell before he died. When he fell asleep, he had the following spiritual travel experience. Later, he was shown a series of hells, but this description concentrates on his spiritual flight with his guide and the experience of a heavenly breeze. The Sioux Medicine Man Black Elk Visits the Land of the Ancestors Black Elk's vision illustrates a shamanic method of inducing spiritual travel. Shamans are priests or healers of tribal peoples who act as go ‐ betweens bringing messages from the ancestors to their tribal group. As a note, many Americans have taken to imitating shamans and their practices but this is a difficult path for those outside these Native American communities. The section titled Shamanic Subcultures and Spiritual Travel discusses this in greater detail. Brief Encounters With a Mandala Mandala areas are composed of powerful imagery containing a variety of clear multi ‐ colored moving geometrical forms tied together in an overall circular pattern. In tantric meditation, they are symbolic maps of the heavens. The \"Clay ‐ like\" Nature of some Psychic Worlds "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"This experience illustrates the malleable nature of some kinds of experience in the psychic worlds. In some states, the reality encountered is plastic and will rapidly reform itself if the traveler has the presence of mind to examine it closely. This power of concentration during spiritual travel has the effect of producing a much wider variety of experience during spiritual travel than is usually present in dreams. Meeting a Spiritual Guide in a Surreal Other ‐ worldly Environment The traveler discovers his body appears as a sphere of light as he embarks on a journey to meet his spiritual guide. Shape ‐ shifting or Altering the Body Image in Spiritual Travel One unusual aspect of spiritual travel is changing the body image to a different form. In this example, the change happens spontaneously but it is likely that some experienced travelers can change bodily forms at will. Three Dimensional Spaces Containing Luminous Objects There are a broad variety of visually interesting spaces to explore in the psychic areas. The Joy of Flying Gives a Taste of Spiritual Freedom Exploring the skies of the psychic worlds is a creative outlet which is exciting for the spiritual traveler, and a refreshing alternative to embodied existence.

No, it is not a tunnel, but a tube, a transparent radiating tube. I am bathed in th e radiation which course s through all of me, and the intensity and recognition of it envelop my consciousness and I laugh with great joy. Something has changed, because the last time, they had to shield me from the random vibration of it. Now, I can tolera te it easily, the actual energy its elf. The radiation flow is two- directional in the tube. The flow moving past me in the direction from which I came is smooth, even, and undiluted. The flow that I am is moving in the opposite direction and appears much different. It is organized in a mo re complex form. It is the same as the wave moving past me, but it contains a multitude of small waves impressed upon the basic. I am both the basic, and the small wave forms, m oving back to the source. The movement is steady and unhurried, impelled by a desire I kno w but cannot express. I vibrate with joyous ecstasy just by knowing."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The tube seems to become larger as another joins it from one side, and another wave form melds into me and we become one. I recogn ize the other immediately, as it does me, and there is a great excitement of reunion, of this other I and I. How could I have forgotten this! We move along together, happily exploring the adventures, experience, and knowledge of the other. The tube widens again, and another I joins, and the process repeats itself. Our waveforms are remarkably identical and our pa ttern grows stronger as they move in phase. There are variegations in each which, when co mbined with another related anomaly, create a new and important modification of the total that we are. The tube expands again and I am no longer concer ned with the walls as still another I enters the waveform flow. This is partic ularly exciting, as it is the firs t I perceive as returning from a nonhuman sojourn. Yet the intermesh was near perfect and we become so much more. Now we know that somewhere, a consciously contro lled physical tail, much like a monkey's is useful in ways far more than balance and acting as a third hand for holding things. It can be a very efficient means of communication far beyond a super sign language just as eloquent as the spoken word. Steadily and surely, one I after another join s us. With each, we become more aware and remember more of the total. How many does not seem important. Our knowledge and ability is so great that we do not bot her to contemplate it. It is not important. We are one. With this, we divert from the underlying wave form and move away from it. We watch motionless in unified respect as the action of it continues away fr om us into infinity. We also perceive easily the smooth orig inating wave coming from such infinity and dissolving into the pattern from which it came. Flowing through all of us is a coherent energy that is our creation, th at displays immensely the reality of the whole is greater than the su m of the parts. Our ability and knowledge seem without limit, yet we know at this point such is valid only within the energy systems of our experience.

I gradually slipped back into sleep, and during the early stage of sleep became partially conscious of a colored picture on the inner screen. The two-dimensional still-picture showed a young lady standing in the middle of a blacktop road in an outdoor, countryside landscape. The picture grew steadily larger as I concentrated, and I felt a slight suction in the vici nity of my Spiritual Eye. Inst antly I found myself standing on the road.

Such jewel trees and banana trees and rows of palm trees are all made of precious things and gr ow everywhere in this region. On all sides it is covered by strange golden nets and these nets are covered with lotus flowers made of precious things. Some of the lotus flowers are huge in proportion, a half a mile in circumference, and others up to ten miles. From each lotus issues many rays of light, and at the end of each ray there is a saint whose golden-colored body b ears the great mark of a spirit ual traveler, and who in all directions and in countless world systems, demonstrates the love of God for man. Rivers flow through this gigant ic world. There are rivers ther e from a mile in width to hundreds of miles wide, and the same in depth. All flowing calmly with fragrant waters, and resounding with the delightful music of bagpipes, and once you have drunk of their waters, never again do you have the desire for the worlds below, but clamor with anxiety to reach the higher worlds. You can bathe in their waters and be refreshed with heavenly bliss, furthermore you can make the waters at the temperature you desire."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"A Description of a Spiritual Travel experience which involved \"exquisite touch\" From: Heaven and Hell Emanuel Swedenborg, Heaven and Hell (New York: Swedenborg Foundation Press, 1962), pps. 294-295 The following passage, which was written by th e 18th century thinker Emanuel Swedenborg, attempts to describe what happens when a pe rson is \"withdrawn from the body and is carried away by the spirit to another place\". Swedenborg was a complex man who was part scient ist, part inventor, pa rt theologian, part spiritualist-medium, and pa rt spiritual traveler. Of particular interest here is first his attempt to put spiritual travel in a biblical context by describing the soul as \"being carri ed away by the Spirit\". This is something that happens in a number of places in the Bible such as in Sa int John's vision in the book of Revelations. He also makes reference to Saint Paul's vision of light on the road to Damascus (Acts 9) in describing the state of \"not knowing one is in the body or out of it\". Second, his emphasis on the the capacity of the spir itual traveler for the sensation of touch is unusual. He emphasizes how this sense of touch is very pronounced because he believes that all the bodily senses are available to the spirit ual traveler (as well as to the angels and to man's disembodied spirit after death). This is a topic which is not much discussed by other authors. This passage contains some confusing el ements. He apparently, while walking and \"conversing with spirits\", went into an out-of-body state without realizing it, and only became aware of it when he returned to hi s body and saw he was at a different physical location. Swedenborg writes: 439. To make clear that man in respect to his interiors ( inner state ) is a spirit I will relate from experience what happens when man is wi thdrawn from the body, and what it is to be carried away by the spir it to another place. 440. First, as to withdrawal from the body, it happ ens thus. Man is brought into a certain state that is midway between sleeping and waking, and when in that state he seems to himself to be wide awake; all the senses are as perfectly aw ake as in the completest bodily wakefulness, not only the sight and the heari ng, but what is wonderful, the se nse of touch also, which is then more exquisite than is ever possible wh en the body is awake. In this state spirits and angels have been seen to the very life, and ha ve been heard, and what is wonderful have been touched, with almost nothing of the body interven ing. This is the state that is called being withdrawn from the body, and not knowing whethe r one is in the body or out of it. I have been admitted into this state only three or four times, that I might learn what it is, and might"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"know that spirits and angels enjoy every sense, and that man does also in respect to his spirit when he is withdrawn from the body. 441. As to being carried away by the spirit to another place, I have been shown by living experience what it is, and how it is done, but only two or three times. I will relate a single instance. Walking through the st reets of a city and through fiel ds, talking at the same time with spirits, I seemed to myself to be fully aw ake, and in possession of my usual sight. Thus I walked on knowing what I was doing, and all th e while with clear vision, seeing groves, rivers, palaces, houses, men, and other objects . But after walking thus for some hours, suddenly I saw with my bodily eyes, and noted that I was in anothe r place. Being greatly astonished I perceived that I had been in the sa me state as those were who were said to have been led away by the spirit into another place. For in this stat e the distance, even though it be many miles, and the time, though it be many hours or days, are not thought of, ne ither is there any feeling of fatigue; and one is led unerringly through ways of which he is ignorant, even to the destined place. A Description of Supernatural Flight in Spiritual Travel From: A Life of Visions Shree Shree Annada Thakur, A Life of Visions , (Calcutta: Adyapeat h Dakshineswar Sangha, 1968) Suddenly I saw as if Thakur was coming to me smiling. Thakur came and sat by the side of my head; and placing his hand on my head said, \"What is this whim of yours... Will you tell me why you are so eager to see hell?\" ... Thakur tried to dissuade me in many ways. When I would not be dissuaded at all Thakur said, \"Then come- let us go; let me show you hell and give you an idea of it.\" Then I came out with Thakur with a cheerful heart and stood outside the room. Pointing his finger to a great distance Thakur said, \"Do you s ee there? That high road you see there is the road to heaven; we have to approach that road.\" Lost in wonder I looked at something with keen eyes. There was a wonderful feeling of joy in my heart. I asked Thakur with a joyous h eart, \"Thakur, how long and along which way are we to go?\" \"Come on- I am leading the way\" saying this Th akur began to fly with a flutter. In my attempt to follow Thakur I slowly got up into space. Ah! what a delightful journey! What a thrilling experience of supernat ural aerial flight! If anybody had ever dream flown in the sky like a bird- he only would feel th is joy; none else would be able to guess it. Both of us were flying so fast as to produce a hi ssing sound; our hands seemed to serve as wings and the legs and feet as the tail of the fl ying bird guiding flight. We had flown a great distance; the way seemed to have no end; both of us were coveri ng the distance silently. After a while a soft breeze touched my body. Thakur exclaimed, \"Annada, this is the breeze of heaven; this is what they mean by Moloy breeze (zephyr); heaven is not far off. Is it painful to you?\""},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"I said with a cheerful heart, \"No, Thakur. Where is the pain. It is a matter of great joy; it is the height of peace.

Neihardt, Black Elk Speaks (New York: Washington S quare Press, 1972), pps. 205- 206 The Oglala Sioux medicine man Black Elk return ed from Europe to find his people involved in the Ghost Dance. It was one of the last large collective attempts of the Plains Indian tribes to reinvigorate their traditional religion. In th e following vision, he visits the land of the ancestors after falling unconscious during the dance ritual. This kind of trance is a form of conscious entry into the inner world since he appears to have never lost consciousness during the transition. After awhile I began to feel very queer. First my legs seemed to be full of ants. I was dancing with my eyes closed, as others did. Suddenly it seemed I was swinging off the ground and not touching it any longer. The queer feeling came up from my legs and was in my heart now. It seemed I would glid e forward like a swing, and then glide back again in longer and l onger swoops. There was no fear with this, just a growing happiness. I must have fallen down, but as I fe ll, I had fallen off the swing when I was going forward, and I was floati ng head first through the air. My arms were stretched out, and all I saw at first was a single eagle feather right in front of me. Then the feather was a spotted eagle dancing on ahead of me with his wi ngs fluttering, and he was making the shrill whistle that is his. My body did not move at all, but I looked ahead and floated fast towards where I looked. There was a ridge right in front of me and I thought I was going to run into it, but I went right over it. On the other side of the ridge I could see a beautiful land where many, many people were camping in a great circle. I could see they were happy and had plenty. Everywhere there were drying rack s full of meat. The air was clear and beautiful with a living light th at was everywhere. All around the circle, feeding on the green, green grass, were fat and happy horses, and animals of all kinds were sc attered over the green hills, and singing hunters were returning with their meat."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"I floated over the tepees and began to come down feet first at the center of the hoop where I could see a beautiful tall tree all green and full of flowers. When I touched the ground, two men were coming towards me, and they wore shirts made and painted in a certain way. They came to me and said: \"It is no t yet time to see your father who is happy. You have work to do. We will give you something that you will carry back to your people, and with it they shall come to see their loved ones.\" I knew it was the way their holy shir ts were made that they wanted me to take back. They told me to return at once and then I was in the air again, floating fast as before. When I came right over the dancing place, the people were still dancing, but it seemed that they were not making any sound. I had hoped to see th e withered tree in bloom, but it was dead. Then I fell back into my body, and as I did this I hear d the voices all around and above me, and I was sitting on the ground. Many were crowding around asking what vision I ha d seen. I told them just what I had seen, and what I brought b ack was the memory of the holy shirts the two men wore. Shamanic Subcultures and Spiritual Travel Many Americans are interested in practicing sh amanic or Native American tribal traditions partly because they emphasize personal religious experience rather than faith in a distant God. The author of this site st rongly supports and encourages an interest in personal religious experience. Much of the religious experience pr esent in these shamanic traditions can be classified as spiritual travel. However, atte mpts by persons who are not members of these tribal groups to participate in these traditions are problematic. This is because the vast majority of native pe ople in these traditions will tell you that a person must be born into these tribes to properly practice the tradition. This is not an arbitrary or selfish statement on their part. There are good reasons that justify such claims. These shamanic traditions are tightly bound up with a group of tribal ancestors who have an interest in guiding and protecting the tribal members. If a non-tribal member wants to contact ances tors, who will he or she contact? There is no tradition of being helped by an cestors in the Jud aeo-Christian traditi on. So the question arises: \"With which ancestors are these mode rn-day non-Indian shamans in contact?\" It is theoretically possible for the tribal ancestors to \"adopt\" a non-native pe rson into the tribe, but why would they wish to do so? Certainly a non-Indian person cannot \"adopt himself\" into the tribe (i.e. claim new ancestors) anymore th an a child can walk into the house down the street and tell the resi dents he or she in now their son or daughter. In addition, the shaman's role of healer a nd priest is based on a close-knit long-term relationship with a tribal group which trusts his or her judgmen t and skill. A group of people"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"who show up at a \"shamanic workshop\" do not constitute a legitimate and cohesive community that resembles the tribes of indige nous peoples. So what gr oup is it that looks to these contemporary shamans for spiritual direction and spir itual vitality? Other religious groups have a means of accepting new members that were not born into them through the process of conversion. Medieval Christianity has th e tradition of be ing baptized and becoming part of the mystical body of Christ, and the communion of saints. Mainline protestantism allows a person to adopt Jesus as a personal savior to become \"saved\" or \"born again\" and become a part of the church. Hinduism and Buddhism both have the traditio n of initiation where a disciple accepts an individual as a guru and joins a lineage which in so me ways is like a family. However, non-tribal members attempting to join a Native American tradition are going against the grain of that tradition. Such a c onvert is subject to be ing labeled a \"plastic shaman\", and will likely be resented by the true members of the tribal group. This is especially true if the practicione r makes money from the practice. These tribal traditions have many attractive elements and it is understandable why many would wish to be involved in them. However, if one is interested primarily in spiritual travel, there are other ways to pursue this interest apart from using these shamanic methods and imitating tribal groups. Brief Encounters With a Mandala From: The Author's Archives One encounter with a mandala in spiritual trav el reminded me of a shooting gallery with a circular symmetry. There were bright and detailed forms of different colors moving in a precise almost mechanical fashion, some around the circle's center, some up and down, some spinning on their own cent ral axis as they moved across ot her arcs. The moving objects were abstract circles, squares, tr iangles and lines filled with br ight high-contrast colors. One characteristic of these ar eas is their overabunda nce of energy. The forms radiate a great deal of light, and are somewhat surprising to th e traveler in their vi sual intensity. In my experience, the mandala appears without prior warning spontaneously during a dream state. These areas are difficult to expe rience for more than a few seconds at a time, since a strong emotional response of surprise tends to bring th e traveler back to the body shortly after the onset of the experience. In general, strong emotional responses tend to te rminate the experience. It is difficult to say where such imagery would lead if a skilled trav eler were able to follow it for an extended period of time. The best way to prolong an experi ence is usually to be detached from what happens, although this is, in practice, sometimes a di fficult rule to follow. The \"Clay ‐ like\" Nature of some Psychic Worlds"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"From: The Author's Archives I was dreaming and suddenly woke up. The most in teresting aspect of th is experience was the way the objects in the mind changed form when I concentrated upon them. In the dream, I heard music and the clarity of awareness associated with lucid dreaming appeared. I let the music carry me along. I wa s gliding down a hallway on my back. I enjoyed not having to walk in this dream environment, and the associated feeling of weightlessness. The music was similar to a Judy Collins folk song I had heard. As I floated on the music, I noticed a somewhat ape-like older gentleman walking down the corridor who invited me into his office to talk. I told him I probably did not have much time, as out-of-body experiences tend to end at a moment's notice. I then told the man of my opinion of his strange appearance. As I continued to stare at him studying his featur es, his face began to change into a variety of different forms. His neck seemed to disappear , and he assumed a bird -like look with a large beak-like nose. The transformations continued into different figur es one after another as if I was watching a claymation movie. The final transformation was that the man shrunk down and was transformed into a series of bent wires like a set of comp lex wire earrings. I marveled at this last transformation and picked up a piece of the wire separating it from the rest of the tangle to examine it. I then put it b ack, thinking it should be an integral part of the whole. As I placed it next to the other wire, a li ttle flash of light occurred fusing the piece I had separated with the part I had left lying there. I then found myself without any effort back in my body. While some environments in the inner worlds s eem stable and resist efforts to change them, others are plastic and can change form dyna mically in front of the travelers eyes. Meeting a Spiritual Guide in a Surreal Other ‐ worldly Environment From: The Tiger's Fang Paul Twitchell, The Tiger's Fang (Menlo Park: The Illuminate d Way Press, 1978), pps. 3-4 Almost as quickly as my eyes were closed I awoke in the Atma Sarup or soul body to find myself walking along a beach where the wild surf lashed the shore and a wind whipped the pines along the edge of the strand. There were pale, white clouds in an azure s ky. Something about the landscape was ethereal and my pulse quickened with the thought that this was an out-of-the-body projection via the dream technique. The color, the invigorating air and the beauty were beyond words. It seemed as if there was God in everything."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"I felt no fear at this sudden transportati on but curiosity, tugging at my mind, asked the question of where was I? Somewhere in the back of my mind it seems that this was not a strange place at all... that some time, in the afterwards, in the earlier travelers with Rebazar Tarzs, I had gone through this section of landscape. But a pe aceful feeling settled over me and all was accepted for what it was. The sea of crystal blue and th e lacy surf was like a million sparkling diamonds that dashed up against the sand beach and ran off into the sea again. The distance was majestic with foaming whitecaps. Yet there was a silence, a strange wonderful silence so deep reaching that it stirred through me. Looking down at my body a feeling of joy went through me . I was wearing a white robe of light which flowed around me in a circular motion in a gen tle swirling current. There were no feet, no hands, nothing but a ball of swirling light. My vision was below where my feet should have been and it was also in the back of my head. It was anywhere I di rected my attention... al l simultaneously. When I spoke, there was a multitude of sounds issuing from me. A brilliant sphere appeared on th e horizon and as it came closer and grew larger it revealed itself as a small sailing vessel, at the tille r was [my spiritual guide] Rebazar Tarzs. Shape ‐ shifting or Altering the Body Image in Spiritual Travel From: The Author's Archives I was once in a dream state and witnessed a bodily transformation. My body changed from its normal form to a shining cross. Immediately, I realized I was out of my body and fully conscious. The cross was similar to two crossed bright white fluorescent bulbs. The feeling was one of great energy and vitality. The cross which was now my body vibrated with an electrical radiant energy. As soon as the transformation occurred, the cross left the ground and began moving through the darkness. Becoming a being of light made me weightless and I literally floated upward moving slowly hovering above the ground. I vividly saw and felt myself to be this shining cross during the experience. This is a case where my new body image during spiritual travel in no way resembled my normal body image. My sense of body consciousness was completely changed. Three Dimensional Spaces Containing Luminous Objects From: The Author's Archives Once while out of the body, I enc ountered a space containing t housands of suns a few feet across moving in random patterns much like th e movement of a group of insects buzzing around a light (except moving somewhat more sl owly). Each sun gave off bright yellow- white light. The background was dark like a nigh t sky. These spheres were too bright to see the outline of their disks clearly, each one having a kind of bright corona radiating from it."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"There was no particular emotional feel to the sp ace and I felt myself to be a distant observer of the passing scene. I also did not sense any consciousness or self-awa reness in these suns. This kind of space is probably typical of many different three dimensional spaces filled with varied forms composed of energy or light in the psychic worlds. The Joy of Flying Gives a Taste of Spiritual Freedom Flying during spiritual travel and the joy it brings is mentioned more than once at this site. However this activity merits some additional co mment. This is because the freedom of flight is a kind of faint echo of the more extreme states of spiritual freedom that come at later stages of the spiritual path. The sensation of flying completely unrestrict ed by gravity has many ecstatic elements and shades of subtlety. On one hand, there is the crea tivity of sky-dancing as the traveler explores different positions while moving through the ai r. There is the tumbling, the rolling, the twisting, the spinning, and the divi ng. All of this can be done at break-neck speed. A sparrow would have a difficult time outmaneuvering the indi vidual with some experience of spiritual flight. Normally we might associate such movement with skydiving in th e physical world but spiritual flight is different in that it is self-powered rather than depending on gravity for movement as the skydiver does. It also contai ns the option of soari ng through an airless void where the wind which limits the skydiver's movement is not present. The effect is for the person in soul flight to experi ence fewer limits on his or her m ovements because of this lack of air resistance. Beyond this dancing approach to soul flight, th ere is the powerful sensation that sometimes comes when moving rapidly across the sky, as if the soul were powered by some mysterious engine that vibrates it with great energy. It is as if the soul is a craft specifically designed to soar at fantastic speeds through the atmosphe re. The experience of freedom, speed, and power differs significantly from normal body consciousness. It is another flavor of experience- yet another altered state of consciousness. There are many such different modes of being that occur in the psychi c worlds during spiritual travel. WESTERN TRADITIONS, Spiritual Travel in Christianity and Judaism Spiritual Travel in the Ch ristian New Testament Some of the most important visionary experi ences in the Christian New Testament can be understood as spiritual travel. While the number of examples listed below from scriptures are small, they are only samples from a larger set. But even with this limited number, there are enough to show that the concept of spiritual travel has been unj ustifiably ignored or devalued in these Western traditions. In the author's view , the topic of spiritual travel needs to be revisited by scholars and religious leaders to first document, and then assert the importance of spiritual travel in Western reli gious scripture and practice."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"For Christians who value the authority of Saint Paul, an important biblical passage is Paul's story of the man who was transported up to the third heaven in Corinthians 12. This experience clearly fits our criteria for spiritua l travel (assuming the man did not visit heaven while actually in his physical body). Some sc holars believe Saint Paul was the person who experienced heaven but that he described the experience as happening to another man because of his humility. This story is important because it is a passage from the new testament that describes in literal terms the soul leaving the physical body and traveling to heaven. It does this when Saint Paul questions: \"Was the man in his body when he visited heaven or not?\" By wondering about these two possibilities, Saint Paul is stating that he believes that the soul of a living person can leave the body, visit heaven, and return to the body to tell the story of what happened. This is precisely what appears to happen in deeper spiritual travel experiences. ... I shall go on to tell of visions a nd revelations granted by the Lord. I know a Christian man who fourteen years ago (whether in the body or out of it, I do not know- God knows) was caught up as far as the third heaven. And I know that th is same man was caught up into paradise, and heard words so secret that human lips may not repeat them. About such a man as that I am ready to boast; but I will not boast on my own account, except of my weaknesses. (2 Corinthians 12:1-5) The most pronounced and longest spiritual travel experience in the new testament is in the book of Revelations. In Revelations 4, the desc ription of spiritual travel is clear and unambiguous. This following passage from Reve lations precedes the famous section where Saint John meets the four heavenly figures with the faces of a human, an eagle, a lion, and an ox. This spiritual travel expe rience appears to go on almost to the end of the book of Revelations. Saint John never does describe retu rning from heaven to his physical body, but clearly he had to return to write the Book of Revelations. After this I looked, and there befo re my eyes was a door opened in heaven; and the voice that I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, \"Come up here, and I will show you what must happen in the hereafter.\" At once I wa s caught up by the spirit. There in heaven stood a throne, and on the throne sat one whose appearance was like the gleam of jasper and co rnelian; and round the throne was a rainbow, bright as an emerald. In the circle about the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on th em sat twenty-four elders, robed in white and wearing crowns of gol d. Burning before the throne were seven flaming torches, the seven sp irits of God, and in front of it stretched what seemed a sea of gla ss, like a sheet of ice. (Revelation 4:1-6) Paul's conversion experience where he had a visi on of light on the Road to Damascus (Acts 9) is unclear as to whether it qualifies as spiritu al travel since it is uncl ear whether he left his body. It may or may not have been a spiritual travel experience."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"3 As he was nearing Damascus on this mission, a brilliant light from heaven suddenly beamed down upon hi m! 4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, \"Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me?\" 5 \"Who are you, sir?\" Saul asked. And the voice replied, \"I am Jesus, the one you are persecuting! 6 Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you are to do.\" 7 The men with Saul stood speechless with surprise, for they heard the sound of someone's voice, but they saw no one! 8 As Saul pi cked himself up off the ground, he found that he was blind. 9 So his companions led him by the hand to Damascus. He remained there blind for three days. And all that time he went without food and water. (Acts 9:3-9) This vision which blinded him for three days wa s a crucial turning point in the history of the early church since Paul, after his conversion, was the primary fi gure who spread Christianity to the Gentiles. One indication that the vision may qualify as spiritual travel was that Paul lost his ability to see. This might indicate his other senses also failed during the experience. If this were the case, his experience might meet our cr iteria for spiritual travel since if all of his senses were inoperable, hi s vision may have occurred during an out-of-body state. Spiritual Travel in the Old Testament There are a few examples of spiritual travel in the Old Testament where individuals are transported to heaven while awake rather than in dreams. Ezekiel 8 is one such example: 1 Then on September 17, during the sixth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity, while the leaders of Judah were in my home, the Sovereign LORD took hold of me. 2 I saw a fi gure that appeared to be a man. From the waist down he looked like a burning flame. From the waist up he looked like gleaming amber. 3 He put out what seemed to be a hand and took me by the hair. Then the Spirit lifted me up into the sky and transported me in a vision of God to Jerusalem. I was taken to the north gate of the inner cour tyard of the Temple, where there is a large idol that has made the LORD very angry. 4 Suddenly, the glory of the God of Israel was there, just as I had seen it before in the valley. 5 Then the LORD said to me, \"Son of man, look toward the north.\" So I looked, and there to the north, beside the entrance to the gate of the altar, stood the idol that had made the LORD so angry. 6 \"Son of man,\" he said, \"do you see what they are doing? Do you see the great sins the people of Isr ael are doing to drive me from my Temple? But come, and you will see ev en greater sins than these!\" (Ezekiel 8:1-6) Ezekiel 40 is another example of spiritual travel in the Old Testament where a vision transports the prophet to what appears to be a physical location (the land of Israel). 1 On April 28, during the twenty-fifth year of our captivity fourteen years after the fall of Jerusalem the LORD took hold of me. 2 In a"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"vision of God he took me to the la nd of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain. From there I co uld see what appeared to be a city across from me toward the south. 3 As he brought me nearer, I saw a man whose face shone like bronze standing beside a gateway entrance. He was holding in hi s hand a measuring tape and a measuring rod. 4 He said to me, \"Son of man, watch and listen. Pay close attention to everything I show you. You have been brought here so I can show you many things. Then you will return to the people of Israel and tell them everything you have seen.\" (Ezekiel 40:1-4) Dreams are also a very important element in th e Old Testament. Numerous prophets such as Job, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, and Amos have visionary and prophetic dreams. The following passage from the Song of Solomon actually describes Solomon waking up in a dream which is something that happen s often in spiritual travel. 2 \"One night as I was sleeping, my heart awakened in a dream. I heard the voice of my lover. He was knocking at my bedroom door. 'Open to me, my darling, my treasure, my lovely dove,' he said, 'for I have been out in the night. My head is soaked with dew, my hair with the wetness of the night.' 3 \"But I said, 'I have taken off my robe. Should I get dressed again? I have washed my feet. Should I get them soiled?' 4 \"My lover tried to unlat ch the door, and my heart thrilled within me. 5 I jumped up to open it. My hands dripped with perfume, my fingers with lovely myrrh, as I pulled back the bolt. 6 I opened to my lover, but he was gone. I year ned for even his voice! I searched for him, but I couldn't find him anywhere. I called to him, but there was no reply. 7 The watchmen found me as they were making their rounds; they struck and wounded me . The watchman on the wall tore off my veil. 8 \"Make this promise to me, O women of Jerusalem! If you find my beloved one, tell him that I am sick with love.\" (Song of Solomon 5:2-8) In the following famous passage from Joel, th e importance of dreams for the believer is emphasized. Implied in this statement is that sp iritual dreaming is an important part of life, and that the ideal world or th e \"end times\" would contain many individuals who had spiritual and visionary dreams. Since many visions and dr eams in the Old Testament appear to involve spiritual travel, it would seem that the bible recommends this practice. If it is good for the prophets, it may be just as valuab le for ordinary men and women. 28 \"Then after I have poured out my rains again, I will pour out my Spirit upon all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams. Your young men will see visions. 29 In those days, I will pour out my Spirit even on servants, men and women alike. 30 \"I will cause w onders in the heavens and on the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke. 31 The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon will turn bloodred before that great and terrible day of the LORD arrive s. 32 And anyone who calls on the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"name of the LORD will be saved. There will be people on Mount Zion in Jerusalem who escape, just as the LORD has said. These will be among the survivors whom the LORD has called. (Joel 2:28-32) In the next passage from Daniel, the concepts of visions and dreams is equated. In the Old testament, the two are very close and sometimes confused, or spoken of using the same terminology. 1 Earlier, during the first year of King Belshazzar's reign in Babylon, Daniel had a dream and saw visions as he lay in his bed. He wrote the dream down, and this is what he sa w. 2 In my vision that night, I, Daniel, saw a great storm churning the surface of a great sea, with strong winds blowing from every di rection. 3 Then four huge beasts came up out of the water, each different from the others... (Daniel 7:1-3) In addition to the above examples of spiritual tr avel in the Old Testamen t, there are prophets who enter heaven while alive a nd sometimes appear to take th eir body with them. Elijah saw a \"chariot of fire\" and \"went up by a whirlwind into heaven\" apparently never to be seen again by those who witnessed this event. This cannot be classified as sp iritual travel since the prophet never returned but it has some clear similarities. THE FLUID SELF, Changing Identities in Spiritual Travel Everyone knows what it is like to be embodied living in the physical world from day to day. In what ways does the individual's identity, self ‐ concept, and body image vary during spiritual travel? One fascinating aspect of spiritual travel is the ability to shift from one's normal body image to a different form. Taking on an identity or form different from one's normal body image happens on occasion during spiritual travel. It sometimes happens spontaneously and adva nced practitioners can probably choose to create a new body image through visualization. Some claim that those who reside in the more ethereal places seem to use this ability to change shape as a fo rm of artistic creativity. They are said to be able change bodies the way we in the material world change clothes. An example of a change in body image can be found in the section on shape-shifting at this site. However, it is more common to find one's self w ith little or no bodily sensation thus creating the sense of having no body at all than to shift shapes."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"One of the basic lessons learned during spiritual travel is that the soul can take many forms and identities when outside the body. However one generic thing that happens repeatedly is the soul or individual becomes a kind of energy or vibration. The qualities of this difficult to describe \"energy based identity\" differ much like the varying qualities of color and texture differ on the surface of a body of water such as a lake. The surface of the water changes so much depending on the kind of wind and the quality of the natural light as it reflects off the surface. Raymond Moody talks briefly about these altera tions in body image that occur during near- death experience: I have heard this new body described in many different terms, but one may readily see that much the same idea is being formulated in each case. Words and phrases which have been used by various subjects include a mist, a cloud, smoke ‐ like, a vapor, transparent, a cloud of colors, wispy, an energy pattern, and others which express similar meanings. Raymond Moody, Jr. M.D., Life After Life , (Harrisburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 1976), p 50 However, it is important to remember that those undergoing a near ‐ death experience are usually experiencing out ‐ of ‐ body states for the first time. The above terms are descriptive of how such persons felt immediately after their accident or injury when they first found themselves outside their physical body. Spiritual travelers are likely to experience a wider variety of identities than those described as occurring during near ‐ death experience. Generally, this kind of experience is very important for the following reason. Once the individual gets acquainted with this unusual way of being during sp iritual travel, it is not such a big step to mysticism since once the soul b ecomes aware of its own energetic nature and essence, it can approach the mystical areas of light and sound with a sense of relatedness. One form of energy is not so easily alienated by another form of energy, whether in the form of another disembodied individual or a vast ocean of light or sound. This is one way in which spiritual travel in the psychic areas prepares th e individual soul for its encounter with ultimate Truth or God. There are many who write on the subjects of mysticism and meditation who talk of the illusion of separateness, and how true spirituality consists of overcoming this illusion. However, when the individual's consciousness is focused within the body, the barriers which account for this feeling of separation are so lid and substantial. It is during out-of-body experience that the self becomes permeable and can merge partially or fully with other forms of consciousness and states of being. In whatever form the individual takes as he or she experiments, the freedom to vary one's bodily form and identity can be one of the beautif ul and fascinating aspect s of spiritual travel. Shape-Shifting From: The Author's Archives I was once in a dream state and witnessed a bodily transformation. My body changed from its normal form to a shining cross. Immediately, I realized I was out of my body and fully conscious. The"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"cross was similar to two crossed bright white fluorescent bulbs. The feeling was one of great energy and vitality. The cross which was now my body vibrated with an electrical radiant energy. As soon as the transformation occurred, the cross left the ground and began moving through the darkness. Becoming a being of light made me weightless and I literally floated upward moving slowly hovering above the ground. I vividly saw and felt myself to be this shining cross during the experience. This is a case where my new body image during spiritual travel in no way resembled my normal body image. My sense of body consciousness was completely changed. RETURNING TO THE PHYSICAL BODY The Ease of Getting Back to the Physical Body One fear of those considering spiritual travel is that once one's consciousness is outside the body, the traveler may not be able to return. My experience with respect to this concern is that it is quite difficult to leave the body but very easy to return. I have ne ver had difficulty returning. Once out of the body, it is difficult to stay out since there seems to be a kind of gravitationa l pull to return. Two ways of intentionally returning are either to have a strong emoti onal reaction, whether to some event or consciously induced, or to si mply tense up one's being, which reasserts the natural connection to the physical body. One of the reasons I call it travel, is that the individual has gone somewhere new, and therefor e must make the return trip. Both actions usually involve time. It takes a few s econds at most to return to the body. The experience of returning is akin to using a camera to unfocus on a distant object while refocusing on a much closer one. The distan t object blurs out at first and eventually disappears completely as the new one comes into focus. The non-physical body image seems to slowly evaporate lik e water on hot pavement, as the normal physical body image coalesces and takes its place. One of the peculiar things that occurs on rare occasions is that upon return from a spiritual travel experience, the traveler is unable to move any part of the physical body for up to thirty seconds. On these occasions, the sensory nerves seem to work as usual and the traveler can feel every part of his or her body. However, th e motor nerves which carry nerve impulses to the muscles seem to take longer to readjust to the return. This can be disconcerting while it is occurring. However, it is short- lived and the traveler regains control of the muscles after a few seconds. NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE Examples of Spiritual Travel During Near-Death Experience The concept of near-death experience wa s developed by Dr. Raymond Moody Jr. in the 1970s. It was based on interviews with over a hundred (and later more than a thousand)"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"patients who described the phenomenon of leav ing their body during a me dical crisis where they came close to death. The vast majority of the peopl e Moody interviewed had no heartb eat or respiration during the near-death experience, and a few also had no measurable brain-waves at the time. The experiences were based on first- person interviews with the patients as well as the medical staff that were present during the event. M oody considered it important for his study that medical personnel experienced with emergency me dicine were present to verify that the patients were thought to be dead during the pe riod when their NDEs (near-death experiences) occurred. There are two general phases to the NDE. The first phase consists of the person's soul leaving the body and viewing the lifele ss body and its surroundings (usu ally a hospital room or accident scene). The second consists of th e soul entering and passing through a psychic tunnel which ends in another world. Here th e dying person sometimes meets a \"being of light\" and reviews their past exis tence with the aid of this bei ng. At some point the person is told that it is not time to die or makes a consci ous choice to return to life, and the soul returns to the physical body. There are about ten stages to the common n ear-death experience outlined by Dr. Moody. Not every person experiences every stage and it is common for a person to experience only four or five out of the ten. We will list the stages briefly. The first stage is \"hearing the news\". This occurs when an accident victim or patient in a hospital hears someone say \"I think we have lost him\" or \"He is dead\" or words to that effect. This statement describing the person's death is many times the last sensory event a person experiences before the onset of the NDE. The second stage of an NDE is \"t he noise\". This is an unusual auditory sensation experienced by the individual as he or she leaves the phys ical body, and sometimes as he travels through \"the tunnel\" (described later). It is described variously as \"a buzzing sound\", \"a loud click\", \"a banging sound\", \"a beautiful majestic mu sical sound\", or \"Japanese bell-like wind chimes\". Such sounds are many times associated with a feeling of m ovement through space. The third stage is \"the dark tunnel\". There is a sensation of being pulled or drawn through a dark tunnel at great speed. The tunnel is also de scribed as \"a corridor\" , \"a black valley\", \"a well\", \"a sewer\", or \"a cylinder\". One person in the tunnel said, \"I was moving beating all the time with this noise, this ringi ng noise\". Another said, \"I went through this dark black valley at super speed\". The tunnel sometime has a light at the far end which the person moves toward. The tunnel is sometimes perceived as a transi tional experience - as a place between two places or worlds. It overwhelms the senses like a roller coaster, and the person in the tunnel is usually completely involved in the e xperience and can think of little else. The fourth stage is \"being out of the body\". Th is is a complex stage with many elements. The descriptions listed below will hopefully give the reader a sense of how this feels."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The fifth stage is \"meeting others\". This usually occurs either in the tunnel or shortly after the end of the tunnel is reached. The others that are met are usually dead relatives or dead friends. The people are usually supportive and ha ppy, and sometimes the individual helper is only sensed rather than seen. The others are al so sometimes called guardian spirits or spirit- helpers. The sixth stage is the \"the being of light\". This being asks the person to reflect on their life and acts as a guide. He or she is described as composed of white or yellow or clear light that has an \"unearthly brilliance\". The being is supportive and compassi onate and helps the individual review their life. The seventh stage is the \"review\". The review consis ts of a series of pictures or snap shots in two or three dimensions of the person's past lif e on earth. They may be very detailed or show just the highlights of th e life. More important events are examined in greater detail but the whole process proceeds very quickly. Some de scribe having great intuition and understanding concerning their own behavior and the reac tions of others to that behavior. The eighth stage is \"the borde r\". At some point, the dying pe rson understands that it is not their time to die and they must return to their physical body. Th ey see or sense a barrier and have the feeling that if it is crossed, they will die. People undergoing NDEs do not cross the border and thus return to life. It is described as a door or threshold or line which separates those who can return to life from those that cannot. The ninth stage is \"coming back\". People descri be returning in various ways and some do not remember returning but wake up later and remember the NDE. The tenth stage is \"telling others\". Individuals in many cases find it difficult to talk about the experience, and difficult to readjust to their normal lives following the experience. They also find that many of their friends and relatives do not believe that the experience was real. It is characterized as a dream, a fantasy, or an i llusion. Some people cha nge religions, jobs, or enroll in a different program at school. Ma ny emphasize the profound effect the NDE had on them. These are the common stages of an NDE. There has been considerable effort put forth in the scientific community to reduce NDEs to physical changes in the brain and nervous syst em thus denying their spiritual causes. The Reductionist Arguments Explai ning Near-Death Experiences page discusses these arguments in some detail. As mentioned in the introduction, near-death expe rience does not meet our full set of criteria for spiritual travel since it is almost never voluntary (except for failed suicide attempts) and much of the experience is beyond the control of the individual. The descriptions of spiritual travel that occur during near-d eath experience are extremely detailed. People who have NDEs are many times able to describe the preci se conversations of relatives who were in other rooms of the hospital during the experience. Doctors and nurses are many times surprised wh en a patient tells them the exact medical procedures that were used to try and resuscitate him or her. The injured person usually has"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"great concentration while out of their body and can remember the procedures in detail. Such enhanced memory is consistent with the he ightened concentration and clarity that is associated with spiritual travel experience. Here are some examples of NDEs in which i ndividuals experience the out-of-body stage in some detail. A Child's Description of a Powerful Near ‐ Death Experience. A fourteen year old describes an intense NDE he experienced when he was eleven. In a bad accident, he was hit by a car while riding his bicycle, and was taken to the hospital. These experiences were chosen by Dr. Moody to counter the criticism that only adults who were \"socialized\" had near ‐ death experiences. The criticism was an attempt to prove that NDEs were false and only a product of social conditioning. However Dr. Moody countered these criticisms by giving examples that show that children also have NDEs. Another Young Child's Description of a Near ‐ Death Experience. A nine year old girl describes an NDE she had which occurred during her appendicitis surgery. She had complications during the surgery and had to be resuscitated. Entering into the Sacred Light during a Near ‐ Death Experience. This is a beautiful and lengthy NDE which contains many mystical elements, and much detail about the physical events observed by the experiencer while in the out ‐ of ‐ body state. Meeting a \"being of light\" During a Near ‐ Death Experience. A man has a near ‐ death experience in the operating room at a hospital, and while outside his physical body describes his encounter with a \"Being of Light\" . A Swimmer Almost Drowns and Describes his Near ‐ Death Experience. A swimmer lost his strength and describes his near ‐ death experience when he almost drowned in the middle of a lake. A Women Describes her Near ‐ Death Experience, and Watching from a Distance the Efforts by Nurses to Revive her. A women with heart trouble is able to describe in precise detail both leaving the physical body, and the efforts by nurses to revive her while she was out of her body during a near ‐ death experience. All Aditions for this Section: Reductionist Arguments Explaining Near ‐ Death Experiences Providing a scientific explanat ion for the phenomenon of near-d eath experience has been a difficult challenge for scientists ever since da ta in the form of NDE testimonials started"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"appearing in the mid 1970s. Some of the scientific arguments against the validity of NDEs (i.e., that they are only halluci nations) are also applicable to out-of-body experiences in general since out-of-body expe riences are an important co mponent of most NDEs. When examining the Near-death experience, we might first ask the question, \"Why did the NDE concept emerge when it did?\" One explanation is that prior to the 1970s, ambulances were little more than transport services whose personnel had li ttle knowledge of emergency medi cine. The result of this was that most serious injuries resulted in the deat h of patients before they reached the hospital or shortly thereafter. The medical art of resuscitation was in its infancy, and the well known role of the Emergency Medical Technician did not yet exist. Thus, few patients came back to describe their near-death experiences. The la rge amounts of data necessary to develop the NDE concept probably came into being as a resu lt of improvements in emergency medicine. As NDEs became better known, psychologists, phys iologists, and neurologists began looking for ways to account for NDEs using physical and medical explanations. Reducing complex psychological phenomena to simpler material laws and processes is a primary occupation of scientists. The goal is to explai n away the supernatural, and redu ce it to physical causes such as brain chemistry (neural noise, hypoxia, etc. ), psychological states (wish fulfillment or reliving the birth trauma), a nd sociological factors (religious fantasies based on social conditioning). The scientist's refusal to accep t supernatural explanations for natural phenomena has in general been very advantageo us for society, and resulted in many of the advances in material comfort that we see today. Their skepticism is therefore something to be praised and makes a valuable contri bution to the world we live in. However, when it comes to investigating th e events and experiences which occur on the borders of life and death, their standard assumptions and methodologies become somewhat problematic. As with scientific attempts to describe the origins a nd fundamental makeup of matter, seemingly implausable or contradictory claims lead to questioning the basic premises of science when investigating borderline or limin al areas. Such areas of investigation as Near- death experience or subatomic matter seem to defy the clear explanations and rational analysis that are so fruitful in the other more common domains of scientific inquiry. Because NDEs contain so many elements, a numbe r of different complementary explanations are needed to account for this complexity. Bu t in most cases, each explanation focuses on only one element of the NDE and ignores the others. Such explanations use the divide and conquer approach to weaken the overall NDE concept by reducing one of its component parts to physical causes. Here are some common explanations for the elements of NDEs followed by some reasons why these explanations seem implausible or in adequate. The first set of explanations are physiological or medical explanations, and th e second set are psychological explanations. Physiological or Medical Explanations for NDEs The NDE euphoria is caused by hypoxia (lack of oxygen to the brain) The euphoria associated with an NDE is said to come from lack of oxygen to the brain. Such euphoria is identical with the pleasant sensation we experience sometimes when fainting. The most common"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"reason that this occurs is a medical situation known as orthostatic hypotension . Here, a sudden change in the position of the body (such as getting out of bed too quickly) causes dizziness or fainting due to a lowering of blood pressure in the brain. However, the euphoria associated with fainting usually lasts at most a few seconds before leading to complete loss of consciousness. NDE victims many times describe a kind of euphoria of \"being in a quiet and peaceful sp ace\" initially after leaving the body. However, this euphoria usually lasts for longer periods , and does not lead to unconsciousness. Such experience is usually followed by the \"tunnel experience\" or observi ng the events occurring around the body in what many times app ears to last a period of minutes. The other type of euphoria associ ated with NDEs is associated with the \"being of light\" and it also appears to last up to several minutes, a nd does not lead to unconsciousness. Instead, it leads to the \"past life review\". In both cases , the NDE euphoria experience differs in both duration and in what follows from the normal experience of hypoxia. The question also arises as to why most peopl e who have a temporary lack of oxygen to the brain as in the case of those who faint from an intense experience of horror, pain, or fear (neurogenic shock) do not experience NDEs. Shock or the lack of perfusion of oxygen to the brain is very common in many medical si tuations but is not associated with NDE- like experience at all . For instance, patients who sustain a great deal of blood loss but do not stop breathing also have brai ns that are starved for oxygen. NDEs are not associated with such situations. It is only when the heart stops beating and breath ing stops and the body appears to be dead that NDEs occur. This simple observation calls the hypoxia-related theories into question. Finally, the experience of fainti ng (in my own experience) is a state where normal perception (sight, balance, vision) is bl urred and a floating sensation ov ertakes the fainting person. The person usually blacks out and falls to the gr ound as the experience occurs. The detailed analysis, memory, and clarity of perception that occurs during most NDEs seems to be very much at odds with this blurred st ate which borders on unconsciousness. The NDE euphoria is caused by the of secretion of endorphins (natural analgesic or pain ‐ relieving chemicals secreted by the body during physical trauma) Euphoria which is traceable to the secretion of endorphins is an unusual explanation, because at least some endorphins appear to be \"local anesthetics\", and not systemic ones. They are associated with specific trauma local to the injured part of the body. However, if they were released in sufficient quantity and get into the bloodstream to affect the entire body, they could lead to an anesthetic high which might be responsible for the NDE's euphoria. However, as explained previously, euphoria is only one of many elements of an NDE. Explaining one component of the NDE is a long way from explaining the entire NDE. Also, many forms of injury which might result in death (drowning or taking an overdose of drugs, for instance) are not associated with spec ific injuries that would be likely to release endorphins because they are not associated with trauma. Yet NDEs are associated with such medical events. This seems to indicate that e ndorphins are not the sole cause of euphoria in NDEs. Again, this simple observation seems to call all the endorphin-related arguments into question."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The NDE tunnel vision is caused by hypoxia (lack of oxygen to the brain) Jet fighter pilots experience \"tunnel vision\" as they gradually lose consciousness as a result of blood draining from their brains because of the extreme gravity forces generated during flight. Their peripheral vision darkens and blurs while the circle of vision becomes smaller as the pilot nears unconsciousness. However, the pilot still perceives the material world during this experience. The central area of vision that remains still shows the cockpit gauges and the horizon. The person having an NDE, however, perceives li ght at the end of a tunnel, not material reality. The experiences have in common that th e individual has a circ ular visual field, but they differ both in what the visu al field contains (image versus light), and how the visual field changes. While the jet pilot gradually sees the visual field decrease in size to a smaller and smaller circle, the NDE experiences described by those who have had the experience do not mention this gradual narrowing over time. Instead , the field starts out as a pinpoint or small circle, which may or may not increase in size during the \"tun nel experience\". It generally does not decrease in size. In some cases, the light at the end of the tunnel gradually grows to engulf the individual as he or she nears the e nd of the tunnel. The t unnel experienced during an NDE is usually 3-dimensional and surrounds the individual while th e pilot experiences a narrowing of the visual fi eld but not a \"tunnel\". Thus the analogy comparing the tunnel-visi on caused by hypoxia, and the NDE tunnel falls short. There are more differences than simila rities in comparing the two kinds of tunnel experiences. The \"neural noise\" concept is another theory which claims to explain the NDE tunnel experience Noise (neural or otherwise) is by its nature random, and contains no usable information. \"Noise\" is how one scientist ‐ researcher explains the experience of the NDE tunnel. Whether the tunnel is composed of sound with a circular light in the distance, or is just a black vibrating corridor in space, the tunnel experience is reduced to random noise produced by a faltering nervous system. What is unusual, however, is that this tunnel leads somewhere. It leads to anothe r space, or a being of light, or a talk with dead relatives. The \"neural noise\" raises similar questions to the hypoxia theo ry when it tries to explain the tunnel experience. We may ask the question why the random noise of a dysfunctional nervous system does not lead to complete unconsciousness? Instead, it seems to lead to a different kind of consciousness during the NDE. If the nervous system is so damaged as to bring about disorientation and random perceptions of a tunnel of light, why is such degraded e xperience followed by complex detailed past-life reviews and meaningful coherent conversations with beings of light? Why is this noise so symptomatic of a nervous system in crisis many times followed by a dramatic improvement in the patient's mental condition?"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Such dramatic improvements in the brain's c ondition seem unlikely after such a shock yet they happen repeatedly. The failure to answer such questions casts considerable doubt on the \"neural noise\" theory. Also, \"noise\" is by its nature random which m eans it does not follow a ny prescribed pattern. The tunnel experience presents a repeating and very definite pattern which means that the term \"noise\" is not well chosen. Psychological Explanations for NDEs NDEs are religious hallucinations caused by Freudian wish-fulfillment fantasies (Freud thought these infantile longings were the basis for all religious experience) The general notion that all elements of NDEs (and all religious visions) are simply hallucinations is pervasive among psychologists. One common theory is that religious hallucinations are especially likely to occur in adults who are familiar with religious views of heaven. They are more likely to project these views into a dream state or fantasy during an NDE. Freud said that wish-fulfillment fantasies a nd dreams were common in people, and religious experience could be reduced to such fantasie s in less functional adul ts. These individuals could not satisfy their desires in the real would and so retreate d into an infantile world of fantasy where religion promised them eternal happiness. His theories are defined in his book titled The Future of an Illusion . The major problem with the infantile fantasy a pproach is that NDEs hardly resemble notions of Christian or Jewish heaven. Saint Peter, Ch rist, Moses, pearly gates, harp music, and angels with wings are entirely absent (with the exception of a very few who believe that the being of light is Christ or anot her religious figure in spite of th e fact that this being possesses none of the appropriate physical attributes). The NDE might be more appropriate for a believer in Vedanta (a philosophical form of Hinduism) with its emphasis on spiritual light. However, attempts to present NDEs as projecti ons of a Christian or Jewish heaven seem a fruitless endeavor. We will note that Freud viewed al l mystical experience as regressive and infantile, and thus reduced one of the highest goals of religious ma nkind to the longings of a child retreating into a fantasy world in an attempt to escape the painful adult world. The NDE's euphoria is based on a birth memory of peace and satisfaction of the fetus in the womb (Romain Rolland believed that europhic feelings associated with religious experience could be traced to the \"oceanic feeling\" of the experience of the fetus in the womb. NDEs contain such euphoria and the memory of womb consciousness may be the source of this euphoria). A theory related to Freud's psychological theory states that the blissful component of the NDE is explained by a memory (as opposed to a fantasy) of the happiness and peace of the \"oceanic feeling\" experienced by the fetus floating in the womb prior to birth. Romain Roland, a contemporary of Freud, believed that this memory accounted for the joyous sense of oneness with the universe experienced by mystics."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"We will note here that there is some evidence to show that the womb is anything but a silent place. Any pregnant women with a stethoscope can listen and conclude for herself that though the womb may be ocean-like, it is certainly not a silent ocean. The notion that peace and quiet go together and depend on each other does not seem to be supported by the sensory environment of the fetus in the womb. The idea that the womb was peaceful seems to have been based largely on the fact that the fetus had all of its desires met through the sustenance supplied by the umbilical chord, while remaining warm and secure in the womb. But it is an open question whether being withou t desire is truly a state of happiness. The act of becoming satisfied after being hungry or in need may bring a temporar y state of happiness but being continuously satisfied may be described more accurately as a state of peace or detachment rather than the joy associated with an NDE. As for mystical oneness being associated w ith a memory of the womb, very few NDEs involve this complete feeling of mystical transcendence even though many NDEs contain lesser feelings of happiness and joy. We will th erefore not attempt to account for mystical phenomena in our discussion of NDEs. The \"tunnel experience\" during NDEs is caused by the re ‐ experience of the birth trauma (the tunnel is the birth canal, the light at the end is the external world, and the doctor is the being of light) Carl Sagan's theory of reliving the birth trauma seems false based on even the most naive analysis. A child going through the birth canal would be completely blind with his or her eyes pressed against the vagina during the entire birth process. Only when the head emerged would the child see anything at all. The \"light at the end of the tunnel\" experience during the NDE would not exist for such a child during childbirth. The tunnel is sometimes described as a rocking and shaking corridor through which the individual moves during an NDE, but the individual is said to fly at great speed through such a space. The child in the birth canal moves or slides extremely slowly and under extreme pressure. The birth trauma memory analogy is very tenuous. Sagan goes further by explaining that the being of light is a doctor or nurse which attends the birth and first holds the child wh en it is born. Reading descripti ons of this being of light and equating him with a doctor or midwif e is quite difficult to imagine. Drugs as an Explanation for NDEs The web page http://www.skepdic.com/nde.html repeats a common theme that if a drug is capable of producing some of the elements of an NDE, the NDE must be the direct result of changes in brain chemistry caused by the drug. The web page states: According to Dr. Karl Jansen, ketamine can reproduce all the main features of the NDE, including travel through a dark tunnel into the light, the feeling that one is dead, communing with God, hallucinations, out ‐ of ‐ body experiences, strange noises, etc. This does not prove that there is no life after death, but it does prove that an NDE is not proof of an afterlife. The previous sentence is a very strong statement and is also highly dubious. For instance, the history of pe ople claiming that they communed or talked with God, beings of light, or non-physical entities is vast and plays a large role in many of the world's religions. Mediums and Shamans have talked to disembodied entities for centuries, and have been an"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"important part of cultures from ancient Greece to Tibet to modern day America (with its interest in such religions as Theosophy, Scientology, and th e Spiritualist movements). Many Shamans have used drugs to enhance their visi on. Dr. Jansen's claim that he knows that none of the people under the influence of ketamine are talking to such entities has no basis in fact. His belief that such claims are obviously fa lse reveals more about his own presuppositions about the way the world works than it does a bout what is actually happening with his subjects. Dr. Jansen has soften ed his claim about the unreali ty of drug-rela ted experience over the years, but his earlier position is still a popular one in and out of the scientific community. Note that the above statement doe s not say that all or even some of these experiences occur to one individual or that those that do occur appear in a prescribed sequence as often happens in an NDE. It only says that at least one of the above expe riences can occur to a single individual under the influence of the drug. Ketamine certainly does not cause NDEs to occur though it appears to sometimes cause the disso ciation where the mind separates from the body in a way that appears similar to what occurs in many NDEs. It also does not talk about the content of the hallucinations under ketamine influence. Why is it that during NDEs, such \"ha llucinations\" consist of swimme rs seeing themselves drowning. Why do people with allergic reactions in thei r home or children hit by cars while riding bicycles see themselves flying through sp ace following ambulances to emergency rooms? Why do people in hospitals repeatedly watch themselves being given CPR (See: Near-Death Experience for detained examples)? The scientific answer to such que stions brings us back to the projection of fantasy worlds and social conditioning arguments but, as stated ea rlier, if the mind is so good at creating hallucinations of accident scenes, hospital room s, and operating room procedures, why is the same mind so bad at creating hallucinations of God the Father, angels, Saint Peter, Moses, and heaven? The fact that a specific drug can cause \"hallu cinations\" is not a ne w or unusual discovery. Therefore, the importance of ketamine research depends on the quality and contents of the hallucinations and their similarity to the NDE experience if they are to help researchers understand near-death e xperience better. Without precise statistics, it is difficult to know the contents of the hallucinations of patients under ketamine influence but I suspect that th eir subject matter does not mimic the complex, detailed, and highly structured kinds of out-of-body experience s of people who have NDEs. Dr. Jansen, so far as I am aware, does not claim that they do this either. Dr. Jansen does acknowledge some of the limita tions in the present research on ketamine: Unfortunately, the study in which persons who have had NDE's are given ketamine and asked to compare the two experiences has yet to be carried out, although the psychological effects of ketamine have been well documented in numerous clinical studies by anaesthetists (see Domino, 1992). Information in the area of ketamine and NDE's remains largely anecdotal, and some of these references are necessarily to secondary sources. (Reference: http://leda.lycaeum.org/?ID=9260 ) The primary objection to Dr. Jansen's claim is that a drug capable producing such a wide variety of \"side ‐ effects\" is probably not the primary cause of such effects but is more likely an ingredient in"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"opening up a huge area of experience which is difficult to classify. The kinds of experience that results from such a drug appear to be more dependent on personality differences of the people taking the drug than on the drug itself. Similarly, trying to reduce the enormous range of LSD experience to simple categories like \"psychotomimetic\" (imitating psychosis) provides little insight into the effect of the drug because some people become \"psychotic\" while others remain lucid and rational under LSD influence. One stimulus (a drug such as LSD or ketamine) cannot be accurately said to \"cause\" dozens (and even hundreds) of different complex psychological effects which vary greatly from individual to individual. Dr. Jansen's claims are nothing new. LSD e xperience can produce all the experiences (and a great many more) that are on his list for ketami ne. Experimenting with a different drug and repeating similar claims about a range of expe rience associated with it does not in itself provide new information. The above quote from skeptic.com is a good illust ration of this kind of false reasoning which attempts to account for myriad effects which vary tremendously from individual to individual with a single drug stimulus. Aldous Huxley's claims that certain drugs ope n the \"doors of perception\" thus removing the brain's normal filtering of percep tion is relevant here. The fact that certain drugs in certain individuals in certain situati ons permit expanded awareness (or psychotic episodes for that matter) does not mean that they are the primary cause of such awareness or episodes. They may simply remove the barriers to such experience which are normally present. A similar approach postulates that the human unconscious is opened and made available to the conscious mind by the use of such drugs. Drugs such as ketamine and LSD merely provide access to huge areas of the mind th at are normally unconscious rather than mechanically causing illusory perceptions to occur to the individual by altering brain chemistry. Stanislav Grof, the well-known LSD researcher, describes these areas as the \"Realms of the Human Unconscious\". The Fundamental Incompatibility ‐ A Tortured Body and an Ecstatic Spirit The basic quality of consciousness usually desc ribed during NDEs is quietness, peacefulness, clarity, happiness, and wonder, accompanied by excellent memory. A crisis of the nervous system should be accompanied by confusion, disorientation, impaired consciousness, and vague or nonexistent memory. The many positive elements described during NDEs should not exist if the brain is in such a degraded state, if NDEs are only a by-product of brain states. Experiences of life-threatening sickness, weakness, shock, and trauma generally have no such positive elements associated with them . Shock or the lack of perfusion of oxygen to the brain is closely associated with a terrible \"feeling of impending doom\" in the literature. In psychological terms, trauma, danger, and injury may cause the individual to react strongly. These reactions are associated with adrenaline an d the \"fight or flight\" reflex. They ready the individual for dynamic action and movement to increase the probabili ty of survival in dangerous situations. This adrenaline-induced reaction of nervousne ss and high arousal is also inconsistent with the pos itive emotions of an NDE. At bottom, it is quite well known that very sick or injured people do not feel at all well. It might therefore follow that the most profound el ements of NDEs are not the result of the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"sickness or injury but instead arise from a set of causes unrelated to the state of the physical body. NDEs are very positive and joyous even when the physical body and brain are in their very worst condition. Science and the Necessity of Explaining the NDE Phenomenon The fact that many scientists take many of th e explanations listed above seriously seems to indicate that they are in a \" holding pattern\" waiting for a better explanation to emerge. In the mean time, they feel the need to say some thing about the NDE phenomena, and the above theories represent their best efforts to date. The strong desire of scientists to explain out-o f-body experience in scientific terms is best illustrated in a report that received world wide in terest in and out of the scientific community. Olaf Blanke, a neurologist at the Geneva University Hospital in Switzerland, made the \"discovery\" while performing surgery. He stimul ated the right angular gyrus, a small region in the brain's right hemisphere, of a wome n and triggered out-of -body experiences. The patient told doctors, \"I see myse lf lying in bed, from above, but I only see my legs and lower trunk.\" Subsequent zaps with the electrodes were reported to replicate the effect. Normally, for a scientific experiment to be worthy of mention, it would require rigorous design and execution followed by a careful analysis of the results. In most cases, it would need to be performed on a number of patient s, and a double blind approach would be taken that involved patients who would be given placebo drugs or stimuli. This makes sure the results were not spurious and attributable to something other than the specific intended stimulus of researchers. In Dr. Blanke's case, we have a situation wher e one or more doctors in teracting with a single patient inadvertently applied a stimulus (stimula tion by a electrode to th e brain) and \"caused\" an out-of-body experience. The patient was also prone to \"a brain disorder that causes seizures\", and therefore not an ideal subject for such an experiment. The credibility of the patient was not questioned, and it appears that an earlier milder stimulus did not cause an OBE but only a change in body image where th e body image was distorte d in the patient's view (the arm and legs were first shortened and later appear ed to be flying up towards the patient's head). Finally, having read many out-o f-body experience descriptions myself, I have never read about one where only half the person' s body (the lower half in this case) appeared. The patient's preception seems quite confused and distorted when compared with more common out-of-body experiences where the person sees his or her entire body. Here, we have only this unteste d hypothesis appearing as the pr imary subject of articles in scientific journals. The fact th at such a haphazard event was treated as science and given so much media and scientific atte ntion shows how heavily invested the scientific community is in their reductionist worldview.

From: A Talk on Her Near-Death Experience By Renee Paraslow"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Baha'i Faith Educational Series Video Tape Reno, Nevada 1989 This is the full text of a near-death experience which happe ned to Renee Paraslow as a teenager. She had the experience when she lost consciousness after she had an allergic reaction to some f ood that she ate. It is unusual because in addition to containi ng many of the classical elements of an NDE, it also contains mystical elements normally not associated with near-death experience - an encounter with and immersi on into spiritual light. After Renee fell unconscious, her mother's first thought was to put her in the car and bring her to the hospital. But since Renee was not br eathing, she decided to lay her on the sidewalk and wait for an ambulance to arrive. A crow d then gathered around Renee's swollen body. Renee describes her experience: I only became aware when I heard the very loud sound of the fire engines arriving... I heard my best friend from elementary school calling to me. She was calling, \"Renee, don't die, don't die Renee\". And I heard this and it seemed as if it was in a foreign language to me, and I finally computed the meaning of this and I realized that my life was in danger, and I had an obligation to fight for my life because of my mother and my friend, because she had such terror in her voice that it cut through to my heart and I tried to fight for my life, but the battle became overwhelming. At this point I just surrendered myself, my soul, to the power that brings us all into existence and that gives us all life, knowing that this was the source of all life and the way of all things, and I surrendered to that and I en tered a state of peacefulness... Then, like that (clapping her hands ) I became like a ball of light or energy in the midst of this crowd that was circling the body. I became massive ly aware, unlike any awareness I had had during physical existence, because I was aware r eally not of myself. I was aware of everyone around me. I was aware of my mother and my ne ighbors, and my friends and the firemen and what they were thinking and what they were feeling and what they were hoping and what they were praying. This was such a pummeling i nput of emotion and information that I was at once overwhelmed and confused, and rather disoriented. I followed their attention to something on th e sidewalk and I looked at this body on the sidewalk, and I looked at the curve of the wris t bone, and I recognized that and I remember looking at it and thinking \"that looks so much like my wrist bone\". And then I became aware that that thing on the sidewalk, that thing that suddenly became a piece of meat to me, was what I had identified as myself before, a nd I had no connection with this thing on the sidewalk other than that I had been with it for a very long time, but it had nothing to do with me because suddenly, I was more a person than I had ever been; I was more conscious than I could ever be; I was free of the limitations of being a physical being. I looked at this body and I was repulsed with the grief and the tumu lt around it and by the very idea that I had ever considered something physical to be my reality, to be a human reality."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"And with that (taps the table) again like th is, I bumped way up, up above some light wires and from that point I could watch everyone bene ath me, but I was not as closely associated with them so I was completely feeling ever ything they were fee ling. And I watched my mother and a boy come out of the house up the hi ll that I could not have seen physically, and I watched the fireman. And I was very sad for my mother; I was very sad for my friend who kept calling me, and I was very said for the ch ild who had come out of the house, and I was very sad that he would think this was death... And so my concern was for them and I spent my time observing them and calling to them, calling to them that everything was as it should be, that everything was fine, that I was free, that it was wonderful; that I l oved them and that they loved me and that that bond, unlike physical bonds, would never be destroyed... I tried to communicate this to them over and over ag ain, and I realized th at I had no mouth, I had no body, that they could not hear what I wa s saying to them, and that I would have to leave them in the same hands I had le ft myself in the process of dying. And with that I turned away, just sort of like a ball, just turned away. My attention turned away lovingly but knowing that there was nothi ng I could do, I turned away from them, and began to pull up, and became aware, it was as if I were a camera on a space ship or something, I became aware of our place, my partic ular little street and then my particular little town, and I kept pulling up and pulling up and pulli ng up to a point where I could observe the whole earth a nd this was wonderful! Because the earth was alive and the earth was singing, and it was si nging a single song, and in that song everyone had a voice. Every human being had a very important note to add to this precious song of the earth. It was a song of love and every living being had something to add to the song of earth, and ev ery one of these essences wa s very much connected. I was seeing it not like we see normally. I was seeing it both from a macroscopic (from the point of view of the spaceship) and from a microscopic va ntage point. [It was] microscopic in that I could see that amoeba in the ocean was connect ed to the song of the heart of all humanity, and that this world was responding to the song in our hearts in a miraculous and unified, and beautiful way. And I too began too sing I wa s so overcome with joy. It wasn't a song obviously with the mouth. I had no mouth. I had no body. I simply was. But I became a part of that song and very full of joy that I coul d have something to cont ribute to this sacred beauty of our earth, and our planet and of all people. I became very aware that we as people have a unique influence on the world even if we are not actively doing something. We influence this planet by our state of being. We influence this planet very positively if we are filled with love and respect for others or negatively if our hearts are negative. At this point I became aware that there was a light calling me from somewhere else, and I entered what people speak of as the tunnel. I wi ll speak of it as that although I did not quite perceive it as a tunnel. It was a transition place where I became aware of other beings who seemed to be rather disoriente d, rather confused and lost a nd some of these beings were moving through to their home. I simply wanted to go home."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"I moved through this place and I became aware that I was not moving like we move physically. When we move physically we have an intent, we have a goal, and we move step by step to that goal. But what moved me through this place where I was aware of people who were not moving through and were somewhat confused, what m oved me through this place was love. It was the love of God, and the love all things sacred and all things beautiful and all things just, and I could go on and on and on but this was what propelled me on was my connection and my affection for God. As I came to the end of this place, I wondered if I would be alone, a nd just like that I was with, I was one with my uncle, just like we we re two lights that were put together. [We were] one red and one blue that made purple light, a nd I was aware of things about him that I had never been aware of in life. I didn't spend much time with him and I didn't know him well. He lived in the south and I lived in California But it was a very joyful reunion and I became aw are that he was concerned that I was there because he communicated to me instantaneously that my mother could not stand the loss of a child, and he was confused, and yet he kne w that everything was as it should be. The Light From that point I became very a ttracted to the light and this a ttraction was like an irresistible magnet... I loved that light I loved what was pulling me home. I moved past my uncle into what I can best define as a sea of light. It wa s as if every atom in the universe had been electrified with color and light and sound, but mo re that with totally unconditional love. And it was a welcoming to me, and I dove into this ocean with each moment with each movement, feeling more rapture and more joy and mo re just absolutely unspeakable love. As I moved through this sea, I became aware I was moving to th e center of the sea of light which I perceived to be, how could I say this, as if you were an gnat and you were flying into the sun, and that is the perspective th at I had for this sea of light. And then in a instant, again like a clap, I ente red into this light and I became one with this light, and of this light, and no longer an individual, no longer a person, but simply a part of this light. I became like the phoenix. I was destro yed, and it was the most blissful, the most excruciatingly beautiful moment th at I could imagine. It seemed to me to be the apex of all existence to get to the point where one was no more. One simply was a part of this light. After being in this state for what seemed to be a time beyond time, I was gathered again together like sands from the s hore as an individual and I was ca lled to recount for my deeds. Renee at this point describes a number of things she was shown such as a group of individuals on the earth she referr ed to as \"the just\" who were working towards the unity of mankind instead of focusing on divisions like ma ny countries and religions do. She describes seeing groups of individuals sh e \"knew as well as here own parents\" who were living and working in other non-physical worlds. She then describes an encounter with \"a being of light\" who showed her various elements of her past past life and reviewed them with her. She talks in ge neral terms about how little acts"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"of kindness were far and away more important th an the activities we usually give so much value to in normal life. She describes how the most positive thing she di d was to give special attention to a not so lovabl e boy at a summer camp so that he would know he was loved. During the review, she said this act of kindne ss was more important fr om her viewpoint of expanded awareness than if she had been pres ident of the United States, or the queen of England. After the life review, the being of light told he r \"it was not time\" for her to enter that world. She then described returni ng to her physical body: I was catapulted back down what I did perceive to be a tunnel this time, down a rainbow tunnel of light and sound and vibrational frequency of love and with a terr ible hard crash, I became aware of the scene I had left earlier - the fire trucks, and now an ambulance had arrived, and there were men who were pickin g up the body and loading it into the ambulance. And I wa s in a state of complete grief. I felt that I had become Eve and wa s cast out of the garden of Eden. As I was descending down this tunn el, my heart was already attached to my home beyond. And I was beggi ng not to leave. And I crashed down into this plane of existen ce and was suddenly confused by time and space. It was as if I had never existed physically. And I was suddenly disoriented. And my concern was for my mother, because she was by herself and sh e was losing a sixteen year old daughter, and she knew that this was happening because the ambulance attendant looked at the driver in front and said \"DOA, DOA\" which means of course dead on arrival, and the driver turned off the siren and slowed down the ambulance. Before, he had been driving in a very reckless manner. We were coming out of the mountains. And as he did that, my concern was for the pain of my mother. I simple wanted to comfort her, to wrap my soul around her. And to assuage the loss of a daught er, the loss of a child, and found myself simply praying for her. I followed the ambulance to the ho spital and I watc hed as the body was unloaded, and my mother followed the gurney into the emergency room. And I watched as the first doctor went to work on me. I wasn't particularly interested in the first doctor because the first doctor had that day been through mo torcycle accidents coming out of the mountains, and he had been through a very long day, and he was not concerned with someone who had been brought in dead on arrival. And he had no connection with me, he didn't care, he had no affection. So I had no interest in watching what he did because my interest was based on affection and love. And I then left the emergency room and was above my mother and was above some friends who had followed them into the other room. And I again tried to communicate with them. I tried to let them know that this was a very joyous occas ion and that I was dead on arrival"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"and hopefully all would go well and they would never be able to revive me. And I was going to be dead now. And death had become life to me. Death was not something to be frightened of but something to look forward to. What happened then was the first doctor pronounced me dead and was sending the body off to the morgue, when my own personal physician who was a country doctor and a very gruff man stormed into the emergency room in a t uxedo with his black bag. And he looked at the nurse on the phone w ho was calling the morgue, and looked at the doctor who was wash ing his hands, and looked at the [covered] body and said, \"what the he ll happened here?\" And he said, \" where is the patient?\" They said she was dead on arrival and he said, \"the hell she was\". And he proceeded to scream at the other nurse who was sort of standing off in the corner \"I want injections of adre naline, and bring them to me immediately and come ov er here and assist me\", and he began to go to work on the body. He began to beat on the chest and began to shock. I was simply terrified by this turn of events and disgusted that they w ould treat a body so brut ally. All of a sudden I sort of became protective towards my body, even though I wanted nothing to do with it, I began to be protective. They could at least be nice about it. But they were beating on the ch est and shocking the body, and I was up in the corner of the emergency room accompanied by other essences who were keeping me c ontained in that emergency room. And this seemed to go on for a very long time until my doctor stopped and asked if there was a car diologist on duty. And they said there was no cardiologist on duty, an d I [telepathically] heard-felt my doctor thinking about injecting my heart with adrenaline, and this was something I had never heard of before - it seemed a barbaric and brutal and appalling thing to do, a nd I was just repulsed by the very idea. But there was no cardiologist and my doctor was swearing at the nurses that that should happen and decided that they would try one more time - that they would give up to six shots of adrenaline. Now the other doctor started arguing with my doctor that this was a dangerous thing to do - to try and bring me back now because there could be brain damage, and I was brought in dead on arrival and it was best not to do that and that he could do terrible damage trying to revive me. And my doctor looked at him and said, \"what the hell, she can't be any worse off than she is already\". Renee goes on to describe how she di d finally return to her body as a result of her doctor's last effort to revive her.

Meeting a \"being of light\" During a Near ‐ Death Experience. From: Life After Life Raymond Moody, Jr. M.D., Life After Life , (Harrisburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 1976), pps 63, 64 I knew I was dying and that ther e was nothing I could do about it, because no one could hear me . . . . I was out of my body, there's no doubt about it, because I could see my own body there on the operating room table. My soul was out! All this made me feel very bad at first, but then, this really bright light came. It did seem that it was a little dim at first, but then it was this huge beam. It was just a tremendous amount of light, nothing like a big bright flashlight, it was just too much light. An it gave off heat to me; I felt a warm sensation. It was a bright yellowish white - more white. It was tremendously bright; I just can't describe it. It seemed that it covered everything, yet it didn't prevent me from seing [sic] everything around me - the operating room, the doctors and nurses, everything. I could see clearly, and it wasn't blinding. At first, when the light came, I wasn't sure what was happening, but then, it asked, it kind of asked me if I was ready to die. It was like talking to a person but a person wasn't there. The light's what was talking to me, but in a voice . Now I think that the voice that was talking to me actually realized that I wasn't ready to die. You know, it was just kind of testing me more than anything else. Yet, from the moment the light spoke to me, I felt really good - secure and loved. The love that came from it is just unimaginable, indescribable. It was a fun person to be with! And it had a sense of humor, too - definitely! A Swimmer Almost Drowns and Describes his Near ‐ Death Experience.

A Women Describes her Near ‐ Death Experience, and Watching from a Distance the Efforts by Nurses to Revive her. From: Life After Life by Raymond Moody, Jr. M.D., 1975 I turned over and as I did I quit breathing a nd my heart stopped beat ing. I heard the nurses shout \"code pink, code pink\". As th ey were saying this, I could feel myself moving out of the body sliding down between the mattress and THROUGH the rail on the side of the bed. I started to rise slowly. I saw the nurses running into the room. I felt as though I was a piece of paper floating up to the ceiling. I watched them reviving me from up there. I heard the nurse say \"Oh my God, she's gone\", while another l eaned down to give me resuscitation. I was looking at the back of her head as she did this. I'll never forget the way her hair looked, it was cut kind of short. Just then, I saw them roll th is machine in there and they put the shocks on my chest. When they did, I saw my whole body just jump right off the bed, and I heard every bone in my body crack and pop. I thought \"why are you going to such trouble, I'm just fine now.\" SPIRITUAL NAVIGATION Changing Course in the Spiritual Worlds The methods of moving between st ates and navigating within the psychic and spiritual worlds vary enormously. Here the author hopes to prov ide a sampling of the various methods used to successfully change states while doing spiritual travel. Most of the following deal with altering lucid dream environments. This activit y is a natural first step to overcoming the limitations of the dream state in preparation fo r more advanced forms of spiritual travel. One of the classical ways of na vigating is through the use of mantra . Repeating certain spiritual words has a way of directing the soul towards certain destinations. This is discussed in greater detail on the page titled Surfing the Mantric Wave Visualization of specific images can have a similar effect. One practice illustrating such visualization is described briefly on the Tibetan Dream Yoga page. This page illustrates an Eastern method but the Christian traveler can as easily practice the visualizations from the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ig natius of Loyola or visualize im ages from Ezekiel's vision of heaven from the Old Testament. One of the functions of a spiritual pr actice is to create these spiritually charged symbols (prayers, mantras, or religious imagery) so they can be used effectivel y to direct the soul towards spiritual states when the opport unity arises during spiritual travel. Spiritual travel"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"provides a unique means and opportunity to explore transcendent states of consciousness but it is the traveler's religious system th at determines the spiritual destination or goal of spiritual travel. The best way to navigate is to have a guide that knows the territory who will assist the traveler, but this is not always possible. However there are al so advantages to discovering things for oneself, since it makes the traveler more independent and capable of standing on his or her own. It is good idea to be open to accepting guidance and even to mentally invite helpers or guides who can assist you if you get into difficult si tuations while doing sp iritual travel. Though such helpers may be unseen, that does not mean that they are not present a nd able to assist the spiritual traveler when called upon to do so. Here are some simple methods that can be used to break out of or increase freedom in a lucid dream environment. Breaking Out of a Lucid Dream by Experimenting with Matter We normally believe that matter obeys certain laws, and breaking those laws is a means of breaking out of a common lucid dream state. Doing a Spiritual Practice During Spiritual Travel Simple spiritual practices such as mantra meditation can have dramatic effects when practiced during spiritual travel when the same practice will have little or no effect when done during normal meditation. Breaking Out of a Lucid Dream by Experimenting with Gravity Flying, while not an advanced spiritual state, can be one of the joyous and liberating aspects of spiritual travel for the beginner. Breaking Out of a Lucid Dream using the \"Skipping\" Method Skipping is the process of using mental expectations to change environments during spiritual travel. All Additions for this Section: Surfing the Mantric Wave Mantras are a common method used to reach destinations during spiritual travel. Mantras in my limited experience are a somewhat advanced form of spiritual travel suited to those who are capable of traveling in a disembodied state (without bodily sensations or body image). Practicing mantras during spiritual travel has the effect of moving the soul through different inner spaces much like a surfer rides a wave. They provide a definite sense of continuous forward movement with the mantric vibration or current acting as the basis of propulsion. The author will attempt to describe elements of travel by mantra but as with most deeper experience, the words simply fail to convey the experience."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"One curious thing about travel by mantra is th at though the mantra is being silently chanted by a single voice (the practitioner's inner voice), the mantric sounds often seem \"larger\" and more all pervading than sounds a single voice could normally produce. Instead, they sound as if they are being intoned by a c horus of voices. This creates the sense that the traveler is not riding the mantric wave or current alone. The wave therefore seems more like a bus than a single passenger car with many beings ridi ng together through a common environment experiencing the same scenery. In my experience, mantric spaces usually have no horizon and as such are more like moving through an underwater environment than moving through a normal atmosphere. The spaces have different textures, densities, and em otional qualities which create varying background sensations that permeate the space. These qualiti es naturally also determ ine the sensations of those traveling through the space. The visual component may also vary but a complex visual field of changing patterns and colored lines (sometimes in 3-D) is one cl ass of imagery that is familiar to me. The author has experimented with different mant ras but the one that seem ed to work best was the one that had been practiced for many hours in normal meditation. Much positive emotional and spiritual energy had been poured into this sound duri ng meditation, and the mantra seemed to function like a batt ery storing the spiritual energy. As a charged religious symbol , it therefore had the power to move me into and through radically altered states of consciousness when other less familiar mantras had much less effect when practiced while out of the body. My intuitive sense is that those who are more familiar with disembodied states of light and energy use mantras the way we in the physical world use vehicles to take them to many destinations in the inner worlds. However, mant ras are used to traverse dimensions in the psychic and spiritual worlds ra ther than streets an d highways in the physical world. Many of these mantric roads are ancient pathways created by spiritual e xplorers eons ago. Another function of mantras somewhat unrelated to spiritual travel is that mantras can link individuals with gurus, entities, and gods. The empowered mantra given to a disciple during a spiritual initiation when repeated can act much like dialing the number of a being in the inner worlds. The being may not always answer but the line is there, and communication can occur over the line once the lin k is established. The question also arises as to what mantra to us e in spiritual travel. In general, the mantra or prayer chosen needs to come from the spiritu al tradition the practitioner follows. For those with a yogic orientation, using simple Sanskrit ma ntras (sometimes one syllable) is effective since they are sounds that are understood to originate in high spir itual planes, and will therefore draw the practitione r towards those points of origination. Names of deities or buddhas, or names of respected livin g or inner spiritual guides can also be used as mantras. This is especially true if the practitioners has an inner or outer relationship with one of these beings. Simple prayers such as the \"prayer of the heart\" from the Eastern Orthodox tradition, or phrases from Psalms or the Lord's Prayer can also be repeated, and they can function as mantras. Again these names or phrases will act as powerful symbols since they usually have very positive spiritual associa tions for a person practicing th e religious tradition connected with these deities, guides, or prayers."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Once the person has even a little experience with riding these mantric waves, he or she is presented with a new way of being that is not easily forgotten. The me thod of using mantras to travel is an advanced form of spiritual trav el since it requires consid erable concentration. It is good to be able to experience this method of travel but the r eal challenge is to catch the wave, and then ride it long enough and with enou gh determination and skill to reach spiritual states of cosmic light and sound. This is the goal of the true spiritual traveler who by wisdom or by grace hopes to touch the infinite. Travel by mantra is perhaps the be st way to direct the soul toward specific destinations in the psychic and spiritual universes. The experience of travel by mantra also justifies using the term spiritual travel rather than more generic terms like meditation or contemplation. This is because the phrase spiritual travel is much mo re phenomenologically descriptive of the actual experience than these other two less specific terms. As with all spiritual travel practices, it is impor tant to emphasize that mantras should be used only for ethical purposes that further the prac titioner's knowledge, or for helping and healing others. Tibetan Dream Yoga The tradition of Tibetan Dream Yoga described by Evans-Wentz in Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines (London: Oxford University Press, 1935) is a good example of a practice that uses conscious visualization of sacred images or symb ols to bring about mysti cal states in dreams. Dream yoga is one of six subtypes of yoga elab orated by the Tibetan guru Marpa and passed down by his well-known disciple Milarepa. The practice has a number of steps, which permit the individual to gradually gain increasing amounts of control in the dream state. First, the individual must become luci d or wake up in the dream state. Second, the dreamer must overcome all fear of the contents of the dr eam so there is the realization that nothing in the dream can cause harm. For instance, the lucid dreamer should put out fire with his hands and realiz e fire cannot burn him in the dream. Next the dreamer should contemplate how all phenomena both in the dream and in waking life are similar because they change, and that lif e is illusory in both states because of this constant change. Both the objects in the dr eam and objects in the world in the Buddhist's worldview are therefore empty and have no s ubstantial nature. This is the stage of contemplating the dream as maya , and equating this sense of maya with everyday experience in the external world. ** Fourth, the dreamer should realize he has cont rol of the dream by changing big objects into small ones, heavy objects into light ones, a nd many objects into one object. He should also experiment with changing things into th eir opposites (i.e. fire into water). After gaining control over objec ts and their transformations, th e dreamer should realize that the dreamer's dream body is as insubstantial as the other objects in the dream. The dreamer should realize that he or she is not the dream body. While this realization is very difficult in"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"normal waking existence, presumably it is quit e obtainable in the dream since the dreamer who has control over dream objects could, for instance, alter the body's shape or make the dream body disappear all together. Finally, the images of deities (Buddhas, Bodhisattvas , or Dakinis) should be visualized in the lucid dream state. These figures are fre quently seen in Tibetan religious art ( thangkas ) and used in meditation. They are said to be linked to or resonate with the clear light of the Void. They can therefore serve as symbolic doorways to this mystical state of being (the Void or clear light). The dreamer is instructed to concentrate on these symbolic images without distraction or thinking about other things so th at the revelatory side of these symbols will become manifest. We will note here that some of the early pract ices of dream yoga where the yogi tests and alters the dream reality were done spontaneously by the author before being introduced to the formal practices of dream yoga. Some exampl es of the practices done are listed on the Spiritual Navigatation page . ** Note: The notion that dreams and everyday experi ence are similar in nature is best understood by Westerners by examining the conc ept of \"idealism\". The philosophy of idealism says that all experience is deliver ed to the individual vi a the brain and nervous system, and is therefore a pr oduct of the mind. Idealism (better termed \"ideaism\") characterizes all sensation as i ndirect mental representations or \"ideas\" rather than direct experience of an external or objective world. Without the brain and nervous system, such experience would not exist. All experience, bo th ideas and sensations are therefore metal phenomena. In this way, everyday material exp erience is very much like dream experience. . Charged Symbols Paul Tillich, the 20th century Protesta nt theologian, defined a symbol as something that points beyond itself . Symbols are unique mental objects wh ich have no fixed referents. They can be contrasted with signs which have fixe d meanings. Symbols are described as layered, multi-valent, multi-dimensional, or multivocal (Victor Turner's term). Their personal meanings and interpretations evolve to refl ect the evolution of th e individual, and the meanings of cultural symbols that are shared evolve as the culture changes. Symbols are complex because they have different meanings that change as they are explored. The figure of Christ has meant different things to different people at different times. For instance, Christ was characterized as a warrior during the crusades going in to battle to defeat the unbelievers. In the early 20th century, he was characterized as a businessman and the perfect salesman and marketer, a union organize r and a friend of the working man during the rise of unions, and a strong athlete who coul d fast and control his desires through physical and mental discipline as preachers focused on th e masculine virtues of Christ. Jesus is both the ideal capitalist and socialist depending on differing interpretations. In the early medieval period, Christia n Neoplatonists saw Christ as the logos or \"divine mind\". Here, God the Father was infinite bei ng or awareness which supplied the light and power of creation. Jesus as logos was the set of archetypal patterns or templates that took this"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"power and created the \"world soul\" or Anima Mundi realm where living things such as plants, animals, and humans came into being. The Holy Spirit was God's presence that infused matter and living things. These th ree abstract entities were \"per sonalized\" by later Christians, and became the basis for the three persons of the trinity. For many early Christians, Christ symbolized the divine intellect and salvation was attained through wisdom rather than faith. This abstract and universally creative function of Christ diffe red greatly from the incarnate Christ who served as the ethical model for th e path to salvation popul ar in more modern interpretations. These examples all illustrate how broadly the symbol of Christ has been interpreted over time. Symbolic statements such as \"Christ is the Light of the World\", \"In the beginning was the Word\", and the necessity of having faith the si ze of a mustard seed also have different possible meanings and interpretations. Literal in terpretation of such statements renders them absurd, and metaphor is a dangerous slippery sl ope that threatens those who believe the Bible or other holy book must be literally true. Symbols are dynamic as they grow and reinvent themselves. Symbols can be looked at as ha ving a spatial dimension. As one layer of meaning is peeled away or shed, another comes into view from behind the first one. Symbols also have a volume dimension. They are receptacles that \"h old\" meaning and power for the individual. The more power they hold, the more they become holy and a focus for prayer and contemplation. As they gain power, they also provide motivation and inspiration for religious individuals and groups. A symbol is multivocal because it communicat es different things depending on where the individual is on his or her spiritual journey. Symbols may be said to speak to people in much the same way that sacred scripture becomes like a living thing when religious people are able to enter into a kind of contempl ative dialogue with the text. Symbols also have a vitality dimension. Symbols ar e in a sense alive. When a symbol fails to hold power, it becomes dead or meaningless. Religions can be looked as sy stems of symbols. Whole cultures evolve as newer symbol systems replace older ones. No one believes in the Greek or Babylonian gods any more. They are part of dead symbol systems (and therefor e dead religions). Many of the symbols from mainstream religions such as Christianity a nd Buddhism derive from religious narratives describing the activities of founde rs of these religions and thei r disciples. For instance, the life of Christ is turned into a set of symbols in the Catholic Ch urch's stations of the cross, which distill the major events in the life of Chri st into a set of fourteen images. The Buddha's life is also captured in a set of images docum enting his adventures in some Tibetan Thangkas, and the incarnations of the god Vi shnu appear in depictions of th e \"ten avatars\" in Hinduism. A charged symbol has power and is alive with meaning. Symbols may be charged spontaneously, and have power when first en countered. This often happens in religious conversion where an individual finds him or hersel f irresistibly attracted to a religious figure or symbol system, and converts to a new religio n. Symbols may also become charged as an individual uses them in prayer and medita tion, and directs attention and positive emotion"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"towards them as part of a spiritual discipline or search. Such charge d symbols can be very valuable when the individual directs atten tion towards them duri ng spiritual travel. One extraordinary thing about sp iritual travel is that religi ous people who adopt a spiritual practice involving contemplative prayer and meditation do not have to wait until death to perceive the power of the symbols that they employ in their practice. They can get glimpses of the value and power of these symbols here and now which can be very motivating and inspiring. Contemplating a charged symbol while in an out-of-body state can be much like stepping into a whirlwind of powerful forces. The individual is pick ed up and carried to mysterious and extraordinary st ates of consciousness with the symbol acting as the method of transport. The symbol can function as the ke y that opens the door to a sacred reality. The Downside of Losing Symbolism One trend seen in modern religion is the idea that there is one literal interpretation of scripture on which all reasonabl e people will agree. Passages from sacred texts are many times highly symbolic and multidimensional containing many possible interpretations. However, scriptures are being fl attened and frozen into a single interpretation by authorities that know, for instance, what the Bible lite rally means. The other common levels of interpretation including the allegorical, ethical, and mystical interpretations are denied and suppressed. The first result of such an approach is that the authority of preacher s who claim to know the correct interpretation is vastly increased. Th e twin doctrines of literal interpretation and inerrancy (the Bible is one hundred percent true, perfect, and without error) give vast authority and credibility to those professiona ls who preach the true word. The individual believer's power is in equal measure lessened. The second result of this con cept of literal interpretation is that it leads to an over simplification of religion where only a short list of \"fundamentals\" are deemed important. This occurs because the same confidence that leads people to claim to know exactly what the Bible means also makes them certain that they know which parts are most important, which parts can be ignored, and what needs to be done to gain salv ation. In this environment, simplified stripped down religion tends to become a formula. Here a personal relationship with the divine is reduced to uttering a prescribed set of phrases, which when spoken sincerely and correctly become a ticket to heaven. Salvation is achieved by employing a simple ritual formula. When such formulas are treated like life preservers thrown to the drowning, they are grasped so tightly by the individual that they become an excuse for some to stop growing spiritually. The formula for salvation is repeated over and ov er again as if it were some sort of magic charm for luck and protection. Once the formula is accepted, the practi ce of religion becomes primarily the task of getting othe rs to subscribe to and repeat this same formula. Thus we see the emphasis on evangelism. Being certain about one's salvation because ther e is faith that sins are forgiven lays the foundation for a happy life and a joyous self-confi dence. It is difficu lt to fault anyone who seeks such assurance in their sp iritual life. The people who seek this kind of security and the church leaders who try to provide it are sincere and honest in their effort s to create a viable"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"religious tradition that can sta nd against the many challenges to religion posed by the modern world. However, there is a hidden or dark side to such an approach. When one has the ultimate answer which is distilled in this simple formul a, why continue to seek and ask questions? For some, spiritual growth or the process of sa nctification becomes irre levant and unnecessary. For others, when salvation is cer tain, religious practices can be put aside. Still for others, when forgiveness of sin is assured, ethics can be put aside, and this ca n be very dangerous. If all sin is forgiven, committing anothe r sin is not such a bad thing. This is especially true if the ultimate goal of the sin has a higher purpose. This \"end justifies the means\" type of morality has been responsib le for much of the evil and suffering in the world because it sugar coats evil making it appe ar virtuous, and having some religious or idealistic goal. The more grandiose the goal, th e greater the dishonesty and cruelty. Thus we have religious \"stealth candidate s\" who lie about their true vi ews running for political office and judges seeking court appointments that avoi d answering questions that will give a true picture of who they are and what they think. We also have religious leaders making claims that Christianity is a religi on of war and vengeance, who advocate torture of enemies while they claim to follow Christ who told them to \"l ove their enemies\". On a more subtle level, we have clearly biased religious authorities with limited educational backgrounds making dubious pronouncements on matters of history and science. Certainly not everyone takes these approaches but many seem to be attracted to these fundamentalist traditions because of them. Modern religions that take the twin approaches of the certainty of salvation and of all sin bei ng forgiven are seeing increased membership. The richness and beauty of religious te xts become sterile and dry as monolithic interpretations are accepted by whole church councils, denominations, and congregations. Agreements arise on what and how people must believe in the name of group unity, or faith, or security, or salvation. Some protestant denominations that protested the authority of the Catholic hierarchy in the reformation so that each individual could become his own priest have now taken on different aut horities in the form of church conventions or charismatic preachers who tell them the true and only interpretation of the Bible. Formerly congregational churches where the local church members decided doctrine are being pressured by interchurch hi erarchies to adopt the true interpretation or be expelled. Authoritarianism is ascendent, and the individua l is expected to adapt and conform to the group. Fortunately, Bible study group s, where people are sometimes encouraged to discuss differing interpretations, run counter to this trend. These group interpretations have the virtue of clarity and simplicity, and can be very helpful, but they are only a point of departure on an individual spir itual journey, and not a final destination. Those who tell people who are at the beginning of a journey that they have already reached their final destina tion do them a great disservice. These group interpretations also have the dis tinct down side of crea ting tendencies towards a \"fortress religion\" where everyone who does not believe the proper interpretation becomes a threat or an enemy or of the devil. Religi ous communities, which should be cohesive based on bonds of love, can shift the basis of this co mmunity to bonds of fear and hatred of the outsider. Having the correct relig ion combined with its correct interpretation has been the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"basis for many religious wars in the past, and could easily become the basis for another wave of cultural and religious wars in the future. It is the deeply symbolic nature of religious texts and imagery, and the inability of some religious people to accept th e pervasive ambiguity of a re ligious life based on shifting meanings and interpretations, that is the sour ce of these fundamentalis t revivals. In this situation, scripture becomes history and its symbolic doorways can become closed and locked. The revelatory nature of symbols requires that their meanings change in order for the symbols to function as doorways to the sacred. The literalist is continually ca ught in confusion trying to make clearly symbolic statements sound literal and fighting to give them only one interpretation. Ironically, the Book of Revelation which is among the most highly symbo lic books in the Bible is one of the most important texts for most Christian literalists. Similarly, those who treat the Bible as a kind of divinatory text which predicts what has happe ned in the recent past, and what will happen from now until the rapture are on very shaky ground. The dense forest of symbolism which must be crossed to understand, for instance, who is the Antichrist, what country will produce him, and the states that will be at war during th e end times is anything but literal. People who claim a literal interpretation as they wade thr ough a sea of symbolism seem to simply have forgotten what the term literal means. The literalist is also largely cut off from th e power of sacred symbols and therefore from religious experience. This bei ng the case, the individual turns to external authorities for guidance. Faith-based religions which rely most ly on external authorities are excellent places for the autocrats and the power hungry to gain foll owers because it is easy to gain the trust of those that consider faith a saving virtue. Religious language is easily learned and easily manipulated, and con artists have been us ing religion for centuries to swindle the unsuspecting. Perhaps even more dangerous is the sincere but confused religious pers on who as a political leader uses religious ideals to convince others to support polic ies motivated by ethnic, class, nationalistic or personal ambition. Medieval history describe s a long series of popes, bishops, judges, inquisitors, muftis and ayatollahs em ploying crusades, church courts, jihads, and pogroms to carry out war, torture, murder, and mayhem in the name of religion. Mixing politics and religion sooner or later creates a toxic brew. Those who believe the two should be mixed need to look closely at current and pa st theocratic governme nts and the injustices they promote. Religious people with political pow er often take on a tribal iden tity, and tribal societies often persecute outsiders and look upon them with distain. Tribalism is corrupting to religious people because it focuses their attention on their enemies instead of their ideals. To become a member of a tribe is to have one's identity defined by what one hates or fears most. To identify with a tribe is to surrender the religious life to the secular, and become truly \"of the world\". Sadly, it usually takes many years for those who mix politics and religion to notice the corruption and cynicism it breeds in their ranks. Eventually th ey discover they are not the victors but rather the losers w ho have sacrificed their religiou s ideals and values on the altar of political power and expediency."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The lack of personal religious experience forces the individual to substitute various things for the ultimate reality as God becomes distant a nd weak, and requires defenders and religious warriors. The \"render unto Caesar \" biblical quote is completely ignored as religious leaders seek to become \"players\" on the political stage with \"a seat at the table\" of power figures. Religious individuals come to distort religion • by focusing on the rapture and the end-times, and how those outside the faith will suffer during this period • by joining \"culture wars\" to fight the forces of evil that are believed to threaten society • by falsely claiming to be threatened minorities and demanding special protection and consideration when th ey are, in fact, members of a majority with considerable political power • by distorting science and investigating theologically based theories that can never be disproven • by transforming religious congreg ations into political action committees • by rewriting history to support a religious world view based on nationalism and the pride of be ing a nation \"chosen by God\" • by making claims about the Bible being against abortion when the concept of abortion is not menti oned in the Bible at all (although Exodus 21:22 says that if men cause a women to have a miscarriage, then they have to pay a sum of money to the family - they are apparently not accused of murder for killing the unborn child but of theft of an object of value, and are required to pay a civil penalty in the amount determined by a judge to compensate the family). • by forcing religious rituals and proc lamations into secular schools and courtrooms • by claiming that abortion is killi ng an \"innocent child \" when nothing is clearer in Christian th eology (from both Augustine's Catholic doctrine of original sin and Calvin's Protestant doctrine of \"total depravity\") that the child (born or unborn) has original sin - the child is therefore not innocent but inherits the \"sin of Adam\" and is thus guilty) • by claiming that state-supported religion is fair when the vast majority of funds go to one's chosen religi on, and the money is given with no audit requirements to determin e how the funds are spent This external and highly politicized approach to religion fills the void left when direct spiritual experience is impossible, and reli gious symbols become signs devoid of real spiritual power. For the spiritual traveler, religi on is much more than having the right beliefs, or a supportive community who all believe th e same thing as you. It is about employing belief and ritual to generate charged religious symbols which can open up deeper layers of realty so that faith matures into direct spiritual experience. Breaking Out of a Lucid Dream by Experimenting with Matter From: The Author's Archives "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"I woke up in a dream, and looked around trying to decide what to do next. I was in a dimly lit room and the environment had little to interest me. I decided to try to experiment with the \"matter\" in the environment. I walked over to a plaster wall and pushed against it knowing it was not physical, and was therefore subject to unusual behavior. As I pushed, my hands and then arms penetrated the wall followed by the rest of my body. I was standing inside the wall, my body merging with the \"material\" structure of it. There was a slowness and heaviness to movement while merged with this object similar to being under water but offering more resistance. It was a curious and surprisingly energetic sensation as if my atoms and the wall's were buzzing around and energizing one another. The altered state of consciousness was a pleasant and novel experience which I perceived as a form of expanded consciousness. For those who are a little less daring, these travelers can experiment with putting a hand or arm into the wall to get a feel for both the buzzing energetic quality of the sensation and the plastic nature of the dream's material form. Entering fully into the wall is one way to erase one's dream body which is something sometimes done in dream yoga as a step towards freeing oneself from the limitations of the dream state. This kind of experience is a small example of the kinds of education that occur as the traveler encounters new realities in the inner worlds. Doing a Spiritual Practice During Spiritual Travel From: The Author's Archives I found myself awake in a dream and decided to experiment. I sat down to meditate and quickly decided on a spiritu al practice to see what effect it would have. I repeated the mantra OM only two or three times out loud in my out-of-body state. Almost immediately, the whole atmosphere became char ged, and I experienced a floating sensation. I vividly felt my body begin to radiate a strange invisible power as if I became a powerful transmitting tower for some invisible radian t energy. The mantric sound echoed all around like a great echo chamber. A short time late r, I was back in my body lying in bed. Breaking Out of a Lucid Dream by Experimenting with Gravity Flying and the feeling of defying gravity is one of the joys of spiritual travel. One of the ways of breaking out of a limited stat e (especially a lucid dream) du ring spiritual travel is to experiment with the freedom of flying. I suddenly woke up in a dream and was determined to change my state of mind and take advantage of the possibilities. I started running a nd as I ran, I began taki ng larger and larger steps. Soon I was leaping ten or twenty feet per step until finally I was airborne and no longer contacting the ground. I was amazed to see gold en fields, sections of trees and rural"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"landscape with great clarity while moving at ex hilarating speed with the air whistling past me. At a certain point, I was skimming the treet ops feeling the top bran ches just touching me as I flew past. I was flying over woods a nd fields brightly l it with golden light. I had chosen a creative method of leaving the ground and had gained a level of freedom that would probably not have occurred had I stayed in the initial lucid dream environment. Another easier way to initiate flying is to find a high spot such as a cliff or the roof of a building and simply jump off it. This works s uprisingly well but it re quires the traveler to have overcome the fear of being hurt in th e inner worlds. It takes some time to be comfortable and secure enough to initiate flying in this way. Breaking Out of a Lucid Dream using the \"Skipping\" Method From: The Author's Archives One method of meditation usable in spiritual travel is the practice I call \"skipping\". This involves shifting (or skipping thro ugh) environments during spiritual travel. This method of meditation is quite dynamic and is possible b ecause in the psychic ar eas, thoughts have much more power than they do while in a normal waking state when the physical senses and body consciousness seems to weigh them down (this is why it is important not to think negative thoughts while in an out-of-body state). When \"skipping\", the traveler can literally ju mp from one space or world to the next. The experience is much like tuning in a station on the radio. The person symbolically moves the tuning dial (some symbolic action like a nod of th e head or shutting and opening the eyes will do) with the intention of changing states (stations). The tr aveler must have associated the symbolic act with the expect ation of movement earlier a nd be prepared to use it. When the act is performed, there is static or noise (a intermediary state of formlessness and disorder) for a second or two as the transition takes place. Then the traveler \"lands\" on a new station (i.e. in a new environment). The next step is to direct the movement toward some desired state or place. This requires discipline, patience, and practi ce. However, this method can be used to skip out of an uninteresting dream environment to some place more interesting and spiritual even if the traveler is unable to pick the destination. SPIRITUAL MATTER The \"material\" Nature of Some Non-material Worlds One of the fascinating elements of spiritual travel experience (out-o f-body or lucid dream experience where there is a spiritual goal) is the material side of the psychic or non-physical worlds. While out of the body in non-physical en vironments, one experiment the spiritual traveler can perform is to closely examine the properties of the \"matter\" encountered. The surprising thing is that if the spiritual tr aveler in an out-of- body state or lucid dream environment examines and analyzes non-mate rial objects closely, they have the same qualities as physical objects. If one looks at objects in an attemp t to determine if one can tell"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"the difference between an object in the inner world and a physical objec t, it seems impossible to tell the difference. I would pick up an object, examine it visua lly, tap it, feel its texture and weight, examine its hardness, or my reflection in it, all in great detail. If I was not intending to change the object in any way, it almost always appeared to be an everyday physical object. Recently, I examined the shoes I was wearing while in an out-of-body state in a dream environment. They were made of medium brow n suede and try as I might, one could not find anything unusual about them. I felt the texture of the suede, and looked at the stitching and the way the piece that held the l aces was attached to the body of the shoe. I used to work with leather and was surprised at the fineness of th e \"workmanship\" on these nonmaterial shoes. In a similar situation, I examined my hands feeling the fingers and watching them move as I made fists and then opened my hands repeating the activity over and over again. My spiritual fingers, hands, arms, and wrists worked as expected with each movement creating the appropriate corresponding internal sensations. Some time ago, I was in a jungle environment, a nd the sharpness and clarity of the vegetation was equally apparent. I examined how the light reflected off and filtered through the leaves in this tropical dream environment. The inability to distinguish between materi al and nonmaterial objects also holds for individuals. At one point, I was conscious in a dream and met a small girl and looked into her eyes intently. She seemed, at least on the surface, to be a normal child that one would meet in the physical world. I was interested in seeing if I could sense a consciousness in this child. As I examined her closely, she seemed to be looking back at me just as if it were a normal interaction between two peopl e on any street corner. The traveler can determine through this kind of experimentation that there is no obvious way to distinguish physical objects and, to a lesse r extent, individuals fr om nonphysical objects and individuals. The senses give the same impressions in spiritual travel or OBE environments as they do in the physical world, each sense (sight, sound, and touch) corroborating and confirming a consiste nt view of the object or person. Though the traveler knows with complete certainty that the dream object is not real in the conventional sense of being made of phys ical matter, it stil l appears real. The realization that inner environments can ap pear in every detail as real as physical environments is another important lesson that spiritual travel teaches . The implications of experimenting and learning such a lesson have a vast reach that affects philosophy and religion in countless ways. Philosophical and Religious Issues For instance, in the area of re ligion, this discovery has imp lications for those who wonder about life in heaven and hell, or any non-physical or spiritual environment. If the objects in the mind can appear completely real while also being non-physical, the notion of an afterlife where beings live in environments much like physical environments se ems quite plausible. Individuals could exist in an afterlife in teracting with familiar objects and normal environments without ever even cons idering them alien or peculiar."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Another religious idea that can be explored in relation to lu cid dreaming is the concept of creation with respect to the notion of design. Th ere is a medieval argument for the existence of God that is best summed up by the follo wing 19th century pholosopher's statement: \"If you find a watch on the road, there must be a wa tchmaker somewhere.\" Similarly if you find a complex universe, God must have designed it (thi s is Saint Thomas Aquinas' \"argument from design\"). But in a lucid dream, one can find e normous complexity and detail where objects and people are not designed. They just appe ar. Some might say th ey are designed by the unconscious mind but the concept of design seem s to require a rather extreme form of attention to detail and consider able planning. The concept of de sign seems antithetical to both unconsciousness and the unconscious mind. In the lucid dream as with the material world, we have objects with a complexity that far outstrips anyone's ability to create or design them , yet they appear anyway. There seems to be creation or design but without a designer. This puts the lucid dream reality in the same category as physical or objective reality where either God \"des igns\" the dream environment, or its complexity spontaneously grows (or evolves) out of the cosmic material or spiritual soil like a plant. Whether the lucid dream is a pr oduct of material or spiritual reality, its complexity of design offers the same challenge as the physical world in terms of looking for a explanation of how this complexity arises. In philosophy, the father of modern philos ophy in the West, Descartes, developed the foundation for our scientific world view by em phasizing rational anal ysis and pointing out that mathematics was the key element in unders tanding the material world. He did this by making a distinction between the mind and the b ody that continues to influence the way we see the world. This mind-body dualism is echoe d in such oppositions as heaven/earth and spiritual/material. This fundamental dualism of Western philosophy is based on the following two elements. The first is the realm of the mind (which canno t be measured or has no size or extension) which is the realm of thought (and perhaps heav en). The second is the world of the body (or matter) which is the realm of things (which can be measured and are therefore the objects of scientific investigation). Based on our previo us discussion, an argument can be made that there are indeed \"things\" in the realm of the mind and it is not just a place of pure thought. If this is true, the classical distinction no longer applies and much of the analytic reasoning that tried to understand the world in terms of this false distinction loses it power to persuade. The experience of lucid dreaming could have changed the course of Western philosophy by seeing the mind as not only the location of thought s but also a place of \"material\" things that stimulate the inner senses and present a cohesi ve realm of being parallel to the physical world. The classical mind-body dualism where the thoughts of the mind stand in stark contrast to the measurable things of the physic al world seems to blur and even dissolve. Most of today's philosophers are materialists who do not believe in dualism at all since they believe that only the material world exists a nd the mind is a by-product of the physical world and derivative in nature. However, in the pa st, when philosophers were less interested in language and more interested in truth and the \"love of wisdom\", such observations might have seriously affected their world view and by shared intellectual inheritance our collective Western world view."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"William James, the psychologist and philosopher of religion who wrote The Varieties of Religious Experience proposed extending the empiricism of his day (empiricism holds that the best way to understand the nature of reality is through the five senses) to embrace a wider arena of experience. He proposed a radical empiricism which extended empirical data beyond the physical or biological senses. He said that the study of religion and psychology should include sense data from the inner senses and the ar eas of dreams, visions, religious experience, and psychic phenomena. The author's approach to spiritual travel accepts this notion of \"radical empiricism\" and denies the typical empirici st's approach which excludes such data as illusory, too difficu lt to study, or not worthy of study. What is difficult to accept is that those doi ng brain research (psychologists and neuro- physiologists) could believe that the physical brai n is so complex and sophisticated that it can create entire inner landscape s and interactive three-dimens ional worlds involving all the senses all by itself. This seems more plau sible when in a normal dream state where the process goes by as the dreamer sits passively li ke when watching a movie. In such a state, there is very little analytical skill a nd the powers of perception are dimmed. However when the full light of consciousness (luc id dreaming) is brought to the dream world, and the individual is able to closely observe and analyze the environment, the inner world looks less like an illusion of the brai n, and more like a stand-alone world - a completely separate and parallel reality to the physical world. SPIRITUAL TRAVEL TECHNIQUES Methods and Techniques to Induce Spiritual Travel The methods of leaving the physical body are varied, and different methods work for different individuals based on the person's temperament. The ones below have worked for myself to different degrees. However, it is important to be creative and feel comfortable with the method used. The most important thing is to get interested in the technique and play with it. Play is characterized by relaxed concentration. Generally, the thing to avoid is tension and struggle since this usually rivets the soul to the body. Maintaining a strong sense of expectation during the day that one is cap able of leaving the body or waking up in a dream is helpful. It also helps to get extra sleep since it seems that most individuals require a cer tain amount of time to dream in a normal or semi-conscious fashion in order to purify the unconscious and process the day's events. Getting additional sleep beyond the minimum required makes add itional time for more conscious or lucid dreaming to occur. It is also important to remember that seeki ng out-of-body experience is part of a spiritual search and a stepping stone to spiritual awarenes s. Therefore any religious activity or practice which sharpens awareness and draws the attentio n away from material goals or objects such as meditation, prayer, devotion, service to ot hers, going to church, mosque, or temple, reading spiritual books, or doing yoga will improve the probability of having a spiritual travel experience. Doing practices that are intended to induce out-of-body experience are meant to supplement other more conventional spiritual practices. The time and effort spent doing such practices"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"can be very worthwhile because having out-o f-body experiences can provide vivid evidence of a spiritual or supernatural world that is distinct from the physical world. Personal experience is many times more convincing than relying on the experiences of others. Such experience can therefore serve as a counterweig ht to the overwhelming materialism of the present age. An interest in spiritual travel experience need not be the primary focus of one's spiritual path. As mentioned in the introduction, sp iritual travel is a tool for th e spiritual seeker. Efforts to induce spiritual travel experience can be an important component of a larger set of spiritual practices because having just a few spiritual travel experiences can provide a powerful justification for living a spiritual life and a dded motivation for adopting a regular spiritual practice. There can be a synergy between spiritual travel practices and more traditional religious activities where each supports and reinforces the other. Spiritual travel also makes th e spiritual quest into a dynamic, interesting, and adventuresome process that helps overcome the dullness and re petition that can be associated with both traditional religious ritual and many secular activities.

New age followers often say that they are interested in spirituality and not religion. Implicit in this approach is the view that traditional religions are lifeless, antiquated (appealing only to previous generations), and rejecting of direct religious experience. Modern religion became more rational as it pr acticed the \"social gospel\" to compete with science for relevance to modern life. Rational religion emphasized uniting and renewing communities, and supported ethical or servi ce activities for improving the world. Church meetings and picnics, running religious schools, hospitals, and soup k itchens, and converting nonbelievers to the true faith in order to a dopt them into the group became the dominant religious activities. Such modern community oriented ideals and act ivities replaced the patristic and medieval monastic ideals of seek ers going into the wilderne ss or monastery cells to seek visions of God. People seeking direct insight into the Truth, the nature of God, or being itself were forced to look outside religion. They became spiritual seeker s rather than joiners of traditional religions where faith was the primary religious virtue an d direct experience was an impossibility (the time of prophets was over). An exception to this trend was the Christian Pentecostal tradition which emphasized personal experience of the Ho ly Spirit. Pentecostalism is a recent addition to Christianity and has only entered into the cultural mainstream in the last decade or two. Religious seekers were interested only in spir ituality, and not religion. Much of their seeking activity involved spiritua l practice (individual prayer and me ditation) rather than liturgy. The primary community for them became the New Age seminar rather than the church meeting. When they were quasi-religious, they were nondenominational accepting religious symbols and narratives pragmatica lly. If a symbol or a particular wo rld-view from a religion or self- help philosophy worked to produce a greater insight, di rect religious expe rience, or personal growth and satisfaction, it was adopted. When it stopped worki ng, it could be discarded and another substituted. Religions and religiously orient ed philosophies became like suits of clothes to be worn for a while, put away in the closet, worn again, and finally thrown away when they became stained, moth eaten, or no longer stylish. The philosophy of Spiritual travel pres ented at this site tries to find a middle ground between the spiritual and the traditional religious world-views . Spiritual travel focuses on a practice directed towards a class of expe rience called out-of-body experience, which is"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"extremely broad. It then narrows the field by requir ing that the ultimate goal of such travel be spiritual experience. It thereby avoids th e goals of some psychics who use out-of-body experience to seek primarily power, excitement, entertainment, or authority over a group of followers or students. Spiritual travel therefore satisfies the New Ag e individual's desire for practices that seeks direct transcendent religious experience. However, the spiritual goal requires the kind of spiritual framework and spiritual symbolism that is embodied in traditional religious systems to support and en able the spiritual traveler to reach this spiritual goal. This encourages the i ndividual to return to tr aditional religions and their symbols, and to look at these symbols in a new and expanded way. The religious symbols become doorways to spiritual or heaven ly realms, or ladders through the heavens. In many traditional religions, the doorways had become locked and considered dangerous. Even for more experientially oriented believers such as Pe ntecostalists, these doorways are closed because they focus on immanence (the Holy Spirit comes down to earth), which usually excludes transcendent religious experience. During sp iritual travel, the doorways function in the ways they were intended to function. They open up the heavenly worlds to the traveler. In support of more traditional religious loyaltie s, it is important to adopt a symbol system, and work with in a consistent way in order that it may become charged and alive with meaning . It can then function properly during spiritual travel. It is therefore important not to change religions lightly. Consistency is a virtue in religious practice, and too much change is a threat to empowering the prac titioner's chosen religion. Religi ous conversion can still occur as the individual evolves and changes, but t oo much mixing and matching can drain the life out of spirituality, even as it has the virtue of educati ng and expanding the individual's knowledge of other cultures. For those who are a ttracted to more than one tradition at a time, this consistency can also be f ound in following a consistent spirit ual practice even if it mixes symbol systems. In the above-mentioned ways, the philosophy of spiritual travel uni tes the function of spiritual travel (direct trans cendent experience) with the forms of religious tradition (scripture, ethics, relig ious symbolism, group ritual, and narratives) to produce a unified whole - a means of access to tr anscendent religious states using the mechanism of out-of- body experience. There is a synergy between the two where bot h support each other in a mutually beneficial way. The spiritual travel approach makes one requirement: that all religions be respected as valuable and useful pathways to the heavens . This is religious universalism. This has the effect of limiting the religious ly based conflict between cult ures, which leads to war and strife. Using this approach, cultures may be s till in conflict but they cannot use religious ideals to justify and exac erbate such conflict. The use of spiritual travel in traditional religions will certainly be a source of change. This is especially true in Western religions where divine revelations have ceased, and the cannon (inspired scripture) is closed or finished. Spiritual travel will lead to visionary experience which will effectively reopen it."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Creative Visualization When I was young, I used to love trains. In my travels to visit relatives, I would be a passenger and visit large railway st ations and see dozens of different trains from all over the United States. The colors, the smells, the por ters and brakemen and travelers, and the enormous thundering vehicles all serv ed to stimulate my imagination. Sometimes I used to visualize the various trai n cars designing the contents of the sleeper, diner, passenger, entertainment, and lounge ca rs. I would create my ideal train on the way into sleep. I would move from car to car describing and visualizing elements of the environment such as seating, windows, and the colors and textures of surfaces. Sometimes, I would find that my dream would ta ke up where my visualizations ended and I would continue designing and ri ding that ideal train during the dream. Because I entered that dream state while involved in a creative ac tivity, I would sometimes find myself in an expanded state of awareness and able to control the progress of the dream to varying degrees. These visualizations and the resulting dream expe riences were antecedents to spiritual travel. Getting involved in a visualizati on that crowds out al l other sensations on the way into sleep is one way to initiate spiritual travel. Creative interest in a subject matter is in many cases a less stressful and more enjoyable method of enteri ng into spiritual travel states than alternate approaches such as concentration exercises. Painters and musicians can compose canvases and musical scores using much the same technique. Dynamic Visualization involving Movement The experience below resulted from attempting to stay conscious on the way into sleep. If the practitioner is able to stay conscious and become aware during this transition, the kind of dynamic visualization used below can be a means of leaving the body from this intermediate state. Note that running was the method used but any activity that the practitioner is familiar with and finds easy to visualize would be appropriate. I had been thinking about spiritual travel a nd reinforcing the exp ectation that it would happen. I was in the early stages of sleep so mewhere between waking and sleeping. I became conscious that I was lying on my back but feeling very little sensory input from my body. I became aware that I might be able to leave the body from this state. I then imagined myself running and immedi ately found myself outside the body running towards a bright white marble wall made of large tile-like square sections with a black sky in the background. After a few moments of runni ng, another transition occurred. I found myself soaring high in the air towards a beautiful large city on the banks of a dark lake. The city was constructed of this same white marble in s quare sections. The place was built up with larger rectangular buildings towards the center and sma ller ones along the edges. It had an ethereal quality due to the lighting which appeared to come from the buildings themselves or from some invisible light source. The background was wa s very dark as was the lake before it. The feeling of flying was exhilarati ng and the city was majestic."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The decisions to try running was a method of doing a \"dynamic\" visualization involving movement which had the desired effect of blotting out other physic al sensations and precipitating spiritual travel. Meditation on Inner Lights Contemplating inner lights can be a method of leaving the body. Those who are familiar with meditation on the energy center usually known as the spiritual eye located between the eyebrows may be familia r with the cobalt blue light that sometimes appears in the inner field of vision. It usually appears as a amorphous blob of light slowly changing shape with blue concentric circles emanating from it slowly. The circles expand hypnotically resembling something akin to broad smoke rings expanding from a central source. This kind of light (whether blue or another color) can serve as a focus of meditation either while sitting in disciplined meditation or while dosing off to sleep. On occasion, the light can draw the travel er out of the body and he or she will be instantaneously flying at a fant astic rate of speed through a powerful force field following the light. It seems that the light recedes as the tr aveler moves towards it with its center still radiating the rings. Such experience demands a tenacity to hold on to the center of concentration since the powerful forces can be di stracting. If the traveler is able to maintain concentration, the scene will tend to shift to a stable environment like a dream environment. However, unlike a dream, the traveler will be fully conscious and able to direct the experience from that point. The point here is to illustrate the importanc e of meditation on these inner lights and to know that the appearance of imagery of this sort can be a form of \"inner invitation\" to do spiritual travel. Focusing Attention on the Screen of The Mind From: How I Learned Soul Travel Terrel Wilson, How I Learned Soul Travel (Minneapolis: Eckankar Publishing, 1987), p. 148 The author recommends persons doing this ex ercise wake themselves up by alarm clock or other means in the middle of the night or earl y in the morning. At th is point, the person should splash some water on the face to bri ng some mental clarity. The following exercise can be practiced anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour while laying on one's back. The author had considerable success in leaving the body on the way into sleep when using this method. Note that the same exercise ca n be done at the beginning of a ni ght's sleep but is more likely to result in just passing in to sleep due to tiredness. With eyes closed, take a couple of minutes to relax the whole body, then rotate the eyeballs upward, far enough to cause a slight strain on the muscles around the eyes. This points the inner vision towards the forehead; then focus it upon the black inner screen. Do not try to"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"drift into sleep at this point, just try to keep the attention focused in this manner. Whenever the mind wanders, simply retrieve it and start ove r again. Listen to the faint high whistle in the top of the head, and place a seco ndary attention on listening to it. Think of the high whistle as a sound current flowing upward through the physical body and out the top of the head at a certa in spot about two inches just in back of the top center. Let the sound lift the inner vision upwar d in a relatively natural way. Gently stop focusing on the inner vision on the blackness of the inner sc reen; doing this any longer can prevent sleep. Instead just keep a peripheral awareness at abou t the location of the spiritual eye in the inside of the forehead, in order to keep the black screen close to the inner point of vision. Eventually, you will slip uns uspectingly into sleep. Improving Visualization Skills Visualization plays a large part in the variety of methods us ed to induce spiritual travel. Improving one's ability to visualize will tend to improve the likelihood of spiritual travel. However it can be a difficult practice especial ly for westerners who are used to constant physical activity. Attempts to perform the inner practice of visualizati on are often interrupted by a variety of distractions. The following practice can be effectively used to take advantage of the goal oriented nature of westerners. Those who are \"task oriented\" and are most able to concentrate when there is a specific job to perform. This visualization involves choosing a job a nd visualizing all the subtasks required to complete it, one by one. It is best to choose so me activity that one is familiar with which can be completed in a period of fifteen to thirty minutes. It should be a neutral or enjoyable job, easy to visualize, and have enough variation to stave off boredom. One somewhat neutral example is painting the side of a house. The worker first visualizes getting the paint, la dder, brushes, roller a nd drop-cloth from a tool shed. The drop-cloth and ladder are positioned. Th e paint is opened and placed in the rolling pan. The worker climbs the ladder and begins painting, moving the ladder, and repositioning it as necessary as the work progresses. The pr ocess continues until one side of the house is painted. Then the tools are cleaned and put away, and the visualization is complete. Any activity is possible such as playing a s ong on an instrument, painting a picture, or mowing the lawn. Visualizing less goal oriented \"play\" activities is also possible such as skiing, or hitting a tennis ball agai nst a wall but in thes e examples, the lack of a clear goal can sometimes lead to boredom a nd a loss of concentration. The key here is to improve one's ability at visualization and do it in a relaxed and concentrated fashion. The act of visualizing a cr eated world so clearly and completely that it replaces all other physical sensations is one method of i nducing a spiritual travel experience. Focusing on Dreams"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Many of the techniques mentioned at this si te revolve around increased consciousness in dreams. A very effective way of breathing life in to the dream world is adopting the discipline of writing down dreams. Dreams are valuable because they permit the drea mer to examine the contents of his or her personal unconscious and interpre t dream symbols to discover hidden conflicts that can then be exposed to the light of waking awareness. Th ey reveal to us our personal weaknesses, our blind spots, and our unacknowledged pain from th e past. Thus, dream analysis can be a form of spiritual purification. However, apart from this psychological functi on, dreams also represen t an entrance to the vast realms of the human unconscious that are accessible through spiritual travel. This consists of both the personal unconsciousness with its layers of conflict and unfulfilled need, as well as the deeper layers of the self which contain a broad variety of transpersonal psychic and spiritual states. To direct attention towards dreams is to focus the waking awareness on these areas and give them value and importance. Writing down dreams informs the deeper self th at the dreamer cares about the unconscious and the variety of states it co ntains. It enlivens the uncons cious contents and increases awareness in dreams. Increased awareness in dr eams can lead to lucid dreaming and spiritual travel. Writing down dreams draws the dreamer's attention to the subtle elements in dream experience that permit the individual to recognize what his or her dreams are like. To become familiar with the contents of one's dreams also increases the probability that a dream will be recognized as such, and the dreamer will wake up. There are many difficulties and challenges to be confronted when keeping a dream journal. A first step is choosing a place to sleep one or two nights a week where the dreamer can do writing upon awakening without disturbing anyone else. The person keeping a dream journal should go to bed early with the journal at the bedside. The mental reminder that the dreamer will remember and write down the dreams upon awakening should be given before going to sleep. A small nightlight is helpful to see enough to write in the journal but not so powerful as to shock the journal writer into consciousness so he or she cannot go back to sleep afte r adding an entry to the journal. Keeping a dream journal represents a quantitive shift of attenti on from the outer to the inner life. It can be a useful tool in improving the dreamers ability to do spiritual travel. As dreams become clearer, the person can extend the reminde r to include the direct ive that the dreamer will awaken in the dream and do some activity that will lead to an altered state of consciousness (spiritual travel). Getting in Touch with a Spiritual Guide Visualize a dim room containing a large blue sapphire, its facets gleaming and shining cobalt blue light which bounces off the walls of the room. In your mind's eye, see yourself walking towards the sapphire and as you near it, you perceive it as a transparent three dimensional blue doorway. You "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"walk through the doorway and within the facets you see a chrome ladder reflecting the blue color around it. You step up to the ladder, and begin clim bing it rung by rung. As you near the top, you see that it opens into a snowy nighttime mountain scene. When your eye level reaches the top rung, you see a mountain landscape with a crisp but not cold breeze blowing through the pine trees. You continue to climb and step out into the snowy terrain gazing down the slope of the mountain. The whole environment is lit by a blue sun that sheds its light across the landscape giving it a grey-blue cast. You walk up a small hill and notice a bench wh ich looks down over a partially cleared snowy slope. You sit down gazing at the blue sun shin ing rays overhead agai nst a blue-black sky causing shadows where the pines grow. You listen to the sound of the breeze amidst the pine needles and feel the fr eshness of the air. Next you issue a invitation to your spiritual guid e to join you. You may see, him or her, or perhaps just feel the guide sit down next to you on the bench. Strike up a conversation asking the guide for advice or assistance on the spiritu al path. Ask for guida nce and protection in dreams or talk about whatever concerns you spir itually. Ask for guidance in spiritual travel and write down any suggestion you receive. If th e guide gives you a name or spiritual word (mantra), remember it and use it in future se ssions to get in touch with him or her . Climbing the Stairs to the Top of the Lighthouse Light is one of the most powerful and universal spiritual symbols. Meditations on light are therefore part of many religious traditions. This kind of meditation will not relate specifically to spiritual travel experience but meditation on light has the effect of loosening the ties that bind the soul to the body. It is therefore good preparation for spiritual travel. The first visualization involves visiting a lightho use. Visualize yourself standing at the base of an east coast lighthouse in the shape of a tall cylinde r as can be seen in pictures taken in the coastal areas of Virginia and the Carolinas . Walk up the steps onto a concrete base and enter through a door at the bottom of the structure. Once inside, visualize a set of sp iral stairs leading to the top of the lighthouse. In the dim light, you grasp the railing and begin climbing. As you slowly move upward, step by step, you spiral around counting perhaps a hundred step s to the top. As you approach the top, you begin to see flashes of light which grow brighter, They ar e coming from th e bulb through a huge lens which directs the beam out over the ocean to warn ships of danger. The reflective unit that emits the light at the top of the lighthouse revolves once every second or two emitting a blazing ray as it faces you for a brief moment. You stand watching the light revolve being blinded as the light briefly shin es upon you and then continues its revolution. The idea is that you briefly experience a very br ight light perhaps like a flash bulb but lasting perhaps a half second which fills your being, and then recedes only to come around again a few seconds later. You visualize being filled w ith spiritual light periodically for about ten minutes. One can prepare for this visualization exercise by glancing at the sun for a half a"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"second a few times with the goal of remembering what a very bright lig ht looks like. Then it will be easier to visualize the light house's light during the meditation. You can change the speed of the light's revolut ion, the period the light faces you directly, and the color of the light from white to golden to cobalt blue. Other options involve shining the light towards a part of the body su ch as the heart, the head, or another part of the body that requires healing. The lighthouse meditation can also be a med itation on compassion. In this case a mirrored heart is visualised in the chest which absorbs and reflect s the beam while creating a strong feeling of love and compassion. This feeling radiates from th e heart along with the reflected light. To end the meditation, you slowly walk down the stairs to the base of the lighthouse and exit through the door. The med itation ends here. Counting Your Way into Sleep This exercise involves counting as one goes to sleep. The first step is to choose a number based on how sleepy you feel and decide that yo u will be asleep by the time you get to that number. If you are sleepy, choose the number tw enty but if you feel more awake, you can choose a higher number like fifty. The next step is to tell yourself that you will wake up as soon as you enter the sleep state as the number is reached. You can suggest an environment that you will wake in and visualize it , or simply choose to be standing in the r oom next to your bed out side of your body. Then begin counting your way into sleep. Some may prefer to count backwards down to zero since it takes a bit more concentration whereas counting forward is automatic and does not require much attention. But counting in either direction will work. Kinetic Visualization Much of the problem with meditation based on Ea stern techniques is that it does not appeal to Westerners who tend to have active minds. Me thods which focus on, for instance, counting the breath tend to produce sleep and boredom in such people. Visualizing movement is one active method of visualization which may help avoid the problem of boredom. Try the following me thod to improve visualization skills: Visualize a bobsled like the ones in the Olympics at the gate at the top of a bobsled run. Note its color, the steering wheel, a nd the view from the cockpit as you look down the steep slide of snow that leads down the mountain. Now feel yourself being pushed and the bobsled starts careening down the track. Feel the vibration as it picks up speed and st eer into the turns as they present themselves. The fee ling of gravity rivets you as th e turns appear in front of you, and the sled alternately goes sideways on the le ft and right walls of the track. To vary the ride, you can see the track as a wormhole and ri de the sled upside-down for a time and make 360 degree rotations on the track. Try doing this for ten or fift een minutes feeling the power and dynamic movement of the sled as it barrels do wn the track to the bo ttom of the mountain."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"As an alternative, you can also visualize a roller-coaster or a sliding board that goes for miles with twists, turns, loops, a nd dramatic rises and falls whic h you ride at great speed. The goal is involve the meditator fully usi ng the powerful sensations of movement and gravitational forces to avoid bor edom and disinterest. As always with visualization exercises, the meditator wants to take himself out of the physical world and activat e the inner senses in order to induce an experience of spiritual tr avel. Though such exercises may not produce an experience at the time, they also prepare the individual for controlling his or her movements should a spiritual travel experi ence occur at a future time. SHAMANISM FOR NON-INDIANS The Difficulties of Pursuing a Sham anic Path for Non-Native Americans Many Americans are interested in practicing sh amanic or Native American tribal traditions partly because they emphasize personal religious experience rather than faith in a distant God. The author of this site st rongly supports and encourages an interest in personal religious experience. Much of the religious experience pr esent in these shamanic traditions can be classified as spiritual travel. However, atte mpts by persons who are not members of these tribal groups to participate in these traditions are problematic. This is because the vast majority of native pe ople in these traditions will tell you that a person must be born into these tribes to properly practice the tradition. This is not an arbitrary or selfish statement on their part. There are good reasons that justify such claims. These shamanic traditions are tightly bound up with a group of tribal ancestors who have an interest in guiding and protecting the tribal members. If a non-tribal member wants to contact ances tors, who will he or she contact? There is no tradition of being helped by an cestors in the Jud aeo-Christian traditi on. So the question arises: \"With which ancestors are these mode rn-day non-Indian shamans in contact?\" It is theoretically possible for the tribal ancestors to \"adopt\" a non-native pe rson into the tribe, but why would they wish to do so? Certainly a non-Indian person cannot \"adopt himself\" into the tribe (i.e. claim new ancestors) anymore th an a child can walk into the house down the street and tell the resi dents he or she in now their son or daughter. In addition, the shaman's role of healer a nd priest is based on a close-knit long-term relationship with a tribal group which trusts his or her judgmen t and skill. A group of people who show up at a \"shamanic workshop\" do not constitute a legitimate and cohesive community that resembles the tribes of indige nous peoples. So what gr oup is it that looks to these contemporary shamans for spiritual direction and spir itual vitality? Other religious groups have a means of accepting new members that were not born into them through the process of conversion. Medieval Christianity has th e tradition of be ing baptized and becoming part of the mystical body of Christ, and the communion of saints. Mainline protestantism allows a person to adopt Jesus as a personal savior to become \"saved\" or \"born again\" and become a part of the church."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Hinduism and Buddhism both have the traditio n of initiation where a disciple accepts an individual as a guru and joins a lineage which in so me ways is like a family. However, non-tribal members attempting to join a Native American tradition are going against the grain of that tradition. Such a c onvert is subject to be ing labeled a \"plastic shaman\", and will likely be resented by the true members of the tribal group. This is especially true if the practicione r makes money from the practice. These tribal traditions have many attractive elements and it is understandable why many would wish to be involved in them. However, if one is interested primarily in spiritual travel, there are other ways to pursue this interest apart from using these shamanic methods and imitating tribal groups. AFTER-DEATH EXPERIENCE The Tibetan Buddhist and Spiritualist Views of After-Death States Tibetan Buddhism has concentrated more a ttention on helping the dying person cross the borders of death than any othe r living religious tradition. The Tibetan Book of the Dead and other sources give detailed descriptions of th e stages of death and afterlife, as well as instructions about how the dying individual shou ld confront and react to these mysterious places and events. Dealing with a tradition that contains so many lineages, deities, and philosophical subsystems in a short article wi ll necessarily involve generalizing about the tradition. Though the material is co mplex and sometimes difficult to interpret for a Westerner who must rely on English sources, the author will describe the st ages of death, and attempt to show how they are relevant to our discussion of sp iritual travel. The Bardos or Stages of the Afterlife The realm of the afterlife is called the world of the bardo . The term bardo literally means \"in- between\" and in this context denotes a transiti onal state, or what Victor Turner calls a liminal situation. For the dying i ndividual, the bardo is th e period of the afterlife that lies in between two different incarnations. In Tantric Buddhist cosmology, existence ha s a foreground which consists of the many worlds of incarnation, and also a background whic h is the space between these worlds which is called the bardo world. Th e stars are the many worlds, a nd bardo is like the night sky which is the backdrop or the space where the stars are hung. The first stage or bardo of the afterlife follows the initial experience of the dissolution of the five elements of the physical body at the time of death. These consist of something similar to the concepts of earth, fire, water, air, and ethe r in the West, and are related to the progressive dissociation of the soul from the physical body. This dissolution follows a prescribed progression: the senses fail, the muscles lose their strength, there is loss of control over bodily fluids (water), the body loses its warmth (f ire), and the breath fails (air). All this is experienced in sequenc e by the dying person. Note here that the \"soul\" in Tibetan Buddhism is only a co llection (or bundle) of karma (credits and debits based on previous actions which mold both the habit patterns of the"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"individual and the kinds of conditions encount ered in life). In Buddhism, the soul has no substantial nature but otherwis e the soul and this \"collection\" seem very similar and are functionally equivalent for our purposes. We therefore use the term soul above even though it is a not a Buddhist term. The First Bardo Following this, the person's experience of the first bardo commences. However, for most individuals, it passes by in a split second and goes unnotic ed. Only those who have undergone training in and practiced meditation, contemplative prayer, and similar spiritual disciplines will likely even be aware of the fi rst bardo state. For some of those fortunate souls, there will be several opportunities to meet with spiritual beings a nd enter the realms of enlightened beings. One description of the ki nd of meditation done by advanced practitioners consists of a conscious effort to \"dissolve space into light\", which if successful will propel the dying soul into an a state of light and bliss be yond the continual cycles of birth and death to which most souls are subject. For those experienced in spiritua l travel who were able to ente r spiritual states of light, sound, and emptiness during life, the first bardo may of fer an opportunity to enter into these areas shortly after the time of deat h. Also, those with a devotional disposition who were able to develop a strong bond with a deity during life may have similar opportunities to enter into one of the heavens of that deity during the fi rst bardo. The devotion must usually be intense and concentrated to draw the deity's atten tion in this circumstance. Though the Tibetan Buddhist tradition is not primarily devotional, it like most of the world's great religious traditions contains devotional aspects where prac ticianers are encouraged to focus on dakinis, bhairavas, Bodhisattvas, Buddhas, and other helpful beings. The spiritual aperture that opens briefly at the time of death presents a wonderful opportunity to those who can control their t houghts as the first bardo begins. This is probably why there is a common folk belief in the Hindu traditi on which puts much emphasis on controlling and directing the last thought of the dying person. If this thought is strong, clear, and of a spiritual nature, it may permit the person to enter th rough this doorway into a spiritual world immediately at the time of death, an d thus avoid the confusion of the second bardo . The Second Bardo If the first bardo passes and attempts to access spiritual states were unsuccessful, the next bardo begins. The second bardo or the \"bardo of becoming\" is a stage in which the desires of the individual are said to carry the largely he lpless soul through a gr eat variety of intense emotional states. Good thoughts br ing great bliss and pleasure, and hateful or negative thoughts bring great pain and desolation. The soul bounces from thought to thought as a torrent of thoughts and feelings come like a wate rfall. Existing thought ha bits and desires are said to define the experience of the so ul during the afterlife in this way. Spiritual Travel and the Second Bardo It is here where some experience and traini ng in spiritual travel and out-of-body experience may be of greatest help. It may first help the individual maintain a state of detachment. The spiritual traveler who has experienced the i nner world during life can take the whirlwind nature of inner world following death with more calm and detachment. Those who have read"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"examples of the kinds of states encountered in spiritual travel located on other pages of this site will understand that some experimentation and discovery in the inner worlds may prepare the soul for many of the dynamics of the states it may encounter after de ath. The similarity of certain aspects of the near-death experience (a temporary bardo state) and elements of spiritual travel experience (the \"tunnel\" experience for example) show some common qualities between certain spiritual trav el states and these bardo states. The soul experienced in spiritual travel is less li kely to be disoriented by this inner torrent of psychic experience. To put it another way, while the spiritual traveler or yogi swims through the ocean of consciousness, the inexperienced so ul may feel more like it is drowning in that ocean. But as with a drowning person, the most important thing is to have a direction in which to swim to safety. The point of orientat ion or goal for the person in the second bardo may be a deity, a mantra, a prayer, a heaven, a guide, or some similar spiritual goal but the spiritual traveler must be able to focus and move towards that goal using meditative techniques learned and practiced during their former life in the physical world. This is the active approach of the spiritual traveler. The second advantage is that th e spiritual traveler has entere d the waters of consciousness consciously on many occasions and is practiced at dire cting his or her experience in the inner worlds. The greatest problems of the soul in the sec ond bardo are negative em otions like guilt and fear (which results from a lack of familiarity with the inner worlds), and lack of conscious control over its own experience. Fear is particularly harmful because it fragments the self making concentration on one thi ng difficult or impossible, and th is can lead to confusion and loss of conscious control. The soul in the second bardo is many times caught in a dream state sometimes unaware that it has died, and incapable of taking action to raise its state of cons ciousness to a threshold level of awareness where it can direct its attention towards spiritual states. This is one of the reasons it is important to do a regular spiritual pr actice during life. Doing meditation or prayer every day establishes a pa ttern of spiritual activ ity. It then becomes automatic and the habit of seeking after the di vine reality continues during the after-death state where it can have powerful results. A da ily spiritual practice di ffers from other more common spiritual practices such as going to ch urch or temple because it is done more often than once or twice a week. Meditation therefor e establishes a stronger habit pattern in the individual and is a valuable a ddition to group oriented spiritua l activities such as attending church. Regular meditation can also be more powerful because it is usually a less passive activity than church since it fully involve s the individual in the medita tive process rather than making a spectator out of him or her. What the soul in the second bardo needs to do is \"wake up\", as in a lucid dream, and begin a meditation or mental exercise that draws it towa rds a desired stable and more conscious state of awareness where it can have some control and continue to evolve spiritually. The opposite of conscious control is a dream-like state wher e the individual experien ces only the results of his or her previous actions, and mechanica lly moves from thought to thought based on thinking patterns developed during life."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Waking up within a dream is one of the activities the spiritual traveler practices when he or she leaves the body to travel the inner planes . Beyond this, the travel er is also always practicing and perfecting th e art of directing his or her attent ion towards some desired state. It is the contention of the author that experience with meditation and actual spiritual travel experience during life can both be of great he lp in rising above the semi-conscious state characteristic of the second bardo, and moving into a more conscious and desirable state following physical death. For those who practiced a devotional tradition in life, some will semi-consciously repeat a religious or a meditative ritual asking gods or intercessors to draw them out of the second bardo world. We see an example of an attempt to create such a ritual in the Catholic rosary, where Mary as intercessor is requested to Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death ... This phrase is from the Hail Mary Prayer. One effect of the repetition of this prayer fifty times in the rosary is that such a prayer for help and intercession may become an automatic process, which will repeat itself in the bardo. For those fortunate enough to be more conscious in these bardo states , a petition to a god, guru, guide, saint, or intercessor can be made in hopes that the individual will be lifted or guided out of the bardo worlds by one of those entities. But here again, the call must be concentrated and the ability to ignore the surrounding chaos somewhat developed. When such grace is given, it is a form of salvation wh ere the individual is saved from the discomfort and confusion of the \"outer darkness\" of the bardo by a powerful entity - usually one that individuals formed a bond with in their form er life. To use the swimming analogy, here the individual calls out to a lifegua rd in hopes of being rescued from the turbulent waters of the bardo state. This is the more passive approach of the devotee. We should also note that souls in this bardo ar e thought to be very se nsitive to the thoughts and attitudes of those they knew during life. The Tibetans therefore put great effort into doing chanting, reading of sacred texts, and other reli gious rituals to help the dying soul on its journey in the afterlife. Praying for the p eace and happiness of the dying person therefore has great value and provides a benefit to both the living and the dead. This process of sending good wishes to those who have recently died can create a posi tive spiritual atmosphere which can orient and bring peace to the person in the bardo realm, and can also counter some of the sorrow and upset that accompan ies the loss of a loved one. The Third Bardo The third and last bardo consists of the stage of reincarnation where the soul is pulled into another body to start a new life, often but not always in the physical world. Tibetan Buddhists believe that the most desirable world to be born in is the phys ical world, since it affords the most opportunity for spiritual growth and realiza tion. The third bardo consists of a series of images determined by the soul's karma that lead to psychic vortices that draw the soul into a womb. The soul's reaction to the images (attraction or repulsion) determines which vortex the soul enters and in which womb the soul ends up. The Tibetan tradition gives detailed advice on which representations to choose and which to avoid in order to gain a desirable rebirth."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"This ability to choose a good incarnation requ ires discrimination, and a certain degree of conscious awareness. The new age approach to reincarnation which claims we choose our new incarnation is idealistic and not always true from th is vantage point. Many souls desperate to escape the confusion of the second ba rdo will grab on to the first opportunity that presents itself like a swimmer who grasps a log in dangerous rapids in hopes of making it to calmer waters. Choosing the first object (or in carnation) that comes along may not be the wisest choice. The average person is said to spend a period of about forty-five days in the second bardo. However, passionate souls with strong desires or those responsible for ev il acts in their most recent life are said to reincarna te almost immediately. In some cases, the individual can stay in the bardo state for long periods, and be drawn into its curren ts awaiting rebirth. If the individual does not reincar nate in the physical world, he or she will go to one of the other five worlds of rebirth. These are the heaven worlds, the hell worlds, the world of hungry ghosts, the asura (demigod) worlds, and the animal worlds. Each of these is believed to be limited and inferior to obtaining anothe r body in the material world. This is because they exist mostly to receive good or bad karma (t he results of previous actions), and are not considered places to create new karma. The least familiar of the above worlds is the asura world which is a place of conflict and struggle where kings, knights, and warlords battle each ot her for dominance. Persons who were fascinated with gaining and exercising power over others during life are said to be likely to incarnate in the asura realm. The hungry ghos t realm is a place of need and desire where souls are denied fulfillment or given only small rewards. Here souls experience states of continuing anxiety and frustration. The animal world is reserved for those whose extreme instincts for violence, gluttony, or sexual gratification dominated their previous lives in the physical world to the extent that they devolved into the instinctual a nd unreflective state of animal existence. The heaven and hell worlds ha ve wide variations, but it is interesting that the Tibetan tradition has both burning hells (as in the Christian tradition) and freezing hells. The Freedom to do Spiritual Travel in the Afterlife One factor that helps the soul achieve the freed om of conscious contro l and spiritual travel during the afterlife is acceptance of death. Thos e who have not accepted death will resist the process of dying and introduce conf lict into the bardo stages. Th is is why it is important for people to take care of any unfin ished business as they near d eath so they can let go of life completely. In Brahmanical Hinduism, there is a stag e of life called the forest dweller or vanaprastha stage in which the older indivi dual who has finished raising a family is supposed to begin letting go of pleasures and attachments to life in preparation for death. However, in the West the goal is to keep spending money and maxi mize enjoyment up to the end of life. This makes it difficult for many to make a graceful tr ansition into death. Intense attachment to the material world makes it difficult to do spirit ual travel both during life and after death. It also usually helps to have faith in some thing beyond the material world at the time of death. Those with a strong faith in Jesus or a nother religious figure wi ll be more calm and relaxed as they enter the bardo realms. While th e religious person can look forward to heaven at the time of death, the spiritual traveler who ha s been trying to do spiritu al travel all his or"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"her life can also look forward to death in certa in respects. This is because the opportunity for exploration and spiritual travel will hopefully be greatly expanded after death when the physical body and its needs will no longer be a major distraction. Of course the areas the spiritual traveler wishes to e xplore are the heavenly areas and beyond, and in that sense, he or she has much in common with other more conventional re ligious people. Both have a distinct advantage over the secular individual because they expect to enter into a positive afterlife (heaven), and expectations ha ve great power in the inner worlds. This expectation combined with love and devotion towards some religious ideal can propel the religious individual towards a heav enly state just as the practice of spiritual travel does. The secular individual with no faith or expectation of heaven is more likely to flounder after death and get stuck in some intermediate gray area surrounded by thoughts and emotions from the past waiting for something to happen. A brief mention of ethics is a ppropriate when discussing the stat e a person enters at death. In general, both the state of mind of a soul and the world it inhab its is presumed to be the result of its past thought pa tterns and actions ( karma ). Trauma and intense pain whether experienced by the soul, or inflicted on another during life will tend to fragment the self and make conscious control after death difficult. Vi olence, cruelty, and hatr ed expressed towards others in life will almost certainly have a limiting effect on the soul's freedom both in the after death state and in subsequent existences . This is true even for souls who have become proficient in spiritual travel during their life. Unethical actions during li fe seem to separate the soul from the knowledge and wisdom attain ed while living, and leave it helpless to experience the results of its actions in the afterlife. Interestingly enough, some of the Western ideas of heaven and hell can be accounted for by the Tibetan notion of the second bardo. The saint or righteous soul will find itself in places of bliss, happiness, and light ba sed on the kinds of th oughts it was in a habit of thinking, while the evil person will lead an existence of fear, a nger, and torment in the afterlife. However, the second bardo is a temporary transitional stat e that actually preced es the longer term experiences of heaven, hell, or rebirth in the physical world which can occur following the third bardo. Spiritualism as an Alternative View of the Afterlife The focus of Buddhism in the afterlife is simila r to its approach to earthly existence. The emphasis is on passion, and its restrictive and de structive consequences. It is therefore not surprising that the Buddhist vi ew of after death states co ncentrates on desire as the mechanism which turns the dead into machines who must live out a karmic destiny in the afterlife. These individuals will exist in a depl eted state of awareness with little freedom of choice during the bardo. As an alternate and competing view of the afterlife, we will briefly examine the Western tradition of spiritualism which has been around fo r more than one hundred years, and is still popular in some quarters today. The central conclusion of the data provided by the spiritualists and trance mediums is that dead people have scarcely more insight and wisdom in death than they had while alive. Such a proposition emphasizes the importance of learning spiritual skills such as spiritual travel while alive instead of hoping for spiritual re demption and transformation after death. Though"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"the spiritualist's view differs from Buddhism in the specifics, it supports the contention that people should not wait until death to begin learni ng since such a delay can result in a very limited and routine afterlife. We examine the spiritualist's view on the page titled A Spiritualist's Approach to After-Death States . Kabir, the Hindu-Muslim poet of India, talk s about the afterlife in an ambiguous way describing it as the \"city of d eath\" which could be consistent with either the Tibetan or Spiritualist's view of the afte rlife. He offers the following words which support the notion that a person who is limited in life will also be limited in death. O friend! Hope for Him whilst you live, know while you live, understand while you live: for in life deliverance abides. If your bonds be not broken whilst living, what hope of deliverance in death? It is but an empty dream that the soul shall have union with Him because it has passed from the body: If He is found now, He is found them, If not, we do but go to dwell in the city of Death. If you have union now, you shall have it hereafter. Bathe in the Truth, know the true Guru, have faith in the true Name. Kabir says: It is the spirit of the quest that helps; I am a slave of this spirit of the quest. Songs of Kabir (York Beach, Maine: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1991), pps. 46 ‐ 47 One Addition fot this Section: A Spiritualist's Approach to After ‐ Death States Spiritualism as a movement became popular in Am erica with the Fox sisters in the mid 1800s when they encountered a spirit that rapped in a code that they could interpret. They began communicating with the spirit of a dead pedlar who had been mu rdered in their family home in upstate New York. In the late 1800s in Br itain, groups such as the Theosophical Society began making efforts to combine Eastern and West ern religions into a syncretism or blending of religious ideas. They also practiced me diumship and communicated with spirits. Spiritualists developed abilities to ta lk to the dead on one hand and to ascended masters or spiritual adepts on the other. Spiritualism con tinued to gain popularity and was most widely practiced during and after Worl d War I. So many people had l oved ones who died in the war that there was a great need to feel the dead were happy and well even though they died in the midst of the suffering and madness of that war. Anyone who has attended a spiritualist church or group will be familiar with the basic formula where the dead interact with the living using a medium or spiritualist minister as a kind of communications relay station. The medi um communicates with a dead person, and passes the information on to the person the spirit wishes to contact. This formula appears to have changed little in the past one hundred years."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"This description of spiritualists necessarily involves some generalizations, and we will not here attempt to discuss the channeling of spiritual teachers such as Kuth Hoomi, Seth, and Emmanuel but only the communication with ghosts and dead individuals. The spiritualist's basic view of the afterlife is one where the dead are able to watch the living from a distance, and often want to offer advice to living friends and relatives about how to solve their earthly problems. They also offer encouragement to the living about the certainty of an afterlife that is largely pleasant and satisfying, and in doing so contradict claims about the extremes of heaven and hell described in mainstream Christianity. Spiritualism can even be viewed as a concrete alternative to Christianity because the spirits purport to offer direct evidence of an afterlif e by telling the audience facts about individuals in the audience that are unknown to the spiritualis t and the rest of the audience. The target individual then confirms the f acts to be correct and the audien ce concludes that the dead are indeed speaking. If the information is wrong or irrelevant (does not apply to the target individual), the spiritualist has various excuses about how or why the information got garbled. The spiritualist's approach usually requires no fa ith in God or Christ though some churches wed the two very different systems of Christiani ty and Spiritualism in a strange admixture of often contradictory ideas (most sp iritualists believe in reincarna tion). There is also no need of attaining salvation to escape hell in the afterlife. This statement that there should be no fear of hell in the afterlife generally applies to the average person who has not committed egregious evil acts during life. And even such evil doers will not experience torment eternally but will eventually move beyond it. One fundamental tenet of these groups is th e well-known maxim attributed to the ancient Hermetic philosopher Hermes Trismegistos that is commonly phrased \"As above, so below\". In the context of the afterlife, the statement can be interpreted to mean that earthly life (below) is basically a reflection of the afterlife (above ). The two are different only in subtle ways. It also means that the \"lower\" earthly real ity is derived from the higher reality, and that changes in the state of mind of the individual (in the mind or \"above\" world) can have direct bearing on future events in th e physical or \"below\" world. This opens up the whole area of positive or magical thinking where our thoughts and attitudes are believed to ultimately create the world we live in. Spir it (or spirits) can also influen ce matter in a different way as in the case where the dead interact with the living to give know ledge and advice that can be channeled by a spiritualist medium. The curious and surprising thing about communica tions with the dead is that despite their increase in telepathic skills, they seem to know very little about the workings of universe. Their vision and interests appear to be quite limited. They behave in some ways like tribal ancestors, and are often helpful a nd interested in the welfare of living friends and relatives. However, the quality of the counsel they offe r seldom reaches the level of a \"Dear Abby\" advice column in a daily newspaper. The spirits, for instance, advise grandchildren or former spouses to go to the doctor and have a checkup, or to stop fighting with other relatives, or to leave a job where they are unfulfilled and find a new one. Those who are convinced that the medium is actua lly in contact with th e dead in the spirit world conclude that death is not the end, and that they will survive dying to enter into a comforting and familiar afterlife when their body is laid to re st. This is how spiritualism competes effectively with Christianity, wh ich attempts to convince people of their"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"immortality by pointing to Jesus' promise that the dead will rise again. The spiritualist, however, will survive death without having faith in Christ and without living what is normally considered to be a religious life. Generally, the dead seem to be quite limited, sometimes discontent, and mostly concerned with the kinds of things that where important to them while on earth. They seem to be basically as conventional and narrow in th e afterlife as they were while alive. This spiritualist's view of the afterlife is in some ways more disturbing than the Tibetan Buddhist view because at least the Buddhist vi ew offers a change in consciousness and an opportunity to meet spiritual bei ngs. Similarly, Christianity offers the extremes of heaven and hell, and therefore predicts a radical change in consciousness in the afterlife when compared to the spiritualist's provincial view of the afterlife. One possibility is that it is the limitations of the spiritualist wh o cannot understand and communicate the level of consciousness of the spir its that is the problem. Another is that the audience would be alienated by beings who are too far above their state of consciousness. The spirits therefore avoid speaki ng about certain elements of th eir experience in order not to lose their audience. Both coul d explain the lack of spiritu al insight and low level of consciousness of the dead. However, if one attempts to work with the ra w data and takes the information at face value, one must conclude after examining the concerns and goals of the dead in these spiritualist groups that learning spiritual tr avel during life is very impor tant. Without such spiritual knowledge, the opportunities for e xploration in the af terlife appear to be negligible. Expanding one's consciousness using spiritual tr avel techniques during life will likely carry over to the world of the afterlif e because one world is said to closely parallel and mimic the other. Spiritual travel skills developed during life will therefore allow for expanded vision in the afterlife hopefully providing the increase in freedom and awareness that will make the afterlife more worth living. K nowledge of spiritual travel may help avoid the trap of an afterlife that closely resembles our lives on earth. The tradition of spiritualism has two very importa nt results with respect to death. First, it provides comfort to the grieving who have lost loved ones by providing a world view that shows they still exist and it even provides a m eans of contacting them. It shows that they can watch our activities, and even read our thoughts. We can theref ore think about them and they can be aware of it. The dead and the livi ng are connected and contacting them through a spiritualist or medium is not required. This can be very comforting to those who have lost loved ones. The power of this connection can be seem in older traditional cultures such as China, India, and Bali where ancestors are re spected, and this kind of connection with and reverence for the dead is an impor tant element of life and society. Second, spiritualism makes death less fearful because death does not mean a severing of relationship with those that are loved. Death is no longer the fear of losing everything since a connection with the living can be maintained. The spirit following death can even continue to help and guide the living though in ways that are different from what was done while he or she was alive. The spiritualist tradition truly has some positive sides when looked at from the point of view of a living, dying, or dead soul."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL TRAVEL AND DEATH Spiritual Travel as a Dress Rehearsal For Death Spiritual travel and the experi ence of leaving the body may provide a kind of dress rehearsal for physical death. The spiritual traveler realizes by immediate personal experien ce that the everyday world that is normally so stable and predictable can disappear at a moment's notice, just as it will at the time of physical death. At this point, an enti rely new world opens up to replace it. In some travel experiences, the traveler has the feeli ng of traveling huge distances from his or her earthly home and normal state of waking awarene ss in just a few seconds. The feeling that you are leaving the comfortable and familiar worl d of five senses behind is very strong in some spiritual travel experiences. There is a saying that only the bold and adve nturesome find heaven. There is sometimes a decision at the onset of a sp iritual travel experience: Do you wish to play it safe and stop the experience because it may challenge the ego and its limited view of the world, and by doing so stay ignorant of some facet of re ality, or are you w illing to take the chance and perhaps learn something new? The intuitive feeling that spiritual travel may involve travel through the realms of the afterlife gives it a certain gravity, sin ce it means one may be experimenting with life and death. Mystical experience is often said to transce nd all dualities including th e opposition of life and death. Shamans are believed by th eir cultures to enter the realm of the ancestors and converse with the spirits of the dead duri ng ecstatic journeys out of the body. One great gift that spiritual trav el may provide is a feeling of confidence that death is not the end, and a familiarity with the realms beyond the physical world. To experiment and gain knowledge of spiritual travel may provide a sense of familiarity with the other worlds so that death will be less of a shock. Those who have had near-death experiences almost always confirm this sense of increase d confidence about their ability to handle the act of dying, and their belief in the existence of life after death . Death can be a new birth into a confusing and al ien world where like an infant, the soul is dependent and incapable of choos ing its destiny. Or it can be a kind of graduation where after a long period of schooling, the s oul enters a new world with a confidence that comes from having learned what it needs to know to surviv e, to thrive, and continue its evolution. Spiritual travel is schooling for the soul as it approaches the death of the physical body. Death is like traveling on an airplane for so meone who has never ridden one before, and is unfamiliar with modern technology. The noise is frightening, the passenger is cramped and uncomfortable, once in the air he or she is a long way from earth and what is familiar, the air on the plane is different, and there are warnings of possible dangerous situations. It can be frightening. But riding planes often (as in pr acticing spiritual travel ) lessons the fear."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Death is one of life's greatest challenges.

The best he can do is train and le arn everything he can to help him face the battlefield situation with confid ence. If his training is good, he will likely return from battle with life and limb intact. Learning spiritual travel only increases one's ab ility to face death with confidence. There is no guarantee that fear, confusion, and anxiety will not complicate the dying process. But how is it that so many are willing to go to the hour of their death without any training whatsoever? As Kabir says of those who make an outer sh ow of religiosity but have no true religious experience: You are going to death's door bound hand and foot! The knowledge of spiritual travel can serve as a set of wings for the soul as it enters the vast open sky of the afterlife at the time of physical death. BEYOND SPIRITUAL TRAVEL Advanced Spiritual Perception Containing Both Physical and Nonphysical Elements For myself and other seekers who attempt to prac tice the art of spiritual travel, the concept of spiritual travel seems a natural one. In consider ing the variety of spiritual travel experiences presented here (some of which are of a personal nature), it seems justifiable to maintain a solid wall between two reali ties - the reality based on per ception in the body, and the one based on perception outside of the body. This fits well with distinctions in Western philosophy by Plato, the church fathers and late r Descartes who subscribed to the dualism which separates the spiritual and the material sp heres. The spiritual world is defined as the realm of the mind (and afterlife for those with a religious worl d view) where thoughts exist, and time, size, and distance are irrelevant. Th e material world is the realm of earthly existence and the body where time, measure, subs tance, and matter are the dominant reality. However, there are people who have experiences that seem to violat e this clear separation between \"in the body\" and \"out of the body\" experience. The following examples give a picture of souls who enter high st ates of spiritual awareness, an d perceive both the spiritual and physical worlds simultaneously as pa rt of one vast sp iritual panorama. Though they violate the basic distinction we ha ve drawn up to this point, it is our position that the physical world is dependent on and derivative of the spiritual world and not the reverse. If this is the case, advanced awareness of the spirit ual world must also optionally include awareness of the physical world. R eaching a high state of spiritual awareness therefore allows souls to peer into the physical world while al so perceiving a broad spectrum of spiritual and psychic states. At a certain stage of spiritual development, the soul is said to have no concrete location but is able to perceive any reality it directs its attention towards, physical or spiritual. As with most mystical systems, the dualism of inner and outer must eventually give way to a fundamental monism, or the all-pervading unity of the infinite spiritual reality. As Kabir states when referring to this spiritual reality:"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"If I say that He is within me, the universe is ashamed: If I say that He is without me, it is a falsehood.

Gopi Krishna avoided meditation for a number of years after an initial experience with the Kundalini which threw him mentally off balance. He then adopted a very strict diet and physical routine while the Kundalini energy slowly transformed and strengthened his body and mind to prepare him for this experience. His extraordinary spiritual experience occurred as the physical world continued to exist as little more than a transparent vapor through which he saw the spiritual one. Wilhurst perceives the interpenetration of the transpersonal light and the worshipers at a church service This vision describes the way a participant at a church service comes to perceive physical objects as transparent.

The marvelous aspect of the condition, lay in the sudden realization th at although linked to the body and surroundings I had expanded in an indescribable manner into a titanic personality, conscious from within of an imme diate and direct contact with an intensely conscious universe, a wonderful immanence all around me. My body, the chair I was sitting on, the table in front of me, the room enclos ed by walls, the lawn outside and the space beyond including earth and sky appeared to be most amazingly mere phantoms in this real, inter-penetrating and all-pervasiv e ocean of existence which to explain the most incredible part of it as best I can, seemed to be simu ltaneously unbounded stretching out immeasurably in all directions, and yet no bigge r than an infinitely small poi nt. From this point, the entire existence of which my body and its surroundings were but a part, poured out like radiation, as if a reflection as vast as my conception of the cosmos were thrown out upon infinity by a projector no bigger than a pinpoi nt, the entire intensely activ e and gigantic world picture dependent on the beams issuing from it. The shoreless ocean of consciousness which I was now immersed in appeared infinitely large and infinitely small at the same time, large when considered in relation to the world picture floa ting in it and small when considered in itself, measureless, without form or size, nothi ng and yet everything. It was an amazing and staggering experience for which I can cite no pa rallel and no simile, an experience beyond all and everything belonging to this world, conceiva ble by the mind or perceptible to the senses. I was intensely aware interna lly of a marvelous being so concentratedly and massively conscious as to outluster and outstature infinitely the cosmic image present before me, not only in point of extent and brightness but in point of reality and s ubstance as well. The phenomenal world, ceaselessly in motion charac terized by creation, incessant change and dissolution, receded into the background and assu med the appearance of an extremely thin, rapidly melting layer of foam upon a substantial ro lling ocean of life, a veil of exceeding fine vapor before an infinitely large conscious sun, constituting a complete reversal of the relationship between the world and the limited human consciousne ss. It showed the previous all-dominating cosmos reduced to a state of transitory appearance and the formerly care- ridden point of awareness, circ umscribed by the body, grown to th e spacious dimensions of a mighty universe and the exalted stature of a ma jestic immanence before which the material cosmos shrank to the subordinate positi on of an evacent and illusive appendage.

He realized that a common mistake in meditati on, which seeks enlightenment, was that the meditator seeks something that can be experience d. He realized the falsen ess of this approach and proceeded to \"drop the expectation of ha ving anything happen\". He was then able to abstract the atman or \"I am\" from the objective real ity around him. He found nothing but \"darkness and emptiness\" from an objective view point but realized \"it as Absolute Light and Fullness\" and that he was That. He writes: I found myself above the universe not in the sense of having left the physical body and being taken out of space but in the sense of being above space, time, and causality. My karma seemed to drop away from me as an individual res ponsibility. I felt intangibly, yet wonderfully free. I sustained the universe and was not bound by it... I seemed to comprehend a veritable library of knowledge, all less concrete that the most abstract math ematics. The personality rested in a gentle glow of happiness."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" CONCLUSION The Comet Flying Through the Darkness of Space Attracted to the Infinite Spiritual Sun The facets of spiritual travel are many and vari ed. They range from near-death experience to mystical union, from immersion in states of spiritual light to shamanic journeys to the ancestor world, from soaring thr ough skies filled with celestial music to riding mantric waves of sound, from encountering sp iritual landscapes to rock eting through th e tunnel that connects the physical world to higher worlds of being. In the past, spiritual travel might have been cl assified as an obscure form of mysticism on one hand, or as \"astral projection\" (as defined by Theosophy, the turn of th e century spiritualist philosophy) on the other. The inte rest in it was very limited. But the recent interest in the indigenous reli gions of tribal peoples, which includes shamanic experience, has added a new class of experience to the list, and a certain respectability to the category. Also, the enormous interest in ne ar-death experience has greatly expanded the awareness of spiritual travel and out-of-body experience as a valuable form of spiritual exploration. However, despite these developments, the fundamental question arises: Why is spiritual travel not a wider topic in human conversation? Why is it unknown to the vast majority of humanity? One explanation is that it is not an easy pat h, and inducing spiritual tr avel experience usually involves discipline, effort, ti me, inner experimentation, and even some good fortune since this ability is in some respects a gift. This is true to the extent that it is easier for some to leave the physical body than others. Therefore th ose who are not predispo sed to this kind of experience might have to work harder and spend more time than those who have this predisposition to bring about out-of-body experi ence. As stated earlier, for most people (including the author), it is quite difficult to leave the physical body and some regard it with a certain amount of fear. Another explanation is that the physical world of fers so many challenges and distractions that it fills the entirety of mankind's consciousness. But the pain of the death of a loved one, th e dissatisfaction with the shallowness of the media-saturated consumer culture of the mode rn world, the sense of limitation that seems inherent in the makeup of the physical body, the knowledge that one's own old age and death are inevitable would seem to be enough motiv ation to counter at least some of life's distractions. In the West, there are other cultural and historic al reasons for this lack of interest in and awareness of spiritual travel. In addition to the obvious wide acceptan ce of the philosophy of materialism, and a scientific world view that reduces both the univers e and the mind of man"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"to complex machines, spiritual travel is a ra dical notion which goes against several centuries of religious belief, and most interpreta tions of the Bible and Muslim Quran. In Hinduism and Buddhism, it is generally believ ed that a person can enter the highest or holiest states of religious consciousness while still alive in the physic al body. If you are not a Buddha or an enlightened sage ( siddha ) with insight into the nature of reality, it is your limitation . The universe is infinite even if you cannot perceive its infinity because of your limited perspective. Each person has a unique set of barriers to overcome to get beyond his or her own limited view of the world. In mainstream Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, however, it is believed that the soul can only experience heaven after the physical death of the body. These areas are thought to be inaccessible to living people in the Western tr aditions, except perhaps for a rare saint or prophet chosen by God to reveal something specific to mankind. No individual can see religious visions of the world of God or visit heavenly worlds by his or her own choice. The person must wait for God's grace. Exploration is forbidden and attempts to explore are a sign of vanity. It is in this context of aliena tion from the spiritual world that some Christians look forward to and even seek to bring about the end of the worl d in order that they be \"raptured\" or taken into heaven. Similarly, some Muslims commit suicide as an act of religious war to reach heaven. Even when such events bring about so much obvious death, suffering, and destruction, they are desirable because they ar e believed to also bring about transcendent spiritual experience and immediate heavenly sa lvation. The motivations for both groups are complex but certainly one primary motivation is the desperate desire for the spiritual experience of heaven, and destruction of the ear th and/or the physical body is only a means to this heavenly end. In addition, these are religions of surrender to a \"higher power\" that will take care of the individual like a parent caring for a child. At de ath, God, Jesus, or an angelic intercessor will take the soul of the individual and control its movements and de stination. For Catholics, there is also the hope that prayer will move Mary or a Catholic saint to petition Christ to be charitable, and through grace give the dying indivi dual a better afterlife th an he or she might otherwise deserve. In mainstream Protestant theology, much of wh ich is based on Martin Luther's doctrine of \"justification by faith\", the individual is subj ect to sin, and therefore cannot be saved by imperfect works and gains heaven by faith alone . Curiously, having faith is not classified as \"a work\" even though serious Protestants both now a nd in the past seem to work very hard at having faith. But it is clear that without access to deeper spiritual expe riences during life in these traditions, maintaining such fa ith becomes a Herculean exercise. In each tradition, the unwritten religious contract states: \"Once I am saved or have faith or live a good life according to the principles of my religion, I am guaranteed eternal life in a heavenly paradise\". I sincerely hope this is true because so many religious people are depending on it. Spiritual travel certainly has an element of trust and surrender, but is really more like yoga in that its major focus is self-mastery rather th an surrender. It is a kind of continuing vision quest in which the arena of the quest is the mi nd instead of going out into nature to seek a"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"vision. Spiritual travel makes individuals responsible for th eir own limitations, and their spiritual perception or the lack of it. It is for those who are not quite ab le to trust the glowing promises of the mainstream religions, or at least those who woul d like some additional evidence for the existence of a spiritual worl d in the afterlife now instead of waiting until death. Taking the concept of spiritua l travel seriously means exte nding and expanding the helpful and valuable Christian virtue of faith beyond a strong belief in God and his inspired word, and the equally important virtue of works beyond prayer, charity, good will, and helpful action towards one's neighbor. For the spiritual traveler, faith must be more than confidence in a distant deity which can only be encountered after death. It must also be faith in one's own ability to see and know the heavenly worlds and this ultimate reality here and now. Faith is also not the end of the individual's spiritual journey on earth. It is rather an importa nt beginning of the spiritual journey because it provides a solid foundati on for developing and pursuing a spiritual practice which leads to spiritua l realization. Many in the West believe that faith divorced from works, spiritual practice, and the deeper study of a spiritual tradition is a ticket to heaven, and that salvation can come at the la st moment of life after a long history of misdeeds. For these individuals, investment pr ofessionals have some valuable advice which can be applied to the spiritual path as well: If something sounds to good to be true, it probably is. The doctrine of \"justificati on by faith\" if wrongly understood could even be dangerous because it can be used to avoid living a spiritual life and to av oid doing any spiritual practice. While many mainstream religious traditions are strong in the areas of encouraging ethical action and religious community in their members, as educati onal institutions, they have a serious limitation. That is that they have low expectations of their members. The religious leaders or teachers who are many times very sincere in their desire to help others unfortunately have so little faith in their me mbers (and also in themselves) that there is virtually no mention that such members are capable of having transcendent spiritual experience prior to death. If there is some glim mer of experience, it has to fit a narrow mold so as not to threaten the prevailing vi ew of what is acceptable and possible. The concept of spiritual travel shows this view to be unnecessarily pessimistic, and substitutes for it a view of an individual who should ha ve great expectations and great optimism about his or her spiritu al potential. It further show s that spiritual experience is wide-ranging and that the universe is a very big place with many rooms in God's mansion, and that spiritual experience should be encouraged rather than feared. In the context of spiritual travel, works mean s adopting a spiritual practice that leads the individual step by step to my stical knowledge, and experimen ting with such a practice and changing it if it does not produce results after extended effort. Works also means taking whatever religion one is currently part of and searching for the transcendent and esoteric elements in that tradition . This includes examining the lives of the saints, prophets, and saviors to uncover the core of transcendent religious experience that is at the heart of these great religious traditions. Spiritual travel as a practice is like mysticism. Both are largely nondenominational. They can be a part of almost any religious tradition."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The philosophy of spiritual travel as outlined at this site asserts that the individual is not trapped in the body while living in the body. He or she is capable of making voyages into the inner worlds and returning to report on the experience. We can use various analogies to describe our identity during spiritual travel. The spiritual seeker becomes the comet flying through the darkness of space (the pictorial theme of this web site) attracted to the infinite spiritu al sun which is its ultimate destination. But the change in how we view ourselves during spiritual travel goes beyond a simple analogy. We are all literally sailors on a cosmic sea . Even though our current home port is the physical body, there is no reas on to insist on staying moored at home port indefinitely. Sailors are safe while in port but their role requires them to leave and explore the sea. At physical death, we must move out on the ocean again anyway, so why not do some exploring now? Sailing is always smoother when the boat is controlled by an experienced seaman who has navigated in a broad variety of waters and weather conditions. Through spiritual travel, we can become the capta ins of our vessels and master the inner sea of awareness. This mastery comes with a process of spiritual purification, and as it occurs, the inner sea of thought, space, imagery and emoti on gradually becomes a sea of sacred light, sound, and Truth. When this occurs, the spirit ual traveler can only echo the words of the Indian medieval poet Kabir: I have drunk from the Cup of the Ineffable, I have found the Key to the Mystery, I have reached the Root of Union. Traveling by no track, I have found that Sorrowless Land ... There I have seen joy filled to the brim, Perfection of Joy; There I have witnessed the sport of One Bliss! ... The inward and outward are become one sky, The Infinite and finite are united: I am drunken with the sight of this All! ... Kabir says: \"My heart is frenzied, and I disclose in my soul what is hidden. I am immersed in that one great bliss wh ich transcends all pleasure and pain.\" - The End -"}]
