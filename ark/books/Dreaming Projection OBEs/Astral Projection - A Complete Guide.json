Mu ch of it is misunderstood and it can all be very confusing at time s. This series of articles attempt s to shed a little light on the subject, and hopefully, explain what its all about. The theories and conclusions in this Treatise are large ly drawn from my own pro jection experience. It is the goal of this Treatise to develop gre ater understanding and new, simpl er and mo re effective techniques for pro jection. The ideas, theories and techniques discussed here are constantly under developme nt and are subject to mo dification and change as new discoveries and insights come to light. What is the Astral Dimension? The astral is the closest dime nsion to the physical. It overlays and perme ates the world like a huge mind net, catching and holding all thought. Its contents are created by the collective consciousness of the world mind. It contains all the thoughts, me mo ries, fantasies, and dreams of every living thing in the world. In it, the laws of sympa thetic attraction, or like attracts like, causes this ocean of mind stuff to strata and settle into layers or"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"pools. These pools of thought are mo re commo nly called astral planes, astral worlds, astral sub planes or astral realms. The astral dime nsion is compo sed of astral ma tter and is aptly described as mind stuff. It is extreme ly sensitive to thought and can be mo ulded into any shape or form. These creations can be so perfect as to be indistingu ishable from reality. The best way to explain this, mind stuff, is to draw a compa rison between astral ma tter and unexposed, high speed photogra phic film. When this film is exposed to light, focused by the came ras lens, a perfect ima ge of reality is instantly burnt into the film by the chemical reaction of the film to light. When astral ma tter is exposed to thought, focused by the lens of the mind, a perfect ima ge of reality is instantly forme d out of astral mind stuff by the reaction of astral ma tter to thought. The compl exity and durability of any creation in the astral dime nsion depends large ly on the strengt h of the mind doing the creating. Dreams This is how the subconscious mind creates dreams: By tuning into the astral dime nsion during sleep, it can create any scenario it wishes. This is the subconscious mind's way of solving pro blems and of commu nicating with the conscious mind. It creates a series of compl ex"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"thought form scenarios and pro jects them into the mind stuff of the astral dime nsion, where they become solid. The conscious mind then lives through and experiences these created scenarios in the dream state. In a way its like a mo vie pro jector (subconscious mind) pro jecting onto a mo vie screen (astral dime nsion). Thought Forms Any new object in the real world is assimilated into the astral dime nsion over a period of time . A thought form repre sentation of it first gro ws in the lowest part of the astral, close to the physical dime nsion, becoming mo re and mo re perma nent as time goes on. As with all thought forms , the mo re attention paid to it the quicker it gro ws. The higher up in the astral dime nsion, or the further away from the physical, the less thought forms , of the physical world, as we kno w it, are found. Physical things have to soak in to it for a very long time before they take shape, and are found, in the higher astral. Have you ever tried to mo ve around a strange house in the dark? You bump into everything, right. But as you become familiar with it though, a me ntal picture of your surro undings forms in your mind, and you can find your way around it better. The longe r you spend in this house the stronge r this me ntal picture become s. This is similar to how things are assimilated and gro wn, as thought"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"forms , in other dime nsions. The generation of thought forms in the astral also works in the reverse. If a physical object has been around for a very long time , it will have gro wn a lasting thought form impre ssion in the astral. After the object is destroyed or remo ved, its thought form still endures. You ma y, for exampl e, in the astral, find furniture in your house you don't have, jumb led up with your own. This is caused by the decaying thought forms of old stuff, belongi ng to pre vious tenants etc., still being there, years after the originals have gone. Old thought forms do not follow their physical counterpa rt around when they are mo ved. Ne w ones begin to gro w in the astral wherever it is while the old ones slowly decay. The longe r a thing is in one place, the stronge r the thought form will become in that place. This also appl ies to buildings , structures and geological features. You ma y pro ject into a park and find a house, bridge, stream, hill etc. that you kno w is definitely not there. These ma y have existed in time s past. The higher up in the astral you go, the older the thought forms are, or the further back in geological time you appe ar to be. The rate of gro wth of a thought form depends large ly on the amo unt of attention paid to it. For exampl e, a famo us painting; loved, viewed and highly thought of by millions, will have a mu ch stronge r thought form than that of a commo n painting that hangs in some one's"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"bedroom and is only viewed by a few. The numb er of thought forms you find in the astral also depends on how close you are to the physical dime nsion. If you are very close, as in a real time pro jection or OOBE, very few thought forms , if any, will be found. In a real time OOBE you are not quite in the astral dime nsion but are existing as an astral form in the buffer zone between the astral and the physical dime nsions. Astral Visio n In the physical body we have 220 degre es of vision, i.e. we can only see in front of us, but not behind, above and below at the same time . In the Astral body we have MO RE than 360 degre es of vision and can see on all sides at once. This is Sph erical vision. During pro jection, habit forces us to focus our attention in one direction only, where we feel the forward part of our vision is. The view behind, above, below, left and right is still there, and seen all at once, but it can not be assimilated by the brain, all at once. This goes against the brains lifelong habit of frontal vision. Sph erical vision is like being one huge mu lti faceted eye that can see in all directions, up, down, left, right, front, back, but all at once! In the astral body you do not have any physical orga ns, i.e., eyes. You are a non-physical point of consciousness floating in space. You are also unaffected by gra vity and other laws of physics. In this state there are no ups or"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"downs, backs or fronts, left or rights. It is only lifelong habit that tries to force this perspective on you during pro jection. It is impo rtant to understand spherical vision, if you are to operate compe tently in the astral. This is especially so when you pro ject, in real time , close to the physical dime nsion. Sph erical vision will often cause you to think you are in a mirro r ima ge dime nsion, or a reversed copy of reality. This me ans your house, for exampl e, will appe ar to be reversed, back to front. This is caused by you losing your original natural viewpoint during pro jection. At some point during the pro jection you have become disoriented and taken a different viewpoint from norma l, i.e., you have rotated or turne d upside down or inside without thinki ng. This reverses your natural left right, up down viewpoint. This tricks the subconscious mind into reversing the place you are in so your conscious mind can function pro perly. As you don't have a physical body in the astral, if you want to look behind yourself you don't have to turn around, or mo ve at all. You just change your viewpoint to the rear. This, when done without mo ving, causes the mirro r ima ge effect, in a way its like looking in a mirro r to see behind. This causes the subconscious mind to use its creative power to correct the view by reversing it, or parts of it. This is easier and causes fewer pro blems for the conscious"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"mind than if it had to try and accept a reversal of left and right. A similar effect can be had by lying down and looking above your head, or standing on your head and trying to pick the left and right sides of things . This causes a slight confusion in your sense of left and right, i.e., you have to consciously calculate which is left and right from your reversed position. This slight confusion is all that is needed to trick the subconscious mind into creating some thing easier to accept. Your brain is unable to assimilate this reversal and thus gives you a new perspective according to what it feels is left and right at the time . Once you consciously notice this anoma ly it is too late to reverse it. The brain canno t accept a conscious change of left and right. If you understand spherical vision though, and happe n to get reversed some time during a pro jection, it is no longe r a pro blem. You can take it into account and function norma lly, rather than thinki ng you are wasting your time in some strange mirro r dime nsion, i.e., if you had plans to do some thing in the astral you still can. All you have to do is, take your left right coordinates from the building or structure around you, and igno re your own sense of left and right compl etely. Everything you see while you are in the astral dime nsion is directly perceived by the mind. It is a simpl e ma tter for the subconscious mind to twist or reverse, all, or even"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"part of, your conscious perception of reality during a pro jection. No te: This reversal of viewpoint can happe n ma ny time s during any one real time pro jection. Creative Visualisa tion Power The subconscious mind has VASTLY gre ater powers of visualisation than the conscious mind. It is like compa ring a super compu ter to an child's calculator. In the astral dime nsion, during any conscious pro jection or lucid dream, where the conscious mind is aware, this difference can cause gre at confusion. The subconscious mind simme rs beneath the surface during any pro jection. All that creative power is just bursting to get out, to create, and it will do just that any chance it gets. This difference in creative power, comb ined with the lifelong habit of norma l frontal vision, is the cause of the \"Alice In Wonderland Effect.\" Let me explain.... Take these together: 1. The incredible creative power of the subconscious mind. 2. The weak creative powers of the conscious mind. 3. The sensitivity of astral ma tter to thought. 4. Sph erical vision. 5. Left, right sense reversals. And you have a recipe for total confusion."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Alice In Wonderland Effect You pro ject your astral body and look around your room. Everything appe ars norma l, but suddenly, you notice the door is on the wrong wall? While looking around, you have seen this door with your rear vision, confusing your natural left, right, brain perspective. The brain can't assimilate this because your frontal perspective, and the position of the furniture, pictures, windows etc., are norma l; but the view behind you is reversed. This tricks the subconscious mind into creating a door where it thinks it should be. When you look at this door, it appe ars real, even though you kno w it is in the wrong place. Once it has been created, it will not be uncreated, as that would be unacceptable to your conscious mind. i.e. solid doors don't norma lly have a habit of vanishing before your eyes. When you turn to where the door really should be, you will, usually, find the door there as norma l. No w you ma y have two, or mo re, doors where there should only be one. If you go through the real door, you will find the rest of the house as it should be, hopefully. But, if you go through a false door, the mind kno ws its false and won't accept it opening to a norma l part of your house that it kno ws can't possibly be there. So, if you open this door you will find some thing else. It is usually a corridor or passage, you don't have, leading off into other parts of the house you don't have either."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"From then on, if you go through this door, you are in Wonderland, where everything is possible, just not very plausible. What you are doing, in effect, is entering the astral dime nsion via uncontrolled creation, through this door you don't have, but now do. Once the subconscious mind starts creating like this it continues to do so at a geome tric rate. It has to, for the conscious mind to assimilate the abnorma l situation it is in. At some stage, in this creative ma elstrom, the subconscious mind loses it compl etely and starts tuning in to other parts of the astral. At this point of the pro jection, all semb lance of reality is lost and you fade into the astral dime nsion pro per. There are ma ny ways this \"Alice\" effect can happe n during a pro jection, the above exampl e is just one variation. It has been noted by ma ny pro jectors that at some time during a pro jection they seem to lose control of it. Objects appe ar, disappe ar, and generally everything gets a little strange . This is caused, basically, by the subconscious mind's vast creative ability being trigge red. It starts ma king and unma king things , and tuning into other areas of the astral and generally ma king everything difficult for the poor pro jector. To avoid the above pro blem: Concentrate on what you are doing while you are pro jecting and don't let your mind wander. The vision reversal pro blem can be minimised if you concentrate on your forward vision"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"during pro jection, i.e., focus in one direction at a time . When you turn, follow the room around with your vision and don't allow it to flit from one view to another. The astral is not a good place to relax if you have serious plans. The vast creative power of the subconscious can, however, be utilised. It is an extreme ly valuable tool if you kno w how to use it. I will outline ways to do this, in the third part of this series, under the heading: \"Virtual Reality Projection\" where I will outline how to custom create your own personal astral realm. Melting Hands When you pro ject the astral body close to the physical world you do not have a body as such. But, the mind canno t accept this and so pro vides a thought form one ma de out of etheric ma tter. If you try and look at your body, say your hands, you will find they start to me lt very quickly. They look pale and odd, and in a couple of seconds your finge rs start to me lt away like ice under a blow torch. They shorten into pale stumps , then the rest of your hand and arm starts to me lt away too. This me lting effect only seems to happe n when you deliberately try and observe a body part or consciously create some thing. Deliberately observing an astral body part like this, uses the conscious mind, which, having poor creative powers,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"can't hold compl ex shapes together for very long and it is this that causes the me lting effect. If you happe n to notice parts of your body, in passing, during pro jection this me lting effect will not be seen. Created Thought Form Objects You can use your conscious mind to create objects while pro jecting. The duration of these, thought form, created objects depends on the strengt h of your creative visualisation ability. It also depends on how mu ch time and effort you put in to a creation. This same me lting phenome na happe ns with any conscious creation done in the astral dime nsion. If you create for exampl e, a sword, it will appe ar in your hand just as you ima gine it, briefly, and then me lt away just like the hand did. If you concentrate on it you can hold it in shape, but as soon as your concentration wavers so does the creation. This is similar to any other visualisation you do in the real world. It is difficult, and you have to concentrate to hold the visualisation in your minds eye. Once your concentration wavers, so does the visualised ima ge. This illustrates the vast difference between the creative powers of the conscious and the subconscious mind. To ma ke a lasting thought form object you have to trick the subconscious mind into creating it for you. I will deal with this subject, in gre ater depth, later in the series."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"How Does Projection Happen? During sleep, the energy body, also kno wn as the etheric body or vitality sheath, is put on charge . It expands and opens in order to accumu late and store energy . The energy body can, norma lly, only do this in its expanded state during sleep. Once expanded, the chakra s trickle power, in the form of etheric ma tter, into the energy body. During this recharging pro cess the astral body separates and tunes into the astral dime nsion where it can create and experience dreams. If this separation is done consciously, or if you become aware after it, you can take some control over it. It then become s an OOBE, astral pro jection or lucid dream. The ma in differences between an OOBE, astral pro jection and a lucid dream are: The OOBE The OOBE (out of body experience) is a real time pro jection close to the physical world. This often occurs as part of a near death experience. This is where a person is kno cked out of their body as a result of some kind of severe trauma , i.e. car accident, surge ry, heart attack, child birth etc. OOBE'ers are aware of things happe ning in the real world, in real time ; such as conversations and events centred around, or near to, their physical body. In ma ny cases, these events and conversations are accurately reported by the person after they have returne d to their"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"body. No te: The OOBE is slightly different from astral pro jection or lucid dreaming because of its real time , objective aspect. This is caused by the astral body containing a large amo unt of etheric ma tter, which holds it close to the physical world. There are two ma in causes of real time OOBE: 1. A person's body is near death, or thinks it is, which causes a large amo unt of etheric ma tter to be channe lled into the astral body in pre paration for the death pro cess. 2. The person has active chakra s which are doing a similar thing,i .e. channe lling etheric ma tter into the astral body. Having active chakra s can be a natural ability, or it can be developed by training. No te: You can pro ject consciously, and have a real time OOBE if enough etheric ma tter is generated by the chakra s. In an OOBE, reality is perceived as objective (real) and time is norma l (real time ). Technically, when you pro ject into the physical world in real time as in an OOBE, it is really into the boundary area of the buffer zone, between the physical and astral dime nsions. If the astral body contains enough etheric ma tter it can exist only slightly out of phase from reality. This me ans the pro jection is in real time and so close to the physical dime nsion as to be indistingu ishable from it. No te: I have checked this ma ny time s, by pro jecting, in"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"real time , during the day and scouting my local area for road works, accidents, incidents etc., then verifying the accuracy of my findings afterwards. There are strong natural barriers to conscious, real time pro jection, the OOBE, in the physical world. The amo unt of etheric ma tter generated and channe lled to the astral body, is one of them. It limits the duration of any real time pro jection to the degre e of chakra developme nt and control. The Astral Projection This is where the astral body is pro jected into the astral dime nsion, where things are quite different from the real world. Time is distorted and extended, i.e., an hour in the astral can be like a few minutes in the physical dime nsion, depending on what part of the astral you are in. Reality is fluid and change able. The Lucid Dream This is where a person become s fully aware that they are dreaming during a dream. They either take some kind of conscious control over the course of events, or they convert the experience into an astral pro jection. Lucid dreaming is mo re similar to an astral pro jection than to an OOBE, as time and reality are distorted."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Astral Projection Or Lucid Dream? Ma ny astral pro jectors black out before ma king a conscious exit from their body and return to awareness in the astral dime nsion. You become aware after the actual separation from the physical body and are usually already in the astral dime nsion. If you miss the conscious exit from your body you are technically having a lucid dream, not an astral pro jection as you have become aware after separation. All three types of pro jection are closely related, i.e., they all involve the astral body separating from the physical and experiencing a reality separate from the physical body."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Part 2 Starting Out Part 2 Starting Out Starting Out After the physical body has fallen asleep, the astral body always pro jects into the physical world. Once the energy body has expanded, the astral body floats free and hovers just above the physical body, but within the expanded energy body's field of influence. Within this field, kno wn as cord activity range , the astral body is held close to the physical world as it is within a field of etheric ma tter. During a conscious astral pro jection it ma y appe ar as if you are pro jecting straight into an astral plane. But there is always an interme diary phase at the beginni ng, when you are existing as an astral form close to the physical dime nsion. This, real time part of any pro jection, ma y be missed if you black out at the mo me nt of pro jection. The area around the body, within cord activity range , is flooded with etheric ma tter and within this field the astral body is held in real time close to the physical dime nsion. Etheric Matter Etheric ma tter is the actual life force substance generated by all living things by simpl y being alive. It is a substance in-between physical ma tter and astral ma tter, part physical and part astral. This etheric ma tter has actual weight. It is a very refined substance in between ma tter"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"and energy and is similar to its coarser cousin, ectoplasm. There have been scientific studies done on this phenome na. Dying people in hospitals have had their beds placed on delicate scales shortly before death and hooked up to EEG and ECG mo nitors. In all cases, at the exact mo me nt of death, a sudden weight loss of appro xima tely one quarter of an ounce is observed. This is caused by a large amo unt of etheric ma tter being transferred into the astral body at the mo me nt of physical death. This is similar to the sudden transfer of etheric ma tter into the astral body during a near death experience where the body believes it is dying. This sudden, ma ssive transfer of etheric ma tter is the start of the death pro cess. Ectoplasm Ectoplasm has been studied in a similar fashion. Ma terialisation me diums have been placed on delicate scales and then asked to pro duced ectoplasm onto another set of fine scales. These me diums were observed to lose weight at exactly the same rate as the weighed ectoplasm gained weight. When the me dium reabsorbed the ectoplasm this weight transfer was reversed. Ectoplasm is pro duced by the chakra s. It converts part of the physical ma ss of the me diums body into another substance, ectoplasm."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Interdimensional Manifestation Any non-physical or disincarna te entity, including the astral body, in order to function, in real time , close to the physical dime nsion; mu st contain etheric ma tter. Without etheric ma tter, non-physical entities fade back into their dime nsion of origin. Etheric ma tter can only be obtained from living inhabitants of the physical world. Energy Flow The fame d \"Silver Cord\" does mo re than just tie the two bodies together. It is a true umb ilical cord, transmitting informa tion and energy between the physical and subtle bodies. It is seen by some pro jectors and not seen by others. Some time s it is seen ema nating from the navel, some time s from the forehead. The area the cord is seen ema nating from ma y depend on chakra activity. Whichever chakra is the stronge st, mo st active, could have control of energy flow to the subtle bodies. There is also the belief system of the pro jector to consider and the creative power of the subconscious mind. The cord will usually appe ar to be wherever you believe it will be, courtesy of the subconscious. Once the astral body enters the astral dime nsion it mu st have a good suppl y of astral energy from the chakra s in order to interact strongl y with that dime nsion. Clear astral me mo ry depends gre atly on the amo unt of energy available. As the astral dime nsion is the natural doma in"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"of the astral body, it will not fade out of it due to a lack of energy . As in the real world, if a person hasn't eaten or slept for a few days they don't dissolve into another dime nsion. They just get weak and listless and don't interact strongl y with the physical world. What it boils down to is this: The astral mind mu st have enough energy to give it strong, vivid me mo ries. These astral me mo ries mu st be strong enough to ma ke a good sized wrinkl e in the physical brain, so the physical mind can recall them when it wakes up. For exampl e, if you haven't slept for a few days you will be tired, listless and your interaction with reality will be weak and vague. If you see a mo vie in this tired state you will retain little me mo ry of it. Afterwards, you ma y only reme mb er fragme nts of it and your me mo ry of it will be a vague blur. If, however, you see a mo vie when you are well rested, fresh and full of energy , it is different. You take in everything about the mo vie and enjoy it. Your me mo ry of it will be crystal clear. This is similar to what happe ns after a low powered astral journe y. The astral body lacks energy and so does not have clear enough impre ssions of its journe y. This causes it to fail ma king its me mo ries the dominant ones when it returns return to the physical body.

This will not, however, stop you using them in a very basic way; to enhance your OOBE's and lucid dreams, at a very early stage in your developme nt. Raising energy and stimu lating the chakra s is extreme ly simpl e to do. This raised energy will automa tically flow into your astral body, prior to and during pro jection. By learning to raise energy and control the flow of power through the chakra s, the nature of your dreams, lucid dreams and OOBE's will change . They will become vivid and unforge ttable experiences. This, in a way, gives you a second life, full of rich experiences you can enjoy, learn and gro w from. Higher Levels And Their Buffer Zones The commo nly accepted name s for the seven kno wn levels of existence, from lowest to highest, are: Physical, Astral, Me ntal, Buddhic, Atmic, Anupadaka and Adi. These higher planes are similar in structure to the astral dime nsion but at a mu ch higher level of consciousness and are compl etely separate from it. In between the different levels are interme diary areas or buffer zones, some time s called lower sub planes. A good analogy for the different dime nsions and their buffer zones is the Earth's atmo sphere: If the air in the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Earth's atmo sphere was the astral dime nsion, the stratosphere would be the buffer zone and the vacuum of space would be the me ntal dime nsion. You can fly in the Earth's atmo sphere in a norma l air plane/astral body. A very powerful jet plane is needed to take you into the stratosphere, but you need a space ship/me ntal body, to travel through space. This explains why a different subtle body is needed to travel into these different levels of existence. The astral body can enter the buffer zones, or sub planes, of the dime nsions above and below the astral dime nsion, if it contains the correct type of energy . i.e. To exist in the buffer zone between the physical/astral levels (in real time ) the astral body mu st contain etheric energy . To exist in the buffer zone between the astral/me ntal levels it mu st contain me ntal energy . Higher Level Projection With enough control over the chakra s, the energy for these higher levels can be pro duced. The pro duction of one particular type of energy will raise the consciousness to that level and energise the corresponding subtle body. This is usually done by consciousness raising me ditation and advanced energy work on the chakra s. The consciousness can then experience that level of existence. If enough energy is available, and conditions are right, the me ditator can pro ject that particular subtle body"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"directly into its natural dime nsion. Depending on the skill and natural ability of the operator, if a higher body is energised and pro jected so, usually, are the lower ones. The astral body contains within it all the other subtle bodies and can, during a pro jection, pro ject the me ntal body into the me ntal dime nsion and so on. This will some time s give mu ltiple sets of me mo ries from the one pro jection. The general rule is, whichever subtle body contains the gre atest amo unt of energy , will have the stronge st me mo ries. These dominant me mo ries will be the ones retained by the physical mind upon its return to the waking state. Projecting consciously into levels higher than the astral dime nsion takes a high level of skill. You need to be pro ficient in both consciousness raising and chakra control, but it is achievable. I have, so far, pro jected into the Astral, Me ntal, Buddhic and Atmic levels of existence. It is commo nly believed that it is only possible for a huma n to pro ject into the Astral, Me ntal and Buddhic levels and not possible to pro ject into the higher Adi and Anupadaka. These dime nsions have been name d, and are described, so some one mu st have been there or they would be unkno wn. If you realise the true nature of the mind you will understand there are no limits. It was also once said that the sound barrier would never be broken. BTW: These dime nsions don't have signpo sts on them"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"saying Welcome to the Astral dime nsion, ta...d aa! or \"Me ntal dime nsion, watch your mind!\". So I will describe the higher levels I have been to using these accepted name s. The Astral Dimension This is a topsy-turvy world like Alice found in Wonderland. Everything seems objective (real) but is change able and fluid. Anything and everything can be found there, from base, coarse levels full of sexual energy ; to beautiful, serene places full of spiritual harmo ny. Time is distorted and extended there. An hour in the Astral can seem like only a few minutes here in the physical. Compa red to the physical world it is at a mu ch higher vibration. It's like playing a video tape at twenty time s norma l speed, although this is not appa rent when you are there. Mo ving amo ngs t the astral dream pools is usually a hit or miss affair for mo st pro jectors. It takes a lot of experience to ma ke planne d astral journe ys to specific realities. There are an infinite numb er of realities, planes, realms and dream pools in this dime nsion. As I stated before, they naturally strata and settle into pools of related thought. During sleep, or in a lucid dream, the subconscious mind usually creates one especially for you, your own personal dream theatre. When you become aware during a dream, you take control over it. This"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"control is taken over from the powerful subconscious mind. Without its powerful controlling influence, your personal custom created realm will change . You will begin tuning into other sympa thetic parts of the astral, and the reality you are in will mix with other realities and take on different aspects. In a conscious pro jection into the astral dime nsion, you can tune into any part of it and travel into different realities, other dream pools, or a mix of ma ny. There are various techniques for this but they all involve some way to disorient the subconscious mind, tricking it into mo ving you into a different Astral reality. Some pro jectors look at their hands and watch them me lt. Others spin around, causing left right reversals. These me thods all disorient the mind and trick the subconscious into tuning into another part of the astral. It's very difficult to describe how to mo ve amo ngs t the levels, you really have to learn by doing it, by trial and erro r. You have to learn how to use and control the subconscious mind, how to trick it for a specific result.

The bigge r the better, but standard poster size will do. Hang it on the wall of the room you are going to pro ject in, or another"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"room close by. Get a sma ll spotlight and set it so the poster is highlighted when the ma in light is turne d off, a norma l directional bedside lamp will do. Place the light under, or above, so the light spre ads out over it giving a diffused effect illuminating it, a bit like a mo vie screen. Entering your custom realm: When you pro ject, go towards the poster, keeping your mind blank. Don't think about what you are doing, just gaze at it and mo ve towards it. As you appro ach it in this way, your subconscious mind will be tricked into creating an astral realm exactly like the poster. Just mo ve up to and into the poster. It is like steppi ng into another world. Everything in this world will be exactly like in the poster. It will appe ar to be a norma l three dime nsional world, an exact copy, indistingu ishable from reality. To customise this world: Cut and paste sma ll pictures of things , or people, you want to find in this world with you when you enter it. Don't just stick a whole picture on the poster. Get scissors and cut around the object, or person. Try and find pictures that are appro xima tely the same scale as the poster. If you cut out a sma ll picture of some one, living or dead, your subconscious will create a thought form shell of them and they will be there waiting for you. This ma y be an excellent way of commu nicating with those that have died. Spirit Commu nication: (I have a theory) The subconscious creates this thought form shell of a person."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"This shell can be anima ted by the perfect, detailed me mo ry of your subconscious. But, if there is love there, between the pro jector and this created person, the spirit of this, deceased person, will be drawn to this scenario and will use this oppo rtunity to commu nicate with the pro jector, by anima ting the created ima ge of their body. The Akashic Records These are found in the buffer zone between the astral and me ntal worlds, part astral part me ntal and, in a way, extending into all levels. They are a record of every thought and event that has ever occurred, like a huge, infinite, me ntal history, picture book. The Akashic records also contain pro babilities stemmi ng from, and created by, past events, actions and thoughts. This is like looking into the future. To ma ke any kind of sense of the Akashic records yourself, some skill in clairvoyance is a definite help. If you tune into the Akashic records yourself you will norma lly see those events with the gre atest amo unt energy around them. Wars and disasters are the easiest to see because of this. The energy surro unding these events ma ke them stand out above all the rest, ma king them easier to see. If you look into the future, the area of pro babilities, you enter into a confusing ma elstrom of symb olism mixed with actual events. This future symb olism is caused by the belief systems of"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"the ma jor religions. Millions of people in the world have believed in some form of pro phecy for thousands of years. Whether it is the Bible's \"Book of Revelations\" or the pro phecies of No stradamu s. These ancient pro phecies are all richly steeped in symb olism. This symb olism affects the way people think and dream about the future. This symb olism, in turn, ma nifests in the Akashic records as symb olic repre sentations of future events. The symb olism is a big help, it ma kes consulting the Akashic records easier. You can use the Akashic symb olism as an index. For exampl e, the reference below to \"The Dogs of War\" is easily understandable as repre senting war. The \"Grim Reaper\" is a universal symb ol of death and destruction. So, if you are interested in this kind of future event you tune into this symb olic index for WAR, then browse through the category of past and future wars. Apart from some clairvoyant ability, a kno wledge of history, geogra phy, religious symb olism, current affairs world leaders and heads of state is a big help; when indexing past and future events. For exampl e, in the future vision I give below: If I had kno wn WHO the well kno wn person I saw addressing a crowd below WAS, and recogni sed the country; I could have ma de an accurate pre diction of future events instead of being wise, AFTER the event. I entered the state of consciousness called the Akashic"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"records. There I was inundated with a ma ss of symb olism. I was seeing in four dime nsions at once. My conscious mind did not assimilate this very well. I saw wars, famines, plagues, disasters, earthquakes, volcanoes erupting, plane crashes, mu rders, etc., it was terribly confusing and depre ssing. I saw one piece of symb olism I recogni sed though and tuned into it, indexed it. The Grim Reaper holding The Dogs of War (as described by various pro phets) These dogs were fearsome beasts with Red eyes and slavering jaws. They were held in check by this hooded figure, with an evil skull for a face, carrying a sickle. He released these dogs as I watched, symb olising a coming war. Tuning into this scene, I was there floating above it all, I could feel the sunshine and sme ll the city below me . I saw a ma n standing on a raised dais, under two giant scimitar swords. He was giving a charisma tic speech to ma ny thousands of people. One of the swords turne d into a Christian Crusader's broad sword. The ma n was Saddam Hu ssein, the scene was in Baghdad, at the mo nume nt to the unkno wn soldier. I saw this six mo nths before the Gulf war started. I did not learn WHO Saddam Hu ssein WAS, or WHE RE this scene took place though, until it was televised during the gulf war.

You have to select one of these thought records, tune into it and enter it. You will then live through the record as if you were really there, watching it as it happe ns. Consulting with the Akashic records can be done alone if you have the skill, but is norma lly done with the assistance of an advanced being from a higher level of existence. This is done as a sort of telepathic guided tour. The enormo us amo unt of informa tion and chaff is filtered out for you and the selected record, of past events or future pro bability, is pre sented to you clairvoyantly, via a telepathic link with the... librarian. Some people claim to have entered the Akashic Records and found some thing like a library there, with real books. The past, pre sent and future was recorded as text in these books. Some people even say they have read a record, then entered into it, and experience the record first hand. All these claims are consistent with the Akashic Records. These are librarian assisted guided tours, where the Akashic Records have been pre sented as some thing familiar, easy to use and easy to accept.

Calming The Mind Relaxation You mu st learn and ma ster, a full body relaxation exercise. If you kno w one already it can be adapted to suit. Here is a very simpl e one: Sit, or lie down, and relax. Starting with the feet, tense and relax them. Continue this with calves, thighs, hips, stoma ch, chest, arms , neck and face until your whole body is deeply relaxed.

Once you are in the trance state, pro jection on the astral body is relatively easy. Contemplation When you begin me ditation, you will be plagued with thoughts from your surface mind, which acts like a huge Me mo pad. It carries me ssages, reminders, pre ssing thoughts, pro blems to solve, unre solved issues etc. It is constantly busy, it NE VER rests, thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, one after the other, all clamo uring for attention. Before you attempt to clear your mind, with the breath awareness exercise below, it is wise to deal with these surface thoughts by the act of contempl ating them. Sit comfortably, do the relaxation exercise and think, nothing mo re, just think. Search out the stronge st thoughts in your mind and examine them, try to resolve and understand them. No te the word: THINK ING . Contempl ation does not involve clearing the mind, or visualisation. It requires you to THINK , deeply and thoroughly, about some thing, to gain a deeper understanding of its nature and how it relates to you, an insight. Breath Awareness Meditation This is a simpl e form of me ditation. It will clear your mind and focus your awareness."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Sit or lie down, close your eyes, do the relaxation exercise and clear your mind. Breathe deeply and slowly and focus on the breath entering and leaving your body. Feel it coming in and feel it going out. Focus your whole attention on your lungs and the breathing pro cess. This simpl e action is enough to occupy your surface mind. Firml y push intruding thoughts away, as they begin, before they can gather strengt h and distract you. Breath awareness occupies the surface mind and allows you to think on a mu ch deeper level. Surface Thoughts Sounds are very distracting, they generate surface thoughts. A car horn will generate: \"Who's that, what's happe ning? \" A door opening will generate: \"Who's coming in or going out?\" The surface mind is always very curious about what is happe ning around you. It wants to kno w all, and it wants to inform you of every little thing going on around you. It will pre ssure you to open your eyes, get up and go find out what's happe ning. Don't allow this to happe n. USE these anno ying, attention getting thoughts as a training aide. By learning to quash and igno re them, your powers of concentration will gro w.

Ma ny people say they can't clear their mind as they are too easily distracted by all the sma ll noises that surro und them, in norma l day to day activity. DON'T use mu sic or other sounds to blanke t these out, USE them for training. It's like weight lifting, if you train with feather dusters your strengt h will not increase. You need to ma ster this, the hard way, if you want to give your mind real mu scle. Slowly but surely you will ma ster the ability to clear your mind. Once accompl ished, you will have gained a valuable me ntal tool. You will be able to concentrate 100% of your attention, on one task, to the TOTAL exclusion of everything else.

NO THING breaks my concentration."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Concentration You mu st be able to concentrate and focus compl etely on what you are doing. Lack of concentration is the singl e, bigge st cause of pro jection failure. It affects every aspect of pro jection, from the relaxation exercise, to the trance state and actual pro jection. To test your ability to concentrate: Sit and relax. Close your eyes and clear your mind of ALL thought. Breath slowly and deeply and count each breath, at the end of each exhale. Ho ld it totally BLANK , apart from the counting, for as long as you can. See how long you can hold it like this. Be honest with yourself, every time a thought intrudes start counting from the beginni ng again. You are doing well if can do this for longe r than ten breaths. Ten breaths is, however, not long enough. Don't worry though, this can be impro ved on with the exercises below. Concentration Exercise (1) After ima ge retention: Relax, calm your mind, and look at a candle or a light bulb. Place this light in front of you, a couple of feet away, and stare fixedly at it for a minute or two. Close your eyes and concentrate on the after ima ge this will generate behind your closed eyelids. Try and keep sight of it for as long as possible.

Concentration Exercise (2) One point stare: Pick a spot on a wall and gaze at it. Don't focus on it, just gaze at it gently. Clear your mind of ALL thoughts and forcibly hold it blank. Concentrate HA RD, on breath awareness while you are doing this. When you feel a thought beginni ng, push it away, don't let it finish! Ho ld this for as long as you can. Do this several time s a day, or mo re if you can. Concentration Exercise (3) Energy breathing: Sit and relax. Close your eyes and clear your mind. Do the breath awareness exercise and ima gine the air you are breathing IN is brightly coloured energy of your favourite colour. Ima gine the air you are breathing OUT is a mu rky Grey, full of toxic waste. This is a purification exercise. It stimu lates your chakra s into absorbing energy on the inhale and getting rid of negative energy on the exhale. No te: Try your best not to tense up while you are doing these concentration exercises, it is ALL me ntal. In the beginni ng, it ma y feel as if you have to tense your mind into a tight ball to stop it thinki ng, but in time you will find the oppo site to be true. When you get used to it, clearing the mind is VERY relaxing."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Trance State When you have attained a deep level of relaxation and me ntal calmne ss, you will feel your body begin to get very, very heavy. This heaviness is the ma in sympt om of your brain waves changi ng from the Beta to the Alpha level as you enter a trance. The trance state is caused by deep physical and me ntal relaxation. There is nothing weird or superna tural about it. It simpl y me ans your body has entered the sleep state while your conscious mind is fully awake. How To Enter A Trance Do the relaxation exercise and calm your mind through breath awareness. Ima gine you are climb ing down a ladder in the dark. Don't visualise a ladder, just ima gine you can feel yourself doing it. On the exhale, feel yourself climb ing a step or two down the ladder with your ima ginary Hands (outlined below). On the inhale, feel yourself holding still on the ladder. What is needed is a me ntal falling effect inside your mind. This change s the level of brain wave activity from the awake level (Beta) to the asleep level (Alpha) or the deep sleep level (Theta). Once your level of brain wave activity reaches Alpha you will enter a trance. Keep doing this for as long as it takes. The time it takes to enter trance will vary, depending on your experience with deep relaxation and me ntal calmne ss."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"No te: Once you get the heavy feeling, stop the me ntal falling exercise. If you don't like the ladder, ima gine you are in a lift, feel yourself falling on the exhale and holding on the inhale. Or, Ima gine you are a feather, feel yourself floating down on the exhale and holding still on the inhale. As I stated above, you need a me ntal falling effect to lower your level of brain wave activity. This me ntal falling effect, when comb ined with deep relaxation and me ntal calmne ss, will cause you to enter the trance state. Feel free to use any scenario you are familiar with to bring about this going deeper feeling. A trance feels like: Everything gets quieter and you feel like you are in a mu ch bigge r place. There is a very slight hummi ng feeling in your body. Everything feels different. It feels a bit like putting a cardboard box over your head in the dark, you can feel the atmo sphere change . It's like everything goes fuzzy or slightly blurred. Any sharp noises, while in trance, feel like a physical blow to the Solar Plexus. Deep Trance The level of trance you achieve depends gre atly on your relaxation, concentration skills and will power. To enter a deeper trance, i.e., Theta level and beyond, you have to concentrate mu ch mo re and for mu ch longe r, on the me ntal falling sensation aided by breath awareness. The"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"first level of trance, i.e., when you get very heavy, is quite deep enough for pro jection. I strongl y advise against forcing yourself deeper than a light trance, until you have plenty of experience with the trance state. Ho w can you tell if you are entering a deep trance? There are four very noticeable sympt oms: 1.An uncomfortable feeling of cold that doesn't ma ke you shiver, coupled with a steady loss of body heat. 2.Me ntally, you will feel very odd and everything will feel extreme ly slooooow. Your thought pro cesses will slow down as if you had been given a strong pain killing injection. 3.You will feel disassociated from your body, i.e., a strong floating sensation and everything will seem far away. 4.Total physical Paralysis. No te: These four things , ALL TOGETHE R, signi fy you are entering a deep trance. Do not mistake the mild floating sensation you some time s get with light trance, i.e., as you astral body come s loose. Or the slight loss of body heat from sitting still for a long time and the mild paralysis, i.e., the heaviness, for a deep trance. The sensation of deep trance is quite uncomfortable and unmi stakable for what it is. It is very difficult to get into the deep trance state, as you need highly developed relaxation, concentration and"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"trance state skills plus lots and lots of will power and me ntal energy . You will not accidentally fall into it. If you are worried you are going too deep, reme mb er this: You CAN pull yourself out of it at any time . Concentrate ALL your will on mo ving your finge rs or toes. Once you can mo ve a finge r or toe, flex your hands, mo ve your arms , shake your head, i.e., reanima te your body; and get up and walk around for a few minutes. Falling into a deep trance should not be a pro blem with these exercises. I have seen ma ny people in me ditation gro ups etc., enter a light trance and not be able to pull themselves out of it, i.e., they float away with the faeries. Usually some kind person will talk them out of it or ma ssage their wrists etc. to get them to come back to reality. This is unne cessary and is the result of lop- sided training, i.e., no concentration or will power training. The person only THINK S they canno t come back and therefore does not try very hard. It is also a good way of getting attention from the gro up. No te: Your mind is extreme ly powerful and has vast untappe d resources. It can do ANY THING , no limits, if it is trained, conditioned and pro perly mo tivated. Energy Body Expansion At some point after entering the trance state, you will feel a mild paralysis come over you. This will soon be"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"accompa nied by a deepening vibration and a buzzing feeling all over. You ma y also feel like you are huge and swollen. The paralysis, vibrations and the huge feeling are sympt oms of the energy body expanding and the astral body loosening. This is part of the norma l sleep pro cess. The energy body expands and opens in order to accumu late and store energy . During this, the astral body drifts free, slightly out phase with the physical body. Trance Familiarity Ma ny people blow their pro jection simpl y because they are not used to the trance state. They think it is a briefly opened window into the Astral dime nsion. This is simpl y NO T true. If you stay me ntally and physically calm when you enter the trance state, you can ma intain it for hours. I regularly spend several hours at a time in the trance state, during me ditation. If, when you enter trance, you think: \"Yes! I've done it!...I'm in a trance! Gotta hurry and get out quick...b efore it stops!\" You'll blow it for sure! The trance will be ended by the simpl e act of getting over excited, i.e., breaking relaxation and me ntal calmne ss. It's a good idea to spend time in the trance state, just getting used to it, before you try and pro ject. Just relax, stay calm, focus on breath awareness, and hold the trance. It won't end until you want it to. Get used to how it feels."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"When you are comfortable doing this, do the energy raising and chakra stimu lation exercises, below, in trance. No te: 1. You do not HA VE to be in a trance to learn energy and chakra work, it just works better in trance. 2. Trance pra ctise can be done lying down, but is best done in a comfortable arm chair. Your astral body will be loose in the trance state, so try lifting your astral arms and legs out, one at a time . Use your HA ND S to do this, as shown in the next section. Focus and FEEL your awareness in an arm and slowly lift it free of your body. You ma y feel a slight tickling or localised dizziness inside your arm or leg, as you do this. Lift your astral arm up and look at it, with your eyes closed, but DON'T mo ve a mu scle. In this state you should be able to see it through your closed eyelids, but don't worry if you can't, this will come later. Lifting your astral arms free is good pra ctise for pro jection. Later, you will use these astral arms to pull your astral body free of the physical. Tactile Imaging Tactile ima ging is a perception or FEELING of localised bodily awareness. Your hands are very closely linke d to your bodily awareness. They are intima tely aware of every part of your body. Ima ginary HA ND S, outlined below, is only"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"an extension of this (hand to body) awareness. When you are asked to feel your awareness, in any part of your body, PRETEND your hands, your real hands, are going to touch that area of your body. Then use the awareness this generates in that area to ima gine your ima ginary HA ND S are there. Keep your eyes closed and hold your hands out a foot or so in front of your face. Concentrate, FEEL where they are and try and SEE them through the blackne ss behind your closed eyes. Cross your wrists, slowly mo ve them about, turn your hands over, open and close your finge rs. Look hard, concentrate, as if you were trying to see in the dark, and you will see a faint mo ving shadow in your minds eye, where your hands and arms are. Close your eyes and touch the tip of your nose with the index finge r of your right hand. You'll find you can accurately put that finge r on any part of your body with your eyes closed. Try it, put your hand, your real hand, on different parts of your body like this. You kno w exactly where your hands are at all time s, you can sense and feel where they are. If you observe what is happe ning in your mind, while you are doing this, you will notice you become aware of the part of your body you are going to touch, the instant you ma ke the decision to touch it. Go over your whole body like this, getting used to the sensation of awareness it generates in different areas of"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"your body. What is happe ning is this: Part of your mind is shifting into, and HIGHL IGHT ING , the area you are going to touch, in order to guide your hand to the exact spot. Your mind shifts part of its awareness to this spot and acts like a homing beacon for your hand. The ability to shift your awareness into different parts of your body like this is VITAL to energy work and this pro jection me thod. No te: You do not have to actually visualise these HA ND S, i.e., see or ima gine you can see them. It is ALL tactile, NO T visual. You just have to be able to pre tend to FEEL them doing some thing, like you are rehearsing some simpl e action in your mind. I originally developed this technique for blind people. Blind people canno t visualise AT ALL, if they have been blind since birth, but they do have a very keen sense of bodily awareness. The ma jority of sighted people also have gre at trouble with visualisation of any kind, and all pro jection techniques depend heavily on visualisation. This being the case, I developed a pro jection technique that does NO T depend on visualisation to exert pre ssure on the astral body to separate.

Chakra s are non-physical orga ns that transform raw subtle energy into mo re subtle, and useable, forms of energy , of a different type. The chakra s do not, themselves, contain energy .

This living energy field can be tappe d, mo re deeply, by the appl ication of focussed, creative will. It can be drawn into the huma n body and transforme d, by the chakra system, into a mo re subtle and useable form of energy . The chakra s are attached to the spinal cord and nervous system via certain glands and nerve gangl ia. The full chakra system is extreme ly compl ex. There are 7 ma jor and over 300 minor chakra s in the huma n body. There are also several non-physical chakra s situated outside of the body. Detailed ma ps of the chakra system and their conne cting me ridians and pathways, have been used for thousands of years in Eastern my sticism and me dicine, i.e., acupuncture. The chakra system is used with every psychic ability, no exceptions. Whatever the psychic ability, the me thod of developme nt or the termi nology used to describe it, it is all done the same way, through chakra stimu lation. It is impo ssible to ma nifest any psychic ability without first stimu lating the chakra s. Ma ny people will deny this, above, and claim they have never done any chakra , energy work, but still have psychic abilities. There are ma ny ways to develop yourself, agre ed, but they all, directly or indirectly, stimu late the chakra system. And let's not forge t natural ability. Ma ny people are born with naturally active chakra s and hence, natural psychic ability. Me diums are people who exhibit psychic abilities when"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"aided by a nonph ysical spirit entity. This entity stimu lates the chakra s of the me dium directly, by me lding with the me dium and causing psychic abilities, clairvoyance, channe lling, healing, pro duction of ectoplasm etc. to ma nifest through the me dium. This is why they are called Me diums or channe ls, i.e., they have the ability to become a passive vehicle for a spirit entity to affect, or commu nicate with, the physical world. You do not need a spirit entity to develop and use, a psychic ability. If you learn to control your own chakra s and energy , you can do these things on your own, with no spirit entity involved, and without the inherent risk involved with that me thod.

Just like you did when you used these HA ND S with breath awareness and colour breathing, pulling air and energy into your lungs .

Do this over and over again, pulling energy to the Base chakra , for at least a few minutes. You ma y or ma y not feel anything while you do this. Even if you don't, you are still drawing some energy with this exercise. The amo unt of energy drawn up through you will increase as the chakra s develop with time and use. From the feet, up the legs to the base centre, is a natural path for the energy that flows through you. This energy will stimu late your chakra s and they will transform this, basic energy , into energy of a different type. This transforme d energy will then flow into your subtle bodies, energising them. With pra ctise, you will actually FEEL this energy tingl ing and surging through you. Chakra Stimulation Opening a chakra : Your ima ginary HA ND S are used for this. Ima gine you are tearing open a bread roll at the site of a chakra when you are asked to do this. You don't have to visualise anything, just FEEL like you are doing this, as if you were doing it in real life without looking at what you are doing. Chakra s are non-physical centres, so you need a non physical me thod to stimu late them. This is achieved by focusing your awareness in the area of a chakra and using your mind to ma nipulate it.

Chakra Sensations The sensations you will feel in your chakra s can vary, according to the degre e of activity occurring in them, i.e., your physical ma ke up, natural ability, concentration and relaxation skills affect this. It can vary from a gentle warmt h, a localised pre ssure, or bubbling (like stoma ch wind), a localised dizziness, a tingl ing, a gentle pulsing, to a heavier throbbing, or a comb ination of some or all of the above.

Once it is working pro perly, you will feel a gentle pulsing or throbbing between your legs, at the site of the chakra . Solar Plexus Chakra : This can some time s cause a shortness of breath feeling, which can cause you to hyper-ventilate. This will pass, with time and use, as the chakra stabilises. Heart Chakra : The heart chakra me rits special me ntion due to the strong, and some time s frightening, sensation it can cause.

It is not your heart racing but the chakra working. I kno w this is easier said than done, igno ring it, but with pra ctise and familiarity you can. This racing is mo re appa rent in the early stages of developme nt. I think this is caused by a lack of energy flowing from the lower centres. In a way it is like a pump racing, when it does not have enough fluid to pump.

Throat Chakra : The throbbing in it can cause a very mild choking feeling, because of the sensitive area it is in. This feels some thing like having an emo tional lump in the base of your throat. Crown Chakra : When fully active it feels like a thousand soft, warm finge rs gently ma ssaging the inside of the top of your head, above the hairline, and extending down in the centre of the forehead, to include the brow chakra , which is part of it.

How Long Does It All Take? Ma ny people have asked me \"Ho w long does it take to learn pro jection?\" My answer is: Because everybody has different levels of natural ability and skill, it will take as long as it takes. I have had letters from people, who have been trying various other me thods for several years, but with no results; get out the very first time they tried this technique. Other people, with NO relaxation or concentration skills at all, are looking at several mo nths training before they will get out."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Part 5 Astral Rope Technique Part 5 Astral Rope Technique Astral Rope A key ingre dient to the new pro jection techniques is an invisible, ima ginary ROPE hangi ng from your ceiling. This ROPE will be used to exert dynamic pre ssure at a singl e point on your astral body to force its separation from the physical. The ROPE technique is similar, but mo re direct and hence mo re effective than other mo re passive and indirect me thods, such as reaching out and pulling vibrations into you, or visualizing yourself in front of yourself. The idea of pulling vibrations into you is vaguely illogical, if you understand the me chanics of pro jection. The vibrations are an effect and NO T a cause of pro jection. When enough pre ssure is exerted on the astral body to loosen it sufficiently, the energy body expands and energy flows through the chakra system to be stored in the energy body. This flow of energy through the hundreds of chakra s and their conne cting web, or me ridians, CAUSES these vibrations. This norma lly happe ns, unno ticed, during sleep. Putting The Pressure On The mo re passive, indirect me thods of pro jection do exert some pre ssure on the astral body to separate, but over a wide area. They still shift the point of consciousness out"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"of the body, albeit obtusely. Any me ntal action that exteriorizes the point of consciousness will exert some pre ssure on the astral body. The action of pulling yourself hand over hand up a rope is a strong, one pointed, natural action that is easy to ima gine yourself doing. The ROPE technique concentrates ALL your me ntal resources into one strong, DYNA MIC action which exerts a high level of pre ssure directly on a singl e point of the astral body. There are ma ny other, mo re subtle, ways that exert pre ssure on the astral body as well. Ma ny of these are unsuspected for what they are. Mo st me ditation exercises, for exampl e, exert PASSIVE pre ssure on the astral body. You ma y ima gine you are going down in a lift, falling, climb ing down a ladder, or just floating downwards. Whatever the technique, it is designe d to reduce brain activity. Any self induced, inward falling sensation places passive pre ssure on the astral body, which will cause brain activity to lower and bring on the trance state where a deeper level of the mind is revealed. The action of inward falling obtusely shifts the consciousness out of the body, exerting passive pre ssure on the astral body over a wide area, but in the reverse to that needed for pro jection, i.e., general downwards pre ssure. This, in a way, is like trying to get your astral body to FALL out of your physical body on its own, i.e., your point of consciousness tries to FALL, downwards,"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"out of the physical body. What mo st people do to pro ject is to either exert forward, passive pre ssure on the astral body, by visualizing themselves floating out of themselves, and HO PE, they can ma ke it happe n, i.e., trigge r the pro jection reflex. Or, they try a mo re direct me thod, such as visualizing themselves out of their body, which is very, very, difficult. Lets face it, 99% of people can't visualize for peanuts and the act of me ntally visualizing yourself OUT of your body, AND shifting your consciousness INT O this visualization is almo st impo ssible for mo st people. The other popular me thod is to try to pull vibrations into you. This me thod is slightly mo re effective than mo st as it exerts some pre ssure at a singl e point, but it is still an indirect me ntal action and, therefore, obtuse. All the above, and the general lack of informa tion about the me chanics of pro jection, i.e., HO W it happe ns, accounts for the extreme ly high failure rate amo ngs t people learning to pro ject. Ho lding passive pre ssure, over a wide area, on the astral body, for long enough, WILL activate the pro jection reflex, eventually. But this can take a long time and can be me ntally exhausting. I have developed, through recent research, a better, faster and mo re dynamic me thod of pro jection that is very effective. I call this technique simpl y ROPE. It is not that using an ima ginary rope for pro jection is such a new idea, it's not, but the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"understanding of the me chanics of it and the appl ication of this kno wledge to ROPE is.

The new ROPE me thod overcome s the general misdirection of me ntal resources and the chronic waste of me ntal energy caused by the usual lengt hy pro cedures needed for pro jection. ROPE shortens the time needed to cause a pro jection and optimizes the use of available energy . One of the mo st impo rtant ingre dients for a successful pro jection is to be pro perly mo tivated. Without this mo tivation you will not have enough me ntal energy to succeed and will either fall asleep or forge t the pro jection afterwards. It is, therefore, impo rtant to keep pre paration time as short as possible so it is not such a daunting and me ntally exhausting task. One thing a new pro jector has in abundance is enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is pure me ntal energy . ROPE, plus the understanding of HO W it works, harne sses and ma kes better use of this energy resource and vastly impro ves the success rate.

They are, however, not all needed, in themselves, for the pro jection pro cess.

This can cause me ntal exhaustion and you ma y find yourself short of energy and willpower for the all impo rtant exit. All the exercises should be done separately from the pro jection itself. They are training and developme nt exercises, designe d to impro ve control over body and mind and to increase the flow of energy through the chakra s. This is like working out in a gym as a part of football training.

The whole point of learning to pro ject is to get your astral body to separate from the physical while fully conscious. The earlier you get a fully conscious pro jection the better. Otherwise, you ma y eventually give it all up as just too difficult. Therefore, I strongl y sugge st all beginne rs concentrate on the simpl est, mo st effective way of getting a conscious pro jection. Once you have some pro jection experiences under your belt you can try for some of the mo re advanced, and hence, mo re difficult, types of pro jection.

You have begun to develop (MB A) (mo bile bodily awareness) and how to use MB A, i.e., using your ima ginary HA ND S to pre form certain tasks both inside and outside of your body. You have also begun to awaken and develop your chakra s so your energy flow is stronge r and you have, hopefully, spent time getting used to being in trance.

First, here is the full sequence for advanced, real time pro jection. Full Sequence Do relaxation exercises thoroughly. 1.

Visualization wastes valuable me ntal energy that can be better put to use exerting direct pre ssure on your astral body. You will feel a slight dizzy sensation inside you as you do this, specifically in your uppe r torso. This is caused by exerting dynamic pre ssure on the astral body.

B.If you have not ma stered using your ima ginary HA ND S for relaxation, raising energy and chakra work, you ma y have difficulty using them for climb ing the ROPE. This does not me an you have to be able to open your chakra s successfully to pro ject using this me thod, you don't, it just helps if you can. This me thod is very direct.

What is needed, apart from the ability to"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"concentrate, is the ability to carry out strong me ntal actions, without any corresponding mu scular action, i.e., you have to be able to separate me ntal and physical actions. If you have trouble with any part of the ROPE me thod, analyse it, find the pro blem area, then go back and concentrate on the related training exercises until you overcome the pro blem. A ROPE Variation No te: One good variation for the simpl e ROPE technique, is to do the full sequence of exercises and energy , chakra work first, but separate from, the actual pro jection. Do the full sequence, but `don't' close your chakra s. Get up and have a break, ma ke yourself comfortable, have a drink etc. Then return to your bed /chair fresh, spend a couple of minutes relaxing and go straight to your ROPE. This will increase the amo unt of chakra energy available during the pro jection. The Mechanics OF How ROPE Works ROPE is the mo st dynamic pro jection me thod to date and can override the need to do just about anything else, once it is learne d. Let me explain a little mo re of the me chanics of what actually happe ns when you use ROPE, by breaking it down:"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Clearing The Mind: The me ntal act of climb ing the ROPE fully occupies and clears the mind. Brain Wave Activity: Clearing the mind and exerting, one pointed, dynamic pre ssure on the astral body, forces the reduction of brain wave activity. Deep Relaxation: Reducing brain wave activity forces the body into a deep level of relaxation. Trance State: Exerting dynamic pre ssure on the astral body, while the physical body is deeply relaxed, and brain wave activity is at a low level, FORCES the mind and body into the trance state. The Chakras: Exerting dynamic pre ssure on the astral body, while in trance, FORCES the energy body to expand and the chakra s to open. Vibrations: Exerting dynamic pre ssure on the astral body while the energy body is in its expanded state and the chakra s are open causes energy to flow through the 300 odd chakra s in the body and causes the vibrational state. Separation: Exerting dynamic pre ssure on the astral body while the energy body is in its expanded, vibrational state forces the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"astral body to separate from the physical. Note: If you exert enough pre ssure on the astral body, during the final phase of the pro jection sequence, the exit, it will override the pro jection reflex compl etely. This forces a ma nual separation of the physical / astral bodies. This means: Instead of involuntarily buzzing out of your body via the pro jection reflex, at the clima x of the pro jection, and ending standing at the foot of your bed etc., you will exit your body in the direction you are pulling on the ROPE. How Long Does It All Take? The whole pro jection pro cess can be done in less than fifteen minutes, I can do it in under five minutes. The speed of the me thod allows you to use ALL your available energy in one burst. If you don't get out in the first fifteen minutes I doubt if you will during that attempt . IF this is the case, either get up and have a break and come back to it later, or get some sleep. Using the ROPE me thod, literally, ama zed me with it's ease and simpl icity the first time I used it. It shortened my usual pro jection time (20-30 minutes, from a cold start) to about 5 minutes, for a norma l astral pro jection.

My First ROPE Projection Here is an account of the first time I tried ROPE, while I was developing it as a viable theory: I laid down on my bed, I was thinki ng of my new theory. I had been working out a pro jection technique that blind people could do. A technique that did not require ANY optical visualization. I had come up with the idea of using the sense of touch to exert pre ssure on the astral body, tactile ima ging, as this sense is strongl y developed in blind people. I lay there for a few minutes, mu lling it over in my mind, while I generally relaxed and settled my self, ready for sleep. Then I decided to try it out, to see if it was pra ctical. No te: I did not do any of the usual relaxation, me ntal calming or chakra energy exercises. I just wanted to see if I could exert pre ssure on my astral body with this me thod. I reached out my ima ginary hands and began climb ing the ROPE, hand over hand. I imme diately felt a sensation of vertigo in my stoma ch and uppe r torso and a dizzy feeling inside my bones, like a tickling inside my arms and legs. I snappe d my mind shut, stoppe d all thought, and focussed my will on the climb ing action. I could feel the enormo us pre ssure it was exerting on my astral body,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"my astral head and uppe r torso was starting to lift free, trying to go up the ROPE following the line of pre ssure I was creating. Still pulling, I felt my brain waves drop into the alpha state and the heavy sensation came over me as I entered trance. I kept pulling and the trance deepened, my body was now paralysed. Still pulling, my chakra s opened and the vibrations started. I was ama zed, I had only been doing this for a couple of minutes! I kept pulling and my astral body soon buzze d free of the physical. This was compl etely different from any other pro jection I had ever done. The pro jection reflex did not seem to have time to cut in and pro ject me out of my body. I had, literally, pulled my self free on my own. I floated above my physical body, still aware of my self on the bed. I went to go through the wall into the lounge , where there was mo re light, as it was pre tty dark in my room. Suddenly I was in a strange world. \"Where the hell am I\" I thought. There was very dim light and there was a damp fog all around me . There was a large building in front of me with an old fashioned thatched roof. To the side of me was an old rail fence ma de of ma ssive, rough hewn timb ers. I leaned against the fence and thought about it all. I looked past the house and saw the reflection of water.

It gre w back as I concentrated on visualizing what it should look like, but started to me lt again as soon as I stoppe d concentrating. Then it hit me , why this scene was so familiar to me , I was in a picture! I have a large picture hangi ng on the wall in my room, in the exact position where I had tried to pass through the wall. This picture has an old house with a thatched roof and a rough hewn fence around it. There is a lake behind it and it is early dawn, when the sun is just starting to illuminate things . There was no doubt about it, I was in my picture. I'd had enough of this, it was too dim to enjoy the pro jection, or to do anything. I focussed on my physical body, which I could still feel. I concentrated on mo ving my mo uth and eyes and this soon brought me back to my physical body. I sat up in bed and thought about it while I recorded the results of my experime nt. Settling back down again I tried climb ing the ROPE again. Within a couple of minutes I was back out of my body again. \"This is gre at,\" I thought! I hovered above my body and looked about the room. There in the gloom was the picture on the wall, the one I had entered by accident.

Everything felt real about it, the fence felt like wood and even the air sme lled different, it had a farm like, swampi sh sme ll about it. Leaving the picture again and returning to my body, I again wrote everything down in my notebook. I lay there for mo st of the night, thinki ng about what had happe ned, mu lling over the impl ications of it all, what it all me ant....

Remembering It All One of the bigge st pro blems with any kind of conscious OOBE is reme mb ering it all when you wake up. Here's what you can do about this not reme mb ering. As soon as you wake up, sit up in bed and pull those me mo ries back. Sit up and think hard. Put aside a few minutes quiet time each mo rning to do this. It will train your dream me mo ry. During this quiet time , run key phrases through your"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"mind until you hit on some thing. Say things like: I looked at my watch and... I looked at my hands and... I was walking... I was talking to... I was just going to... I was over at... I was flying over... I was having a... I was inside a... I was with... These are exampl es of phrases that can lead you to a fragme nt of dream me mo ry you can lock on to. Ma ke up some mo re phrases to suit yourself. It ma y feel like there is nothing in your mind to reme mb er, but try hard and put some REAL effort into it. They are there, you just have to reach in and locate them. Once you lock onto a fragme nt of me mo ry, mo re can be located and mo re and mo re. You will be surpri sed how mu ch you can reme mb er this way. It is impo rtant to write these down as soon as you reme mb er them. Even if you have to do this several time s during the night.

Just write down a few key words and you can fill in the blanks later. With pra ctise, this writing down can be dispensed with as your astral recall develops. Stuck ?

There are two possible reasons for this: If you are stuck in the middle, stoma ch area, it ma y be diet related, i.e., a heavy pro tein or me at me al before pro jection can cause this. Remedy: Eat a light me al, eat plenty but have fish or white me at instead of red me at and avoid fats, oils, nuts and cheese. If you are stuck at the head, or some other part, this is a sign of an inactive chakra , possibly caused by an energy blockage. Remedy: Concentrate on opening this stuck chakra during the energy exercises. If this happe ns during your pro jection sequence, stop everything and open that chakra , you will be in trance so it will be easier. Once you have done some work on it, try pulling on the ROPE again."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Part 6 Mo re on the Rope Part 6 Mo re on the Rope Technique Technique More On Rope ROPE is a very effective pro jection technique, but it still has to be learne d to be effective. I would like to elaborate on a couple of points about the technique, inspired by the feedback I have received so far. 1. There is NO visualisation required - AT ALL - in the ROPE technique. It is ALL tactile ima ging. This me ans you do NO T have to picture yourself doing it. That is, to climb ROPE, the correct me ntal action is to REHE ARSE the climb ing action in your mind. * This me ntal rehearsal - IS - the ROPE technique * 2. You need to *me ntally* grit your teeth and strain with the action, i.e., you have to put ma ximu m me ntal effort into it, as if you were really climb ing a ROPE, but without allowing your mu scles to take part in it - this is ALL me ntal. Your body mu st not be allowed to respond. You also need to feel you are very strong, full of energy and could climb like this all night. 3. You will find that a certain way of holding the focus of your mind, while you climb , will exert mo re pre ssure on your astral body than another. It is VERY impo rtant you note what this is and learn how to"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"appl y it. This will tune your climb ing action for the ma ximu m effect. When you hit on the right me ntal focus for the action, you will feel a corresponding dizzy /falling sensation in your Solar Plexus. 4. To use ROPE successfully, it is extreme ly impo rtant to ma ke a firm decision to DO IT. This commi tme nt is VERY impo rtant to success. A DO OR DIE effort is needed. This focuses all your me ntal energy into a singl e point, for a singl e purpo se - to exit your body. 5. Ma ny people have ema iled me with ROPE success stories. In every case - they have been pra ctising ROPE when they suddenly decided to give it a go - TO REALLY DO IT! This commi tme nt to succeed me ans the difference between actually getting out - OOBE - and experiencing various levels of ROPE induced relaxation, trance, paralysis, chakra activity etc. I canno t stress enough the impo rtance of this commi tme nt to the success of ROPE induced OOBE. 6. While using ROPE, compl etely IGNO RE ALL PHY SICAL SENSA TION AND ANY NO ISES YOU HE AR. If you react to a sensation, in any way, you will lose the focus of your me ntal energy and dilute your effort considerably. All the energy /chakra work and other exercises in Parts 3 and 4, are designe d to stimu late the flow of energy in your body and increase concentration, will power and"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"me ntal control. By increasing the energy flow during a pro jection and controlling your mind better, your duration in real time is increased. It is also easier to exit. You CAN skip all the exercises entirely and just concentrate on learning ROPE. Everyone has different levels of skill, natural ability and energy flow. Some people need lots of training in order to OOBE, others do not. Some people will pre fer to learn ROPE by DOING it, rather than training for it. If your goal is just to have a conscious OOBE, of any kind, the simpl e use of ROPE, below, is your best option. Simple Use Of Rope Some people have the impre ssion ROPE is too compl icated. This was possibly because by the detailed explanation I gave about the me chanics of ROPE in Part 5, i.e., HO W it works. ROPE is THE simpl est pro jection technique to date. All that is needed to use ROPE in its simpl est form, are these two steps: 1. Go to bed, or sit in your chair, relax and settle yourself down, as you norma lly would do before going to sleep. 2. Start climb ing the ROPE. * This is all there is to the simpl e use of ROPE * As there are no time consuming exercises or compl icated relaxation exercises involved, the simpl e use of ROPE has"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"ma ny advantages. It allows you to focus all your me ntal resources on it. In ma ny cases this is all that is needed to give you your first conscious OOBE. Because the simpl e use of ROPE is less compl ex, you will find yourself attempt ing pro jection mo re often, even when you are tired one of the best time s to try - and canno t be bothered with anything compl icated. The increased frequency of your pro jection attempt s gives you mo re pra ctise with ROPE and hence the technique will be ma stered sooner. Lucid Dream Backup I have had a gre at ma ny reports of vivid dreams and heightened lucid dream activity (L.D.) from people doing the energy /chakra training exercises. This is happe ning far too frequently for it to be coincidence. The energy /chakra work increases the level of energy flowing into the energy body and heightens awareness and me mo ry of the dream and OOBE state. It is a shame to waste all this energy on uncontrolled dreams, so I sugge st L.D. be used as a secondary goal. This will give you OOBE experience earlier, in the form of L.D., and help keep your interest high until you learn how to do the conscious exit. Lucid Dreaming To become Lucid in dream you need to pro gra m yourself"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"with a trigge r to ma ke you realise when you are dreaming, in order to take control over it, i.e., become lucid. The best way of doing this is by getting into the habit of doing frequent reality checks during your daily life. Reality Checking A reality check is when you stop what you are doing and check the reality level of your situation. This is simpl e to do. Every time you do a reality check. Ask yourself: 1. Is this a norma l situation, is there anything strange about it? 2. Can I fly? Try floating up in the air. 3. Try closing your eyes. This is a dead giveaway as you canno t close your eyes in astral form. No te: This reality checking mu st become habitual to be effective. When you do a reality check during a dream, you will realise you are dreaming and can take control of it. It is then impo rtant to affirm to yourself you are going to reme mb er everything. Tell yourself over and over, \" I will reme mb er this when I wake up.\" L.D. Trigger The key to success with reality checks is to have a good trigge r for it. This should be some thing you would norma lly do ma ny time s a day. This can be any kind of"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"habitual action, but here are a few ideas: 1. Time: Every time you look at your watch, do a reality check. An electronic watch is a good aid. Set the time r to beep hourly. When it beeps, do a reality check. * A wrist watch, beeping hourly, is the mo st effective 2. Hands: Every time you notice your hands, do a reality check. 3. Smoking: If you smo ke, every time you have a cigarette, do a reality check. You will usually find yourself reaching for a cigarette during the course of a dream, if you are a habitual smo ker. No te: It takes time to ma ke your trigge r habitual, usually a few weeks. It also helps to do a few affirma tions before you go to sleep, e.g., \"I will reme mb er to look at my watch\" When you become aware in a dream, L.D., you should already be in a commu nal dream pool. If you want to try changi ng this to a real time pro jection, try and become aware of your physical body. If you can sense it, you ma y be able to return to a time location near it. This is difficult, though, and ma y end the experience compl etely, i.e., forcing a return to the waking state. I sugge st you enjoy the L.D. for what it is. Commu nal dream pools are very colourful places and usually lots of fun. You will see all kinds of weird and wonderful things there and have all kinds of adventures."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"No te: To impro ve your me mo ry of the L.D. don't forge t to remind yourself constantly during the L.D., to reme mb er it all. Changing Your Reality Location If you don't like the dream pool you are in, or are in a real time OOBE and want to enter a dream pool, here are a couple of ways to do it: 1. Look closely at your hands and watch them me lt. (This is worth doing just to see the me lting hands phenome non). 2. Spin around until you become disoriented. 3. Visualise a place you would like to be. (Instantaneous travel). This will usually mo ve you to a dream pool similar to your visualised targe t destination. 4. Fly straight up, as fast as you can. If this fails to shift your reality location, at least you will experience space flight. 5. Fly away fast, close to the surface, until you find a place you like. The blurring of speed will cause a reality shift. 6. Walk into a mirro r, picture or painting. This is the same as VRP (virtual reality pro jection). These techniques all trick the subconscious, through disorientation, into mo ving you to another reality location."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Astral Form In Motion Ma ny people have mo tion pro blems in their first few pro jections. Simpl y getting across a room in the right direction, can be a ma jor accompl ishme nt. This lack of control is simpl y because they are unfamiliar with astral form. It is like being in zero gra vity. You have to learn to mo ve all over again. When you pro ject in real time , you are just a point of consciousness with a poorly constructed etheric shell surro unding it. Mo tion is pro vided by thought - not mu scles. Astral Momentum There is a type of mo me ntum in astral form that causes mo st of the pro blems. This causes you to continue mo ving for a while, after you decide to stop. This ma y take you through a wall or a ceiling etc. This impe tus is caused by the thought you used to cause the mo tion. If it is too strong, or too pro longe d for the action, you will mo ve too quickly or too far. Only pra ctise teaches you how to get about with any degre e of accuracy and gra ce. It really is quite a comical pro cess, learning astral mo tion. I reme mb er learning to mo ve about my home town, in my youth. I would start by trying to navigate through my house, usually ending up stuck in the roof, for a while. Then I would run down the road, trying to build up speed and take off like a plane. I would get airborne for a while, but could never quite clear the roof tops of"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"the surro unding houses. I would often float unintentionally into strange houses, blundering about like a drunk in zero G. I seeme d to be endlessly apologising to all these strange rs in passing, as I floated in and out of their houses. How To Move To mo ve about in astral form, simpl y - DO IT. Do not think about what you are doing, just DO IT. Be aware that mo tion is pro vided by your mind. You have to will yourself into mo tion, to change direction, and to stop. This is the best advice I can give you on this. It really has to be learne d by doing. Have fun. When you have learne d basic mo tion, do not try anything too amb itious for a while. Stick close to the surface and learn to get around your local area first. Practise varying your speed until you gain some control over it. Learning To Fly Learn to fly the same way as you learne d to mo ve, by using your mind. At first you ma y find some thing very mu ch like gra vity affecting you. You ma y get yourself into the air only to find yourself slowly arcing back to earth again. If you persevere you'll find yourself mo ving in a series of short flight hops. This is caused partly by habit and partly by the basic mo tion pro blem in general."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"You sink back to earth when your mo tion causing me ntal action falters. This causes your flight impe tus to stop and the gra vity habit then pulls you down. You ma y find yourself, as I did, trying to fly by runni ng down the road and leaping into the air. This is not necessary. Focus your will into floating up into the air. Then use your will to pro vide mo tion, same as with basic mo tion. There is NO gra vity affecting you in astral form. Convince yourself of this and you will be flying in no time . Speed The three speeds as defined by, S. Mu ldoon, and commo nly accepted, are a basic guide only. These are: 1. Walking speed. 2. Mo tor car speed. 3. Instantaneous travel. I think these three speeds were a sign of the time s back then. These would have been the only types of speed kno wn to mo st people. Today, mo vies, compu ter game s and air travel have thoroughly pre pared our minds to accept mu ch higher speeds. With pra ctise and good me ntal control, you CAN vary your speed to your purpo se, from walking speed to supersonic speed. This is a big pro blem for the beginne r though, the control of direction and speed. It has a lot to do with how stable the pro jection is and how experienced"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"you are at appl ying your will to mo tion. Instantaneous Travel It is generally accepted that if you can visualise a destination you can pro ject yourself there instantly, at the speed of thought. * I have found this to be highly unre liable * I find this instantaneous me thod usually pro jects you straight into a subjective location created by the visualisation of your targe t. You ma y appe ar to be at your destination but you will usually find ma ny discrepancies between the real location and where you are. Instantaneous travel is very like VRP. By using your visualisation powers to travel with, you will not actually travel. You will create a subjective copy of a destination and enter it. Long Distance Travel I have found it mo re reliable to follow the surface for short to me dium distance pro jection of up to a few hundred miles. Even this can be difficult as it is easy to fall into the Alice effect while travelling. All you have to do is break concentration once and you will slip into a dream pool. Strict me ntal control mu st be ma intained at all time s when travelling in real time . It is not really pra ctical to follow the surface for a long"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"distance. For exampl e, a country on the other side of the world from you is 12000 miles away. You would need to travel at about 64 time s the speed of sound to reach there in 15 minutes. At this speed in the atmo sphere, everything blurs and clouds and surface features cause disorientation and a corresponding reality shift. Any real time objective aspect of the pro jection will then be lost. No te: Ne wbie pro jectors can norma lly hold themselves in real time for only a few minutes. Therefore, any long distance travel is limited by the real time part of a pro jection. To travel long distance you need to study geogra phy. You have to be able to recogni se continents, oceans, countries, states and cities. You also need to study a ma p of your targe t area and note any landma rks. To pro ject there, after this is me mo rised, you mu st go into orbit and re-enter over your targe t. As you appro ach the earth you mu st adjust your appro ach and aim for the geological features and landma rks around your destination. Orbiting the Earth To enter orbit is a little mo re difficult than it sounds. Getting up there is easy, you just go straight up, but stoppi ng when you get high enough is difficult. Mo st people, my self included, tend to blast themselves straight out of the solar system, some time s right out of the galaxy. To avoid this, it is impo rtant to control your"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"speed during the ascent. It is easier to pro ject to the mo on first, as a way of entering orbit. This gives you a large visual targe t you can pro ject to in mo me nts. Once there, it is a simpl e ma tter to head back to Earth, enter orbit, and circle until you are above your targe t. In space, away from the atmo sphere, there are no pro blems with speed induced blurring. How Far Can You Go? There are * NO * limits to distance, destination or speed. You can travel to the mo st distant galaxy. The speed of thought is infinite. It is like folding space and mo ving without mo ving. If you can see some thing, you can be there....a s quick as that. In compa rison, the speed of light is that of a snail. I often go out into deep space, where the galaxies are just tiny smu dges in the distance, to think and me ditate. That is easy, but the trick is getting back for a conscious re-entry. Unless you have a good kno wledge of astronomy , which I do not, this is difficult. Following the silver cord, if you can see one, is not pra ctical at that kind of speed, though it will give you a basic direction to go in. To return from a long distance pro jection, tune into your body and become aware of it. Then try mo ving part of your physical body, i.e., a finge r or toe. This will return you to your body, and end the pro jection with full me mo ries of the OOBE."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Future Wind There is a strange phenome non you will come across, from time to time , while you are pro jecting.

Your point of consciousness is caught up by this vision and pro jected into the vision. 3. A comb ination of both of the above - this is the mo st logical. Symbolic Visio ns There is another aspect of this wind that is very similar to the above but the vision you experience is symb olic, or has a symb olic aspect, rather than an actual future event or scene. No te: I would like to warn you about the symb olic aspect of visions. If you don't understand the nature of symb olism it can cause gre at harm to your life. This warning appl ies to all clairvoyant visions in general, whether experienced in astral form or not.

This impa rts a \"Cargo Cult\" type of belief system on you, a belief that everything will be given to you - with all the negative aspects this primitive belief system has. This can cause you to ma rk time in your life, instead of living it to the full. * What you ma y have missed, from the symb olism of the above vision is: The amo unt of mo ney ma y be unusual for that lottery draw. $18 million is an odd amo unt of mo ney and ma y be a rare event.

Personally, I would always ma ke sure I had a ticket in the draw, just in case, but I would not depend on it. Future Wind Example I left my body and was mo ving about my home , getting my sea legs. Suddenly, a force mo ved me across the room. I tried to fight it but it gre w stronge r until I was blown out of the house and up into the night sky. A short time later I was brought down again, outside my home . I was just left standing there in the middle of the road. In front of me stood a refrigerator. It was just sitting there in the road with its door open. I examined it and could tell it was not working. Behind it was a ma ssive red brick wall, 40 feet high and twice as wide. There are no REAL brick walls in this street. Then I noticed my wife was standing beside me . I turne d and said hello to her."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"She just said goodbye, very coldly, then turne d and walked away. Perplexed, I watched her walk away.

To decipher a symb olic vision it is necessary to analyse it and break it down into its parts. The six signi ficant aspects of this vision are: 1. The sign post...

There is some logic to this if you look at the me chanics of pro jection. Death, in the early stages, is very mu ch like a powerful real time pro jection.

This is until the suppl y of etheric ma tter that binds the spirit to its physical body runs out. During this time it is norma l for the spirit to wander amo ng relatives and loved ones, saying goodbye and coming to terms with their new state of existence. This goodbye pro cess, eases the psychological trauma of death, and helps pre pare the spirit for the next stage of existence. What can happe n with mirro rs, is this: A new spirit can inadvertently enter a mirro r. If this happe ns, they enter a mirro r world in the same way a pro jector enters a picture through VRP. Once in a mirro r world they usually do not kno w where they are, or how to get out of it, and can be stuck there for the duration of their real time stay. This will not interfere with the journe y of the soul. It will just cause confusion for a few days until it enters the next stage of existence.

This can be done by leaving a letter, uncovered, for the spirit to read. They can also hear you, so talking to them is also effective.

This uncomfortable and confusing state appe ars to only occur at close range and can easily be avoided by not looking too closely at each other (ph ysical and pro jected double) and by not thinki ng at each other at close range (within appro xima tely twenty feet) during a real time pro jection.

Notes On Projection & Reintegration: 1. The sleep state, or trance state, is required for pro jection to occur. 2. Trance = body asleep + mind awake. 3. The waking state is required for reintegra tion to occur. 4. The only exception to the above is the in-between trance state, where the body is asleep but the mind is fully awake. 5.

This me thodology ma y not solve all pro blems, nor answer all questions, but it at least pro vides some kind of a logical and understandable frame work to work in. Purpose Of Mind Split: The mind split is, I believe, an integra l part of the workings of Universal Law, where the mind splits and reflects itself into ma ny different parts, levels and aspects, each belongi ng to a different dime nsional level. During the full mu lti-mind-split pro cess, the highest level (highest subtle body) appe ars to be drawn into the centre of the universe, into the Source of all consciousness, by what I have called the Akashic Pulse. There, the influential and conditional energies (consciousness seeds), contained within each individual energy egg (each person) are pro cessed and updated according to Universal Law. These are adjusted according to past and current thoughts and actions, and as further mo dified by Karmi c Law."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"These seeds affect and influence us all pro foundly. They cause the attraction and repulsion effect, all our likes and dislikes and natural tendencies, which are the visible workings of Universal Law in the physical dime nsion. Universal Law is that which attempt s to guide us all along our individual life's paths, towards pre determi ned but eminently variable goals (variable according to laws of free will and individual choices). An impo rtant aspect of the mind split, to ma ny people, is the way it shows how the physical body and it's mind are 'ne ver' 'ever' left empt y and ungu arded during sleep or any type of out of body experience or pro jection. They are thus never exposed to being entered, mo lested, possessed or interfered with by any other pro jector, or by any type of inorga nic being, entity or demo n. A conscious exit pro jector's physical body and mind are, according to my research, far mo re pro jected than they are during the full waking state - where natural non- physical senses become some what dulled or inactive. During an OOBE, the pro jector's energy body appe ars to expand and create a very sensitive perime ter, a kind of expanded energy cocoon around itself. This appe ars to extend in all directions for appro xima tely 20 feet (6 me tres) often filling or overflowing from the room around the pro jector's physical body. This sensitive energy perime ter acts some thing like an early warning system. If it is broached by another 'awake' person,"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"another pro jector, or any other type of energy being or entity, and a negative reaction occurs, it will instantly snap shut and reel back the pro jector for imme diate reintegra tion and the return of full waking consciousness. This early warning system appe ars to be particularly sensitive during any type of conscious OOBE, where the pro jected double is fully aware it is out of it's body. It seems, however, to become slightly less sensitive to 'real' awake people once the physical body and mind have fallen into a deep sleep. It will, however, always react violently and instantly if touched by anything which causes a negative reaction in it's perime ter field. ULTRA Short OOBE: One of the mo st impo rtant things to do after a successful exit, especially the first few time s, is to keep the pro jection ultra short. Ten seconds out and then get straight back into the physical body. Please trust me on this. Ten seconds of REAL out of body experience with a fully conscious exit and re-entry, are worth a thousand all nighters that are forgo tten! An ultra short oobe is, in mo st cases, the 'ma jor' contributing factor to a successful first time conscious exit pro jection. Once again, if a pro jector stays out too long, especially a novice pro jector, and their physical/etheric body falls into a deep sleep, the pro jected double will not usually be able to reanima te it's physical body and mind when it"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"returns . It can thus become locked out for the duration of the pro jection, or until natural waking occurs. Projection requires the physical body to fall asleep, and the reverse appl ies, with reintegra tion requiring the physical body to wake up. If the physical body and mind fall into a deep sleep, some time s even a good shaking will fail to wake them. The slight energy rush caused by re- entry can thus also fail to awaken a deeply sleeping, and possibly dreaming, physical body and mind. Projected Double Contact: One way of ceme nting pro jection me mo ries is to ma ke contact with yourself during an OOBE. Keeping in mind the nature of the mind split, agre e with yourself to try and ma ke contact from both sides of the pro jection, from both physical and pro jected sides. Some degre e of real time sight (seeing through closed eyelids in physical body) is required for this. Agre e for your pro jected double to be in a particular place, say the foot of the bed, and that it will look and think at where your physical head is, or should be. Do this even if the physical or pro jected double canno t clearly see its counterpa rt - which often happe ns on both sides. Often only a vague ghostly shape is seen, or a depre ssion in the bed. The physical body should trust its pro jected double will be doing this and should try to do the same , by thinki ng and concentrating and 'feeling' for where it's pro jected"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"double is 'suppo sed' to be. Once contact is ma de, me mo ries will flood both ways and will become ceme nted - ma king a strong and lasting impre ssion upon the physical brain. After the initial contact, the pro jected double should mo ve away quickly to avoid nauseating me ntal/visual feedback pro blems. This conne ction and me mo ry downloading pro cess, if successful, can allow the duration of real time pro jections to be drama tically extended. The pro jected double can periodically return to it's physical counterpa rt and download (top up) it's pro jection me mo ries. If this is done, I sugge st no mo re than a few minutes interval between each me mo ry download. The pro jected double should also re-enter it's physical body the mo me nt it detects signs it is tiring, or the mo me nt it begins experiencing reality fluctuations - which is a sure sign the dream mind is becoming active, which indicates the physical mind is falling asleep. Energy Raisin g During OOBE: To increase out of body vitality and capability it is impo rtant to have enough energy flowing from the physical/etheric bodies to the pro jected double. This is best done by the pro jected double while it is out of body. It mu st reach out and 'feel' itself sucking energy into itself, feeling energy rushing into it from it's physical body.

This technique can be used with gre at effect to solve or ease mo st commo n pro jected double related weakne ss pro blems, visual or otherwise. Improved Relaxation Technique No te: This new set of 'impro ved' and 'simpl ified' deep physical relaxation exercises are to replace those in the original Treatise. The first big hurdle you need to overcome is deep physical relaxation. With the thousands of letters I have had from people having pro blems achieving OOBE - one pro blem area stands way out, DEEP PHY SICAL RELAXATION. Everyone seems to rush through learning this, mo st impo rtant of skills, to get on with the mo re interesting stuff, like the pro jection attempt itself. But, as with any type of me taphysical developme nt (me taphysical = mind science) any skill not thoroughly learne d will eventually stop the aspirant cold, forcing them right back to the beginni ng to learn it pro perly"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"before they can pro ceed. Mo re time mu st be spent learning the skill of totally relaxing your physical body than with any other skill - it is THA T impo rtant. Relaxation is a pro gre ssive skill that can be learne d and impro ved with time and pra ctise. The bigge st pro blem with deep physical relaxation, in the early stages, is that it takes so long that if done pro perly as part of a pro jection attempt the pro jector can become me ntally exhausted or bored. This can ruin a pro jection attempt as the pro jector ma y then have little energy or enthusiasm for the exit. If this become s a pro blem, I sugge st deep physical relaxation be learne d and pra ctised regularly but 'separately' from pro jection attempt s, until such time as the pro jector can attain deep physical relaxation fairly quickly. A deep level of physical relaxation is absolutely necessary to consciously pro ject your astral body. This is quite easy to achieve, though, if you go about it in the right way and pra ctice regularly. Deep physical relaxation plus a clear mind = Trance State The trance state is achieved when the physical body goes to sleep while the mind stays awake and in control of itself. A conscious exit pro jector needs to be able to attain some level of the trance state before they can successfully pro ject out of their body. Deep physical relaxation leads to and naturally brings about the trance"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"state. The trance state is entered automa tically once the physical body enters a deeply enough relaxed state. *Important Note : Just as sleep is possible without deep physical relaxation, so is the trance state. It is quite easy to fall asleep and even enter the trance state while stressed and full of tension, relying on physical/me ntal tiredness to overcome lack of relaxation and trance ability. Just because you feel the sensations of trance (i.e., heavy body feeling) it does not me an you have attained deep physical relaxation. Ma ny people do this and think they have found a handy short cut, only to find conscious exit pro jection virtually impo ssible. Mo st people, in this case, will fail right on the exit, because their physical body is too tense. The above is also why sleeping for a few hours first, then waking for a pro jection attempt , works better for mo st people who lack relaxation and trance ability. The body has time (sleep) to overcome it's sleep deficit and physical tension. This ma kes pro jection mu ch easier and is a good way to get early results with conscious exit pro jection. Physical relaxation: Seating: I sugge st sitting in a comfortable arm chair, with good arm and neck suppo rt, and a pillow under your feet. The pillow is necessary because when relaxed to a deep level,"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"suppo rting mu scles in the feet will tend to relax and can cause some discomfort. If an arm chair is not available, use a high backed dining chair. It is possible to use a bed, but falling asleep can be a big pro blem. If a bed mu st be used, I sugge st laying on the back (ne ver the side) with hands and forearms held vertically above the bed, with elbows resting comfortably on the bed. Adjust and vary this position slightly for comfort. This position will reduce the likelihood of falling asleep. Dress: Wear loose, comfortable clothing and bare feet (or loose socks) depending on the local tempe rature. Tight clothing and shoes will cause discomfort with deep relaxation, and will also restrict the flow of blood and energy . Posture: Good posture helps a gre at deal with deep relaxation. Do not slump in the chair. If good posture is used the body will be well balanced. Then, when a deep level of relaxation is achieved, the body will stay well balanced and will experience no distracting discomfort. If posture is not good when relaxing deeply, mu scles will relax and the body will sag, causing discomfort in the spine and joints, which will interfere with the level of relaxation attained.

It shows the mind split, in some form, has already occurred. The physical body has varying degre es of difficulty anima ting itself when the mind split effect is active. Even though they ma y not be aware a pro jection is in pro gre ss, a pro jector's physical/etheric body ma y feel total physical paralysis, or some degre e of lethargy and heaviness and disorientation in their physical body. The degre e of this depends gre atly upon the strengt h of the pro jection and how mu ch energy is being used to ma intain it. Strong sensations like these point to an OOBE being in pro gre ss. The degre e of paralysis shows the 'strengt h' of the pro jection.

This me ans a partial pro jection has occurred, albeit interna lly, and is causing some degre e of waking paralysis. The real time 'pro jectable double' in this case has not pro jected compl etely free of it's physical body. If this is suspected, the pro jector should relax and let it happe n, or use a pro jection technique like rope. A full pro jection can then occur if it has not already happe ned. No te: Ma ny people are plagued by waking paralysis, and it can indeed be a terrifying experience, capable of causing psychological dama ge. Waking paralysis can best be broken by concentrating on a singl e big toe and trying hard to mo ve it. Concentrate 'everything' on mo ving that big toe. Once this mo ves, even a tiny bit, full physical mo veme nt will be instantly restored. Unwanted Vibrations & Projection Symptoms: Frequent bouts of vibrations, waking paralysis and other pro jection related sympt oms are a big pro blem for some people. Ma ny people do not like these sensations and some can be absolutely terrified by them. Because of this, ma ny people avoid sleep as a way of avoiding the pro jection sympt oms, or other pro jection related pro blems, like bad oobe experiences or nightma res. This is the very worse thing they could do as this will have the reverse effect, and will gre atly worsen the condition. 1. Lack of sleep causes over tiredness which"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"encourages pro jection sympt oms. 2. Sleeping flat on back encourages pro jection sympt oms. 3. Hu nge r raises vibrations and encourages pro jection sympt oms. Lack of sleep can also cause a loss of appe tite which can further aggra vate this debilitating condition. Together with disturbing energy sensations and bad OOBE experiences, this can set up a psychological reflex and a physical condition which can pro gre ssively worsen the longe r it is allowed to continue. The very first thing to address in cases like this is the lack of sleep, which is the 'root' cause of the whole pro blem. I strongl y sugge st sufferers of this condition seek me dical advice 'urge ntly' and to ask for a strong enough sleeping me dication which will pro mo te long lasting and dreamless sleep. (I sugge st people tell their doctor they are suffering from insomni a caused by bad dreams - which is partly true - to save lengt hy explanations) Once the sleep deficit is overcome and norma l sleep patterns return to norma l, appe tite will return and the pro jection related sympt oms will quickly cease. Keep in mind here that the me dication mu st be taken regularly (as per me dical advice) until the sleep deficit is compl etely overcome before the me dication can be stoppe d, or the pro blem ma y reoccur. If the use of me dication is not possible, I sugge st getting"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"up early in the mo rning and undertaking mo re physical exercise than usual. This will 'na turally' tire out the physical body, ma king for easier and heavier sleep. This type of natural tiredness is quite different from 'over tiredness' caused by a sleep deficit that has been built up over a long time . The bigge st pro blem with waking paralysis and OBE exit sympt oms is that these 'wake up' the physical body and mind. Therefore, if the physical body and mind are 'na turally' very tired, they will not wake so easily, and waking paralysis and etc. will be slept through, instead of them disturbing sleep and causing fear episodes, etc. Heavy Exit Sensations: Heavy exit sensations, including the famo us vibrations, are simpl y energy mo veme nt sensations. The strengt h of these, however, appe ars to be caused by the attempt to shift the centre of 'waking' consciousness 'outside' the bounds of the physical body, along with the real time body as it pro jects. This forces a reflection of 'waking' consciousness to go with the pro jecting double as it pro jects 'outside' the physical body. This throws a spanne r into the norma l 'sleep pro jection' me chanism, and causes a type of teeth rattling bio-energe tic jarring to occur in the physical/etheric body as it tries to accommo date the unusual dema nd placed upon it. No rma lly, this shift of reflected consciousness would follow the real time body,"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"outside the bounds of the physical body, naturally, while falling asleep. This causes far lighter and less noticeable energy mo veme nt sensations - i.e., not enough to disturb the 'falling asleep' pro cess. It is the pre sence of 'awake' consciousness during the pro jection pro cess which causes all the pro blems. It seems that ma intaining two awake and active copies of consciousness, both interior and exterior, requires a gre at deal mo re energy flow than nature generally pro vides for, and this in itself appe ars to be the real cause of heavy exit sensations. This is, in other words, a true compl ication of consciousness, of spirit incarna tion into a bio-energe tic vehicle. I kno w this ma y sound like the same thing - a natural shift of 'falling asleep' consciousness out of body, as when compa red with a deliberate shift of 'awake' consciousness out of body - but there is a vast difference in the energy requireme nts and resulting sensations for each. When a pro jector succeeds in shifting their centre of awareness strongl y enough along 'with' their pro jecting double, there is also mu ch mo re likelihood of them retaining their OOBE me mo ries after re-entry and reintegra tion - when they wake up. Heavy exit sensations quickly reduce after the first few conscious exit pro jections, through forced bio-energe tic developme nt. The energy body pro gre ssively become s used to the conscious exit pro cess, and steadily adapts and develops in response to further awake OBE attempt s, to pro vide for"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"and handle the required energies. Torso Energy Surge: Ma ny pro jections are ruined by a surge of energy in the torso, as energy flows through the legs and lower prima ry centres, through the navel and solar plexus to the heart and higher centres. This feels very mu ch like the 'falling' sensation you get occasionally while drifting off to sleep. This feeling ma kes you catch at the sides of the bed, as if to stop yourself from falling. All these sensations are caused by a surge of emo tional type energy through the energy body and heart centre, as the real time double is generated and the pro jection out of body begins. This sensation is so strong in some people it leaves them breathless and wide awake, thus breaking the delicate relaxed state necessary for conscious exit oobe. This can be an infuriating pro blem. The torso energy surge often contains a gre at deal of emo tional, nervous and adrenalin affecting energies as ma ssive amo unts of energy mo ve through the lower prima ry centres into and through the heart centre. This can be felt in mu ch the same way as any emo tional surging type of body-rush would be felt...like a huge wave of exciteme nt, mu ch like you ma y feel if you suddenly won a million dollars, or like the feelings caused by riding roller coaster or bunge e-jumpi ng. Sexual arousal is, also, not uncommo nly related to this type of energy surge , as there is a prima ry energy centre"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"(ma jor chakra ) situated directly over the genitals. (This centre is not me ntioned in the Treatise, but is dealt with in my book \"Astral Dynamics\" under the Core Skills & Energy section) A strong upwards energy rush of energy will thus often involve this genital centre, to a gre ater or lesser extent, depending upon the energy ma ke-up of the pro jector. Arousal usually breaks the delicately balanced state required for conscious exit oobe. Lying pro ne on the back seems to intensify the torso energy surge pro blem. One way of easing this pro blem is to experime nt with other resting/ pro jection positions, to find one where the sensations are weaker or less distracting. These sensations are generally weaker when lying on your side or when sitting semi-upright. Lying fully on your side, however, tends to pro mo te lucid dreams rather than OOBE's. This energy surge is, basically, caused by ma ssive energy mo veme nt through the energy body and it's prima ry centres (ma jor chakra s). Heavy energy mo veme nt sensations are caused by energy blockages in energy structures not accustome d to conscious exit pro jection. The heavier the sensations the stronge r will be the energy blockages causing them. When the energy body is unused to heavy prima ry centre energy mo veme nt, and the pro jector is awake, these sensations can severely disrupt pro jection attempt s.

This is best done separately from actual pro jection attempt s. These exercises should be continued until energy centres and their conne cting pathways gro w strong enough to handle the stronge r energy mo veme nts which happe n during a conscious exit oobe. Lost Focus During The Exit: A commo n cause of failed pro jection appe ars to be a failure to shift the 'centre' of consciousness out of the physical body along 'with' the real time double as it pro jects free of the physical body. It is extreme ly impo rtant a pro jector keep their mind clear and focused on the action and sensation of leaving their physical body, to go with it, and not to lose touch with what is happe ning. Heavy exit sensations can ma ke this difficult, I kno w, but they mu st be 'totally' igno red. Stay focused on the pro jection and where the centre of consciousness is going. If concentration slips at the wrong time , the real time body can pro ject out, without a strong centre of waking consciousness. A reflection of mind will still transfer into the pro jecting real time double, but the pro jector's stronge st centre of consciousness will, in effect, rema in behind locked inside the physical/etheric body.

In this case, strong me mo ries are created in the physical brain, for the same time period as the pro jection.

The whole idea, with this aspect of pro jection, is to ma ke the 'pro jection' me mo ries the stronge st and mo st me mo rable me mo ries for the same time period. The above is a compl ication of the mind split effect which causes enormo us pro blems for pro jectors. It goes a long way to explaining what ma y have occurred when (as happe ns to ma ny people) everything goes fine right up until the exit stage, with all the right sensations: vibrations, rapid heartbeat, falling or floating sensation, etc., and then everything just stops. It just goes away, leaving the almo st-pro jector lying there wondering what happe ned and why they failed. Mo st people this happe ns to also feel exhausted, or partially or fully paralysed, after their seemingl y failed pro jection attempt and soon fall into a deep sleep. The pro jection, in this case, will pro ceed without them, being centred in their pro jected double, without them being aware they have succeeded.

All of these can be pro gre ssively overcome by understanding the me chanics and dynamics of OOBE and by experiencing the pro jected state at first hand. Projection out of body requires some bravery and fear is one of the first natural barriers faced by all new pro jectors standing on the threshold of a conscious exit pro jection. Fear is a natural barrier, appa rently designe d to stop people pro jecting until they are psychologically ready to operate out of their bodies. \" True bravery is not the ability to feel no fear, but is the ability to control fear whilst continuing to function in a reasonably norma l fashion. \" (RB) During an oobe, a pro jector is virtually invulnerable and can pass through solid ma tter, sit on gro und zero during an atomic blast, or even to bask within the heart of a superno va unscathed. The only thing to fear while out of body is 'fear' itself. No thing else can directly hurt a pro jector and nothing can get at their physical body and mind during a conscious pro jection. While it is fairly rare to come across anything nasty or negative during a pro jection, any troublesome entity a pro jector might stumb le across canno t, therefore, directly harm them. They can, however, show themselves as a form designe d to scare the daylights out of a pro jector, and this can"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"cause psychologically dama ge. This can also result in a subconscious fear of OOBE. It can cause an instinctive, negative baulking type of reaction which can ruining every conscious exit.

If this is already the case, I sugge st a course of affirma tions and self hypno sis be used to overcome it. Fear Of OOBE Exit Sensations: Fear of OOBE exit sensations is the very first of the natural barriers to conscious exit oobe needed to overcome . This is not easy and can take a lot of control, as well as a lot of faith that the heavy physical sensations of early conscious pro jections will not actually hurt you. The sensations can be 'extreme ly' physical and violent, especially during the first few conscious exit attempt s, but will always pro gre ssively reduce during subsequent pro jections. The physical heartbeat is 'no t' actually increased by a conscious exit pro jection attempt . It is not 'caused' to physically race by the OOBE attempt - although it will often definitely 'feel' like it is racing so fast it seems about to explode. This racing sensation is the heart chakra (pri ma ry centre) working overtime to pro vide the energy needed to generate and pro ject the Real Time vehicle.

Fear and panic can cause further sensations by way of an 'actual' rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, vertigo, nausea, cramps and pain, etc. The best way to get over this is to concentrate everything on climb ing ROPE and getting out of body as 'quickly' as possible - while totally igno ring the racing heart sensation and heavy bodily vibrations.

Religion Instilled Worry/Fear: Ma ny people worry they are breaking God's laws, or infringi ng upon some thing in the Bible, by having OBE's. There are NO direct Biblical references which directly state pro jection is wrong, evil or even advising against it. In fact, there are ma ny references within the bible that me ntion OBE, i.e., if me mo ry serves me , St Paul speaks on this, when telling of one ma n's my stical experience: \"whether in or out of his body I canno t tell\".

The ability to have conscious out of body experiences is a 'na tural' ability and, even though ma ny people find it difficult to accompl ish, everyone has the potential for this ability. I think, if God did not want people to have OOBE's, He would have designe d us a little differently, and ma de pro jection impo ssible?

Callin g For Help: It is possible to call for help from another pro jector when attempt ing to pro ject, or to call some one to me et you when you get out of body.

Another pro jector, although they ma y be able to help in other ways, will not, however, be able to actually 'pu ll' another pro jector out of their body. Any attempt to do so will be perceived by the pro jector as a psychic/energy body attack (very unpl easant cold shivers, etc.) which will tend to break their delicately balanced 'pro jectable' state. A pro jector can best help another pro jector by waiting for the natural pro jection (sleep pro jection) to take place and then ma king them aware they are pro jecting, helping them to reme mb er it. Good advice at this time would be for them to dive back into their physical body shouting \"I did it!\" to help them ceme nt their oobe me mo ries.

The real time pro jector in this state is asleep, just as it's physical body and mind are.

Spirits: Personally, I do not advise pro jectors call out to 'unkno wn' spirits or 'unkno wn' guides to help them pro ject, unless they kno w 'exactly' who or what they are calling, and can verify their credentials as to exactly who and what they are. Calling blindly for any help from anywhere carries a high risk of attracting the unwanted attention of undesirable astral wildlife and mischievous spirit entities. Mo st types of intelligent astral wildlife and spirit entities appe ar to require some kind of 'permi ssion' before they can interfere with a living person's life. Calling blindly for help can pro vide an entity with all the 'permi ssion' it needs, albeit obtusely. And, once permi ssion is given in cases like this, it canno t so simpl y or easily be revoked. It is, I believe, a very unsafe pra ctice indeed, to deliberately solicit the help of unkno wn spirit entities, as any type of open invite or request for help ma y invite a negative entity to trouble you instead."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Calling upon Ange ls, however, does not carry the same cautions as does blindly calling upon unkno wn spirits. Prayers to God (in whatever form or name you believe in) asking for His pro tection and help, however, are 'highly' recomme nded and do not carry this same risk. I thoroughly recomme nd a pra yer for pro tection be 'sincerely' said before any pro jection, even just a few words, regardless of belief or religion - or even the lack of it. Prayers are mo st effective when said from a deeply relaxed 'quiet' me ntal state; i.e., from in the trance state. If a spirit of some kind does ma nifest during an OBE, and the pro jector is not sure if they are genuine or not, a simpl e test is to ask it to go away and leave you alone, and to return at another time , when called upon. Any good spirit will obey this request, and will return another time when called upon. If a spirit does not leave, or argu es against this request, saying it kno ws better than you what's good for you, etc., then its a pre tty safe bet this spirit is not who they say they are. There are certain skills necessary to be learne d by any pro jector wishing to OOBE at will. There are 'no ' safe short cuts to pro jection. The difficulties associated with conscious exit OOBE are best thought of as natural barriers, barriers which are there for a 'reason' and which are therefore unwise to avoid.

These skills: deep physical relaxation, clearing the mind, concentration, trance, bodily awareness actions, energy raising and the ability to overcome fear, are necessary requireme nts for successful and safe out of body operations. In a nutshell, if you canno t ma ke it out of your body under your own steam, you should not be pro jecting at that time .

Physical Body's Eyes: While this ma y appe ar obvious to ma ny people, I have had a lot of queries over this ma tter.

If a pro jection is too dark or the pro jector feels they are blind, I sugge st they use the out of body energy raising techniques, as given earlier. It is also possible to create light by visualisation, by visualising a torch or lamp, etc. Ma ny people find they simpl y have to ask for their sight when out of body and they get it straight away. Another way to overcome darkne ss is to visualise a well lit destination and use the instant travel me thod to pro ject there. REM (Rapid Eye Movement) Rapid Eye Mo veme nt, commo nly called the 'REM' state, often happe ns during an oobe attempt - often, but not always. This is a natural event trigge red by the trance state when the physical body is very tired - when the physical body falls into a deeper sleep than is actually required, but with the mind still being held awake. The REM condition signpo sts the ideal time to have a lucid dream, as this indicates the dream mind is becoming active. If fear or other difficulties ma ke OOBE difficult I sugge st the pro jector focus on having a lucid dream at this time , as this will give some type of related out of body experience which will help pre pare them for a full blown conscious exit OOBE later on. At this time a 'conscious' lucid dream become s a viable alterna tive to a conscious OOBE, especially if REM activity is disturbing and breaking the concentration of the pro jector.

LD Note: A good way to attain a lucid dream, if lying down when the REM state hits, is for the pro jector to stop the OOBE attempt , staying relaxed and turning on their side (no t their back) and to ima gine a departme nt store setting while allowing themselves to sink gently into sleep. If all goes well, they'll slip directly into a lucid dream with no appa rent break in consciousness. Closing Energy Centres? *Author's No te* This section contradicts, corrects and replaces an earlier section in the original Treatise - on closing prima ry energy centres after using them. The reason for this contradiction is simpl y that my continuing research has led to an increased understanding of the energy body and how it works - with experience teaching me otherwise in this case:) After any type of energy work it is, traditionally, believed to be impo rtant to close all energy centres that have been stimu lated or opened. While this idea appe ars to have some me rit on the surface, I have come to the conclusion it is a compl etely illogical pra ctice. No localised awareness action or visualised action can cause an energy centre"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"(chakra ) to deactivate or close. This appl ies to any type of energy centre, secondary or prima ry. Experience tells me that no ma tter how an awareness action is performe d at the site of an energy centre it will 'always' cause stimu lation. It is a mistake to think that any awareness or visualised action can succeed at closing or deactivating an energy centre. This is a little like fanni ng a spark (inactive energy centre) into a flame with an stimu lation action (ma king the spark an 'active' energy centre) and then trying to ma ke that same flame go out by blowing up on it from a different direction. Ho wever it is done, it will continue to fan the flame . Consider this: Mo st popular chakra opening me thods involve visualising a sma ll door or pair of curtains opening over the site of a chakra . Once this is done that chakra is deeme d to have been 'opened'. This me thod is then simpl y reversed to 'close' that chakra at the end of the session. Once these doors have been visualised as closing, the chakra s are deeme d to have been 'closed'. Prima ry chakra s are compl ex non-physical 'vortexes' of energy , each with a gre at ma ny functions, about the size of the palm of your hand. If you look at just how a visualised 'little door' opening technique like this would affect a powerful energy structure like this, it become s fairly obvious that a reversed action of 'closing' a simpl e little door would have little or no effect. It would also not affect it in the desired way. If you understand how"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"bodily awareness and Tactile Ima ging works, as per the Treatise, it become s clear this reasoning is some what faulty. Both opening and closing me thods involve a visualised or bodily awareness action at the site of a ma jor chakra . Both opening and closing actions will, therefore, each cause some degre e of stimu lation. Prima ry energy centres can not be likened to simpl e me chanical devices that can be switched off or closed by any such visualisation or awareness action. Energy centres are, I think I have shown, not simpl y little doorways that can be opened and shut with good intentions and a little visualisation. Some people ma y dispute this, as energy centres are 'traditionally' suppo sed to be closed after use; as per popular new-age type theories and literature on this subject. Be that as it ma y, my logic is sound and based on repeatable experime nts, and energy centres simpl y 'canno t' be deactivated or 'closed' in this way. If a person thinks they have succeeded at doing this, they will find this is me rely a coincidence, and that the energy centres in question were deactivating on their own anyway. In mo st cases, prima ry energy centres will begin deactivating very quickly from the mo me nt relaxation discipline is broken, when physical body mo veme nt and norma l levels of me ntal activity are restored. Reversing the energy 'raising' action and taking energy down through the legs (no t through prima ry centres)"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"however, does help reduce activity in prima ry energy centres. This reversed energy raising action does not involved any type of direct chakra stimu lation and will reduces the amo unt of energy flowing into the energy body, especially through the legs. This reduces the amo unt of energy available to prima ry energy centres, thereby reducing activity in them to some extent. This does not, however, involve any focused awareness actions at the sites of prima ry centres. Energy centres, prima ry and secondary, naturally reduce their level of activity once relaxation discipline is broken, as well as when they cease to be stimu lated or used. The best way to deactivate energy centres is to stop stimu lating and using them. Energy centres will also cease activity when they become energe tically exhausted. This will happe n when the suppo rting energy body circuitry shuts down, become s exhausted, or for some other reason become s incapable of pro viding the required energy flow necessary to ma intain prima ry energy centres in their active state. Note: if no signi ficant continuing energy mo veme nt or activity is felt in prima ry energy centres, after a developme nt session or pro jection attempt , they should be left alone. An attempt should be ma de to reduce activity 'only' if continuing chakra sensations are pro nounced or become bothersome and uncomfortable.

Ways Of Reducing Primary Centre Activity: 1. Reverse the energy raising action in the legs and arms alone - pushing energy back down and out of the body. 2.

If this is done only briefly, however, over and over and rhythmically, for long enough, it will also have the effect of trigge ring the pro jection reflex.

Get yourself into a deeply relaxed state, or into the trance state if possible, as you norma lly would pre pare for using an OOBE technique. 1.

Bounce your awareness back and forth between the targe t and your body at roughly one second intervals (whatever feels mo st natural). Try and develop a natural rhythm, in and out, in and out, over and over. 5. When you get used to using this technique, extend your time at the targe t slightly, just a little bit longe r.

Racing Heartbeat, Disorientation & Pressure: In my opinion, disorientation and head pre ssure, during or after an OBE or OBE attempt , stem from forced bio- energe tic developme nt, caused by an OBE attempt . Any pro blems resulting from this will settle down over a couple of days. I do not advise further attempt s until you feel compl etely norma l again - as things mu st have time to adjust and develop in response to what has happe ned - as a mu scle mu st be given time to heal and develop after being overworke d and strained. While a logical observation, and partly true, the assumpt ion that the heart chakra is not getting enough energy , and that this is causing it to race during an OBE attempt , is not entirely correct. This ma tter is far mo re compl ex than it appe ars."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"When you cease a pro jection causing bodily awareness action, i.e., Rope, and observe the throbbing in your heart chakra slowing, you have actually eased the pre ssure that was forcing your energy body to generate your pro jectable double. This eases the load on the heart chakra , thus slowing its activity. The heart chakra is forced to pro vide a lot of energy , to generate the pro jectable double, during an awake induced OBE attempt . Excessive heart centre activity, and all other heavy exit sensations, are 'caused' by the pre sence of 'awake' consciousness, which cause a plethora of bio- energe tic conflicts to arise. To suppo rt this: think how easily you pro ject out of body when your mind is asleep, and out of the bio-energe tic equation? When asleep, you'll find you slip out with hardly a mu rmu r from your hear chakra , feeling only a mild, brief falling sensation. At the very worse this level of exit sensations will ma ke you catch the sides of your bed, especially at time s when you are drifting in and out of sleep, before actually falling asleep.

This can occur during an OBE, when the pro jected double deliberately draws mo re energy from its physical/etheric counterpa rt, which is energe tically ma intaining its pro jected double via the Silver Cord. A noticeable heavier thrummi ng will also be felt from within the perceived chest area of the pro jected double when this happe ns, even though it does not have a chest, per se. This is especially noticeable at close range , within 20 feet (6 me tres) or so, during a Real Time OBE, and eases with gre ater distance. But, when heart centre throbbing speeds up during a conscious exit OBE attempt (which is especially noticeable during early OBE's and OBE attempt s), this is a sign that awake consciousness is throwing a spanne r into the works, so to speak.

No way! you might say, \"I'm in full trance and so 'mu st' be deeply physically relaxed enough for pro jection to occur. Well, while an understandable assumpt ion, think on this: it is quite possible to attain a fairly deep level of trance (usually too deep for easy OBE) while the physical body still retains sufficient physical tension to interfere with the pro jection me chanism. In a similar way, it is also possible to fall asleep while still full of stress and tension. For exampl e, I can attain a full trance state while standing and even walking - which obviously entails physical tension, which obviously would interfere with an OBE attempt , if I attempt ed one at this time . My sugge stion is to read The Treatise on OBE, Version 2.00, parts 1 - 8, and then to spend at least a few weeks pra ctising deep physical relaxation, and trance work only.
