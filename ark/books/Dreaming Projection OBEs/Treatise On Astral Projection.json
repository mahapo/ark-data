All rights reserved. This is part one of a series of articles that will endeavor to define the astral world and the projection process. Please keep in mind, wh ile reading v1.x of this Treatise, that it was my first attempt at serious writing. That is, I was learning to write while writing them. I have been studying the astral plane, in my astral form, for most of my life. I have attempted, by careful observatio n and critical thinking, to understand it, and hopefully, to shed a little light on it. Everybody, without exception, leaves their body in a low powered projection, when they go to sleep. I call this sleep projection. The astral body hovers a few inches a bove the physical like a balloon on a string, mimicking the sleeping position and going no further. Once the astral body has separated, it is free to create dreams. This is the natural (sleep, dream) process we are all familiar with. During this, you sink into the collective dream consciousness of the world. This ‘dream pool’ settles into layers. According to what type of person you are, spiritual, moral advancement etc, you will tune in to a level you have affinity with. These levels are commonly called the ‘Planes’ or sub Planes. There is nothing wrong with this analogy except that it can confuse things when you try to grasp the whole concept. If you become aware during sleep projection you can take some control over it as in a lucid dream, and move amongst the levels. If you do take control though, you cannot return to the real world and function as an astral form in it. You are in the topsy - turvy world of the dream pool or astral planes, where everything is possible, but not very plausible. W hen you do a ‘fully conscious’ projection of the astral form you project into the physical world, not any astral world. This has long been misunderstood. What is usually thought of as astral projection today is better called ‘Lucid Dreaming’ which is co mpletely different. Many authors suggest we all race about the universe in AP every night. This is simply not true. You will find the world a lonely place in your astral form and will rarely see anyone else projecting there. If you do see someone, ofte n they are just standing, confused and befuddled, caught in a ‘between’ state of projecting and creating.

I call it ‘The Alice and Wonderland Effect’ It is an effective barrier to the u ntrained mind. In the astral form you have an incredibly strong creative ability, normally used to create dreams. Once free of the fetters of the physical world, you can create an entire world, and often do. This creative ability is the problem, and the cause, of all the misunderstandings about AP. There is a natural barrier in AP just as there is with any other form of psychic ability. The ‘Alice’ effect, limits projection time in the real world to a few minutes, in most cases, unless you can control yo ur mind and energy level well. If there was not a barrier - think about it - millions of people flitting around the world every day and night, no privacy, no secrets. This would be a very unhappy world to live in. What happens during a fully conscious AP if you can’t control your mind and energy? Well, at some point during the AP you will start to lose control over the experience and well known things will be found in wrong places. Doors, windows, furniture; extra rooms will appear etc. Your subconsciou s mind has started creating or you are tuning into a dream plane. Once this happens it is impossible to know what is real any more. Some of the dream pool levels, or planes, are a carbon copy of the real world. You may tune into one of them and think yo u are projecting in the real world - until you meet a Cheshire cat. One final thing, the Eastern concept of the levels; physical, astral, mental, Buddhic, Atmic etc is very real. They have been confused though and mixed in with the Western concept of astr al projection. They are different levels of consciousness, not planes as such. When you AP you don’t raise your consciousness, it is the same as when you are awake. These ‘higher’ levels can only be reached by raising your consciousness; you can’t just project into them. It is a different kind of ‘projection’. I have been in these higher levels but it is difficult to explain them, they really have to be experienced. They are normally reached during deep meditation. In order to reach these higher le vels, some clairvoyant ability is required. This can be developed, or natural ability. ---------- Robert Bruce ------------- rsb@tower.com.au ---------- Your comments, experiences and requests for help and advice ar e most welcome.

All rights reserved . Astral Projection (AP’) is an automatic reflex, built in to your body and mind. To tri gger it, while fully conscious, there are three major requirements. 1. The ability to relax your body 100% and stay awake. 2. You have to be able to shift your consciousness point outside of your body. 3. You need enough mental and psychic energy to mainta in control over the projection and not slip into the dream state. Together, these will trigger the automatic projection reflex for a full powered AP’. There are a few minor conditions but these can be varied to suit your experience and surroundings. Rel axation : You must ‘master’ a full body relaxation exercise. If you know one already it can be adapted to suit. Sit in a ‘chair’ and relax. Starting with the feet, tense them and relax them. Continue this with calves, thighs, hips, stomach, chest, arms , neck and face. Go over this a few times until you feel completely relaxed. Breathe deeply and slowly throughout this and try to become ‘aware’ of the breath entering and leaving your body. Mental hands : Imagine you have a pair of ‘mental hands’. Stro ke yourself with these ‘hands’ in an upward motion from your feet and up your legs, over and over again. Try and ‘feel’ them relaxing and soothing you. Continue this up through the center of your torso, paying particular attention to the chakras. The m ental hands technique will also get you used to shifting your point of consciousness to different parts of your body. Try and put as much of yourself as you can into these mental hands. Energy raising : As you pull upwards through your legs with your ment al hands, imagine you are gripping the energy that flows there and pull it up through you. This is the natural path of the psychic/life energy that flows through you. With practice you will actually ‘feel’ this energy tingling and surging through you. It will literally ‘charge’ you up like a battery. Chakras : These are situated at: 1. The base of the spine (between the anus and the genitals) 2. The spleen (slightly below the belly button) 3. The solar plexus (1 hand - span above the belly button) 4. The heart (center of the chest) 5. The throat. 6. Forehead. 7. Crown (full top of your head). They are best imagined as roughly the size of your hand."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 Chakra stimulation : Chakras are centers for the transformation of energy. Each chakra transforms the raw life energy of the planet into a different type. As you pull this energy up through you with your mental hands, stop at each chakra and imagine your mental hands opening it. Pull the energy up through it to the next one and so on. Repeat this a few times, you may not feel anything at first but with practice you will feel a fluttering or pulsing under your skin. Stop Check : Keep checking your muscles for any tensioning throughout these exercises and re - relax as needed. A common problem is the auto matic tensing of muscles as you pull energy up through you. Remember, this is all mental; the body must stay dormant and relaxed throughout this. Point shift : To shift your point of consciousness, imagine you are a foot or two out in front of yourself. NOT a figure in front of you but YOU are in front of your physical body. Keep in mind you physical body being behind you. This is tricky but you will get used to it quickly. Don’t tense or strain any muscles during this, your body will try to obey you ‘ physically’, don’t let it. Mental state : Your surface mind will be fully occupied by these exercises so no mental exercise is needed up to this point. When you feel Breath awareness: ‘Feel’ your breath coming in and ‘feel’ it going out. With the inha le, ‘pull’ energy up from the base chakra to your heart chakra with your mental hands. Note: If you feel any vibration start in your body at this point, and don’t want to project yet, move your head slightly, and gently sway your body into normal alertnes s. These exercises should be carried out daily. Some of them can be done anywhere and anytime you have a few minutes to spare. You will, in time, condition your body to respond quickly and easily. With practice you will be able to attain a state of ‘t otal relaxation’ in just a few minutes. This training will reduce the amount of effort needed, and the fatigue produced, when you attempt a fully conscious AP. ---------- Robert Bruce ------------- rsb@tower.com.au ---------- Your comments, experiences and requests for help and advice are most welcome.

All rights reserved . This arti cle will deal with actually leaving the body (AP’). If you have read the previous two parts - and I strongly recommend you do - you will have some understanding of the AP’ process. I will go into more detail on related subjects, i.e.: duality, multipl e bodies, paralysis, the psychic wind, long distance AP’, fear, astral sex, ethics, entering other bodies, astral entities, limitations to AP’, thought forms, healing, problems, and other topics in subsequent articles. Note: The projection method I use a nd describe here is slightly different to what is called AP’ today. It is how to do a ‘fully conscious’ projection of the astral body into the real world - not the astral world. This is equivalent to a safe (near death experience). Conditions: Stated here are the IDEAL conditions for AP’. Some of them can be varied according to your circumstances and needs. You need a quiet room where you will be undisturbed. If background noise is a problem, tune a TV or radio - off station - to provide white nois e, which will blanket it. I advise against music. Make sure the temperature is comfortable as you will tend to lose body heat during AP’. The light must be soft and fairly dim, not dark. The burning of incense, while not necessary, helps condition your body to relax. If you use incense, use one type exclusively for AP’, and use that type for no other purpose. You need a comfortable chair with arm and neck support. This can be a lounge chair or of the recliner type. AP is much more successful when done from a SITTING position. The chair must be slightly reclined to stop the head rocking forward. A phone book under the front of it will do. A pillow is needed for the feet, and sometimes a small pillow or towel behind the neck. The type of neck pillow used on aircraft are good. Play around with this until you are 100% comfortable. Note: wear loose clothing. If you must use a bed, say you are unable to sit due to illness, injury or circumstance, prop yourself up in bed with pillows, as you would when y ou eat. As I have said, any of this can be dispensed with according to your needs and circumstances. I am giving you here the optimum conditions for AP’. Tiredness: To AP’ you don’t want to be too tired. The state needed is that found after you have ex ercised, showered, had your evening meal and relaxed for an hour or so.

If you are projecting in the daytime, I recommend some form of vigorous exercise, a hot shower and s ome relaxation first. The body will be physically tired - thus easier to relax - but the mind will be awake and alert. If light is a problem, use blackout goggles like the ones they give you on air raft. They are comfortable and will not interfere. Note: If saliva builds up in your mouth at any time, before, during or while you are AP’ you can swallow, move your tongue etc • It won’t affect it at all. If you have to move your body slightly, to ease it, do it in a sleepy, stretchy way, without breaking re laxation. If you have to cough, cough gently. If you are coughing and sneezing, as with a cold - forget it - and get some sleep. One other sensation you may feel is the (cobwebs) a tickling sensation on the face, this is normal. In the early stage you m ay scratch them if you wish. In the latter stage, after the heaviness starts, ignore them, they will soon stop. It is caused by chakra energy and the subtle bodies loosening. THE EXIT When your chosen time comes, form a STRONG intention to AP’, sit in your chair, stretch and get comfortable. Do the relaxation exercises and energy raising until you feel the heavy condition as you enter a light trance. Switch to breath awareness and keep your consciousness shifted out in front. Stay aware of your phys ical body being behind you and keep checking for tension. A humming will start inside and around you. It will increase to a much deeper vibration, depending on the chakra activity. With heavy chakra involvement this can be a truly awesome feeling and is very frightening - if you don’t know what is happening. Your heart will FEEL like it is speeding up to an impossible rate. This is NOT your heart but the heart chakra! Ignore it. This feels like: Place your hand on your chest, with your fingertips re sting in the center of it over your heart. Tap your fingers on your chest, in time with your heart. Increase this rate slowly, until you are tapping as fast as your fingers can. This is how a chakra feels when it is fully activated; it varies from a g entle pulsing, like a muscular twitch under the skin, to a deep robust thrumming, like a muscle gone mad. Ignore the thrumming and vibrations and stay frosty. Adopt a ho - hum attitude to all of this and you will be out in a jiffy. The vibes and thrumming may feel as though they are increasing to an unbearable pitch - but you must ignore them. With subsequent projections, it will be less noticeable, as the dormant chakras stabilize. The thrumming and vibes reach a crescendo as the AP’ reflex cuts in.

You’ll think, YES.... I did it! You are now consciously projecting your astral body, and hey, it DOES feel great! The first time out, limit it to a few minutes - please trust me on this - it is important. Move around the room - slowly. You haven’t really got legs, and DON’T look for them. The law of gravity doesn’t apply any more, so be careful. Just move around the room a bit, don’t think about how - just do it! You may feel a pu rring deep in your chest as you move, from your heart chakra. This is like a little motor, it speeds up as you move and slows to a gentle (putt putting) when you stop. This is your power pack, your energy; the strength of it will depend on the amount of chakra involvement and how close you are to your body. Keep control of your mind - stay frosty - and don’t get over excited during the AP’. Don’t imagine at all, or expect anything that was not there when you left your body. This is essential to keep fro m falling into the ALICE effect. Now move back to your body with the intention of re - entering. You are new to the astral form and if you go charging off there is a 99% chance you will lose control, fall into the ‘Alice’ effect, and remember nothing. Lear n to crawl before you fly? You can go further a field in later AP’s but it is important you limit the first one to this. Re - entry is simple. Move into your body, any old how, and it will straighten itself out. The re - entry reflex will take over - and s nap - you’re back. GET UP straight away, keeping in mind what you have done and WRITE IT DOWN. The astral mind is like the RAM in a computer, the physical mind is like a hard disk and the paper is like a floppy. Switch off the power in a computer withou t saving to hard disk and all data in high mem is gone - poof - just like that! When you write it down it makes a wrinkle in your hard disk mind. You just need a few key words - not a full essay - you can fill in the details later. Start a journal of yo ur AP’S. A typical Projection I sit in my chair, comfortable and warm. I am going to AP, come hell or high water. I WILL do it! I do the relaxation thoroughly, as I know it is the REAL secret to AP’. I raise energy with my mental hands to activate my chakras. They start to thrum nicely. I concentrate more on my heart chakra, pulling more and more power to it through the others, until it throbs with a deep primal rhythm. The heavy feeling comes over me as I enter trance. I feel like a corpse, a d ead weight. My face tickles all over with cobweb sensation, but I ignore it. I shift my point of focus to the ME in front. I AM in front, but I am also aware of my body behind me. The vibes start from deep within my body, I concentrate on breathing but keep my focus out in front. The vibes increase to a huge droning, powerhouse generator intensity, but I ignore it. My spine thrills as adrenalin courses through me, but I ignore it. I focus on breathing and where I am going. My heart chakra feels like it’s going to blow a gasket, but ha, I know it’s not my heart, so I ignore it. The droning changes into a deep buzzing and I am suddenly lifting free, I feel a slight falling, buzzing sensation. I buzz out and am standing before myself in a couple of se conds. Damn but this feels good! I move around the room, searching - hunting. The little motor in my heart purrs louder as I move, keeping pace with my movement."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 ---------- Robert Bruce ------------- rsb@tower.co m.au ---------- Your comments, experiences and requests for help and advice are most welcome.

All righ ts reserved . SPLITTING The splitting of your consciousness, into two separate, but identical minds, happens every time you go to sleep or have any kind of out of body projection. This splitting happens for a very good reason: If you read the case histor ies in books on astral projection, lucid dreaming, OOBE’s and near death experience; you will find many accounts illustrating the splitting effect. It is common, during an out of body experience, to be aware of your physical body while also being aware yo u are existing in a separate, finer body. This is due to a telepathic link between your two bodies. In the case of astral projection this link serves the purpose of monitoring the physical body, so no harm comes to it. When you project, your astral doub le leaves the physical body and the mind splits. One part is centered in the astral body and the other in the etheric body, which must stay with the physical. When the astral form is generated, it has a mirror image of your mind. It is YOU, in every re spect, like a tape recording of a tape recording; both identical, both YOU! Often, during sleep, the mirrored minds mix in a kind of telepathic dream sharing. The physical, etheric minds are also capable of having dreams. This dream mixing results in a k ind of dream memory schizophrenia, caused by having more than one point of consciousness. For those of you unfamiliar with schizophrenia, sufferers of it can have more than one set of thoughts in their mind at the same time. DUALITY If the astral and the etheric bodies, when they are both fully aware, concentrate on each other at close range during a projection; a two - way telepathic link is formed. This is very disturbing and I don’t recommend you try it too often. The physical/etheric YOU and the a stral YOU will see each other clearly, and at the same time. You will be looking out of each other’s eyes at the same time, aware of both sets of vision simultaneously."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 On top of this, making it even more confusing, you are also aware of each others thoug hts, as well as your own, simultaneously. This is telepathic feed back, like holding two mirrors facing each other to give you a glimpse of infinity, a reflection of a reflection of a reflection etc. This uncomfortable and confusing state can be avoided b y not looking too closely at each other and not thinking of each other when you are projecting. This, in a way, goes a long way to explaining why dreams are sometimes so confused and chaotic. The mind splits for a VERY good reason and the two parts are me ant to function separately. I have experienced this phenomena many times during projection. I studied it because I was curious of the way I could feel my physical body when in close proximity to it. I also kept getting confusing memories of doing two thi ngs at once while projecting. i.e. Being aware of events and noises, in the house and in the street, as well as remembering the projection. This duality has been reported by other projectors, but never properly explained or understood. Here is an ac count of the first time I experienced duality and telepathic feedback: I had been meditating in my chair by the fire and returned to normal awareness as the rain started drumming on the roof. The wind was getting up and it was shaking the windows. I loo ked at the clock; it was three in the morning. This was not unusual, sometimes I meditate all night. I felt well rested and full of energy. I thought to myself, ‘I’ve never projected in the rain before, I wonder what its like?’ Closing my eyes once aga in, I soon projected out of my body. Moving through the wall, I went out into the rain. What a gloriously wet feeling it was. I could feel the rain passing through me. The smell of rain and wetness was everywhere; it seemed to fill me with energy. I floated up to the roof, sat on the chimney and looked out over the town. I watched the rain dancing on the roofs and streets, swirling down gutters and gurgling into drains. It seemed to have a friendly voice and rhythm all its own, it said, “drink me, s plash me, gurgle me, slosh me.” It was funny at the time. Sitting on the roof, I noticed I could feel my body below me in the chair. This had often intrigued me, how I could feel my physical body when I was near it but not when I was further away. Slid ing back through the roof, I decided to study my it more closely. Suddenly, I could see myself floating through the wall as well as seeing myself sitting in the chair. It was ME, sitting in the chair looking at myself floating through the wall, but also M E floating in front of the chair ten feet away watching myself sitting in the chair. This was not only confusing; it made me feel quite ill. I had two sets of vision, two sets of thoughts, all the same and all joined together, it was fascinating. It also made sense. Just because my astral was separated from my physical, why should the physical have to stop thinking? The astral ME moved around the room, observing my body in the chair while it was watching me. I could still see the astral ME, even when I w as behind the physical me. I could feel myself in the chair, trying to follow my astral body around the room.

I felt as if I were huge and was moving against enormous pressure. I was moving my view point but I wasn’t physically moving at all. My awareness was existing in both my etheric and astral bodies at the same time. This was how my physical ME was able to see the astral ME so easily, and from any angle. My etheric was, literally, turning aro und in my skin. This ability to see through closed eyelids and from different perspectives is often described by projectors and meditators. This duality seems remarkably similar to how schizophrenics describe what they feel during an attack: The nausea, lack of energy, multiple sets of thoughts and feelings of disorientation. This terrible disorder may be caused by a dislocation of the astral body? The only way to find out if this is the case would be to study a schizophrenic during an attack, from the astral viewpoint. After studying the etheric/physical bodies from my astral form I have come to the following conclusions: During normal sleep, the etheric, better described as the energy body or vitality sheath, expands and acts like an energy sponge or s olar accumulator. It swells and opens; allowing the astral body to float free, while it absorbs some kind of energy (cosmic energy?) from the universe. When it expands, all the chakras, major and minor, slowly open up like the flowers in a garden, catchi ng and absorbing energy. When we awake, the etheric body contracts and re - absorbs the astral body; forming a dense etheric sheath, or skin, which holds within it our stored energy and subtle bodies. According to some sources we have 300 chakras, if you c ount all the minor ones. The swelling of the etheric body, while awareness is centered in it, also appears to be responsible for the sensation of swollen hugeness in the body coupled with a feeling of smallness in self. This strange mix of sensations is o ften reported by people during astral projection or meditation. It appears to be caused by the etheric body swelling and interacting with the universe. ---------- Robert Bruce ------------- rsb@tower.com.au ---------- Your comments, experiences and reques ts for help and advice are Most welcome.

All rights reserved. Projection Problems Here are some answers to the most common problems people are having with projection. Thank you all for the hundreds of email letters you have sent me. Your feedback is helping me to improve this treatise, which ultimately helps everybody. If you write to me and don’t get a reply within a week, write again, I sometimes, inadvertently, l oose a few letters. I have done away with the original technique of shifting the consciousness out of the body. Most people find this kind of visualization far too difficult, and waste precious energy trying to do it. Visualization is the biggest proble m with all projection techniques. To overcome this, I have developed a simpler method that is much more efficient. The most common problems are: 1. Visualization, out in front of yourself. 2. Paralysis, after an apparently successful projection. 3. Fea r. 4. Remembering the projection. 1. The visualization problem: Shifting your point of consciousness away from your body, by visualizing, is simply a way of exerting pressure on the astral body. There are many ways to do this other than the method I gave earlier in this series. The biggest difficulty with this is it requires you to imagine yourself in a different position from the one you are in. For example, if you are lying down, you are (horizontal) and you will be trying to imagine you are standing a t the foot of the bed, which is (vertical).

Clos e your eyes now, and try to imagine yourself lying on the floor, and you will see what I mean. This is not the only difficulty. Any visualization that requires you to imagine yourself at a different place from where you actually are is unnatural and hence extremely difficult. This, I believe, is the cause of most failures. A great deal of energy is wasted on this, energy, which can be better used on the projection itself. Visualization is a big hurdle for people when they are learning to project. Many have trouble with it because they think they have to actually SEE what they are visualizing, you DON’T. People who can visualize things clearly DON’T actually see anything. If they do, it is no longer a visualization but a clairvoyant vision. Visualizati on is simply the ability to construct a representation of what something would look, or feel like, in your minds eye. It is better termed fantasizing, an imaginary perception of reality. Many people who say they can’t visualize at all, are still able to create elaborate fantasies. To overcome this problem I have developed a simple extension of the mental hands technique that will do the same thing. If you managed the mental hands in the relaxation exercise OK, you will have no problems with this. MENTA L HANDS PROJECTION Use a thumbtack to attach a length of ribbon to the ceiling over your bed or chair. Have it hanging over your chest, with the end within arms reach. IF you are using a chair, have it a foot or so in front of you and within arms reach. NOTE: This is a visual aide only. Before you attempt your next projection, get used to reaching out and holding the ribbon. Remember where it is and what it feels like. You are going to use this ribbon to pull yourself out of your body. Start your pr ojection the same as outlined in Part 3. When you enter the trance state, instead of imagining you are out in front of yourself, use your mental hands to pull yourself hand over hand out of your body. Reach up with your mental hands and imagine you are climbing the cord. Feel yourself coming loose from your physical body every time you hand over hand up the cord. Make sure you don’t tense any muscles while you are doing this. Put everything you have in the way of will power into doing this. While yo u are using the mental hands to pull yourself out you can also dispense with the breath awareness. Climbing the ribbon with your mental hands will fully occupy your mind, making any other mental exercise redundant. This will let you put every ounce of me ntal energy you have into the one activity, projection, instead of wasting it on a complicated visualization exercise. While you are climbing the ribbon imagine you are coming loose from the physical body. Imagine you can feel yourself rising a little wit h each new handhold. Feel yourself floating free. You will feel a slight giddy feeling in the pit of your stomach, or solar plexus, as pressure is put on the astral body."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 2. Paralysis after an apparently successful projection: This happens when, after e verything appears to goes well, you feel all the sensations, heaviness, heart chakra thrumming, vibrations etc, but nothing seems to happen. You lie there, unable to move, feeling very light, and with a floating sensation. This is a form of waking paraly sis. What has happened is, you have activated the projection reflex, and the etheric body has expanded but only partially freed the astral body. This is like waking sleep projection. To overcome this when it happens, increase the effort in climbing the rib bon with your mental hands, apply all the will power you have to this. This should put enough pressure on the astral body to complete the projection. If this fails, there is a strong possibility you have already projected and are centered in your physica l or etheric body. If you think this is the case, and you can’t break out of it, use it. Observe all you can, experiment, feel, see what you can see through your eyelids, and try looking behind yourself. Another thing you can try is to convert it into a lucid dream. Try focusing on a fantasy, or a place you would like to go. Build it in your mind so you can tune into it. Not enough is known about the above condition of waking paralysis. If you discover a way to do something about it, or with it, please email me. I will include these findings in a future rewrite to help others with it. 3. Fear: Many people have written to me describing their feelings of fear during projection. This is a kind of natural barrier to some people that must be overcome. Some call it “The Dweller on the Threshold.” It is a manifestation of your own inner fears, very much like a child’s unreasoned fear of the dark; a fear of the unknown. Many people feel there is something evil waiting for them, or a nasty spirit trying to stop them projecting. This must be faced with courage! Look upon it as a test, an exam that must be passed before you can project freely. Once you do project, and face it, you will find it is only a hollow threat that will crumple into nothing. I have projected hundreds of times in my life, and in my astral form, have never been attacked. I did, however, have strong feelings of fear to conquer when I first taught myself to project consciously. There is also this to consider: You are invulnerable in y our astral form and your body has excellent defenses to protect you during a projection. Your expanded etheric will react instantly at the slightest intrusion or unfriendly touch. It can pull you back in a second, no matter how far away you are. Ways to help overcome fear are: • Project during the day. • Leave plenty of lights on in the house. • Project with a friend. (joint projection) • Pray to whatever deity you believe in for protection."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 4. Remembering it all: If your projection seems to happen OK but you only remember laying on the bed and falling asleep after it. The problem could be in remembering the astral experience. Here’s what you can do about not remembering. As soon as you awake, sit up and pull those memories back. Sit up and think hard. Put aside a few minutes quiet time each morning and do this. It will train you to remember your projections and dreams. During this quiet time, run key phrases through your mind until you hit on something. Say things like: I was walking... I was talking t o... I was just going to... I was over at... I was flying over... I was having a... I was inside a... These are examples of phrases that can lead to a fragment of memory you can lock on to. Make up some more phrases for yourself. It may not feel l ike there is anything in your mind to remember, but try hard and put some real effort into it. They are there, you just have to reach in and locate them. Once you lock onto a fragment of memory, more can be located and more still. You will be surprised how much you can remember this way. It is important to write these down as you remember them. They may seem vivid and unforgettable but they will vanish in a few minutes if you don’t record them. Just a few key words will do. One other aid to rememberin g is to give you post - hypnotic suggestions before you project, or go to bed. This can take the form of an affirmation. Say something like “I will remember everything I do tonight.” Say it over and over until you get sick of saying it. Lastly, it helps if you have a mission goal for each projection, something you especially want to do. Combine this with the affirmation and program yourself to do it. For example, say: I will go to the beach and remember... I will go to the beach and remember... Lastly , remember to keep the first few projections ultra short. This is an absolute must! It is more important to have a 30 Sec projection you can remember that an all nighter you forget. ---------- Robert Bruce ------------- rsb@tower.com.au ---------- Your comments, experiences and requests for help and advice are most welcome.

I have tried, by applying my experience as a projector and mystic; to solve some of the basic problems people are having with projection. This has become an interactive work thanks to all the constructive feedback a nd experimentation it has inspired on the Internet. There are certain aspects of the astral dimension and the projection process that are very complicated. Much of it is misunderstood and it can all be very confusing at times. This series of articles a ttempts to shed a little light on the subject, and hopefully, explain what its all about. The theories and conclusions in this Treatise are largely drawn from my own projection experience. It is the goal of this Treatise to develop greater understandi ng and new, simpler and more effective techniques for projection. The ideas, theories and techniques discussed here are constantly under development and are subject to modification and change as new discoveries and insights come to light. What is the A stral Dimension? The astral is the closest dimension to the physical. It overlays and permeates the world like a huge mind net, catching and holding all thought. Its contents are created by the collective consciousness of the world mind. It contai ns all the thoughts, memories, fantasies, and dreams of every living thing in the world. In it, the laws of sympathetic attraction, or like attracts like, causes this ocean of mind stuff to strata and settle into layers or pools. These pools of thought are more commonly called astral planes, astral worlds, astral sub planes or astral realms. The astral dimension is composed of astral matter and is aptly described as mind stuff. It is extremely sensitive to thought and can be molded into any shape or for m. These creations can be so perfect as to be indistinguishable from reality. The best way to explain this, mind stuff is to draw a comparison between astral matter and unexposed, high speed photographic film. When this film is exposed to light, focused by the cameras lens, a perfect image of reality is instantly burnt into the film by the chemical reaction of the film to light. When astral matter is exposed to thought, focused by the lens of the mind, a perfect image of reality is instantly formed out o f astral mind stuff by the reaction of astral matter to thought.

Dreams This is how the subconscious mind creates dream s: By tuning into the astral dimension during sleep, it can create any scenario it wishes. This is the subconscious mind’s way of solving problems and of communicating with the conscious mind. It creates a series of complex thought form scenarios and pr ojects them into the mind stuff of the astral dimension, where they become solid. The conscious mind then lives through and experiences these created scenarios in the dream state. In a way it’s like a movie projector (subconscious mind) projecting onto a movie screen (astral dimension). Thought Forms Any new object in the real world is assimilated into the astral dimension over a period of time. A thought form representation of it first grows in the lowest part of the astral, close to the physical d imension, becoming more and more permanent as time goes on. As with all thought forms, the more attention paid to it the quicker it grows. The higher up in the astral dimension, or the further away from the physical, the less thought forms, of the physic al world, as we know it, are found. Physical things have to soak in to it for a very long time before they take shape, and are found, in the higher astral. Have you ever tried to move around a strange house in the dark? You bump into everything, right. But as you become familiar with it though, a mental picture of your surroundings forms in your mind, and you can find your way around it better. The longer you spend in this house the stronger this mental picture becomes. This is similar to how things ar e assimilated and grown, as thought forms, in other dimensions. The generation of thought forms in the astral also works in the reverse. If a physical object has been around for a very long time, it will have grown a lasting thought form impression in th e astral. After the object is destroyed or removed, its thought form still endures. You may, for example, in the astral, find furniture in your house you don’t have, jumbled up with your own. This is caused by the decaying thought forms of old stuff, be longing to previous tenants etc, still being there, years after the originals have gone. Old thought forms do not follow their physical counterpart around when they are moved. New ones begin to grow in the astral wherever it is while the old ones slowly decay. The longer a thing is in one place, the stronger the thought form will become in that place. This also applies to buildings, structures and geological features. You may project into a park and find a house, bridge, stream; hill etc that you know is definitely not there. These may have existed in times past. The higher up in the astral you go, the older the thought forms are, or the further back in geological time you appear to be."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 The rate of growth of a thought form depends largely on the amoun t of attention paid to it. For example, a famous painting; loved, viewed and highly thought of by millions, will have a much stronger thought form than that of a common painting that hangs in someone’s bedroom and is only viewed by a few. The number of thought forms you find in the astral also depends on how close you are to the physical dimension. If you are very close, as in a real time projection or OOBE, very few thought forms, if any, will be found. In a real time OOBE you are not quite in the as tral dimension but are existing as an astral form in the buffer zone between the astral and the physical dimensions. Astral Vision In the physical body we have 220 degrees of vision, i.e. we can only see in front of us, but not behind, above and below at the same time. In the Astral body we have MORE than 360 degrees of vision and can see on all sides at once. This is Spherical vision. During projection, habit forces us to focus our attention in one direction only, where we feel the forward part of ou r vision is. The view behind, above, below, left and right is still there, and seen all at once, but it cannot be assimilated by the brain, all at once. This goes against the brains lifelong habit of frontal vision. Spherical vision is like being one hu ge multi faceted eye that can see in all directions, up, down, left, right, front, back, but all at once! In the astral body you do not have any physical organs, i.e., eyes. You are a non - physical point of consciousness floating in space. You are also u naffected by gravity and other laws of physics. In this state there are no ups or downs, backs or fronts, left or rights. It is only lifelong habit that tries to force this perspective on you during projection. It is important to understand spherical vi sion, if you are to operate competently in the astral. This is especially so when you project, in real time, close to the physical dimension. Spherical vision will often cause you to think you are in a mirror image dimension, or a reversed copy of realit y. This means your house, for example, will appear to be reversed, back to front. This is caused by you losing your original natural viewpoint during projection. At some point during the projection you have become disoriented and taken a different viewpo int from normal, i.e., you have rotated or turned upside down or inside without thinking. This reverses your natural left right, up down viewpoint. This tricks the subconscious mind into reversing the place you are in so your conscious mind can function properly. As you don’t have a physical body in the astral, if you want to look behind yourself you don’t have to turn around, or move at all. You just change your viewpoint to the rear. This, when done without moving, causes the mirror image effect, in a way its like looking in a mirror to see behind. The diagram below illustrates this reversal of viewpoint without turning; note left and right do not change: "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 Right | Right | (A) <<<<<<<<< -------- | -------- >>>>>>>>>> (B) |   Left | Left That is, if viewpoint (A) becomes viewpoint (B) without turning, then left and right are not reversed. This causes the subconscious mind to use its creative power to correct the view by reversing it, or parts of it. This is easier and causes fewer problems for the conscious mind than if it had to try and accept a reversal of left and right. A similar effect can be had by lying down and looking above your head, or standing on your head an d trying to pick the left and right sides of things. This causes a slight confusion in your sense of left and right, i.e., you have to consciously calculate which is left and right from your reversed position. This slight confusion is all that is needed to trick the subconscious mind into creating something easier to accept. Your brain is unable to assimilate this reversal and thus gives you a new perspective according to what it feels is left and right at the time. Once you consciously notice this anoma ly it is too late to reverse it. The brain cannot accept a conscious change of left and right. If you understand spherical vision though, and happen to get reversed sometime during a projection, it is no longer a problem. You can take it into account and function normally, rather than thinking you are wasting your time in some strange mirror dimension, i.e., if you had plans to do something in the astral you still can. All you have to do is, take your left right coordinates from the building or structure around you, and ignore your own sense of left and right completely. Everything you see while you are in the astral dimension is directly perceived by the mind. It is a simple matter for the subconscious mind to twist or reverse, all, or even part of, you r conscious perception of reality during a projection. Note: This reversal of viewpoint can happen many times during any one real time projection. Creative Visualization Power The subconscious mind has VASTLY greater powers of visualization than the con scious mind. It is like comparing a super computer to a child’s calculator. In the astral dimension, during any conscious projection or lucid dream, where the conscious mind is Aware, this difference can cause great confusion. The subconscious mind si mmers beneath the surface during any projection. All that creative power is just bursting to get out, to create, and it will do just that any chance it gets. This difference in creative power, combined with the lifelong habit of normal frontal vision, i s the cause of the “Alice In Wonderland Effect.” Let me explain.... Take these together: "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 1. The incredible creative power of the subconscious mind. 2. The weak creative powers of the conscious mind. 3. The sensitivity of astral matter to thought. 4. Sphe rical vision. 5. Left, right sense reversals. And you have a recipe for total confusion. The Alice In Wonderland Effect You project your astral body and look around your room. Everything appears normal, but suddenly, you notice the door is on the w rong wall? While looking around, you have seen this door with your rear vision, confusing your natural left, right, brain perspective. The brain can’t assimilate this because your frontal perspective, and the position of the furniture, pictures, windows e tc, are normal; but the view behind you is reversed. This tricks the subconscious mind into creating a door where it thinks it should be. When you look at this door, it appears real, even though you know it is in the wrong place. Once it has been crea ted, it will not be uncreated, as that would be unacceptable to your conscious mind. i.e. solid doors don’t normally have a habit of vanishing before your eyes. When you turn to where the door really should be, you will, usually, find the door there as n ormal. Now you may have two, or more, doors where there should only be one. If you go through the real door, you will find the rest of the house, as it should be, hopefully. But, if you go through a false door, the mind knows it’s false and won’t accep t it opening to a normal part of your house that it knows can’t possibly be there. So, if you open this door you will find something else. It is usually a corridor or passage, you don’t have, leading off into other parts of the house you don’t have eithe r. From then on, if you go through this door, you are in Wonderland, where everything is possible, just not very plausible. What you are doing, in effect, is entering the astral dimension via uncontrolled creation, through this door you don’t have, but now do. Once the subconscious mind starts creating like this it continues to do so at a geometric rate. It has to, for the conscious mind to assimilate the abnormal situation it is in. At some stage, in this creative maelstrom, the subconscious mind loses it completely and starts tuning in to other parts of the astral. At this point of the projection, all semblance of reality is lost and you fade into the astral dimension proper. There are many ways this “Alice” effect can happen during a projection; the above example is just one variation. It has been noted by many projectors that at sometime during a projection they seem to lose control of it. Objects appear, disappear, and generally everything gets a little strange. This is caused, basically, by the subconscious mind’s vast creative ability being triggered. It starts making and unmaking things, and tuning into other areas of the astral and generally making everything difficult for the poor projector."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 To avoid the above problem: Concentrate on what you are doing while you are projecting and don’t let your mind wander. The vision reversal problem can be minimized if you concentrate on your forward vision during projection, i.e., focus in one direction at a time. When you turn, follow the room aro und with your vision and don’t allow it to flit from one view to another. The astral is not a good place to relax if you have serious plans. The vast creative power of the subconscious can, however, be utilized. It is an extremely valuable tool if you kno w how to use it. I will outline ways to do this, in the third part of this series, under the heading: “Virtual Reality Projection” where I will outline how to custom create your own personal astral realm. Melting Hands When you project the astral body close to the physical world you do not have a body as such. But, the mind cannot accept this and so provides a thought form one made out of etheric matter. If you try and look at your body, say your hands, you will find they start to melt very quickly. They look pale and odd, and in a couple of seconds your fingers start to melt away like ice under a blowtorch. They shorten into pale stumps, and then the rest of your hand and arm starts to melt away too. This melting effect only seems to happen when y ou deliberately try and observe a body part or consciously create something. Deliberately observing an astral body part like this uses the conscious mind, which, having poor creative powers, can’t hold complex, shapes together for very long and it is this that causes the melting effect. If you happen to notice parts of your body, in passing, during projection this melting effect will not be seen. Created Thought Form Objects You can use your conscious mind to create objects while projecting. The durat ion of these, thought form, created objects depends on the strength of your creative visualization ability. It also depends on how much time and effort you put in to a creation. This same melting phenomena happens with any conscious creation done in the a stral dimension. If you create for example, a sword, it will appear in your hand just as you imagine it, briefly, and then melt away just like the hand did. If you concentrate on it you can hold it in shape, but as soon as your concentration wavers so do es the creation. This is similar to any other visualization you do in the real world. It is difficult, and you have to concentrate to hold the visualization in your minds eye. Once your concentration wavers, so does the visualized image. This illustrates the vast difference between the creative powers of the conscious and the subconscious mind. To make a lasting thought form object you have to trick the subconscious mind into creating it for you. I will deal with this subject, in greater depth, later in the series."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 How does Projection Happen? During sleep, the energy body, also known as the etheric body or vitality sheath, is put on charge. It expands and opens in order to accumulate and store energy. The energy body can, normally, only do this in its expanded state during sleep. Once expanded, the chakras trickle power, in the form of etheric matter, into the energy body. During this recharging process the astral body separates and tunes into the astral dimension where it can create and experience d reams. If this separation is done consciously, or if you become aware after it, you can take some control over it. It then becomes an OOBE, astral projection or lucid dream. The main differences between an OOBE, astral projection and a lucid dream are: T he OOBE The OOBE (out of body experience) is a real time projection close to the physical world. This often occurs as part of a near death experience. This is where a person is knocked out of their body as a result of some kind of severe trauma, i.e. ca r accident, surgery, heart attack, child birth etc. OOBE’ers are aware of things happening in the real world, in real time; such as conversations and events centered around, or near to, their physical body. In many cases, these events and conversations a re accurately reported by the person after they have returned to their body. Note: The OOBE is slightly different from astral projection or lucid dreaming because of its real time, objective aspect. This is caused by the astral body containing a large amount of etheric matter, which holds it close to the physical world. There are two main causes of real time OOBE: 1. A person’s body is near death, or thinks it is, which causes a large amount of etheric matter to be channeled into the astral body in prep aration for the death process. 2. The person has active chakras, which are doing a similar thing, i.e. channeling etheric matter into the astral body. Having active chakras can be a natural ability, or it can be developed by training. Note: You can proje ct consciously, and have a real time OOBE if enough etheric matter is generated by the chakras. In an OOBE, reality is perceived as objective (real) and time is normal (real time). Technically, when you project into the physical world in real time as in an OOBE, it is really into the boundary area of the buffer zone, between the physical and astral dimensions. If the astral body contains enough etheric matter it can exist only slightly out of phase from reality. This means the projection is in real time a nd so close to the physical dimension as to be indistinguishable from it."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 Note: I have checked this many times, by projecting, in real time, during the day and scouting my local area for road works, accidents, incidents etc, then verifying the accuracy o f my findings afterwards. There are strong natural barriers to conscious, real time projection, the OOBE, in the physical world. The amount of etheric matter generated and channeled to the astral body, is one of them. It limits the duration of any real time projection to the degree of chakra development and control. The Astral Projection This is where the astral body is projected into the astral dimension, where things are quite different from the real world. Time is distorted and extended, i.e., an hour in the astral can be like a few minutes in the physical dimension, depending on what part of the astral you are in. Reality is fluid and changeable. The Lucid Dream This is where a person becomes fully aware that they are dreaming during a dream. They either take some kind of conscious control over the course of events, or they convert the experience into an astral projection. Lucid dreaming is more similar to an astral projection than to an OOBE, as time and reality are distorted. Astral Project ion Or Lucid Dream? Many astral projectors black out before making a conscious exit from their body and return to awareness in the astral dimension. You become aware after the actual separation from the physical body and are usually already in the astral dimension. If you miss the conscious exit from your body you are technically having a lucid dream, not an astral projection as you have become aware after separation. All three types of projection are closely related, i.e., they all involve the astral bo dy separating from the physical and experiencing a reality separate from the physical body. ---------- Robert Bruce ------------- rsb@tower.com.au ---------- Your comments, experiences and requests for help and advi ce are most welcome.

Once the energy body has expanded, the astral body floats free and hovers just above the physical body, but within the expanded energy body’s field of influence. Within this field, known as cord activity range, the astral body is held close to th e physical world as it is within a field of etheric matter. During a conscious astral projection it may appear as if you are projecting straight into an astral plane. But there is always an intermediary phase at the beginning, when you are existing as an astral form close to the physical dimension. This, real time part of any projection, may be missed if you black out at the moment of projection. The area around the body, within cord activity range, is flooded with etheric matter and within this field the astral body is held in real time close to the physical dimension. Etheric Matter Etheric matter is the actual life force substance generated by all living things by simply being alive. It is a substance in - between physical matter and astral matter, par t physical and part astral. This etheric matter has actual weight. It is a very refined substance in between matter and energy and is similar to its coarser cousin, ectoplasm. There have been scientific studies done on this phenomenon. Dying people in h ospitals have had their beds placed on delicate scales shortly before death and hooked up to EEG and ECG monitors. In all cases, at the exact moment of death, a sudden weight loss of approximately one quarter of an ounce is observed. This is caused by a large amount of etheric matter being transferred into the astral body at the moment of physical death. This is similar to the sudden transfer of etheric matter into the astral body during a near death experience where the body believes it is dying. This sudden, massive transfer of etheric matter is the start of the death process.

Materialization mediums have been placed on delicate scales and then asked to produce ectoplasm onto another set of fine scales. These mediums were observed to lose weight at exactly the same rate as the weighed ectoplasm gained weight. When the medium reabsorbed the ectoplasm this weight transfer was reversed. Ectoplasm is produced by the chakras. It converts p art of the physical mass of the mediums body into another substance, ectoplasm. Interdimensional Manifestation Any non - physical or disincarnate entity, including the astral body, in order to function, in real time, close to the physical dimension; must c ontain etheric matter. Without etheric matter, nonphysical entities fade back into their dimension of origin. Etheric matter can only be obtained from living inhabitants of the physical world. Energy Flow The famed “Silver Cord” does more than just ti e the two bodies together. It is a true umbilical cord, transmitting information and energy between the physical and subtle bodies. It is seen by some projectors and not seen by others. Sometimes it is seen emanating from the navel, sometimes from the forehead. The area the cord is seen emanating from may depend on chakra activity. Whichever chakra is the strongest, most active, could have control of energy flow to the subtle bodies. There is also the belief system of the projector to consider and t he creative power of the subconscious mind. The cord will usually appear to be wherever you believe it will be, courtesy of the subconscious. Once the astral body enters the astral dimension it must have a good supply of astral energy from the chakras in order to interact strongly with that dimension. Clear astral memory depends greatly on the amount of energy available. As the astral dimension is the natural domain of the astral body, it will not fade out of it due to a lack of energy. As in the real wo rld, if a person hasn’t eaten or slept for a few days they don’t dissolve into another dimension. They just get weak and listless and don’t interact strongly with the physical world. What it boils down to is this: The astral mind must have enough energy to give it strong, vivid memories. These astral memories must be strong enough to make a good - sized wrinkle in the physical brain, so the physical mind can recall them when it wakes up. For example, if you haven’t slept for a few days you will be tired, listless and your interaction with reality will be weak and vague. If you see a movie in this tired state you will retain little memory of it. Afterwards, you may only remember fragments of it and your memory of it will be a vague blur. If, however, you see a movie when you are well"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 rested, fresh and full of energy, it is different. You take in everything about the movie and enjoy it. Your memory of it will be crystal clear. This is similar to what happens after a low powered astral journey. The astra l body lacks energy and so does not have clear enough impressions of its journey. This causes it to fail making its memories the dominant ones when it returns return to the physical body. As I stated earlier, there must be strong, vivid memories if a wri nkle is to be made in the physical brain and the experience remembered. Chakras Use Fully developing the chakras and learning how to control them can take many years, depending on natural ability. This will not, however, stop you using them in a very ba sic way; to enhance your OOBE’s and lucid dreams, at a very early stage in your development. Raising energy and stimulating the chakras is extremely simple to do. This raised energy will automatically flow into your astral body, prior to and during projection. By learning to raise energy and control the flow of power through the chakras, the nature of your dreams, lucid dreams and OOBE’s will change. They will become vivid and unforgettable experiences. This, in a way, gives you a second life; full of rich experiences you can enjoy, learn and grow from. Higher Levels And Their Buffer Zones The commonly accepted names for the seven known levels of existence, from lowest to highest, are: Physical, Astral, Mental, Buddhic, Atmic, Anupadak a and Adi. These higher planes are similar in structure to the astral dimension but at a much higher level of consciousness and are completely separate from it. In between the different levels are intermediary areas or buffer zones, sometimes called lo wer sub planes. A good analogy for the different dimensions and their buffer zones is the Earth’s atmosphere: If the air in the Earth’s atmosphere was the astral dimension, the stratosphere would be the buffer zone and the vacuum of space would be the men tal dimension. You can fly in the Earth’s atmosphere in a normal air plane/astral body. A very powerful jet plane is needed to take you into the stratosphere, but you need a space ship/mental body, to travel through space. This explains why a differe nt subtle body is needed to travel into these different levels of existence. The astral body can enter the buffer zones, or sub planes, of the dimensions above and below the astral dimension, if it contains the correct type of energy. i.e. To exist in th e buffer zone between the physical/astral levels (in real time) the astral body must contain etheric energy. To exist in the buffer zone between the astral/mental levels it must contain mental energy.

The production of one particular type of energy will raise the consciousness to that level and energize the corresponding subtle body. This is usually done by consciousness raising meditat ion and advanced energy work on the chakras. The consciousness can then experience that level of existence. If enough energy is available, and conditions are right, the meditator can project that particular subtle body directly into its natural dimensi on. Depending on the skill and natural ability of the operator, if a higher body is energized and projected so, usually, are the lower ones. The astral body contains within it all the other subtle bodies and can, during a projection, project the mental b ody into the mental dimension and so on. This will sometimes give multiple sets of memories from the one projection. The general rule is, whichever subtle body contains the greatest amount of energy, will have the strongest memories. These dominant memo ries will be the ones retained by the physical mind upon its return to the waking state. Projecting consciously into levels higher than the astral dimension takes a high level of skill. You need to be proficient in both consciousness raising and chakr a control, but it is achievable. I have, so far, projected into the Astral, Mental, Buddhic and Atmic levels of existence. It is commonly believed that it is only possible for a human to project into the Astral, Mental and Buddhic levels and not possibl e to project into the higher Adi and Anupadaka. These dimensions have been named, and are described, so someone must have been there or they would be unknown. If you realize the true nature of the mind you will understand there are no limits. It was also once said that the sound barrier would never be broken. BTW: These dimensions don’t have signposts on them saying “Welcome to the Astral dimension, ta...daa!” or “Mental dimension, watch your mind!”. So I will describe the higher levels I have been to using these accepted names. The Astral Dimension This is a topsy -turvy world like Alice found in Wonderland. Everything seems objective (real) but is changeable and fluid. Anything and everything can be found there, from base, coarse levels full of sexu al energy; to beautiful, serene places full of spiritual harmony. Time is distorted and extended there. An hour in the Astral can seem like only a few minutes here in the physical. Compared to the physical world it is at a much higher vibration. It’s l ike playing videotape at twenty times normal speed, although this is not apparent when you are there. Moving amongst the astral dream pools is usually a hit or miss affair for most projectors. It takes a lot of experience to make planned astral journeys t o specific realities."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 There are an infinite number of realities, planes, realms and dream pools in this dimension. As I stated before, they naturally strata and settle into pools of related thought. During sleep, or in a lucid dream, the subconscious min d usually creates one especially for you, your own personal dream theatre. When you become aware during a dream, you take control over it. This control is taken over from the powerful subconscious mind. Without its powerful controlling influence, your personal custom created realm will change. You will begin tuning into other sympathetic parts of the astral, and the reality you are in will mix with other realities and take on different aspects. In a conscious projection into the astral dimension, you can tune into any part of it and travel into different realities, other dream pools, or a mix of many. There are various techniques for this but they all involve some way to disorient the subconscious mind, tricking it into moving you into a different Ast ral reality. Some projectors look at their hands and watch them melt. Others spin around, causing left right reversals. These methods all disorient the mind and trick the subconscious into tuning into another part of the astral. It’s very difficult to describe how to move amongst the levels, you really have to learn by doing it, by trial and error. You have to learn how to use and control the subconscious mind, how to trick it for a specific result. Virtual Reality Projection Here is a simple, reli able method, I have developed, to create your own personal realm: Get a poster of a pleasant scene, something bright and sunny. The bigger the better, but standard poster size will do. Hang it on the wall of the room you are going to project in, or anot her room close by. Get a small spotlight and set it so the poster is highlighted when the main light is turned off, a normal directional bedside lamp will do. Place the light under, or above, so the light spreads out over it giving a diffused effect ill uminating it, a bit like a movie screen. Entering your custom realm: When you project, go towards the poster, keeping your mind blank. Don’t think about what you are doing, just gaze at it and move towards it. As you approach it in this way, your subcon scious mind will be tricked into creating an astral realm exactly like the poster. Just move up to and into the poster. It is like stepping into another world. Everything in this world will be exactly like in the poster. It will appear to be a normal three - dimensional world, an exact copy, indistinguishable from reality. To customize this world: Cut and paste small pictures of things, or people, you want to find in this world with you when you enter it. Don’t just stick a whole picture on the poster . Get scissors and cut around the object, or person. Try and find pictures that are approximately the same scale as the poster. If you cut out a small picture of someone, living or dead, your subconscious will create a thought form shell of them and the y will be there waiting for you. This may be an excellent way of communicating with those that have died."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 Spirit Communication: (I have a theory) The subconscious creates this thought form shell of a person. This shell can be animated by the perfect, de tailed memory of your subconscious. But, if there is love there, between the projector and this created person, the spirit of this, diseased person, will be drawn to this scenario and will use this opportunity to communicate with the projector, by animat ing the created image of their body. The Akashic Records These are found in the buffer zone between the astral and mental worlds, part astral part mental and, in a way, extending into all levels. They are a record of every thought and event that has e ver occurred, like a huge, infinite, mental history, picture book. The Akashic records also contain probabilities stemming from, and created by, past events, actions and thoughts. This is like looking into the future. To make any kind of sense of the A kashic records yourself, some skill in clairvoyance is a definite help. If you tune into the Akashic records yourself you will normally see those events with the greatest amount energy around them. Wars and disasters are the easiest to see because of this . The energy surrounding these events make them stand out above all the rest, making them easier to see. If you look into the future, the area of probabilities, you enter into a confusing maelstrom of symbolism mixed with actual events. This future symb olism is caused by the belief systems of the major religions. Millions of people in the world have believed in some form of prophecy for thousands of years. Whether it is the Bible’s “Book of Revelations” or the prophecies of Nostradamus. These ancient prophecies are all richly steeped in symbolism. This symbolism affects the way people think and dream about the future. This symbolism, in turn, manifests in the Akashic records as symbolic representations of future events. The symbolism is a big help; it makes consulting the Akashic records easier. You can use the Akashic symbolism as an index. For example, the reference below to “The Dogs of War” is easily understandable as representing war. The “Grim Reaper” is a universal symbol of death and destr uction. So, if you are interested in this kind of future event you tune into this symbolic index for WAR, then browse through the category of past and future wars. Apart from some clairvoyant ability, knowledge of history, geography, religious symbolism, current affairs world leaders and heads of state is a big help; when indexing past and future events. For example, in the future vision I give below: If I had known WHO the well known person I saw addressing a crowd below WAS, and recognized the country; I could have made an accurate prediction of future events instead of being wise, AFTER the event. I entered the state of consciousness called the Akashic records. There I was inundated with a mass of symbolism. I was seeing in four dimensions at once. My conscious mind did not assimilate this very well. I saw wars, famines, plagues, disasters, earthquakes, volcanoes erupting, plane crashes, murders, etc, it was terribly confusing and depressing."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 I saw one piece of symbolism I recognized though and tun ed into it, indexed it. The Grim Reaper holding The Dogs of War (as described by various prophets) these dogs were fearsome beasts with Red eyes and slavering jaws. They were held in check by this hooded figure, with an evil skull for a face, carrying a sickle. He released these dogs as I watched, symbolizing a coming war. Tuning into this scene, I was there floating above it all, I could feel the sunshine and smell the city below me. I saw a man standing on a raised dais, under two giant scimitar sw ords. He was giving a charismatic speech to many thousands of people. One of the swords turned into a Christian Crusader’s broadsword. The man was Saddam Hussein; the scene was in Baghdad, at the monument to the Unknown Soldier. I saw this six months before the Gulf war started. I did not learn WHO Saddam Hussein WAS, or WHERE this scene took place though, until it was televised during the gulf war. Looking through the Akashic records is like leafing through an infinite mental photo album. You are b ombarded with an awesome array of the sights and sounds of past, present and probable futures. You have to select one of these thought records, tune into it and enter it. You will then live through the record as if you were really there, watching it as it happens. Consulting with the Akashic records can be done alone if you have the skill, but is normally done with the assistance of an advanced being from a higher level of existence. This is done as a sort of telepathic guided tour. The enormous amount of information and chaff is filtered out for you and the selected record, of past events or future probability, is presented to you clairvoyantly, via a telepathic link with the... librarian. Some people claim to have entered the Akashic Records and foun d something like a library there, with real books. The past, present and future was recorded as text in these books. Some people even say they have read a record, then entered into it, and experience the record first hand. All these claims are consiste nt with the Akashic Records. These are librarian assisted guided tours, where the Akashic Records have been presented as something familiar, easy to use and easy to accept. The Mental Dimension This is a spectacular dimension! Iridescent rivers of sou nd bounded by rainbow shores of pulsating light. Thoughts appear as kaleidoscopic patterns of light and sound. You walk across fields of ideas under a sparkling crystal sky of inspiration. If you enter this world don’t try to rationalize or understand it, or you may go mad, for it is beyond human understanding. Just accept it all, go with the flow and enjoy it! This dimension is what, I believe, the ancient Vikings called the famed “Rainbow Bridge” into Asgard. It truly looks and feels as if you are walking up a rainbow into some wonderful world where the Gods must surely dwell."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 Exist here in wondrous amazement. Let loose the child within you to play in this fairy wonderland. Everything feels real and solid. Time is even further distorted here than in the Astral and reality is kaleidoscopic. Buddhic Dimension This is a warm, abstract world filled with utter peace and infinite love. It is a dimension of pure White. There is no sight or sound perception here other than the all pervading, brillia nt White. In this dimension you very quickly relinquish conscious thought and individuality. You cannot think for long once you enter ere and there is no need or desire to do so. There is an irresistible urge drawing you into a quiet stillness. It is l ike being immersed in warm, pure White cotton wool. In this world you cease to be an individual and you become, PART OF THE ONE. You also cease to be male or female. In a way this is like returning to the Mother’s womb. You are surrounded, absorbed an d assimilated by infinite loving warmth, understanding, forgiveness and atonement. AT - ONE - MENT. Time here ceases to have any meaning. If you enter this world you will never, ever want to leave it, you cannot leave it, until your physical body calls and drags you back. This is the healing, resting place of the soul. Atmic Dimension This dimension appears be the spirit world. Here, spirits wait for those they loved during their time on earth. This is the happy place of the gathering. It is the place where the reunion of souls takes place. The light in this world is purest, brightest silver, brighter than the flash of an arc welder. It is so bright it seems impossible to look at, but it is, for all that, a supremely gentle light, soft and soothing. It is the light of divine love. The people here appear as they did in the physical world, but at their most magnificent. They glow ecstatically, ablaze with the brightest love, happiness and joy imaginable. The atmosphere is electric and vital, but at the same time deeply spiritual. In this world you can FEEL the presence of God as a tangible all - pervading force. Communication here, is done by high - level telepathic imaging, similar to one - on - one clairvoyance only much more vivid and real. It leaves sp eech and thought for dead. Time stands utterly still here. Reality is more real and solid than normal reality. Compared to this, the physical world is a vague, tired dream full of half dead people. I have entered this dimension only four times in my li fe. Each time from the very deepest consciousness raising meditation, with all my chakras wide open and fully functioning. There was also extreme crown chakra activity. The feeling of this was like a thousand fingers vibrating, and deeply massaging, th e whole top of my head above the hairline."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 On these four occasions my energy has soared to seemingly impossible heights within me, carrying my spirit and consciousness with it. At the climax of this deeply mystical experience I have heard the sound of one long, pure musical note slowly rising in pitch. I have felt this note in the core of my being, in my heart, calling me, drawing me to it. I have focused on this note and attuned to it. With every ounce of strength and energy I possessed I have focused my consciousness on it and projected to it. Stripping away my physical body, I have projected straight into this dimension. It was just like stepping, slipping, through a heavy curtain into another place and another world. I am still aware of my physi cal body, duality, during this whole experience. I look about me with wonder; the light is so silver and bright it burns deeply into my soul and I can feel its healing touch within me. There in front of me is my long dead son. He was eight years old when he left me, and he looked just as he did when I last saw him. He was beaming with happiness, his eyes bright and shining. I cuddled him up to me and wept with the joy of seeing him. I looked beyond him and there was a large crowd of people waiting for me. These were all the friends and family I had known and loved and lost during my life. There were also many people I did not know. They all seemed very familiar though and I felt I loved them all. They were clapping and jumping up and down, cheering me in greeting. There were many tears of joy and lots of hugging and kissing. Looking beyond them, I see we are in a natural stone amphitheatre. The ground is smooth rock and it rises to a ridge a couple of hundred meters away that curves towards us. O n the top of this ridge are Angels. They looked just like Michelangelo painted them. They were incredibly beautiful, with large White feathered wings, curly Golden hair and Alabaster skin. They were blowing long sparkling golden horns, and the pure hi gh note came from them. Stepping from the crowd I walked into the open. I look in awe at these angels and waved at them. The note started to die away as I did this and the Angels began lowering their horns. I stand for a timeless moment in silence, lo oking all around me. Then everything began to shimmer and I slipped; fell back into my physical body. I wept. I have never wanted to come back. Death When you leave your body for the final time, at death, this is what I believe will happen: You will b e projecting, in real time, for the first few days, close to the physical world, until your supply of etheric matter runs out. Then you will go through the second death and enter the Astral dimension. There, you will purge yourself of all desire, by being able to have anything you have ever wanted, in abundance. This is done through having the full use of your subconscious mind’s powerful creative ability. Here you can saturate your every need and desire, until you see these desires for the illusions the y really are."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 You will then shed your Astral (desire body) and enter the Mental dimension.

There, your thoughts, memories and exper iences will be added to the Akashic Record. Which is the recorded experience of the entire human existence in the physical dimension. Shedding your mental body you will then enter the Buddhic dimension. There you will stay for timeless healing, for rest, atonement, forgiveness and understanding of self. In this world your inner wounds will heal and your soul will be nurtured by divine love. Your spirit will become whole and perfect once more. Then you will shed your Buddhic body and enter the Atmic dime nsion. There you will wait in the divine presence for those you love.

Relaxing your body 100% while staying awake. 2. Concentrating 100% on what you are doing. 3. Having eno ugh energy available. 4. Pressuring the astral body to separate. Together, these four things will trigger an OOBE. Below are exercises that will teach how to relax the body, concentrate, clear the mind, raise energy, stimulate the chakras and enter the tr ance state. CALMING THE MIND Relaxation You must learn and master, a full body relaxation exercise. If you know one already it can be adapted to suit. Here is a very simple one: Sit, or lie down, and relax. Starting with the feet, tense and relax th em. Continue this with calves, thighs, hips, stomach, chest, arms, neck and face until your whole body is deeply relaxed. Go over this a few times, making sure your muscles stay relaxed. Note: Deep physical relaxation is the key to bringing on the tra nce state, i.e., deep relaxation CAUSES the trance state. Once you are in the trance state, projection on the astral body is relatively easy.

It carries messages, reminders, pressing thoughts, problems to solve, unresolved issues etc. It is constantly busy, it NEVER rests, thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, one after the other, all clamoring for attention. Before you attempt to clear your mind, with the breath awareness exercise below, it is wise to deal with these surface thoughts by the act of contemplating them. Sit comfortably, do the relaxation exercise and think, nothing more, just think. Search out the strongest though ts in your mind and examine them, try to resolve and understand them. Note the word: THINKING. Contemplation does not involve clearing the mind, or visualization. It requires you to THINK, deeply and thoroughly, about something, to gain a deeper underst anding of its nature and how it relates to you, an insight. Breath Awareness Meditation This is a simple form of meditation. It will clear your mind and focus your awareness. Sit or lie down, close your eyes, do the relaxation exercise and clear your mi nd. Breathe deeply and slowly and focus on the breath entering and leaving your body. Feel it coming in and feel it going out. Focus your whole attention on your lungs and the breathing process. This simple action is enough to occupy your surface mind . Firmly push intruding thoughts away, as they begin, before they can gather strength and distract you. Breath awareness occupies the surface mind and allows you to think on a much deeper level. Surface Thoughts Sounds are very distracting, they generat e surface thoughts. A car horn will generate: “Who’s that, what’s happening?” A door opening will generate: “Who’s coming in or going out?” The surface mind is always very curious about what is happening around you. It wants to know all, and it wa nts to inform you of every little thing going on around you. It will pressure you to open your eyes, get up and go find out what’s happening. Don’t allow this to happen. USE these annoying, attention getting thoughts as a training aide. By learning to q uash and ignore them, your powers of concentration will grow. Stop these annoying little thoughts as they begin, before they can take root and grow into something stronger.

DON’T use music or other sounds to blanket these out, USE them for training. It’s like weight lifting, if you train with feather dusters your strength will not increase. You need to master this, the hard way, if you want to give your mind real muscle. Slowly but surely you will master the ability to cl ear your mind. Once accomplished, you will have gained a valuable mental tool. You will be able to concentrate 100% of your attention, on one task, to the TOTAL exclusion of everything else. I sometimes meditate, in the trance state, successfully, in a no isy, crowded room with little children crawling all over me. NOTHING breaks my concentration. CONCENTRATION You must be able to concentrate and focus completely on what you are doing. Lack of concentration is the single, biggest cause of projection fa ilure. It affects every aspect of projection, from the relaxation exercise, to the trance state and actual projection. To test your ability to concentrate: Sit and relax. Close your eyes and clear your mind of ALL thought. Breathe slowly and deeply a nd count each breath, at the end of each exhale. Hold it totally BLANK, apart from the counting, for as long as you can. See how long you can hold it like this. Be honest with yourself, every time a thought intrudes start counting from the beginning aga in. You are doing well if can do this for longer than ten breaths.

Try and keep s ight of it for as long as possible. Use breath awareness to keep the mind clear, while you are doing this. Try and make the after image grow, instead of fading away. Concentration Exercise (2) One point stare: Pick a spot on a wall and gaze at it. D on’t focus on it, just gaze at it gently. Clear your mind of ALL thoughts and forcibly hold it blank. Concentrate HARD, on breath awareness while you are doing this. When you feel a thought beginning, push it away, don’t let it finish! Hold this for as long as you can. Do this several times a day, or more if you can. Concentration Exercise (3) Energy breathing: Sit and relax. Close your eyes and clear your mind. Do the breath awareness exercise and imagine the air you are breathing IN is brightly c olored energy of your favorite color. Imagine the air you are breathing OUT is a murky Grey, full of toxic waste. This is a purification exercise. It stimulates your chakras into absorbing energy on the inhale and getting rid of negative energy on the e xhale. Note: Try your best not to tense up while you are doing these concentration exercises, it is ALL mental. In the beginning, it may feel as if you have to tense your mind into a tight ball to stop it thinking, but in time you will find the opposite to be true. When you get used to it, clearing the mind is VERY relaxing. The Trance State When you have attained a deep level of relaxation and mental calmness, you will feel your body begin to get very, very heavy. This heaviness is the main symptom of your brain waves changing from the Beta to the Alpha level as you enter a trance. The trance state is caused by deep physical and mental relaxation. There is nothing weird or supernatural about it. It simply means your body has entered the sleep st ate while your conscious mind is fully awake. How To Enter A Trance Do the relaxation exercise and calm your mind through breath awareness. Imagine you are climbing down a ladder in the dark. Don’t visualize a ladder; just imagine you can feel yourself doing it. On the exhale, feel yourself climbing a step or two down the ladder with your imaginary Hands (outlined below). On the inhale, feel yourself holding still on the ladder. What is needed is a mental falling effect inside your mind.

Once your level of brain wave activity reaches Alpha you will enter a trance. Keep doing this for as long as it takes. The time it takes to enter trance will vary, depending on your experience with deep relaxation and mental calmness. Note: Once you get the heavy feeling, stop the mental falling exercise. If you don’t like the ladder, imagine you are in a lift, feel yourself falling on the exhale and holding on the inhale. Or, Imagine you are a feather, feel yourself floating down on the exhale and holding still on the inhale. As I stated above, you need a mental falling effect to lower your level of brain wave activity. This mental falling effect, when combined with deep relaxation and mental calmness, will cause you to enter the trance state. Feel free to use any scenario you are familiar with to bring about this going deeper feeling. A trance feels like: Everything gets quieter and you feel like you are in a much bigger place. There is a very slight humming feeling in your body. Everything feels different. It feels a bit like putting a cardboard box over your head in the dark, you can feel the atmosphere change. I t’s like everything goes fuzzy or slightly blurred. Any sharp noises, while in trance, feel like a physical blow to the Solar Plexus. Deep Trance The level of trance you achieve depends greatly on your relaxation, concentration skills and will power. To enter a deeper trance, i.e., Theta level and beyond, you have to concentrate much more and for much longer, on the mental falling sensation aided by breath awareness. The first level of trance, i.e., when you get very heavy, is quite deep enough for projection. I strongly advise against forcing yourself deeper than a light trance, until you have plenty of experience with the trance state. How can you tell if you are entering a deep trance? There are four very noticeable symptoms: 1. An uncomfortab le feeling of cold that doesn’t make you shiver, coupled with a steady loss of body heat. 2. Mentally, you will feel very odd and everything will feel extremely slooooow. Your thought processes will slow down as if you had been given a strong pain killing injection. 3. You will feel disassociated from your body, i.e., a strong floating sensation and everything will seem far away. 4. Total physical Paralysis. Note: These four things, ALL TOGETHER, signify you are entering a deep trance. Do not mistake the mild floating sensation you sometimes get with light trance, i.e., as you astral body comes loose. Or the slight loss of body heat from sitting still for a long"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 time and the mild paralysis, i.e., the heaviness, for a deep trance. The sensation of deep tr ance is quite uncomfortable and unmistakable for what it is. It is very difficult to get into the deep trance state, as you need highly developed relaxation, concentration and trance state skills plus lots and lots of will power and mental energy. You wi ll not accidentally fall into it. If you are worried you are going too deep, remember this: You CAN pull yourself out of it at any time. Concentrate ALL your will on moving your fingers or toes. Once you can move a finger or toe, flex your hands, move yo ur arms, shake your head, i.e., reanimate your body; and get up and walk around for a few minutes. Falling into a deep trance should not be a problem with these exercises. I have seen many people in meditation groups etc, enter a light trance and not be a ble to pull themselves out of it, i.e., they float away with the faeries. Usually some kind person will talk them out of it or massage their wrists etc to get them to come back to reality. This is unnecessary and is the result of lop - sided training, i.e. , no concentration or will power training. The person only THINKS they cannot come back and therefore does not try very hard. It is also a good way of getting attention from the group. Note: Your mind is extremely powerful and has vast untapped resourc es. It can do ANYTHING, no limits, if it is trained, conditioned and properly motivated. Energy Body Expansion At some point after entering the trance state, you will feel a mild paralysis come over you. This will soon be accompanied by a deepening vib ration and a buzzing feeling all over. You may also feel like you are huge and swollen. The paralysis, vibrations and the huge feeling are symptoms of the energy body expanding and the astral body loosening. This is part of the normal sleep process. Th e energy body expands and opens in order to accumulate and store energy. During this, the astral body drifts free, slightly out phase with the physical body. Trance Familiarity Many people blow their projection simply because they are not used to the t rance state. They think it is a briefly opened window into the Astral dimension. This is simply NOT true. If you stay mentally and physically calm when you enter the trance state, you can maintain it for hours. I regularly spend several hours at a time in the trance state, during meditation. If, when you enter trance, you think: “Yes! I’ve done it!...I’m in a trance! Gotta hurry and get out quick...before it stops!” You’ll blow it for sure! The trance will be ended by the simple act of getting over e xcited, i.e., breaking relaxation and mental calmness."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 It’s a good idea to spend time in the trance state, just getting used to it, before you try and project. Just relax, stay calm, focus on breath awareness, and hold the trance. It won’t end until you want it to. Get used to how it feels. When you are comfortable doing this, do the energy raising and chakra stimulation exercises, below, in trance. Note: 1. You do not HAVE to be in a trance to learn energy and chakra work, it just works better in tranc e. 2. Trance practice can be done lying down, but is best done in a comfortable armchair. Your astral body will be loose in the trance state, so try lifting your astral arms and legs out, one at a time. Use your HANDS to do this, as shown in the next sec tion. Focus and FEEL your awareness in an arm and slowly lift it free of your body. You may feel a slight tickling or localized dizziness inside your arm or leg, as you do this. Lift your astral arm up and look at it, with your eyes closed, but DON’T mo ve a muscle. In this state you should be able to see it through your closed eyelids, but don’t worry if you can’t, this will come later. Lifting your astral arms free is good practice for projection. Later, you will use these astral arms to pull your ast ral body free of the physical. Tactile Imaging Tactile imaging is a perception or FEELING of localized bodily awareness. Your hands are very closely linked to your bodily awareness. They are intimately aware of every part of your body. Imaginary HANDS, outlined below, is only an extension of this (hand to body) awareness. When you are asked to feel your awareness, in any part of your body, PRETEND your hands, your real hands, are going to touch that area of your body. Then use the awareness this gener ates in that area to imagine your imaginary HANDS are there. Keep your eyes closed and hold your hands out a foot or so in front of your face. Concentrate, FEEL where they are and try and SEE them through the blackness behind your closed eyes. Cross you r wrists, slowly move them about, turn your hands over, open and close your fingers. Look hard, concentrate, as if you were trying to see in the dark, and you will see a faint moving shadow in your minds eye, where your hands and arms are. Close your eyes and touch the tip of your nose with the index finger of your right hand. You’ll find you can accurately put that finger on any part of your body with your eyes closed. Try it, put your hand, your real hand, on different parts of your body like this. You know exactly where your hands are at all times; you can sense and feel where they are.

Go over your whole body like this, getting used to the sensation of awareness it generates in different areas of your body. What is happening is this: Part of your mind is shifting into, and HIGHLIGHTING, the area you are going to touch, in order to guide your hand to the exact spot. Your mind shifts part of its awareness to this spot and acts like a homing beacon for your hand. The ability to shift your awareness into different parts of your body like this is VITAL t o energy work and this projection method. Note: You do not have to actually visualize these HANDS, i.e., see or imagine you can see them. It is ALL tactile, NOT visual. You just have to be able to pretend to FEEL them doing something, like you are rehe arsing some simple action in your mind. I originally developed this technique for blind people. Blind people cannot visualize AT ALL, if they have been blind since birth, but they do have a very keen sense of bodily awareness. The majority of sighted pe ople also have great trouble with visualization of any kind, and all projection techniques depend heavily on visualization. This being the case, I developed a projection technique that does NOT depend on visualization to exert pressure on the astral body to separate. It turned out to be so much easier, and more successful, than the other visualization based techniques, that I discarded them in favor of this simple tactile method. Note: Blind people are not blind in astral form. The astral body does not have any organs as such; it is a point of consciousness only. The astral body you are aware of while projecting is provided courtesy of the subconscious minds creative ability. ---------- Robert Bruce ------------- rsb@tower.com.au ---------- Your comments, experiences and requests for help and advice are most welcome.

Base chakra (base of spine, between anus and genitals) 2. Spleen chakra (slightly below the belly button) 3. Solar Plexus chakra (1 hand - span above the belly b utton) 4. Heart chakra (center of the chest) 5. Throat chakra (base of throat, above where it joins the chest) 6. Brow chakra (exact center of forehead) 7. Crown chakra (whole top of head above the hairline) They are best imagined as roughly the size of t he palm of your hand, except for the crown chakra, which is much larger. What Are Chakras? Chakras are non - physical organs that transform raw subtle energy into more subtle, and useable, forms of energy, of a different type. The chakras do not, themselv es, contain energy. Raw energy is drawn up from the planet, by the minor chakras in the legs and feet, and fed into the main chakra system. Subtle energy is, in essence, pure thought energy that permeates and binds the universe together. This living en ergy field can be tapped, more deeply, by the application of focused, creative will.

There are also several non - physical chakras situated outside of the body. Detailed maps of the chakra system and their connecting meridians and pathways, have been used for thousands of years in Eastern mysticism and medicine, i.e., acupuncture. The chakra system is used with every psychic ability, no exceptions. Whatever the psychic abilit y, the method of development or the terminology used to describe it; it is all done the same way, through chakra stimulation. It is impossible to manifest any psychic ability without first stimulating the chakras. Many people will deny this, above, and cl aim they have never done any chakra, energy work, but still have psychic abilities. There are many ways to develop yourself, agreed, but they all, directly or indirectly, stimulate the chakra system. And let’s not forget natural ability. Many people are born with naturally active chakras and hence, natural psychic ability. Mediums are people who exhibit psychic abilities when aided by a nonphysical spirit entity. This entity stimulates the chakras of the medium directly, by melding with the medium and c ausing psychic abilities, clairvoyance, channeling, healing, production of ectoplasm etc to manifest through the medium. This is why they are called Mediums or channels, i.e., they have the ability to become a passive vehicle for a spirit entity to affect , or communicate with, the physical world. You do not need a spirit entity to develop and use, a psychic ability. If you learn to control your own chakras and energy, you can do these things on your own, with no spirit entity involved, and without the inhe rent risk involved with that method. Energy Raising Sit, or lie down, do the relaxation exercise and clear you mind with breath awareness. Focus your awareness in your feet. Use your HANDS to pull energy up from your feet, through your legs, to the ba se chakra. Imagine you are gripping energy and pulling it up through you. Just like you did when you used these HANDS with breath awareness and color breathing, pulling air and energy into your lungs. Note: Try and imagine your HANDS are inside your leg s and just inside the front of your torso as you do this. Use breath awareness as an aide to energy rising. Draw energy up through you, with the inhale, and hold it in place on the exhale. Do this over and over again, pulling energy to the Base chakra, f or at least a few minutes. You may or may not feel anything while you do this. Even if you don’t, you are still drawing some energy with this exercise. The amount of energy drawn up through you will increase as the chakras develop with time and use. Fro m the feet, up the legs to the base center, is a natural path for the energy that flows through you. This energy will stimulate your chakras and they will transform this, basic energy, into energy of a different type. This transformed energy will then fl ow into your subtle bodies, energizing them. With practice, you will actually FEEL this energy tingling and surging through you."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 Chakra Stimulation Opening a chakra: Your imaginary HANDS are used for this. Imagine you are tearing open a bread roll at t he site of a chakra when you are asked to do this. You don’t have to visualise anything, just FEEL like you are doing this, as if you were doing it in real life without looking at what you are doing. Chakras are non - physical centers, so you need a non - phy sical method to stimulate them. This is achieved by focusing your awareness in the area of a chakra and using your mind to manipulate it. You need a localized, mental opening effect in a chakra to stimulate it; this tearing open action, with your imagina ry HANDS, provides it. By moving your point of awareness to the site of a chakra and causing a mental opening effect with your HANDS, you are directly stimulating the chakra. Note: Do the energy raising exercise, as above, before stimulating the chakras . Use breath awareness to aide your HANDS in pulling energy into each chakra, i.e., draw energy UP on the inhale and HOLD it on the exhale, with all the chakra stimulation exercises below. 1. Base chakra: Raise energy up to your Base chakra. Use your HA NDS to open it. Pull energy INTO the Base chakra. Repeat this first step, thoroughly, seven times. 2. Spleen chakra: Draw energy from the feet, through the Base chakra and on up to the Spleen chakra. Open the Spleen chakra. Repeat this three times, st arting at feet. 3. Solar Plexus chakra: Draw energy from the feet, through the Base and Spleen chakras and on up to the Solar Plexus chakra. Open the Solar Plexus chakra. Repeat this three times, starting at feet. 4. Heart chakra: Draw energy up from th e feet, through the Base, Spleen and Solar Plexus chakras and on up to the Heart chakra. Open the Heart chakra. Repeat this three times, starting at feet. 5. Throat chakra: Draw energy up from the feet, through the Base, Spleen, Solar Plexus and heart c hakras to the Throat chakra. Open the Throat chakra. Repeat this three times, starting at feet. 6. Brow chakra: Draw energy up from the feet, through the Base, Spleen, Solar Plexus, Heart and Throat chakras to the Brow chakra. Open the Brow chakra. Repe at this three times, starting at feet. 7. Crown chakra: Draw energy up to the Crown chakra as in the previous step. Open the Crown chakra. This chakra is much larger than the others (whole top of head, above hairline). Imagine you have a much larger, f latter bread roll inside the top of your head and are tearing it open with your HANDS, or like you are tearing your scalp open. Repeat this entire process twice, starting with the feet. Note: Try your best not to tense any muscles during these exerc ises. You may, however, feel a slight internal contracting, a feeling that is NOT muscular while you are stimulating your chakras. These are the glands and nerve ganglia, linked to the chakras, contracting in response to the stimulation. This interna l contracting is normal."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 The Base, or Root chakra, is THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE TO ACTIVATE. This chakra is the doorway for the Kundalini energy. Unless this is opened sufficiently, the energy cannot flow into the other chakras. I suggest you concentrate m ost of your time and energy into stimulating your Base chakra, at least in the early stages of chakra development. Note: When I first started raising energy and developing my chakras, many years ago, I didn’t feel ANY sensation for several months. Many people, though, have reported to me strong energy and chakra sensation the first time they used them. Some people have more natural chakra activity than others. Lack of any sensation, though, will not stop you from stimulating and developing them, even if, as was my case, you feel nothing at first. I did not have ANY natural chakra activity or ANY natural psychic ability when I first started energy work. Stop And Check Check your muscles for any tensing during the energy raising and chakra stimulati on exercises, and re - relax as needed. Your muscles will automatically try and respond to the mental action of pulling energy up through you. Remember, this is ALL mental; your body must stay calm and relaxed throughout. Chakra Sensations The sensations you will feel in your chakras can vary, according to the degree of activity occurring in them, i.e., your physical make up, natural ability, concentration and relaxation skills affect this. It can vary from a gentle warmth, a localized pressure, or bubb ling (like stomach wind), a localized dizziness, a tingling, a gentle pulsing, to a heavier throbbing, or a combination of some or all of the above. The heavier the thrumming, the more active the chakra. If you place your hand on a chakra, when it is ac tive, you will actually feel the flesh pulsing. Some of the chakras, when active, can cause other odd, localized sensations: Base chakra: You may feel a very slight burning or tingling, or a cramping, like you have been riding a bicycle for too long, to b egin with. Once it is working properly, you will feel a gentle pulsing or throbbing between your legs, at the site of the chakra. Solar Plexus Chakra: This can sometimes cause a shortness of breath feeling, which can cause you to hyperventilate. This wi ll pass, with time and use, as the chakra stabilizes. Heart Chakra: The heart chakra merits special mention due to the strong, and sometimes frightening, sensation it can cause. When strongly activated it can feel like your heart is racing at an impossi ble rate. It is a powerful sensation. Try and ignore this when it happens, it won’t hurt you. It is not your heart racing but the chakra working. I know this is easier said than done, ignoring it, but with practice and familiarity you can.

I think this is caused by a lack of energy flowing from the lower centers. In a way it is like a pump racing, when it does not have enough fluid to pump. The heart chakra, when fully operational, feels like: Place one hand on your chest, with your fingertips resting in the middle of it over your heart. Tap your fingers on your chest, in time with your heart. Increase this rate until you are tapping as fast and hard as your fingers can move. Note: Your actual heart rate does NOT speed up with this racing sensation. If you hook yourself up to a heart monitor, you will see that your heat beat hardly changes at all. Throat Chakra: The throbbing in it can cause a very mild choking feeling, beca use of the sensitive area it is in. This feels something like having an emotional lump in the base of your throat. Crown Chakra: When fully active it feels like a thousand soft, warm fingers gently massaging the inside of the top of your head, above the hairline, and extending down in the center of the forehead, to include the brow chakra, which is part of it. This sensation is the reason the Buddhists call it “The Thousand Petalled Lotus”. Note: You may feel a stronger sensation in some chakras and little or none in others. Concentrate on the lowest ones with the least sensation. This will help balance the energy flow in the chakra system. If you are unbalanced, during projection the inactive chakras can cause failure, i.e., you may get your body p artly loose but find you are stuck to your body at the site of the inactive chakra. If this happens, concentrate on stimulating the inactive chakra prior to projection. Psychic Abilities After beginning chakra work, you may find psychic abilities start to grow in you. This is a natural offshoot of stimulating the chakras. In my next series, on more advanced energy work, I will show how to develop and use some of these abilities and how to raise the Kundalini. Practice Some relaxation, breath awareness , concentration and mental hands exercises should, ideally, be carried out daily. They can be done anywhere and anytime you have a few minutes to spare.

Other people, with NO relaxation or concentration skills at all, are looking at several months training before they will get out. ---------- Robert Bruce ------------- rsb@tower.com.au ---------- Your comments, experiences and requests for help and advice are most welcome.

This ROPE will be used to exert dynamic pressure at a single point on your astral body to force its separation from the physical. The ROPE technique is similar, but more direct and hence more effective than other more passive and indirect methods, such as reaching out and pulling vibrations into you, or visualizing yourself in front of yourself. The idea of pulling vib rations into you is vaguely illogical, if you understand the mechanics of projection. The vibrations are an effect and NOT a cause of projection. When enough pressure is exerted on the astral body to loosen it sufficiently, the energy body expands and ene rgy flows through the chakra system to be stored in the energy body. This flow of energy through the hundreds of chakras and their connecting web, or meridians, CAUSES these vibrations. This normally happens, unnoticed, during sleep. PUTTING THE PRESSU RE ON The more passive, indirect methods of projection do exert some pressure on the astral body to separate, but over a wide area. They still shift the point of consciousness out of the body, albeit obtusely. Any mental action that exteriorizes the poin t of consciousness will exert some pressure on the astral body. The action of pulling yourself hand over hand up a rope is a strong, one pointed, natural action that is easy to imagine yourself doing. The ROPE technique concentrates ALL your mental resourc es into one strong, DYNAMIC action, which exerts a high level of pressure directly on a single point of the astral body."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 There are many other, more subtle, ways that exert pressure on the astral body as well. Many of these are unsuspected for what they ar e. Most meditation exercises, for example, exert PASSIVE pressure on the astral body. You may imagine you are going down in a lift, falling, climbing down a ladder, or just floating downwards. Whatever the technique, it is designed to reduce brain acti vity. Any self induced, inward falling sensation places passive pressure on the astral body, which will cause brain activity to lower and bring on the trance state where a deeper level of the mind is revealed. The action of inward falling obtusely shifts the consciousness out of the body, exerting passive pressure on the astral body over a wide area, but in the reverse to that needed for projection, i.e., general downwards pressure. This, in a way, is like trying to get your astral body to FALL out of yo ur physical body on its own, i.e., your point of consciousness tries to FALL, downwards, out of the physical body. What most people do to project is to either exert forward, passive pressure on the astral body, by visualizing themselves floating out of the mselves, and HOPE, they can make it happen, i.e., trigger the projection reflex. Or, they try a more direct method, such as visualizing themselves out of their body, which is very, very, difficult. Lets face it, 99% of people can’t visualize for peanuts and the act of mentally visualizing yourself OUT of your body, AND shifting your consciousness INTO this visualization is almost impossible for most people. The other popular method is to try to pull vibrations into you. This method is slightly more effe ctive than most as it exerts some pressure at a single point, but it is still an indirect mental action and, therefore, obtuse. All the above, and the general lack of information about the mechanics of projection, i.e., HOW it happens, accounts for the ext remely high failure rate amongst people learning to project. Holding passive pressure, over a wide area, on the astral body, for long enough, WILL activate the projection reflex, eventually. But this can take a long time and can be mentally exhausting. I have developed, through recent research, a better, faster and more dynamic method of projection that is very effective. I call this technique simply ROPE. It is not that using an imaginary rope for projection is such a new idea, it’s not, but the unders tanding of the mechanics of it and the application of this knowledge to ROPE is. If you fully understand how a thing works, you can use that thing more efficiently and, therefore, get better results. The new ROPE method overcomes the general misdirection o f mental resources and the chronic waste of mental energy caused by the usual lengthy procedures needed for projection. ROPE shortens the time needed to cause a projection and optimizes the use of available energy. One of the most important ingredients fo r a successful projection is to be properly motivated. Without this motivation you will not have enough mental energy to succeed and will either fall asleep or forget the projection afterwards. It is, therefore, important to keep preparation time as shor t as possible so it is not such a daunting and mentally exhausting task."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 One thing a new projector has in abundance is enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is pure mental energy. ROPE, plus the understanding of HOW it works, harnesses and makes better use of this ener gy resource and vastly improves the success rate. Getting The Feel Of Rope Pin a length of ribbon, string or rope to the ceiling above you. Have it hanging within arms reach so you can easily reach up and touch it. Reach out and touch it frequently, unti l you are used to where it is in your mind. This ribbon is only a tactile aide. By being able to reach out and touch the ribbon, you used to the spatial coordinates of where the invisible, imaginary ROPE is. This grows both in your mind and hence as a th ought form, making it easier to imagine yourself reaching out and climbing the ROPE with your imaginary HANDS. Note: You do NOT have to actually visualize, or see, the ROPE at any time, just know where it is supposed to be. This method uses NO visualiza tion at all. Reaching out and pulling on this invisible, imaginary ROPE with your imaginary HANDS shifts the bodily awareness induced point of consciousness, out of the body, with a strong natural action that puts direct pressure on one point of the astral body. Active Chakra One important point, if you happen to have more activity in your Brow Chakra, rather than in your Heart Chakra, which is sometimes the case. Move the position of your imaginary ROPE so your arms would be at a 45 - degree angle above y our head. If you use the visual aide, ribbon, move this so it is hanging down over your head, rather than over your chest. Changing the angle of the ROPE shifts the point of pressure you are exerting on your astral body to the most active chakra area and gives better results. In any case, position the angle of the ROPE at the most natural, and easy to imagine attitude for you. It is important that the angle and position of the imaginary ROPE feels natural. Experiment with this angle until it feels righ t for you. ARE YOU READY TO PROJECT? All the exercises in the previous parts of this series ARE necessary training for projection.

This can cause mental exhaustion and you may find yourself short of energy and willpower for the all - important exit. All the exercises should be done separately from the projection itself. They are training and development exercises, designed to improve control over body and mind and to increase the flow of energy through the chakras. This is like working out in a gym as a part of football training. You don’t actually use these exercises to play football; they just improve your fitness and strength so you are able to play football effectively. Do the training exercises separately UNLESS you are trying for an advanced, real time projection. It is, then, still necessary to go through the full procedure, and activate all the chakras, prior to the actual projection. The whole point of learning to project is to get your astral body to separate from the physical while fully conscious. The earlier you get a fully conscious projection the better. Otherwise, you may eventually give it all up as just too difficult. Therefore, I strongly suggest all beginners’ concentrate on the simplest, most effective way of getting a conscio us projection. Once you have some projection experiences under your belt you can try for some of the more advanced, and hence, more difficult, types of projection. By doing the training exercises you have learned to relax your body, to clear your mind and to concentrate. You have begun to develop (MBA) (mobile bodily awareness) and how to use MBA, i.e., using your imaginary HANDS to perform certain tasks both inside and outside of your body. You have also begun to awaken and develop your chakras so your energy flow is stronger and you have, hopefully, spent time getting used to being in trance. These skills have prepared your body and mind for projection. When To Do The Exercises Even though the exercises, in themselves, are not all used during the pr ojection sequence, they still need to be done regularly in order to develop the necessary skills and energy levels for conscious projection. I suggest the relaxation, concentration and mental calming exercises are done daily. Use your imaginary HANDS wi th these exercises. The energy, chakra work and other exercises should be done at least once a week to be effective. If you wish to do them more often, fine, just don’t tire yourself out too much. Your Projection Sequence It is difficult to give one, universal projection sequence as everybody has different levels of skill and natural ability. For this reason I give a more flexible sequence and I suggest you tailor a projection method to fit your own needs and level of skill.

First, here is the full sequence for advanced, real time projection. Full Sequence 1. Do relaxation exercises thoroughly . 2. Clear your mind through breath awareness. 3. *Enter trance using mental falling method. 4. *Raise energy and open all chakras. 5. Pull yourself out with the imaginary rope. Note: 1.Steps 3* and 4* can be swapped to suit, i.e., do the energy work befo re, or after, entering trance. Energy and chakra work is more effective done in trance, but some people have trouble getting into that state. Doing the energy work first will usually help bring about the trance state. 2. IF you still have trouble getting i nto trance, use the ROPE climbing method at step 3* instead of the mental falling exercise, until you are in trance. Then stop the ROPE climbing and do the energy work before continuing with the projection, i.e., using the ROPE at step 3* will help force your body into the trance state. How To Use ROPE This is a complete projection method in itself, if you have good powers of concentration. I suggest beginners concentrate solely on this method until they have more experience. This projection method wi ll give you a normal Astral projection. The duration of this projection, in real time, will depend on the level of chakra development and energy flow you have attained. 1. Do the relaxation exercise thoroughly, until you are completely settled. This shoul d only take a few minutes, don’t overdo it. 2. Reach out with your imaginary HANDS and pull yourself, hand over hand, up the strong, invisible, imaginary ROPE hanging above you. Try and imagine the feel of a strong, thick, coarse rope in your HANDS. Don’ t try and visualize this ROPE! I want you to imagine you are reaching out and climbing this ROPE in the pitch dark, so you can’t see it at all, you just know where it is and can imagine the feel of it. Visualization wastes valuable mental energy that can b e better put to use exerting direct pressure on your astral body. You will feel a slight dizzy sensation inside you as you do this, specifically in your upper torso. This is caused by exerting dynamic pressure on the astral body.

This feeling of vertigo will intensify the more you pull on the rope. Very Important Note: a) This dizzy feeling and any feelings of pressure or vertigo, etc, caused by your mental action of pulling on the ROPE MUST be carefully noted by you. Learn the EXACT mental action you are doing to cause this vertigo. You will have to train your mental climbing action to cause this feeling. So, the first few times you try this ROPE method, concentrate on finding the right mental action to do this. Once you learn what it is you are doing to cause this, and can recreate it at will, you are really starting to get somewhere. b) IGNORE ALL SENSATION YOU FEEL DURING PROJECTION or it will distract you, break your concentration, and rui n your chances for projection. Concentrate on the single act of climbing your ROPE to the TOTAL exclusion of everything else. Put everything you have into this one action, but don’t tense up, it must be all mental. 3. Keep climbing, hand over hand, ever upwards, and you will feel the heavy sensation come over you. The pressure you are exerting on your astral body will force you into the trance state. Ignore this when it happens and concentrate on what you are doing. 4. Keep climbing and you will feel y our chakras open in response to the pressure, don’t stop. 5. Next you will feel the vibrations start, your whole body will seem to be vibrating and you will feel paralyzed. Concentrate, single minded, on climbing your rope, don’t stop. 6. Next you will fe el yourself coming free of your body. You will buzz slightly as you pull yourself out of your body. You will exit your body in the direction of your imaginary ROPE and will be hovering above your body. You’re free at last! Note: a) Do NOT allow yourself to break concentration when the vibrations start. They are a natural EFFECT caused by energy coursing through all the hundreds of major and minor chakras in your body. If you do find yourself being distracted by this, spend more time and effort doing the concentration exercises until you overcome this problem. b) If you have not mastered using your imaginary HANDS for relaxation, raising energy and chakra work, you may have difficulty using them for climbing the ROPE. This does not mean you have to be able to open your chakras successfully to project using this method, you don’t, it just helps if you can. This method is very direct. It shortens the time needed to project dramatically! Once you start pulling in earnest on your ROPE you WILL enter trance, your chakras WILL open, the vibrations WILL start and you WILL project, very quickly!

You will get used to this, though, and will appreciate having plenty of mental energy to use during your projection. If your powers of concentration are good, you have a better chance of getting out with this method than any other, even if you haven’t mastered deep relaxation and trance skills. What is neede d, apart from the ability to concentrate, is the ability to carry out strong mental actions, without any corresponding muscular action, i.e., you have to be able to separate mental and physical actions. If you have trouble with any part of the ROPE metho d, analyze it, find the problem area, then go back and concentrate on the related training exercises until you overcome the problem. A ROPE Variation Note: One good variation for the simple ROPE technique is to do the full sequence of exercises and ener gy, chakra work first, but separate from, the actual projection. Do the full sequence, but ‘don’t’ close your chakras. Get up and have a break, make yourself comfortable, have a drink etc. Then return to your bed /chair fresh, spend a couple of minute s relaxing and go straight to your ROPE. This will increase the amount of chakra energy available during the projection. The Mechanics OF How ROPE Works ROPE is the most dynamic projection method to date and can override the need to do just about anyth ing else, once it is learned. Let me explain a little more of the mechanics of what actually happens when you use ROPE, by breaking it down: Clearing The Mind : The mental act of climbing the ROPE fully occupies and clears the mind. Brain Wave Activity : C learing the mind and exerting, one pointed, dynamic pressure on the astral body, forces the reduction of brain wave activity. Deep Relaxation : Reducing brain wave activity forces the body into a deep level of relaxation. Trance State : Exerting dynamic pres sure on the astral body, while the physical body is deeply relaxed, and brain wave activity is at a low level, FORCES the mind and body into the trance state.

Vibrations: Exerting dynamic pressure on the astral body while the energy body is in its expanded state and the chakras are open causes energy to flow through the 300 odd chakras in the body and causes the vi brational state. Separation: Exerting dynamic pressure on the astral body while the energy body is in its expanded, vibrational state forces the astral body to separate from the physical. Note: If you exert enough pressure on the astral body, during the final phase of the projection sequence, the exit, it will override the projection reflex completely. This forces a manual separation of the physical / astral bodies. This means: Instead of involuntarily buzzing out of your body via the projection refle x, at the climax of the projection, and ending standing at the foot of your bed etc, you will exit your body in the direction you are pulling on the ROPE. How Long Does It All Take The whole projection process can be done in less than fifteen minutes; I can do it in less than five minutes. The speed of the method allows you to use ALL your available energy in one burst. If you don’t get out in the first fifteen minutes I doubt if you will during that attempt. IF this is the case, either get up and have a break and come back to it later, or get some sleep. Using the ROPE method, literally, amazed me with its ease and simplicity the first time I used it. It shortened my usual projection time (20 - 30 minutes, from a cold start) to about 5 minutes, for a n ormal astral projection. I still, though, use the full sequence when I do a real time projection. My analysis of the mechanics of this process comes from using the ROPE method myself and carefully observing what was happening to my body during the separat ion. My First ROPE Projection Here is an account of the first time I tried ROPE, while I was developing it as a viable theory:"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 I lay down on my bed, I was thinking of my new theory. I had been working out a projection technique that blind people could do. A technique that did not require ANY optical visualization. I had come up with the idea of using the sense of touch to exert pressure on the astral body, tactile imaging, as this sense is strongly developed in blind people. I lay there for a few min utes, mulling it over in my mind, while I generally relaxed and settled myself, ready for sleep. Then I decided to try it out, to see if it was practical. Note: I did not do any of the usual relaxation, mental calming or chakra energy exercises. I jus t wanted to see if I could exert pressure on my astral body with this method. I reached out my imaginary hands and began climbing the ROPE, hand over hand. I immediately felt a sensation of vertigo in my stomach and upper torso and a dizzy feeling inside my bones, like a tickling inside my arms and legs. I snapped my mind shut, stopped all thought, and focussed my will on the climbing action. I could feel the enormous pressure it was exerting on my astral body, my astral head and upper torso was starting to lift free, trying to go up the ROPE following the line of pressure I was creating. Still pulling, I felt my brain waves drop into the alpha state and the heavy sensation came over me as I entered trance. I kept pulling and the trance deepened, my bod y was now paralyzed. Still pulling, my chakras opened and the vibrations started. I was amazed; I had only been doing this for a couple of minutes! I kept pulling and my astral body soon buzzed free of the physical. This was completely different from an y other projection I had ever done. The projection reflex did not seem to have time to cut in and project me out of my body. I had, literally, pulled myself free on my own. I floated above my physical body, still aware of myself on the bed. I went to g o through the wall into the lounge, where there was more light, as it was pretty dark in my room. Suddenly I was in a strange world. “Where the hell am I” I thought. There was very dim light and there was a damp fog all around me. There was a large bui lding in front of me with an old fashioned thatched roof. To the side of me was an old rail fence made of massive, rough - hewn timbers. I leaned against the fence and thought about it all. I looked past the house and saw the reflection of water. There was a lake on the other side of the house. This didn’t make any sense to me and I was getting bored, so I tried to move to another realm in the dream pool. I looked at my hand, this usually works. It was white and pale and unreal looking, it began to m elt quickly, like white ice under a blowtorch. My fingers were soon stumps and then my hand melted and my arm began to follow. I tried remaking it. It grew back as I concentrated on visualizing what it should look like, but started to melt again as so on as I stopped concentrating. Then it hit me, why this scene was so familiar to me, I was in a picture! I have a large picture hanging on the wall in my room, in the exact position where I had tried to pass through the wall.

There is a lake behind it and it is early dawn, when the sun is just starting to illuminate things. There was no doubt about it, I was in my picture. I’d had enough of this; it was too dim to enjoy the projection, or to do anything. I focused on my physical body, which I could still feel. I concentrated on moving my mouth and eyes and this soon brought me back to my physical body. I sat up in bed and thought about it while I recorded the results of my experiment. Settling back down again I tried climbing the ROPE again. Within a couple of minutes I was back out of my body again. “This is great,” I thought! I hovered above my body and looked about the room. There in the gloom was the picture on t he wall, the one I had entered by accident. I went towards it again, just to see if it would happen again. As I got closer it got bigger and bigger and I seemed to shrink into it. As I got right up to it, instead of passing through it, I seemed to mov e into it and there I was again in this dimly lit, damp world with the old house and the fence. Everything felt real about it, the fence felt like wood and even the air smelled different, it had a farm like, swampish smell about it. Leaving the picture ag ain and returning to my body, I again wrote everything down in my notebook. I lay there for most of the night, thinking about what had happened, mulling over the implications of it all, what it all meant.... This is how I discovered ‘Virtual Reality Proje ction’ or (VRP) this technique is, at the moment, in its infancy and only a rough method for creating a custom made world. I plan to do some more experiments with it in the near future, though, to get the bugs out of it. Remembering It All One of the b iggest problems with any kind of conscious OOBE is remembering it all when you wake up. Here’s what you can do about this not remembering. As soon as you wake up, sit up in bed and pull those memories back. Sit up and think hard. Put aside a few minutes quiet time each morning to do this. It will train your dream memory. During this quiet time, run key phrases through your mind until you hit on something. Say things like: I looked at my watch and... I looked at my hands and... I was walking... I was talking to... I was just going to... I was over at... I was flying over... I was having a... I was inside a... I was with... These are examples of phrases that can lead you to a fragment of dream memory you can lock on to. Make up some mo re phrases to suit yourself. It may feel like there is nothing in your mind to remember, but try hard and put some REAL effort into it. They are there, you just have to reach in and locate them. Once you lock onto a fragment of memory, more can be locate d and more and more. You will be surprised how much you can remember this way. It is important to write these down as soon as you remember them. Even if you have to do this several times during the night. They may seem vivid and unforgettable at the tim e"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 but dream, or astral, memories will usually vanish in a few seconds if you don’t record them. Just write down a few key words and you can fill in the blanks later. With practice, this writing down can be dispensed with as your astral recall develops. Stuck? Some people may find they are stuck in part of their body during projection. They may come free of their body but be stuck at their head or stomach area. If this happens, exerting too much pressure by pulling on the rope may cause some physical pain and discomfort. There are two possible reasons for this: If you are stuck in the middle, stomach area, it may be diet related, i.e., a heavy protein or meat meal before projection can cause this. Remedy: Eat a light meal, eat plenty but have fish or white meat instead of red meat and avoid fats, oils, nuts and cheese. If you are stuck at the head, or some other part, this is a sign of an inactive chakra, possibly caused by an energy blockage. Remedy: Concentrate on opening this stuck chakra d uring the energy exercises. If this happens during your projection sequence, stop everything and open that chakra, you will be in trance so it will be easier. Once you have done some work on it, try pulling on the ROPE again. ---------- Robert Bruce --- ---------- rsb@tower.com.au ---------- Your comments, experiences and requests for help and advice are most welcome.

I would like to elaborate on a couple of points about the technique, inspired by the feedback I have re ceived so far. 1. There is NO visualization required - AT ALL - in the ROPE technique. It is ALL tactile imaging. This means you do NOT have to picture yourself doing it. That is, to climb ROPE, the correct mental action is to REHEARSE the climbing actio n in your mind. • This mental rehearsal - IS - the ROPE technique * 2. You need to mentally grit your teeth and strain with the action, i.e., you have to put maximum mental effort into it, as if you were really climbing a ROPE, but without allowing your mus cles to take part in it - this is ALL mental. Your body must not be allowed to respond. You also need to feel you are very strong, full of energy and could climb like this all night. 3. You will find that a certain way of holding the focus of your mind, w hile you climb, will exert more pressure on your astral body than another. It is VERY important you note what this is and learn how to apply it. This will tune your climbing action for the maximum effect. When you hit on the right mental focus for the act ion, you will feel a corresponding dizzy/falling sensation in your Solar Plexus. 4. To use ROPE successfully, it is extremely important to make a firm decision to DO IT. This commitment is VERY important to success. A DO OR DIE effort is needed. This fo cuses all your mental energy into a single point, for a single purpose - to exit your body. 5. Many people have emailed me with ROPE success stories. In every case - they have been practicing ROPE when they suddenly decided to give it a go - TO REALLY DO I T! This commitment to succeed means the difference between actually getting out - OOBE - and experiencing various levels of ROPE induced relaxation, trance, paralysis, chakra activity etc. I cannot stress enough the importance of this commitment to the su ccess of ROPE induced OOBE."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 6. While using ROPE, completely IGNORE ALL PHYSICAL SENSATION AND ANY NOISES YOU HEAR. If you react to a sensation, in any way, you will lose the focus of your mental energy and dilute your effort considerably. All the energy/c hakra work and other exercises in Parts 3 and 4, are designed to stimulate the flow of energy in your body and increase concentration, will power and mental control. By increasing the energy flow during a projection and controlling your mind better, you r duration in real time is increased. It is also easier to exit. You CAN skip all the exercises entirely and just concentrate on learning ROPE. Everyone has different levels of skill, natural ability and energy flow. Some people need lots of training i n order to OOBE, others do not. Some people will prefer to learn ROPE by DOING it, rather than training for it. If your goal is just to have a conscious OOBE, of any kind, the simple use of ROPE, below, is your best option. SIMPLE USE OF ROPE Some peop le have the impression ROPE is too complicated. This was possibly because by the detailed explanation I gave about the mechanics of ROPE in Part 5, i.e., HOW it works. ROPE is THE simplest projection technique to date. All that is needed to use ROPE in i ts simplest form, are these two steps: 1. Go to bed, or sit in your chair, relax and settle yourself down, as you normally would do before going to sleep. 2. Start climbing the ROPE. • This is all there is to the simple use of ROPE * As there are no time c onsuming exercises or complicated relaxation exercises involved, the simple use of ROPE has many advantages. It allows you to focus all your mental resources on it. In many cases this is all that is needed to give you your first conscious OOBE. Because t he simple use of ROPE is less complex, you will find yourself attempting projection more often, even when you are tired • One of the best times to try - and cannot be bothered with anything complicated. The increased frequency of your projection attempts giv es you more practice with ROPE and hence the technique will be mastered sooner.

This is happening far too frequently for it to be coincidence. The energy/chakra work increases the level of energy flowing into the energy body and heightens awareness and memory of the dream and OOBE state. It is a shame to waste all this energy on uncontro lled dreams, so I suggest L.D. be used as a secondary goal. This will give you OOBE experience earlier, in the form of L.D., and help keep your interest high until you learn how to do the conscious exit. Lucid Dreaming To become Lucid in dream you need to program yourself with a trigger to make you realize when you are dreaming, in order to take control over it, i.e., become lucid. The best way of doing this is by getting into the habit of doing frequent reality checks during your daily life. Reality C hecking A reality check is when you stop what you are doing and check the reality level of your situation. This is simple to do. Every time you do a reality check. Ask yourself: 1. Is this normal situation, is there anything strange about it? 2. Can I fly? Try floating up in the air. 3. Try closing your eyes. This is a dead giveaway, as you cannot close your eyes in astral form. Note: This reality checking must become habitual to be effective. When you do a reality check during a dream, you will r ealize you are dreaming and can take control of it. It is then important to affirm to yourself you are going to remember everything. Tell yourself over and over, “ I will remember this when I wake up.” L.D. Trigger The key to success with reality chec ks is to have a good trigger for it. This should be something you would normally do many times a day. This can be any kind of habitual action, but here are a few ideas:"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 1. Time: Every time you look at your watch, does a reality check. An electronic watch is a good aid. Set the timer to beep hourly. When it beeps, do a reality check. • A wrist watch, beeping hourly, is the most effective * 2. Hands: Every time you notice your hands, do a reality check. 3. Smoking: If you smoke, every time you have a cigare tte, do a reality check. You will usually find yourself reaching for a cigarette during the course of a dream, if you are a habitual smoker. Note: It takes time to make your trigger habitual, usually a few weeks. It also helps to do a few affirmations b efore you go to sleep, e.g., “I will remember to look at my watch” When you become aware in a dream, L.D., you should already be in a communal dream pool. If you want to try changing this to a real time projection, try and become aware of your physical bo dy. If you can sense it, you may be able to return to a time location near it. This is difficult, though, and may end the experience completely, i.e., force a return to the waking state. I suggest you enjoy the L.D. for what it is. Communal dream pool s are very colorful places and usually lots of fun. You will see all kinds of weird and wonderful things there and have all kinds of adventures. Note: To improve your memory of the L.D. don’t forget to remind yourself constantly during the L.D., to reme mber it all. Changing Your Reality Location If you don’t like the dream pool you are in, or are in a real time OOBE and want to enter a dream pool, here are a couple of ways to do it: 1. Look closely at your hands and watch them melt. (This is worth doin g just to see the melting hands phenomenon). 2. Spin around until you become disoriented. 3. Visualize a place you would like to be. (Instantaneous travel). This will usually move you to a dream pool similar to your visualized target destination. 4. Fly s traight up, as fast as you can. If this fails to shift your reality location, at least you will experience space flight. 5. Fly away fast, close to the surface, until you find a place you like. The blurring of speed will cause a reality shift. 6. W alk into a mirror, picture or painting. This is the same as VRP (virtual reality projection). These techniques all trick the subconscious, through disorientation, into moving you to another reality location."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 THE ASTRAL FORM IN MOTION Many people have mo tion problems in their first few projections. Simply getting across a room in the right direction can be a major accomplishment. This lack of control is simply because they are unfamiliar with astral form. It is like being in zero gravity. You have to learn to move all over again. When you project in real time, you are just a point of consciousness with a poorly constructed etheric shell surrounding it. Motion is provided by thought - not muscles. Astral Momentum There is a type of momentum in ast ral form that causes most of the problems. This causes you to continue moving for a while, after you decide to stop. This may take you through a wall or a ceiling etc. This impetus is caused by the thought you used to cause the motion. If it is too st rong, or too prolonged for the action, you will move too quickly or too far. Only practice teaches you how to get about with any degree of accuracy and grace. It really is quite a comical process, learning astral motion. I remember learning to move abou t my hometown, in my youth. I would start by trying to navigate through my house, usually ending up stuck in the roof, for a while. Then I would run down the road, trying to build up speed and take off like a plane. I would get airborne for a while, bu t could never quite clear the rooftops of the surrounding houses. I would often float unintentionally into strange houses, blundering about like a drunk in zero G. I seemed to be endlessly apologizing to all these strangers in passing, as I floated i n and out of their houses. How To Move To move about in astral form, simply - DO IT. Do not think about what you are doing, just DO IT. Be aware that motion is provided by your mind. You have to will yourself into motion, to change direction, and to s top. This is the best advice I can give you on this. It really has to be learned by doing. Have fun. When you have learned basic motion, do not try anything too ambitious for a while. Stick close to the surface and learn to get around your local area f irst. Practice varying your speed until you gain some control over it.

At first you may find something very much like gravity affecting you. You may get yourself i nto the air only to find yourself slowly arcing back to earth again. If you persevere you’ll find yourself moving in a series of short flight hops. This is caused partly by habit and partly by the basic motion problem in general. You sink back to earth when your motion causing mental action falters. This causes your flight impetus to stop and the gravity habit then pulls you down. You may find yourself, as I did, trying to fly by running down the road and leaping into the air. This is not necessary. Focus your will into floating up into the air. Then use your will to provide motion, same as with basic motion. There is NO gravity affecting you in astral form. Convince yourself of this and you will be flying in no time. Speed The three speeds as defined by, S. Muldoon, and commonly accepted, are a basic guide only. These are: 1. Walking speed. 2. Motor car speed. 3. Instantaneous travel. I think these three speeds were a sign of the times back then. These would have been the only types of speed known to most people. Today, movies, computer games and air travel have thoroughly prepared our minds to accept much higher speeds. With practice and good mental control, you CAN vary your speed to your purpose, from walking speed to supersonic speed. T his is a big problem for the beginner though, the control of direction and speed. It has a lot to do with how stable the projection is and how experienced you are at applying your will to motion. Instantaneous Travel It is generally accepted that if yo u can visualize a destination you can project yourself there instantly, at the speed of thought. • I have found this to be highly unreliable * "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 I find this instantaneous method usually projects you straight into a subjective location created by the visualiza tion of your target. You may appear to be at your destination but you will usually find many discrepancies between the real location and where you are. Instantaneous travel is very like VRP. By using your visualization powers to travel with, you w ill not actually travel. You will create a subjective copy of a destination and enter it. Long Distance Travel I have found it more reliable to follow the surface for short to medium distance projection of up to a few hundred miles. Even this can be d ifficult as it is easy to fall into the Alice effect while traveling. All you have to do is break concentration once and you will slip into a dream pool. Strict mental control must be maintained at all times when traveling in real time. It is not really p ractical to follow the surface for a long distance. For example, a country on the other side of the world from you is 12000 miles away. You would need to travel at about 64 times the speed of sound to reach there in 15 minutes. At this speed in the atmo sphere, everything blurs and clouds and surface features cause disorientation and a corresponding reality shift. Any real time objective aspect of the projection will then be lost. Note: Newbie projectors can normally hold themselves in real time for on ly a few minutes. Therefore, any long distance travel is limited by the real time part of a projection. To travel long distance you need to study geography. You have to be able to recognise continents, oceans, countries, states and cities. You also need to study a map of your target area and note any landmarks. To project there, after this is memorized, you must go into orbit and re - enter over your target. As you approach the earth you must adjust your approach and aim for the geological features and l andmarks around your destination. Orbiting the Earth To enter orbit is a little more difficult than it sounds. Getting up there is easy, you just go straight up, but stopping when you get high enough is difficult. Most people, myself included, tend to blast themselves straight out of the solar system, sometimes right out of the galaxy. To avoid this, it is important to control your speed during the ascent. It is easier to project to the moon first, as a way of entering orbit. This gives you a large vis ual target you can project to in moments. Once there, it is a simple matter to head back to Earth, enter orbit, and circle until you are above your target. In space, away from the atmosphere, there are no problems with speed induced blurring."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 How Far Ca n You Go? There are * NO * limits to distance, destination or speed. You can travel to the most distant galaxy. The speed of thought is infinite. It is like folding space and moving without moving. If you can see something, you can be there.... as q uick as that. In comparison, the speed of light is that of a snail. I often go out into deep space, where the galaxies are just tiny smudges in the distance, to think and meditate. That is easy, but the trick is getting back for a conscious re - entry. Unless you have a good knowledge of astronomy, which I do not, this is difficult. Following the silver cord, if you can see one, is not practical at that kind of speed, though it will give you a basic direction to go in. To return from a long distance proj ection, tune into your body and become aware of it. Then try moving part of your physical body, i.e., a finger or toe. This will return you to your body, and end the projection with full memories of the OOBE. FUTURE WIND There is a strange phenomenon y ou will come across, from time to time, while you are projecting. I call this “Future Wind.” You will be OOBE’ing somewhere, minding your own business, when all of a sudden you will feel an irresistible force. You will feel yourself being moved against y our will, usually backwards, by this force. You can fight it for a while but it will grow steadily stronger until you are blown away; over the roof tops, up into the sky and....into the future. Then, after a while, you will come down in a different pla ce.... and time. Often it will be somewhere mundane, maybe a domestic setting of some sort. You will be released there and left to wander about... confused. You may even meet people you do not know, yet, and they will be just as confused as you are. Thi s may be an actual scene out of your future life; it may be a symbolic vision, or a mixture of both. You may be an invisible spectator to this scene, or you may merge with your future self, and see out of your future eyes for a while. This can also be a s cene of an important future event. It could be a disaster, natural or otherwise, or something unusual or exciting on the world scene. These types of events usually have a lot of energy surrounding them, and this may be part of the reason for the vision. The only explanations I can give for this are: 1. The intervention of your higher self: For some reason it decides that now is the time to show you something from your future."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 2. Clairvoyant interference: Your Brow chakra has become clairvoyantly active and has tuned into a future setting. Your point of consciousness is caught up by this vision and projected into the vision. 3. A combination of both of the above - this is the most logical. Symbolic Visions There is another aspect of this wind that is very similar to the above but the vision you experience is symbolic, or has a symbolic aspect, rather than an actual future event or scene. Note: I would like to warn you about the symbolic aspect of visions. If you don’t understand the nature of symboli sm it can cause great harm to your life. This warning applies to all clairvoyant visions in general, whether experienced in astral form or not. For example: You are taken, by a future wind, to a scene in which you see yourself winning a lot of money. Yo u are sitting at a table checking your lottery ticket with the results. You see the prize money is $18 million. You check your numbers, or ticket, and find you have the winning ticket. You feel all the excitement, the surge of adrenalin; dreams of we alth come flooding into you and your heart races with excitement. After this vision, you start buying lots of tickets. You also start to make decisions that affect your life with a “When the money comes through” type of attitude. This can cause irrepar able damage to your life! You lose your drive, your initiative, your ambition, i.e., you stop trying. This imparts a “Cargo Cult” type of belief system on you, a belief that everything will be given to you - with all the negative aspects this primitive belief system has. This can cause you to mark time in your life, instead of living it to the full. • What you may have missed, from the symbolism of the above vision is: The amount of money may be unusual for that lottery draw. $18 million is an odd amount of money and may be a rare event. This is what I call a SIGN POST - a date stamp of a future event. This means that when your local lottery has a prize of the above amount, something important is going to happen in your life or in the world around you. I f you know how symbolism works, during the vision you would have been able to pick up more information about this coming event. The setting, the symbols, the connections to you, the action and the sequence of events in it, are all important aspects of it s meaning. Misunderstanding a vision can ruin your life. Only experience and the intelligent application of logic can teach you how to interpret a symbolic vision. Until you have this experience, it is best to treat any sort of vision with caution."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 Some possible reasons for a symbolic vision are: 1. You are being given a warning or guidance by your higher self. 2. You are being given proof there is a future, a destiny, a meaning, a purpose to your life. 3. The signpost of this vision may mark a good or ba d event in your life. 4. You may actually win the lottery. Personally, I would always make sure I had a ticket in the draw, just in case, but I would not depend on it. Future Wind Example I left my body and was moving about my home, getting my sea legs . Suddenly, a force moved me across the room. I tried to fight it but it grew stronger until I was blown out of the house and up into the night sky. A short time later I was brought down again, outside my home. I was just left standing there in the midd le of the road. In front of me stood a refrigerator. It was just sitting there in the road with its door open. I examined it and could tell it was not working. Behind it was a massive red brick wall, 40 feet high and twice as wide. There are no REAL b rick walls in this street. Then I noticed my wife was standing beside me. I turned and said hello to her. She just said goodbye, very coldly, then turned and walked away. Perplexed, I watched her walk away. Oddly, instead of walking to our home, she walked away from it and off into the distance. Being experienced with the symbolism and nature of visions I knew what this foretold, the end of my marriage. I could not understand it as we were only recently married and very happy together. To decipher a symbolic vision it is necessary to analyze it and break it down into its parts. The six significant aspects of this vision are: 1. The sign post... (the date stamp of the event) • The refrigerator that did not work. 2. The connections... (something, or som eone, in the vision that connects the events to me). • 1. My wife. 2. It was outside my home. 3. I was there as me. 3. The symbol... (the basic nature of the coming event) The large brick wall. This symbolizes a barrier or an end to something. This was the only actual symbol in the vision, but other parts of it were by nature or action - symbolic.

The symbolic action... (This signifies the meaning of the vision) • My wife’s cold goodbye. 5. The symbolic modifiers... (these modify the symbol or, in this case, the symbolic action in the vision). a) My wife departed in a direction away from our home. b) She walked away until she disappeared from view. 6. The sequence of events. a) The broken fridge. b) The large brick wall. c) My wife’s actions. O R: When I saw the broken fridge (sign post) I saw the brick wall (symbol) and my wife (connection) said goodbye and left (symbolic action) in a direction away from our home, until she disappeared (symbolic modifiers) The timing and sequence of a vision is important to unraveling its meaning. It is important to break a symbolic vision into its 5 basic parts and to note this in your journal, while it is still fresh in your mind. Note: There may be more than one modifier to each part of a vision. Hinds ight A year after I had the above vision, we moved to another town. The day we moved, we had to borrow a refrigerator from a relative. Ours had broken down and was in for repairs. The borrowed fridge did not work either. After our’s was repaired, this o ther fridge sat on our porch for two and a half years, waiting to be collected. I remembered the vision clearly, and knew this fridge was the date stamp of an upcoming event. I also knew what the event was, but honestly could not see it happening. One day, though, they came and collected this fridge. A week later my marriage ended. Suddenly, permanently, and for no foreseeable reason. Looking at it in hindsight, it is crystal clear what the vision meant. It was as simple as it was accurate. Most sym bolic visions are this simple. Be very careful not to read too much into vision otherwise the true message in the vision will be obscured.

Ask of each part: 1. “What is it in itself?” 2. “What does it do?” 3. “What is its simplest, most basic, symbolic meaning?” Write these answers down and then apply common sense and logic to them. This will give you insight into the true meaning of the vision. MIRRORS Mirrors, historically, are magical devices used as doo rways to other worlds. There are also numerous superstitions and old wives tales concerning their effect on the recently departed. After a person had died, all mirrors in their home were covered. This was so they could not see their lack of a reflection and be shocked. Another reason for this was to prevent them from being accidentally trapped in a mirror. There is some logic to this if you look at the mechanics of projection. Death, in the early stages, is very much like a powerful real time projection . The biggest difference being the lack of a living body to return to. Spirits are normally held close to the physical dimension, in real time, for a week or so after death. This is until the supply of etheric matter that binds the spirit to its physical body runs out. During this time it is normal for the spirit to wander among relatives and loved ones, saying goodbye and coming to terms with their new state of existence. This goodbye process, eases the psychological trauma of death, and helps prepare t he spirit for the next stage of existence. What can happen with mirrors is this: A new spirit can inadvertently enter a mirror. If this happens, they enter a mirror world in the same way a projector enters a picture through VRP. Once in a mirror world t hey usually do not know where they are, or how to get out of it, and can be stuck there for the duration of their real time stay. This will not interfere with the journey of the soul. It will just cause confusion for a few days until it enters the next s tage of existence. This can though, make their last days near the physical world very confusing and interfere in the natural goodbye process. This, I believe, is where the old superstitions came from. Therefore, in the light of my understanding of project ion and the death process, I think the covering of mirrors after a death is a VERY good idea, for the benefit of the deceased. This is best done for two weeks, to be sure.

This can be done by leaving a letter, uncovered, for the spirit to read. They can also hear you, so talking to them is also effective. I think a good practice would be to have goodbye letters, from all the peop le that loved the deceased, stuck to the wall in the spirit’s old room. Leave the letters open, with all pages clearly in view, to make reading easier. ---------- Robert Bruce ------------- rsb@tower.com.au ------- --- Your comments, experiences and requests for help and advice are most welcome.

Please note that the entire Treatise on OBE articles will shortly be replaced by a single online book, greatly revised and updated; hopefully by Christmas of 99. And for those interested, my latest book, Astral Dynamics, has just been released and is now available. See the end of this file for more information, links and details. RB. OOBE & Duality: If you read the enormous number of case histories avail able on out of body and near death experiences; you will find many accounts hinting at perceptions of duality which indicate symptoms of the mind split effect at work. It is fairly common, during an OOBE, to be aware of the physical body while also being aware of existing in the projected double, or less commonly, vice - versa. This effect appears to indicate the existence of telepathic and bio - energetic links between the physical body and it’s remote projected double (possibly via the silver cord). This l ink appears to serve the purpose of providing the projected double with the necessary energies it requires whilst operating out of body, while also maintaining an unbreakable connection with it’s physical body. This connection also allows the physical bod y to be, in many ways, monitored (or sensed) so that no harm can come to it during an OOBE. During an OOBE, at the moment the projected double is generated and projected from the physical body, the projector’s mind effectively splits into two identical par ts (mirror images) each containing a complete copy of thinking mind and memory. One copy always remains firmly locked inside the physical body (original hard copy) while a mirror image is reflected into and maintained in the exterior projected double. The splitting of consciousness into two (or more) separate but identical copies happens during sleep or any kind of OOBE. I call this effect “The Mind Split Effect”: Mental/Visual Feedback: If a mentally awake physical mind happens to observe (with real time or astral sight) it’s projected double at close range during a projection, a strong visual and telepathic connection can form between them. This can be a very disturbing experience and I don’t recommend this be tried for more than a few seconds at a time . The awake physical mind (whilst a projection is in progress) must see and be seen by it’s projected double for this type of connection to occur.

Each becomes aware of each other’s vision and perspective as well as that of their own. Once the visual side of this co nnection occurs, each side of the mind split instantly becomes aware of each other’s thoughts as well, simultaneously and compounding. This appears to be something like telepathic feed back, much like holding two identical ‘mental’ mirrors facing each oth er. This gives an unnatural glimpse of mental infinity - a mental reflection of a mental reflection of a mental reflection, continually compounding. When two identical minds connect, while separated during an oobe, the two identical sets of vision and tho ughts create something that can best be described as a visual and telepathic loop, compounding and feeding back upon itself in a never ending loop. This is an unnatural, incomprehensible, disturbing and possibly dangerous event for any mortal mind to expe rience. This uncomfortable and confusing state appears to only occur at close range and can easily be avoided by not looking too closely at each other (physical and projected double) and by not thinking at each other at close range (within approximately twenty feet) during a real time projection. Note: this can only happen if both sides of a projector, physical and projected, are awake and become visually aware of each other during a real time projection. This all goes a long way towards explaining why dreams and projection memories can sometimes appear so chaotic. The mind splits for a very good reason and the separated copies are meant to function separately. I have experimented with this phenomena many times during real time projections, after disco vering it accidentally during a powerful real time OOBE. I recreated the original ‘accident’ and studied it because the original experience raised so many questions. I had always been curious of the way I could often feel my physical body while close to it, and this mind split effect appeared to hold many of the answers I had been searching for. Like many other projectors, I had often experienced confusing anomalies during projections: of being aware of events and noises near my physical body, in and ar ound my house, plus being aware of my remote existence during a projection. This sense of perceived duality, of having two different sets of perception, one physical and one remote, has been reported by many other projectors but has never, I believe, been properly studied or understood. Double Trouble: Here is an account of one of the first times I experienced the mind split effect and mental/visual feedback: I had been meditating in my chair by the fire and returned to normal awareness as the rain started drumming on the roof. The weather was pretty wild and the wind was starting to shake the windows and doors. I looked at the clock, it was almost 3 AM. This was not unusual for me, as sometimes I will meditate all night. I felt well rested and full of energy and thought to myself “I’ve never projected in a storm before, I wonder what it’s like?” Closing my eyes once again, I relaxed back into myself and soon projected out of my body, using the ‘point shift’ method, as given in Vol 1 of the Treatise. T his method is very similar to the method given by T.Lobsang Rampa in his book ‘You Forever’.

I have been projecting since the age of 4 or 5, but this was always spontaneous and I had little control of when I would project. I taught myself to project deliberately at the age of 21, and found Rampa’s books a great help. (As a side note: many people have claimed that Lobsang Rampa was discredited, that he was ‘exposed’ as being nothing more than an English plumber cum writer on metaphysics. But, if you read his first book ‘The Third Eye’ you’ll see that he fully explained hi s circumstances, and how he came to be living in the body of an English Plumber. He claims to have swapped bodies with a suicidal English plumber who was about to kill himself - while his own Tibetan body lay dying of wounds. This feat was accomplished d uring an astral operation carried out by high ranking Tibetan masters (spirit masters) to preserve Rampa’s unfinished life path, while freeing the Plumber (with his full permission) who was at the exact end of his life. Personally, I found Rampa’s books t o be very good reading, and they contain a great deal of useful information on projection, clairvoyance, metaphysics, etc.) Back to the projection: After exiting my body I moved through the wall and floated out into the rain drenched night. What a glori ously wet feeling that was. I could feel and taste the cool rain and blustering wind passing through me. The smell of rain and wetness was everywhere, seeming to fill me with a bright and happy energy. I floated up to the roof and sat on the chimney, lo oking out over the town. I felt a little bit like a very wet Mary Poppins. I watched the rain dancing over the roofs and streets, swirling through gutters and gurgling into drains. It seemed to have a friendly voice and rhythm all its own “drink me, spl ash me, gurgle me, slosh me.” (It seemed funny at the time:) While sitting on the roof, I felt my body stirring in room chair below me. This effect had often intrigued me and I decided to slide back through the roof and study it more closely. As I passed through the roof I saw my body sitting in the chair, right where I had left it, but suddenly I became aware of also watching my projected double (from my perspective in the chair) sliding down through the ceiling - both at the same time! It was ME, sitti ng in the chair watching another ME floating down through the ceiling, but it was also ME floating in front of my chair some ten feet away - watching myself sitting in the chair. This was not only confusing, it started making me feel quite ill. I had two sets of vision and two sets of thoughts, all at the same time and all joined together, it was fascinating. It also made a lot of sense. Just because the projected ME was outside it’s physical body, why should the physical ME have to stop thinking. Why w ould it be left (as is commonly believed today) as a mere empty shell during a projection? This raises the question of ‘what’ actually leaves the physical body during a projection? The projected ME (real time double) moved about the room, observing my phy sical body in the chair - while it watched me back at the same time. I could still see the projected ME, even when my projected double was situated behind the physical ME. I could feel myself in the chair perfectly, as I tried to follow the movements of my projected double about the room. This took some very real effort, and it also took a lot of energy to move"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 my projected double. It felt like I was moving through thick mud and I felt an enormous pressure building up inside both of ME. I was existing in both my physical body as well as in my projected double - both at the ‘same’ time. I was fully awake (mentally) and aware and thinking inside both aspects of myself. Inside my physical body, my consciousness appeared to be actively centered in my eth eric body, and this appeared to be how the physical ME was able to see the projected ME (real time sight - seeing through closed eyelids). I came to this conclusion because of the way I could move around ‘inside’ my physical body, and could even see behin d myself without physically moving. My etheric body appeared to be, quite literally, able to turn around inside my physical body. This ability of the physical body to see through closed eyelids and from different perspectives is frequently described by p rojectors and trance meditators. Note: The etheric body appears to be the very first level of subtle body, one stage up from the physical body. This appears to be so closely enmeshed within the physical body that it cannot normally leave its confines w hile it still lives. During the full trance state, as well as during the projection process, however, it appears to gain some limited freedom of movement. It will also often gain the ability to see into the real time zone, and sometimes even into the ast ral dimension, around it. The etheric body appears to be responsible for the ability to see through closed eyelids and covers, as is often reported by projectors near the exit stage of a projection. My observations: the center of waking consciousness app ears to shift over ‘into’ the etheric body when the physical body enters the trance state and falls asleep. This is very like an internal projection, taking a ‘reflection’ of consciousness one step away from the physical body and mind, while still holding it’s original place within the confines of the physical body. This stage, I believe, is the very first level of the multi dimensional projection process, and is marked by the ‘heaviness’ experienced when the full trance state is entered, which is also th e sign the physical body has fallen asleep. This process makes a lot of sense and answers a lot of questions when projection case histories, plus the ‘mechanics’ and ‘dynamics’ of projection, are studied. It points to projection being a staggered proces s where consciousness is reflected one stage at a time away from the physical body and mind. Each stage becomes progressively more subtle and refined, while still maintaining firm telepathic and energetic links between each stage. Basically, this allows the projection of all the higher subtle bodies at the same time, while keeping a safe and unbreakable link between them and the physical body (the original hard copy).

Physical bodies. (base line) • 1. Dream mind The Incredible Mind Split: A projector’s m ind splits during any kind of OOBE. One complete copy (original hard physical copy) staying at all times safely inside the physical body, capable of thinking and dreaming. A perfect thinking copy, containing full memories, both conscious and subconscious , ‘reflects’ into the extruded real time body. Each copy is capable of thinking and acting independently during an oobe if enough vital energy (vitality) is available. Neither copy may be aware of the other’s continuing existence or awake state. This is the natural mind - split effect, which always occurs, but is very seldom noticed, during sleep and all types of OOBE. During a conscious exit projection, consciousness is first reflected into the etheric body. From the etheric body it is then reflected in to the real time ‘projectable’ double when that body is generated. The real time double appears to be generated inside the combined physical/etheric bodies and does not appear to project outside the physical/etheric body until a copy of consciousness is t ransferred (reflected) into it. Before the actual moment of projection, of the exit of the real time body out of the physical body, all potential copies of mind are closely enmeshed and held together safely inside the physical body. One full copy always s tays inside the physical/etheric body and this (the original copy) appears to fall asleep and thus moves itself safely, but temporarily, out of the picture to allow the natural projection process to occur. The original copy of mind will begin dreaming at some point after it falls asleep. If the original copy does not move itself out of the picture, the difficulty of projection increases dramatically, as with conscious exit projection where the mind is awake throughout the projection process. This last f actor alone accounts for the sheer difficulty of conscious exit projection. The dreaming mind of the physical body appears to account for the reality fluctuations commonly experienced shortly after the exit stage of a projection. This event may also be as sociated with the physical body’s dream mind entering the REM sleep state (REM = Rapid Eye Movement), which is commonly associated with the dreaming state. The physical body’s dreaming mind also appears to account for the hypnagogic imagery and visions ex perienced during the trance state and during the pre - projection state, or where the mind is held awake and balancing on the verge of sleep. At the moment of separation, as the real time body projects free of the physical/etheric bodies, the mind appears t o split or reflect a complete copy of itself into an ‘exterior’ subtle body. From this moment onwards both copies, one internal and one external, continuing to record their memories separately. Neither will usually be aware of the other’s presence or exi stence, apart from the occasional vaguely shared feelings and remote perceptions of each other. The separateness of the mind - split effect and memory recording will continue until reintegration occurs. Upon reintegration, or waking, only one set of memor ies will usually be retained, but sometimes a mixture will"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 occur. This can be part dream, part physical/etheric and part OOBE memories. The successful ‘downloading’ of projection memories strong enough to override physical/etheric body and dream memories for the same time period, strong enough to leave a lasting impression on the physical brain of a projector, appears to be the real key to successful and repeatable OOBE. See my new book “ASTRAL DYNAMICS” Chapter 21 - Overcoming The Mind Split - for more detailed information on this. Mind Split Effects: It is fairly common for projector’s to experience a perfect projection right up until the exit, where they feel all the vibrations, rapid heart beat, floating sensation, etc, and then it all just ‘goes aw ay’. This leaves the projector, usually energetically exhausted, often partially or fully paralyzed, thinking they have simply failed the exit. What may often happen in cases like this are normal and successful OOBE’s, but where consciousness has remaine d awake and ‘centered’ in the ‘physical/etheric’ mind after the mind split of projection has occurred. The resulting memories retained after the experience, in cases like this, are thus from the physical/etheric side of the experience only. The projecte d double, in many cases, simply stays out of its body for too long, which allows the physical/etheric mind’s to fall into a deep sleep. Once deep sleep occurs, the projected double becomes effectively locked out of its physical/etheric body for the durati on of sleep, or until waking occurs. (re why I recommend short projections) The projection side of this experience (the memory of it) has thus been totally lost, as if it never was. The physical/etheric mind (internal) side of the experience has the only solid memories for the whole experience, and the projected double’s memories have failed to make a strong enough impression on the physical brain to become ‘memorable’ after reintegration. Basically, the projection memories have failed to make the final ‘wrinkle’ in the physical brain after the projection. Another mind - split also appears to occur between the real time double and the astral body. This begins to happen ‘naturally’ within several minutes of the start of an average real time projection, but can often occur within a few seconds. At some point during any real time projection reality will always begin to fluctuate. This appears to be the sign that the physical/etheric mind has begun dreaming. At this point the real time body usually begins to run low on energy (in most cases, apparently not having enough energy to maintain it’s conscious integrity whilst the dream mind is active) and it thus starts shifting into the seemingly more easily maintained (but more dimensionally remote) astral vehicl e in the astral dimension. Soon, the real time body will effectively fall asleep and will then be reeled in to hover, as if asleep, just above the sleeping physical body. It will remain there until the natural waking of the physical body and mind causes reintegration of all it’s multi - dimensional aspects, thus ending the mind split. Notes on Projection & Reintegration: 1. The sleep state, or trance state, is required for projection to occur. 2. Trance = body asleep + mind awake. 3. The waking state is required for reintegration to occur. 4. The only exception to the above is the in - between trance state, where the body is asleep but the mind is fully awake. 5. Deep sleep prohibits reintegration of physical/etheric and projected doubles."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 I know this m ay all sound a little complex, but it sheds a great deal of light on many of the seemingly mysterious difficulties which can beset a projector. It also explains why projections are so time limited and difficult to maintain, let alone remember in detail. All through my research and studies, in the incredibly complex field of theoretical metaphysics, I have found that the further I get from the relatively normal reality of the physical dimension the more outrageously complicated everything becomes. There is nothing simple about the mechanics and dynamics of projection, far from it, but it can be understood if the lower levels of projection are studied, i.e., etheric and real time bodies. If the principals this yields are then applied to the higher aspects of projection, and even dreaming, a few precious constant factors appear. This methodology may not solve all problems, nor answer all questions, but it at least provides some kind of a logical and understandable framework to work in. Purpose Of Mind Spli t: The mind split is, I believe, an integral part of the workings of Universal Law, where the mind splits and reflects itself into many different parts, levels and aspects, each belonging to a different dimensional level. During the full multi - mind - split process, the highest level (highest subtle body) appears to be drawn into the center of the universe, into the Source of all consciousness, by what I have called the Akashic Pulse. There, the influential and conditional energies (consciousness seeds), con tained within each individual energy egg (each person) are processed and updated according to Universal Law. These are adjusted according to past and current thoughts and actions, and as further modified by Karmic Law. These seeds affect and influence u s all profoundly. They cause the attraction and repulsion effect, all our likes and dislikes and natural tendencies, which are the visible workings of Universal Law in the physical dimension. Universal Law is that which attempts to guide us all along our individual life’s paths, towards predetermined but eminently variable goals (variable according to laws of free will and individual choices). An important aspect of the mind split, to many people, is the way it shows how the physical body and it’s mind are ‘never’ ‘ever’ left empty and unguarded during sleep or any type of out of body experience or projection. They are thus never exposed to being entered, molested, possessed or interfered with by any other projector, or by any type of inorganic being, entity or demon. A conscious exit projector's physical body and mind are, according to my research, far more projected than they are during the full waking state - where natural non - physical senses become somewhat dulled or inactive. During an OOBE, th e projector's energy body appears to expand and create a very sensitive perimeter, a kind of expanded energy cocoon around itself. This appears to extend in all directions for approximately 20 feet (6 meters) often filling or overflowing from the room aro und the projector's physical body. This sensitive energy perimeter acts something like an early warning system. If it is broached by another 'awake' person, another projector, or any other type of energy being or entity, and a negative reaction occurs, i t will instantly snap shut and reel back the projector for immediate reintegration and the return of full waking consciousness."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 This early warning system appears to be particularly sensitive during any type of conscious OOBE, where the projected double is fully aware it is out of its body. It seems, however, to become slightly less sensitive to 'real' awake people once the physical body and mind have fallen into a deep sleep. It will, however, always react violently and instantly if touched by anything which causes a negative reaction in it's perimeter field. Note: See my book \"ASTRAL DYNAMICS\" chapter 24 - The Akashic Connection - for more detailed information on the higher aspects of the mind split, the workings of Universal Law and of the Akashic P ulse. ULTRA Short OOBE: One of the most important things to do after a successful exit, especially the first few times, is to keep the projection ultra short. Ten seconds out and then get straight back into the physical body. Please trust me on this. Ten seconds of REAL out of body experience with a fully conscious exit and reentry, are worth a thousand all nighters that are forgotten! An ultra short oobe is, in most cases, the 'major' contributing factor to a successful first time conscious exit projection. Once again, if a projector stays out too long, especially a novice projector, and their physical/etheric body falls into a deep sleep, the projected double will not usually be able to reanimate it's physical body and mind when it returns. It can thus become locked out for the duration of the projection, or until natural waking occurs. Projection requires the physical body to fall asleep, and the reverse applies, with reintegration requiring the physical body to wake up. If the physical body and mind fall into a deep sleep, sometimes even a good shaking will fail to wake them. The slight energy rush caused by reentry can thus also fail to awaken a deeply sleeping, and possibly dreaming, physical body and mind. Projected Double Contact: One way of cementing projection memories is to make contact with yourself during an OOBE. Keeping in mind the nature of the mind split, agree with yourself to try and make contact from both sides of the projection, from both physical and projecte d sides. Some degree of real time sight (seeing through closed eyelids in physical body) is required for this. Agree for your projected double to be in a particular place, say the foot of the bed, and that it will look and think at where your physical he ad is, or should be. Do this even if the physical or projected double cannot clearly see its counterpart - which often happens on both sides. Often only a vague ghostly shape is seen, or a depression in the bed. The physical body should trust its projec ted double will be doing this and should try to do the same, by thinking and concentrating and 'feeling' for where it's projected double is 'supposed' to be. Once contact is made, memories will flood both ways and will become cemented - making a strong an d lasting impression upon the physical brain."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 After the initial contact, the projected double should move away quickly to avoid nauseating mental/visual feedback problems. This connection and memory downloading process, if successful, can allow the durat ion of real time projections to be dramatically extended. The projected double can periodically return to it's physical counterpart and download (top up) it's projection memories. If this is done, I suggest no more than a few minutes interval between eac h memory download. The projected double should also reenter it's physical body the moment it detects signs it is tiring, or the moment it begins experiencing reality fluctuations - which is a sure sign the dream mind is becoming active, which indicates th e physical mind is falling asleep. Energy Raising During OOBE: To increase out of body vitality and capability it is important to have enough energy flowing from the physical/etheric bodies to the projected double. This is best done by the proje cted double while it is out of body. It must reach out and 'feel' itself sucking energy into itself, feeling energy rushing into it from it's physical body. This out of body awareness action appears to create a strong energy demand in the projected doubl e, which causes an increased flow of energy from the physical/etheric body to meet this demand. The increase in the clarity and ability this can cause during a projection can be quite amazing, and happens very quickly. This technique is especially useful if you have projection vision problems or blindness. Everything will noticeably brighten and light will be seen all around the projector, lighting up the darkness and following them about wherever you go. This technique can be used with great effect to solve or ease most common projected double related weakness problems, visual or otherwise. IMPROVED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE: Note: This new set of 'improved' and 'simplified' deep physical relaxation exercises are to replace those in the original Treat ise. The first big hurdle you need to overcome is deep physical relaxation. With the thousands of letters I have had from people having problems achieving OOBE - one problem area stands way out, DEEP PHYSICAL RELAXATION. Everyone seems to rush through learning this, most important of skills, to get on with the more interesting stuff, like the projection attempt itself. But, as with any type of metaphysical development (metaphysical = mind science) any skill not thoroughly learned will eventually stop t he aspirant cold, forcing them right back to the beginning to learn it properly before they can proceed. More time must be spent learning the skill of totally relaxing your physical body than with any other skill - it is THAT important.

The biggest problem with deep physical relaxation, in the early stages, is that it takes so long that if done properly as part of a projection attempt the projector can become menta lly exhausted or bored. This can ruin a projection attempt as the projector may then have little energy or enthusiasm for the exit. If this becomes a problem, I suggest deep physical relaxation be learned and practiced regularly but 'separately' from proj ection attempts, until such time as the projector can attain deep physical relaxation fairly quickly. A deep level of physical relaxation is absolutely necessary to consciously project your astral body. This is quite easy to achieve, though, if you go ab out it in the right way and practice regularly. Deep physical relaxation plus a clear mind = Trance State The trance state is achieved when the physical body goes to sleep while the mind stays awake and in control of itself. A conscious exit projecto r needs to be able to attain some level of the trance state before they can successfully project out of their body. Deep physical relaxation leads to and naturally brings about the trance state. The trance state is entered automatically once the physical body enters a deeply enough relaxed state. *Important Note: Just as sleep is possible without deep physical relaxation, so is the trance state. It is quite easy to fall asleep and even enter the trance state while stressed and full of tension, relying on physical/mental tiredness to overcome lack of relaxation and trance ability. Just because you feel the sensations of trance (ie, heavy body feeling) it does not mean you have attained deep physical relaxation. Many people do this and think they have f ound a handy short cut, only to find conscious exit projection virtually impossible. Most people, in this case, will fail right on the exit, because their physical body is too tense. The above is also why sleeping for a few hours first, then waking for a projection attempt, works better for most people who lack relaxation and trance ability. The body has time (sleep) to overcome it's sleep deficit and physical tension. This makes projection much easier and is a good way to get early results with consc ious exit projection. Physical relaxation: Seating: I suggest sitting in a comfortable armchair, with good arm and neck support, and a pillow under your feet. The pillow is necessary because when relaxed to a deep level, supporting muscles in the fee t will tend to relax and can cause some discomfort.

It is possible to use a bed, but falling asleep can be a big problem. If a bed must be used, I suggest laying on the back (never the sid e) with hands and forearms held vertically above the bed, with elbows resting comfortably on the bed. Adjust and vary this position slightly for comfort. This position will reduce the likelihood of falling asleep. Dress: Wear loose, comfortable clothin g and bare feet (or loose socks) depending on the local temperature. Tight clothing and shoes will cause discomfort with deep relaxation, and will also restrict the flow of blood and energy. Posture: Good posture helps a great deal with deep relaxation . Do not slump in the chair. If good posture is used the body will be well balanced. Then, when a deep level of relaxation is achieved, the body will stay well balanced and will experience no distracting discomfort. If posture is not good when relaxing deeply, muscles will relax and the body will sag, causing discomfort in the spine and joints, which will interfere with the level of relaxation attained. Put a pillow behind the lower back and one behind the neck, if necessary, to make sure the body is n ot sagging. Tensing and relaxing muscle groups: I have kept the relaxation exercises as simple as possible. All that is required is to progressively tense and relax opposing groups of muscles. If you already know a full body relaxation discipline, sti ck with it or adapt it to this one, making sure all muscle groups are covered. · Full body stretch: Stretch your arms and legs, really stretch, as if you were very tired, and take several long, slow, deep breaths. · Feet and calves: Lift up your toes and tense both feet and both calves at the same time - and then relax them. Curl up your toes and repeat. · Knees and Thighs: Tense both your thighs, knees and calves at the same time - then relax them. Press down with your heels and tense thighs, c alves and feet, then relax them. · Hips, buttocks and groin: Push your buttocks backwards, tense and relax.

This will get progressively easier to do the mor e often you do it. In time, you will be able to relax your entire body simply by waving your awareness, your mental hands, over it.

It shows the mind split, in some form, has already occurred. The physical body has varying degrees of difficulty animating itself when the mind split effect is active. Even though they may not be aware a projection is in progress, a projector's physical/etheric body may feel total physical paralysis, or some degree of lethargy and heaviness and disorientation in their physical body. The degree of thi s depends greatly upon the strength of the projection and how much energy is being used to maintain it. Strong sensations like these point to an OOBE being in progress. The degree of paralysis shows the 'strength' of the projection. A full powered Rea l Time OOBE will cause total physical paralysis (full waking paralysis) while a lighter level of projection can still allow the projector's physical body to stumble to the bathroom - albeit mumbling incoherently and feeling like they are walking on pillows , body fairly numb and fuzzy - but ambulatory all the same. Waking paralysis (often called sleep paralysis) will also occur where the real time body has been generated 'inside' the physical/etheric body, but actual separation or full projection from the p hysical/etheric bodies has not occurred. This means a partial projection has occurred, albeit internally, and is causing some degree of waking paralysis. The real time 'projectable double' in this case has not projected completely free of it's physical b ody. If this is suspected, the projector should relax and let it happen, or use a projection technique like rope. A full projection can then occur if it has not already happened. Note: Many people are plagued by waking paralysis, and it can indeed be a terrifying experience, capable of causing psychological damage. Waking paralysis can best be broken by concentrating on a single big toe and trying hard to move it. Concentrate 'everything' on moving that big toe. Once this moves, even a tiny bit, full physical movement will be instantly restored.

Many people do not like these sensations a nd some can be absolutely terrified by them. Because of this, many people avoid sleep as a way of avoiding the projection symptoms, or other projection related problems, like bad oobe experiences or nightmares. This is the very worse thing they could do as this will have the reverse effect, and will greatly worsen the condition. 1. Lack of sleep causes overtiredness, which encourages projection symptoms. 2. Sleeping flat on back encourages projection symptoms. 3. Hunger raises vibrations and encourages p rojection symptoms. Lack of sleep can also cause a loss of appetite, which can further aggravate this debilitating condition. Together with disturbing energy sensations and bad OOBE experiences, this can set up a psychological reflex and a physical cond ition which can progressively worsen the longer it is allowed to continue. The very first thing to address in cases like this is the lack of sleep, which is the 'root' cause of the whole problem. I strongly suggest sufferers of this condition seek medi cal advice 'urgently' and to ask for a strong enough sleeping medication which will promote long lasting and dreamless sleep. (I suggest people tell their doctor they are suffering from insomnia caused by bad dreams - which is partly true - to save length y explanations) Once the sleep deficit is overcome and normal sleep patterns return to normal, appetite will return and the projection related symptoms will quickly cease. Keep in mind here that the medication must be taken regularly (as per medical advi ce) until the sleep deficit is completely overcome before the medication can be stopped, or the problem may reoccur. If the use of medication is not possible, I suggest getting up early in the morning and undertaking more physical exercise than usual. Th is will 'naturally' tire out the physical body, making for easier and heavier sleep. This type of natural tiredness is quite different from 'overtiredness' caused by a sleep deficit that has been built up over a long time. The biggest problem with waking paralysis and OBE exit symptoms is that these 'wake up' the physical body and mind. Therefore, if the physical body and mind are 'naturally' very tired, they will not wake so easily, and waking paralysis and etc will be slept through, instead of them dis turbing sleep and causing fear episodes, etc. Heavy Exit Sensations: Heavy exit sensations, including the famous vibrations, are simply energy movement sensations. The strength of these, however, appears to be caused by the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 attempt to shift the center of 'waking' consciousness 'outside' the bounds of the physical body, along with the real time body as it projects. This forces a reflection of 'waking' consciousness to go with the projecting double as it projects 'outside' the physical body. This throws a spanner into the normal 'sleep projection' mechanism, and causes a type of teeth rattling bio - energetic jarring to occur in the physical/etheric body as it tries to accommodate the unusual demand placed upon it. Normally, this shift of reflected consciousness would follow the real time body, outside the bounds of the physical body, naturally, while falling asleep. This causes far lighter and less noticeable energy movement sensations - ie, not enough to disturb the 'falling asleep' process. It is the presence of 'awake' consciousness during the projection process, which causes all the problems. It seems that maintaining two awake and active copies of consciousness, both interior and exterior, requires a great deal more energy flow than nature g enerally provides for, and this in itself appears to be the real cause of heavy exit sensations. This is, in other words, a true complication of consciousness, of spirit incarnation into a bio - energetic vehicle. I know this may sound like the same thing - a natural shift of 'falling asleep' consciousness out of body, as when compared with a deliberate shift of 'awake' consciousness out of body - but there is a vast difference in the energy requirements and resulting sensations for each. When a projector succeeds in shifting their center of awareness strongly enough along 'with' their projecting double, there is also much more likelihood of them retaining their OOBE memories after reentry and reintegration - when they wake up. Heavy exit sensations quickl y reduce after the first few conscious exit projections, through forced bio - energetic development. The energy body progressively becomes used to the conscious exit process, and steadily adapts and develops in response to further awake OBE attempts, to pro vide for and handle the required energies. Torso Energy Surge: Many projections are ruined by a surge of energy in the torso, as energy flows through the legs and lower primary centers, through the navel and solar plexus to the heart and higher c enters. This feels very much like the 'falling' sensation you get occasionally while drifting off to sleep. This feeling makes you catch at the sides of the bed, as if to stop yourself from falling. All these sensations are caused by a surge of emotiona l type energy through the energy body and heart center, as the real time double is generated and the projection out of body begins. This sensation is so strong in some people it leaves them breathless and wide awake, thus breaking the delicate re laxed state necessary for conscious exit oobe. This can be an infuriating problem. The torso energy surge often contains a great deal of emotional, nervous and adrenalin affecting energies as massive amounts of energy move through the lower primary cente rs into and through the heart center. This can be felt in much the same way as any emotional surging type of body - rush would be felt...like a huge wave of excitement, much like you may feel if you suddenly won a million dollars, or like the feelings cause d by riding roller coaster or bungie - jumping."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 Sexual arousal is, also, not uncommonly related to this type of energy surge, as there is a primary energy center (major chakra) situated directly over the genitals. (This center is not mentioned in the Treatise, but is dealt with in my book \"Astral Dynamics\" under the Core Skills & Energy section) A strong upwards energy rush of energy will thus often involve this genital center, to a greater or lesser extent, depending upon the energy makeup of the projector. Arousal usually breaks the delicately balanced state required for conscious exit oobe. Lying prone on the back seems to intensify the torso energy surge problem. One way of easing this problem is to experiment with other resting/proje ction positions, to find one where the sensations are weaker or less distracting. These sensations are generally weaker when lying on your side or when sitting semi - upright. Lying fully on your side, however, tends to promote lucid dreams rather than OOB E's. This energy surge is, basically, caused by massive energy movement through the energy body and it's primary centers (major chakras). Heavy energy movement sensations are caused by energy blockages in energy structures not accustomed to consci ous exit projection. The heavier the sensations the stronger will be the energy blockages causing them. When the energy body is unused to heavy primary center energy movement, and the projector is awake, these sensations can severely disrupt projection a ttempts. The only way to solve this particular problem appears to be regular meditation, relaxation, trance & energy work, which promotes energy body development. This is best done separately from actual projection attempts. These exercises should be co ntinued until energy centers and their connecting pathways grow strong enough to handle the stronger energy movements, which happen during a conscious exit oobe. Lost Focus During The Exit: A common cause of failed projection appears to be a fail ure to shift the 'center' of consciousness out of the physical body along 'with' the real time double as it projects free of the physical body. It is extremely important a projector keep their mind clear and focused on the action and sensation of leaving their physical body, to go with it, and not to lose touch with what is happening. Heavy exit sensations can make this difficult, I know, but they must be 'totally' ignored. Stay focused on the projection and where the center of consciousness is going. I f concentration slips at the wrong time, the real time body can project out, without a strong center of waking consciousness. A reflection of mind will still transfer into the projecting real time double, but the projector's strongest center of consciousn ess will, in effect, remain behind locked inside the physical/etheric body. This copy will be, in effect, left behind, feeling some degree of paralysis and weakness, thinking it has failed the projection completely, and will usually fall asleep shortly af terwards. In this case, strong memories are created in the physical brain, for the same time period as the projection. The projected double's memories can thus have trouble overwriting these upon reintegration. The whole idea, with this aspect of projec tion, is to make the 'projection' memories the strongest and most memorable memories for the same time period."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 The above is a complication of the mind split effect, which causes enormous problems for projectors. It goes a long way to explaining what may have occurred when (as happens to many people) everything goes fine right up until the exit stage, with all the right sensations: vibrations, rapid heartbeat, falling or floating sensation, etc, and then everything just stops. It just goes away, leaving the almost - projector lying there wondering what happened and why they failed. Most people this happens to also feel exhausted, or partially or fully paralyzed, after their seemingly failed projection attempt and soon fall into a deep sleep. The projectio n, in this case, will proceed without them, being centered in their projected double, without them being aware they have succeeded. In most cases, no memory of the successful projection will be evident upon waking. FEAR has many colors: 1. Fear of heavy projection exit sensations. 2. Fear of the unknown out of body environment. 3. Religion instilled worry/fear of doing the wrong thing. Fear has many subtle forms. All of these can be progressively overcome by understanding the mechanics and dynamics of OOBE and by experiencing the projected state at first hand. Projection out of body requires some bravery and fear is one of the first natural barriers faced by all new projectors standing on the threshold of a conscious exit projection. Fear is a natura l barrier, apparently designed to stop people projecting until they are psychologically ready to operate out of their bodies. \"True bravery is not the ability to feel no fear, but is the ability to control fear whilst continuing to function in a reasonabl y normal fashion.\" RB During an oobe, a projector is virtually invulnerable and can pass through solid matter, sit on ground zero during an atomic blast, or even to bask within the heart of a supernova unscathed. The only thing to fear while out of bod y is 'fear' itself. Nothing else can directly hurt a projector and nothing can get at their physical body and mind during a conscious projection. While it is fairly rare to come across anything nasty or negative during a projection, any troublesome entit y a projector might stumble across cannot, therefore, directly harm them. They can, however, show themselves as a form designed to scare the daylights out of a projector, and this can cause psychologically damage. This can also result in a subconscious f ear of OOBE. It can cause an instinctive, negative baulking type of reaction, which can ruin every conscious exit. This can stop a projector from enjoying conscious OOBE for the remainder of their life, unless they can program themselves to overcome it. If this is already the case, I suggest a course of affirmations and self - hypnosis be used to overcome it.

This is not easy and can take a lot of control, as well as a lot of faith that the heavy physical sensations of early conscious projections will not actually hurt you. The sensations can be 'extremely' physical and violent, especially during the fir st few conscious exit attempts, but will always progressively reduce during subsequent projections. The physical heartbeat is 'not' actually increased by a conscious exit projection attempt. It is not 'caused' to physically race by the OOBE attemp t - although it will often definitely 'feel' like it is racing so fast it seems about to explode. This racing sensation is the heart chakra (primary center) working overtime to provide the energy needed to generate and project the Real Time vehicle. The difficulty here is, again, caused by the real time body attempting to take an 'awake' copy of consciousness out of body. This is something quite different from natural sleep projection, and therefore can cause some rather extreme energy movement sensation s, which are often felt as extremely physical sensations. The heart may, indeed, increase in speed when the heart chakra becomes fully active 'if' the projector becomes frightened. Fear and panic can cause further sensations by way of an 'actual ' rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, vertigo, nausea, cramps and pain, etc. The best way to get over this is to concentrate everything on climbing ROPE and getting out of body as 'quickly' as possible - while totally ignoring the racing heart sensation and heavy bodily vibrations. The sooner the projector gets out of their body the sooner these will stop. The heavy physical sensations can, to a great extent, be reduced by regular meditation and energy work, which progressively develops the energy body , enabling it to provide and deal with the energies required for conscious exit projection. A smooth and rapid exit from the physical body is, however, the very best way of overcoming this. Please note that 'not' everybody experiences heavy exit sensat ions, but it is far better to be prepared for a worst case scenario than to be caught by surprise and scared out of a perfectly good projection. Heavy exit sensations, on their own, can also cause psychological scarring and make each future projection att empt even more difficult to achieve. This is like how you might wince by instinctive reflex action while brushing a once sensitive tooth, even long after it has been repaired and no pain will be felt. Fear of The Unknown Out Of Body Environment: Fear of the out of body environment itself is not easy to get over. This is simply caused by fear of the unknown and most people get some degree of this the first few times they get out. This type of fear seems related to the natural fear of the dark, which all children have to grow out of. This type of fear goes away gradually, as you become accustomed to projection sensations and the out of body environment through progressive personal experience. A new projector must be brave and control and ignor e this fear, if only for a short time. Even if they still feel strong feelings of fear, they can and must"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 ignore these and go on with their OOBE attempt. Once they get out of body, they'll have overcome the first great barrier to OOBE and fear levels wil l be greatly reduced the next time they get out. Becoming progressively more and more familiar with the out of body environment, through multiple projections, is of the best ways of overcoming this type of fear. Getting out, if only briefly and fo r the very first time, is the most important goal for any new projector. This will make the out of body environment much more real and it will make it even more achievable next time. Even if a projector only manages the conscious exit a couple of times, the memory and 'reality' of OOBE will be forever instilled into them by those experiences. The knowledge that they can exist apart from their physical body and remain intact, alive and functioning will remain with them forever. This, on it's own, can als o greatly help to reduce the fear of personal death, and even the pain of grief felt when a loved one is lost. OOBE provides very attainable first hand experience of what it will be like to die. What is death if not the final projection out of body? If OOBE has been experienced, therefore, they are not going to some strange place or having some totally unknown experience, i.e., death. They are only repeating (albeit with slightly more finality) something they have already experienced before. Projecting during daylight hours is the very best way to quickly overcome fear of the out of body environment. There is 'nothing' scary about flying around out of body on a bright sunny day. It's an enormously enjoyable experience, to say the very least. Have you every wondered what it would be like to fly like Superman? And, if you worry about meeting something scary: I have never seen or heard of any type of negative or troublesome entity, not even the simple mischievous types, operating out in the open in ful l sunlight. While it is possible to come across some things inside a building, the chances of meeting something scary are extremely remote if, after the exit, the projector immediately heads outside into the open and into the full sunlight. The action of doing this quickly, immediately after the exit, may also throw a projector straight into the astral planes, again greatly reducing the likelihood of meeting anything scary. Religion Instilled Worry/Fear: Many people worry they are breaking God's laws, o r infringing upon something in the Bible, by having OBE's. There are NO direct Biblical references which directly state projection is wrong, evil or even advising against it. In fact, there are many references within the bible that mention OBE, i.e., if memory serves me, St Paul speaks on this, when telling of one man's mystical experience: \"whether in or out of his body I cannot tell\". \"If it's not written in the Holy Bible then it 'must' be evil\" is another common flame against OBE. However, the major ity of the technological accomplishments of the modern world are also 'not' in the Bible. This does not make them evil in any way. \"OBE is witchcraft, as witches are known to have OBE's, and they therefore must be evil\" is another popular flame against OBE. Well, this is like saying that air travel is evil, simply because Hitler was known to fly in aircraft, or that the night is evil, simply"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 because witches are generally more active at night, or that explosives are evil, simply because some people make bombs out of them to hurt people with. My way of seeing this is: God created the heavens and the universe and everything within them. His creation is perfect and nothing has been overlooked, down to the smallest atom. God also created the integrated p hysical and energetic subtle bodies within man, and unseen inside His design lays the potential for the natural multi - dimensional mind split effect, which occurs to 'everyone' whenever they sleep. The ability to have conscious out of body experiences is a 'natural' ability and, even though many people find it difficult to accomplish, everyone has the potential for this ability. I think, if God did not want people to have OOBE's, He would have designed us a little differently, and made projection impossibl e? To think otherwise is to claim that God made a mistake, which is to say God, is fallible, which is definitely irreligious and probably goes against all known religious and Biblical laws. My life experience leads me to sincerely believe that God is wis e and that HE never ever makes mistakes. Calling For Help: It is possible to call for help from another projector when attempting to project, or to call someone to meet you when you get out of body. Once you hit the trance state, or feel heavy and are close to falling asleep, mentally call out the person's name several times, as loudly (mentally) as you can. If they are out of body they will definitely hear you, no matter where they are or how far away them might be, and will be drawn to come v isit you. If this person is experienced, they may be able to help you out of your body. Another projector, although they may be able to help in other ways, will not, however, be able to actually 'pull' another projector out of their body. Any attempt to do so will be perceived by the projector as a psychic/energy body attack (very unpleasant cold shivers, etc) which will tend to break their delicately balanced 'projectable' state. A projector can best help another projector by waiting for the natural projection (sleep projection) to take place and then making them aware they are projecting, helping them to remember it. Good advice at this time would be for them to dive back into their physical body shouting, \"I did it!\" to help them cement their oobe memories. Often, when a natural projection occurs, the real time body will drift slowly out of it's physical body and hover just above it, mimicking it's sleeping position. The real time projector in this state is asleep, just as it's physical body an d mind are. A helpful projector can best help them attain an OOBE by gently waking the sleeping projector's real time body and urging them to reenter their physical body before it falls too deeply asleep. If this has already happened, a joint projection can then proceed. In this case, I suggest the novice projector periodically returns to their physical body and keeps a close eye on the time. They can then make sure they are hovering nearby and ready to dive back into their physical body shouting, \"I di d it!\" the moment the alarm clock starts to go"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 off, when they feel the first tugs from the physical body as it begins reeling them in for reintegration. Spirits: Personally, I do not advise projectors call out to 'unknown' spirits or 'unknown' guides to help them project, unless they know 'exactly' who or what they are calling, and can verify their credentials as to exactly who and what they are. Calling blindly for any help from anywhere carries a high risk of attracting the unwanted attention of undes irable astral wildlife and mischievous spirit entities. Most types of intelligent astral wildlife and spirit entities appear to require some kind of 'permission' before they can interfere with a living person's life. Calling blindly for help can provide an entity with all the 'permission' it needs, albeit obtusely. And, once permission is given in cases like this, it cannot so simply or easily be revoked. It is, I believe, a very unsafe practice indeed, to deliberately solicit the help of unknown spirit entities, as any type of open invite or request for help may invite a negative entity to trouble you instead. Calling upon Angels, however, does not carry the same cautions, as does blindly calling upon unknown spirits. Prayers to God (in whatever form or name you believe in) asking for His protection and help, however, are 'highly' recommended and do not carry this same risk. I thoroughly recommend a prayer for protection be 'sincerely' said before any projection, even just a few words, regardless of b elief or religion - or even the lack of it. Prayers are most effective when said from a deeply relaxed 'quiet' mental state; ie, from in the trance state. If a spirit of some kind does manifest during an OBE, and the projector is not sure if they are gen uine or not, a simple test is to ask it to go away and leave you alone, and to return at another time, when called upon. Any good spirit will obey this request, and will return another time when called upon. If a spirit does not leave, or argues against this request, saying it knows better than you what's good for you, etc, then its a pretty safe bet this spirit is not who they say they are. There are certain skills necessary to be learned by any projector wishing to OOBE at will. There are 'no' safe sh ortcuts to projection. The difficulties associated with conscious exit OOBE are best thought of as natural barriers, barriers which are there for a 'reason' and which are therefore unwise to avoid. If there is a friendly spirit or guide associated or in terested in the progress of a projector, and they are interested in helping, they will know 'exactly' what the projector is doing and 'when' they are doing it. If they are willing and able to help with them learning projection, they will do so, without an y request from the projector. The difficulties of conscious exit OOBE are 'natural' barriers and it is unwise to avoid the lessons these hold and the skills that can be gained in overcoming them. These skills: deep physical relaxation, clearing the mi nd, concentration, trance, bodily awareness actions, energy raising and the ability to overcome fear, are necessary requirements for successful and safe out of body operations.

This does not, however, mean you should not keep trying, as once the necessary skills are learned, and you have fulfilled the requirements for OBE operations, you will have passed the first natural barrier and will be ready to take your first steps out of your body. Physical Body's Eyes: While this may appear obvious to many people, I have had a lot of queries over this matter. The physical body's eyes must remain closed at all times during a projection attempt. (You wouldn't believe how many times I've been asked about this:) Real Time and/or Astral sight will enable by itself during or just prior to a conscious projection exit. If a projection is too dark or the projector feels they are blind, I suggest they use the out of body energy raising techniques, as given earlier. It is also possible to create light by visualization, by visualizing a torch or lamp, etc. Many people find they simply have to ask for their sight when out of body and they get it straight away. Another way to overcome darkness is to visualize a well - lit destination and use the instant travel method to project there. REM (Rapid Eye Movement) Rapid Eye Movement, commonly called the 'REM' state, often happens during an oobe attem pt - often, but not always. This is a natural event triggered by the trance state when the physical body is very tired - when the physical body falls into a deeper sleep than is actually required, but with the mind still being held awake. The REM conditi on signposts the ideal time to have a lucid dream, as this indicates the dream mind is becoming active. If fear or other difficulties make OOBE difficult I suggest the projector focus on having a lucid dream at this time, as this will give some type of re lated out of body experience which will help prepare them for a full blown conscious exit OOBE later on. At this time a 'conscious' lucid dream becomes a viable alternative to a conscious OOBE, especially if REM activity is disturbing and breaking the con centration of the projector. Keep in mind here that a lucid dream can be converted into a Real Time or astral projection if the projector focuses on and 'feels' for their body. They will then either project back to their body, or near to it, and a full OO BE can continue, or is then much easier to attain. LD Note: A good way to attain a lucid dream, if lying down when the REM state hits, is for the projector to stop the OOBE attempt, staying relaxed and turning on their side (not their back) and to imagi ne a department store setting while allowing themselves to sink gently into sleep. If all goes well, they'll slip directly into a lucid dream with no apparent break in consciousness.

While this idea appears to have some merit on th e surface, I have come to the conclusion it is a completely illogical practice. No localized awareness action or visualized action can cause an energy center (chakra) to deactivate or close. This applies to any type of energy center, secondary or primary . Experience tells me that no matter how an awareness action is performed at the site of an energy center it will 'always' cause stimulation. It is a mistake to think that any awareness or visualized action can succeed at closing or deactivating an energ y center. This is a little like fanning a spark (inactive energy center) into a flame with an stimulation action (making the spark an 'active' energy center) and then trying to make that same flame go out by blowing up on it from a different direction. H owever it is done, it will continue to fan the flame. Consider this: Most popular chakra opening methods involve visualizing a small door or pair of curtains opening over the site of a chakra. Once this is done that chakra is deemed to have been 'opened '. This method is then simply reversed to 'close' that chakra at the end of the session. Once these doors have been visualized as closing, the chakras are deemed to have been 'closed'. Primary chakras are complex non - physical 'vortexes' of energy, ea ch with a great many functions, about the size of the palm of your hand. If you look at just how a visualized 'little door' opening technique like this would affect a powerful energy structure like this, it becomes fairly obvious that a reversed action of 'closing' a simple little door would have little or no effect. It would also not affect it in the desired way. If you understand how bodily awareness and Tactile Imaging works, as per the Treatise, it becomes clear this reasoning is somewhat faulty. Bo th opening and closing methods involve a visualized or bodily awareness action at the site of a major chakra. Both opening and closing actions will, therefore, each cause some degree of stimulation. Primary energy centers cannot be likened to simple mech anical devices that can be switched off or closed by any such visualization or awareness action. Energy centers are, I think I have shown, not simply little doorways that can be opened and shut with good intentions and a little visualization. Some people may dispute this, as energy centers are 'traditionally' supposed to be closed after use; as per popular new - age type theories and literature on this subject. Be that as it may, my logic is sound and based on repeatable experiments, and energy centers sim ply 'cannot' be deactivated or 'closed' in this way. If a person thinks they have succeeded at doing this, they will find"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 this is merely a coincidence, and that the energy centers in question were deactivating on their own anyway. In most cases, primary energy centers will begin deactivating very quickly from the moment relaxation discipline is broken, when physical body movement and normal levels of mental activity are restored. Reversing the energy 'raising' action and taking energy down throu gh the legs (not through primary centers) however does help reduce activity in primary energy centers. This reversed energy raising action does not involved any type of direct chakra stimulation and will reduces the amount of energy flowing into the energ y body, especially through the legs. This reduces the amount of energy available to primary energy centers, thereby reducing activity in them to some extent. This does not, however, involve any focused awareness actions at the sites of primary centers. Energy centers, primary and secondary, naturally reduce their level of activity once relaxation discipline is broken, as well as when they cease to be stimulated or used. The best way to deactivate energy centers is to stop stimulating and using them. En ergy centers will also cease activity when they become energetically exhausted. This will happen when the supporting energy body circuitry shuts down, becomes exhausted, or for some other reason becomes incapable of providing the required energy flow nece ssary to maintain primary energy centers in their active state. Note: if no significant continuing energy movement or activity is felt in primary energy centers, after a development session or projection attempt, they should be left alone. An attempt s hould be made to reduce activity 'only' if continuing chakra sensations are pronounced or become bothersome and uncomfortable. If left alone, they will naturally deactivate very quickly once relaxation discipline is broken and physical movement and activi ty are restored. Ways Of Reducing Primary Center Activity: 1. Reverse the energy raising action in the legs and arms alone - pushing energy back down and out of the body. 2. Stop focusing awareness on any primary energy centers. 3. Break mental relaxa tion and trance and restore normal physical and mental activity. Move, stand, talk, stretch and restore full circulation and movement. 5. Curl up and go to sleep - if this is appropriate. 6. Have a substantial snack or meal."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 7.

YO - YO OOBE Technique: The whole point of any OOBE technique is to exteriorize bodily awareness outside of the physical body to trigger the projection reflex quickly, whi lst the projector remains mentally awake. This, apparently simple, awareness action can, however, be extremely difficult for most people to maintain for more than a couple of seconds. If this is done only briefly, however, over and over and rhythmically, for long enough, it will also have the effect of triggering the projection reflex. Following is the outline of a new technique I call YOYO. I have used this myself and it seems to have almost as many good points as the Rope technique, but most people find YOYO much easier. This method is a good alternative if you are having trouble with ROPE. This can also be used as a good preparatory exercise for an OOBE attempt. It helps 'loosen up' the projectable double, even if another technique is to be used for the actual exit. 1. Get yourself into a deeply relaxed state, or into the trance state if possible, as you normally would prepare for using an OOBE technique. 2. Pick a target on the ceiling above your bed, or on the wall if using a chair. This can be a light fitting or picture (anything) or you can tape a small paper target up above you. 3. Stand on a chair (careful not to fall) and get the feel of what it is like to have your face up close to the target. Feel the changed spatial coordinates. Fe el what this new position (up next to the target) feels like from there. Feel where the floor and bed and furniture and windows and doors are now. Memorize what it 'feels' like to be in this position, up close to your target."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 4. Instead of using ROPE, s hift your awareness out of your body and push it right up next to the target, as if target were right next to your face. Imagine and 'feel' yourself being at the target, right up close to it. Hold your awareness there for one second only and then pull yo ur point of awareness back to your body. Feel yourself move right up to the target and, briefly, feel your spatial coordinates in the room change as your bodily awareness changes location. Feel the room move around you, briefly, as you fly up to the targ et and back to your body. Feel the room change back to normal when you pull your center of awareness back to your body. 5. Bounce your awareness back and forth between the target and your body at roughly one - second intervals (whatever feels most natural ). Try and develop a natural rhythm, in and out, in and out, and over and over. 6. When you get used to using this technique, extend your time at the target slightly, just a little bit longer. Always keep this time short enough to be comfortable and ach ievable so you can do it repeatedly, over and over, with ease. This takes concentration but is quite easy when you get the hang of it. 7. Keep this up and it will trigger the projection reflex just like ROPE. 8. Vary this technique as you see fit, wit h other OOBE techniques like ROPE, or rolling out of your body, or feeling yourself floating out of body, point shift, etc. You may, for example, trigger the projectable state, feeling vibrations, etc, using YOYO and find it easier to finish off the exit using ROPE, or by rolling out of your body, or with another favorite method. Racing Heartbeat, Disorientation & Pressure: In my opinion, disorientation and head pressure, during or after an OBE or OBE attempt, stem from forced bio - energetic development , caused by an OBE attempt. Any problems resulting from this will settle down over a couple of days. I do not advise further attempts until you feel completely normal again - as things must have time to adjust and develop in response to what has happened - as a muscle must be given time to heal and develop after being overworked and strained. While a logical observation, and partly true, the assumption that the heart chakra is not getting enough energy, and that this is causing it to race during an OBE att empt, is not entirely correct. This matter is far more complex than it appears."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 When you cease a projection causing bodily awareness action, ie, Rope, and observe the throbbing in your heart chakra slowing, you have actually eased the pressure that was f orcing your energy body to generate your projectable double. This eases the load on the heart chakra, thus slowing its activity. The heart chakra is forced to provide a lot of energy, to generate the projectable double, during an awake induced OBE attemp t. Excessive heart center activity, and all other heavy exit sensations, are 'caused' by the presence of 'awake' consciousness, which cause a plethora of bio - energetic conflicts to arise. To support this: think how easily you project out of body when you r mind is asleep, and out of the bio - energetic equation? When asleep, you'll find you slip out with hardly a murmur from your hear chakra, feeling only a mild, brief falling sensation. At the very worse this level of exit sensations will make you catch th e sides of your bed, especially at times when you are drifting in and out of sleep, before actually falling asleep. When awake consciousness is present during an OBE attempt, a true 'complication of bio - incarnated consciousness' arises. Your awake mind c hanges the whole equation, and the usual bio - energetic projection mechanism comes under a lot of unusual pressure. It finds it must work overtime to provide the energies needed to generate the projected double while awake consciousness is present. When a wake consciousness is present during projection, the bio - energetic projection mechanism has to overcome the awake mind's conscious control over its physical body, and the 'tension' this automatically generates. By partly true, I mean that the heart chakra does speed up when increased energy demands are placed upon it. This can occur during an OBE, when the projected double deliberately draws more energy from its physical/etheric counterpart, which is energetically maintaining its projected double via the Silver Cord. A noticeable heavier thrumming will also be felt from within the perceived chest area of the projected double when this happens, even though it does not have a chest, per se. This is especially noticeable at close range, within 20 feet (6 me ters) or so, during a Real Time OBE, and eases with greater distance. But, when heart center throbbing speeds up during a conscious exit OBE attempt (which is especially noticeable during early OBE's and OBE attempts), this is a sign that awake consciousn ess is throwing a spanner into the works, so to speak. Apart from the 'unavoidable' presence of awake consciousness - which must be overcome through repeated OBE attempt experience (which develops the projection mechanism to the point where it can compens ate), plus simple bio - energetic development - most of the problems this causes stem from a lack of deep physical relaxation. This is the most 'widespread' problem and general cause of this. The vast majority of would - be projectors do not attain a sufficie nt state of deep physical relaxation prior to OBE attempts, and then experience heavy exit sensations and problems as a result. \"No way!\" you might say, \"I'm in full trance and so 'must' be deeply physically relaxed enough for projection to occur. Well, while an understandable assumption, think on this: it is quite possible to attain a fairly deep level of trance (usually too deep for easy OBE) while the physical body still retains sufficient physical tension to interfere with the projection mechanism. In a similar way, it is also possible to fall asleep while"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 still full of stress and tension. For example, I can attain a full trance state while standing and even walking - which obviously entails physical tension, which obviously would interfere with an OBE attempt, if I attempted one at this time. My suggestion is to read The Treatise on OBE, Version 2.00, parts 1 - 8, and then to spend at least a few weeks practicing deep physical relaxation, and trance work only. Do this 'separately' from OBE attempt s, preferably at times when you are wide - awake, like in the morning. This makes relaxation and trance work much harder, but has far more development benefits because of this. If after following the above advice, you still have problems, I'd consider the Mind - Split as being the culprit stopping you from 'remembering' your OBE's. If you experience vibrations or other exit sensations prior to the racing heart center sensation, it possible that you had already succeeded at projecting, but had missed the exit: meaning that after your projected double had departed, your physical/etheric aspect was continuing to attempt projection. Under this circumstance, projection is impossible; re the etheric body cannot leave its physical counterpart while a OBE is 'already ' in progress. Emotion and Reentry: The emotional content of the reentry phase is 'extremely' important as it strengthens OBE memories. If the mind split is responsible, and it probably is, for failed OBE attempts, this means your memories of existing in your physical/etheric body are not allowing your OBE memories to 'overwrite' them after reentry. The nature of the physical brain is to record only a single memory for any single time period. During an OBE, two completely separate sets of memory are p resent - those of the physical/etheric body and those of its projected double. The 'strongest' memory set will be the set retained, as a recallable memory, after an OBE. The memories of the physical/etheric body have more of an immediate impact on the ph ysical brain, as these memories are automatically recorded, as per normal physical memory recording. In order for an OBE memory download to take place, and overwrite these memories, they have to be stronger and have more 'impact' than the resident memor ies. Emotion can thus be used to empower OBE memories, to give them more impact on the physical brain. It is for the above reasons that fearful or exciting, more dramatic, OBE's are more easily remembered than are the more mundane type. I remember durin g my early days of OBE (when I started doing it deliberately) floating near my physical body trying to work out why I seemed to be failing and losing the OBE memory most of the time. I was trying to OBE just about every night, but had only succeeded a few times that year. At these times, my projected double had no problem exiting my physical body. I wondered, as it was so easy, why I was not remembering more of my OBE's. Then I remembered how excited I was during and after these OBE's, and started to wo nder....'hmmm, maybe emotion itself had something to do with carrying the OBE memories back into my physical body with me?'

However, Robert Bruce, who is a metaphysical researcher providing a free service on the Net for enquirers re astral projection and energy work etc. has provided a book, which justly deserves an alternative title \" The Muldoon for the Millennium\". He has gone into great detail concerning the actual dynamics of projection and the various phenomena which have puzzled practitioners for years e.g. dual consciousness, lack of ability in controlling the out of body trip and the difficulty in recalling astral adventures.

In my own reading, many projectors have provided fairly abstract explanations concerning these problems which remain, alas, m ostly theoretical but Robert Bruce has gone into great detail, after extensive personal experimentation since childhood, exactly how the problems inherent in the puzzling aspects concerning these phenomena can be eradicated. In the book he devotes consid erable space to his innovatory \"New Energy Ways\" which is a description of techniques, which facilitate the build up of energy, which is an essential accompaniment for astral projection and other psychical procedures. His description of outings to the var ious astral planes/sub planes and so on are fascinating and, indeed, thought provoking. I can only recommend this book very highly to those who are keen to get a thorough grounding in the development and understanding of the dynamics of this most fascinat ing phenomena. I believe Astral Dynamics will emerge as a classic, a worthy successor to the 20th century's \"master\" projector, Sylvan Muldoon.

It shows the mind split, in some form, has already occurred. The physical body has var ying degrees of difficulty animating itself when the mind split effect is active. Even though they may not be aware a projection is in progress, a projector's physical/etheric body may feel total physical paralysis, or some degree of lethargy and heavines s and disorientation in their physical body. The degree of this depends greatly upon the strength of the projection and how much energy is being used to maintain it. Strong sensations like these point to an OOBE being in progress. The degree of paraly sis shows the 'strength' of the projection. A full powered Real Time OOBE will cause total physical paralysis (full waking paralysis) while a lighter level of projection can still allow the projector's physical body to stumble to the bathroom - albeit mum bling incoherently and feeling like they are walking on pillows, body fairly numb and fuzzy - but ambulatory all the same. Waking paralysis (often called sleep paralysis) will also occur where the real time body has been generated 'inside' the physical/et heric body, but actual separation or full projection from the physical/etheric bodies has not occurred. This means a partial projection has occurred, albeit internally, and is causing some degree of waking paralysis. The real time 'projectable double' in this case has not projected completely free of it's physical body. If this is suspected, the projector should relax and let it happen, or use a projection technique like rope. A full projection can then occur if it has not already happened. Note: Many people are plagued by waking paralysis, and it can indeed be a terrifying experience, capable of causing psychological damage. Waking paralysis can best be broken by concentrating on a single big toe and trying hard to move it. Concentrate 'everything' on moving that big toe. Once this moves, even a tiny bit, full physical movement will be instantly restored.

Many people do not like these sensations and some can be absolutely terrified by them. Because of this, many people avoid sleep as a way of avoiding the projection symptoms, or other projection related problems, like bad oobe experien ces or nightmares. This is the very worse thing they could do as this will have the reverse effect, and will greatly worsen the condition. 1. Lack of sleep causes overtiredness, which encourages projection symptoms. 2. Sleeping flat on back encourages pr ojection symptoms. 3. Hunger raises vibrations and encourages projection symptoms. Lack of sleep can also cause a loss of appetite, which can further aggravate this debilitating condition. Together with disturbing energy sensations and bad OOBE experien ces, this can set up a psychological reflex and a physical condition which can progressively worsen the longer it is allowed to continue. The very first thing to address in cases like this is the lack of sleep, which is the 'root' cause of the whole pro blem. I strongly suggest sufferers of this condition seek medical advice 'urgently' and to ask for a strong enough sleeping medication which will promote long lasting and dreamless sleep. (I suggest people tell their doctor they are suffering from insomn ia caused by bad dreams - which is partly true - to save lengthy explanations) Once the sleep deficit is overcome and normal sleep patterns return to normal, appetite will return and the projection related symptoms will quickly cease. Keep in mind here t hat the medication must be taken regularly (as per medical advice) until the sleep deficit is completely overcome before the medication can be stopped, or the problem may reoccur. If the use of medication is not possible, I suggest getting up early in the morning and undertaking more physical exercise than usual. This will 'naturally' tire out the physical body, making for easier and heavier sleep. This type of natural tiredness is quite different from 'overtiredness' caused by a sleep deficit that has b een built up over a long time. The biggest problem with waking paralysis and OBE exit symptoms is that these 'wake up' the physical body and mind. Therefore, if the physical body and mind are 'naturally' very tired, they will not wake so easily, and waki ng paralysis and etc will be slept through, instead of them disturbing sleep and causing fear episodes, etc. Heavy Exit Sensations: Heavy exit sensations, including the famous vibrations, are simply energy movement sensations.

This forces a reflection of 'waking' consciousness to go with the proj ecting double as it projects 'outside' the physical body. This throws a spanner into the normal 'sleep projection' mechanism, and causes a type of teeth rattling bio - energetic jarring to occur in the physical/etheric body as it tries to accommodate the un usual demand placed upon it. Normally, this shift of reflected consciousness would follow the real time body, outside the bounds of the physical body, naturally, while falling asleep. This causes far lighter and less noticeable energy movement sensations - ie, not enough to disturb the 'falling asleep' process. It is the presence of 'awake' consciousness during the projection process, which causes all the problems. It seems that maintaining two awake and active copies of consciousness, both interior and exterior, requires a great deal more energy flow than nature generally provides for, and this in itself appears to be the real cause of heavy exit sensations. This is, in other words, a true complication of consciousness, of spirit incarnation into a bio - energetic vehicle. I know this may sound like the same thing - a natural shift of 'falling asleep' consciousness out of body, as when compared with a deliberate shift of 'awake' consciousness out of body - but there is a vast difference in the energy req uirements and resulting sensations for each. When a projector succeeds in shifting their center of awareness strongly enough along 'with' their projecting double, there is also much more likelihood of them retaining their OOBE memories after reentry and r eintegration - when they wake up. Heavy exit sensations quickly reduce after the first few conscious exit projections, through forced bio - energetic development. The energy body progressively becomes used to the conscious exit process, and steadily adapts and develops in response to further awake OBE attempts, to provide for and handle the required energies. Torso Energy Surge: Many projections are ruined by a surge of energy in the torso, as energy flows through the legs and lower primary center s, through the navel and solar plexus to the heart and higher centers. This feels very much like the 'falling' sensation you get occasionally while drifting off to sleep. This feeling makes you catch at the sides of the bed, as if to stop yourself from f alling. All these sensations are caused by a surge of emotional type energy through the energy body and heart center, as the real time double is generated and the projection out of body begins. This sensation is so strong in some people it leave s them breathless and wide awake, thus breaking the delicate relaxed state necessary for conscious exit oobe. This can be an infuriating problem. The torso energy surge often contains a great deal of emotional, nervous and adrenalin affecting energies as massive amounts of energy move through the lower primary centers into and through the heart center. This can be felt in much the same way as any emotional surging type of body - rush would be felt...like a huge wave of excitement, much like you may feel if you suddenly won a million dollars, or like the feelings caused by riding roller coaster or bungie - jumping."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 Sexual arousal is, also, not uncommonly related to this type of energy surge, as there is a primary energy center (major chakra) situated directly over the genitals. (This center is not mentioned in the Treatise, but is dealt with in my book \"Astral Dynamics\" under the Core Skills & Energy section) A strong upwards energy rush of energy will thus often involve this genital center, to a gr eater or lesser extent, depending upon the energy makeup of the projector. Arousal usually breaks the delicately balanced state required for conscious exit oobe. Lying prone on the back seems to intensify the torso energy surge problem. One way o f easing this problem is to experiment with other resting/projection positions, to find one where the sensations are weaker or less distracting. These sensations are generally weaker when lying on your side or when sitting semi - upright. Lying fully on yo ur side, however, tends to promote lucid dreams rather than OOBE's. This energy surge is, basically, caused by massive energy movement through the energy body and it's primary centers (major chakras). Heavy energy movement sensations are caused by energy blockages in energy structures not accustomed to conscious exit projection. The heavier the sensations the stronger will be the energy blockages causing them. When the energy body is unused to heavy primary center energy movement, and the project or is awake, these sensations can severely disrupt projection attempts. The only way to solve this particular problem appears to be regular meditation, relaxation, trance & energy work, which promotes energy body development. This is best done separately from actual projection attempts. These exercises should be continued until energy centers and their connecting pathways grow strong enough to handle the stronger energy movements, which happen during a conscious exit oobe. Lost Focus During The Exit: A common cause of failed projection appears to be a failure to shift the 'center' of consciousness out of the physical body along 'with' the real time double as it projects free of the physical body. It is extremely important a projector keep their mind clear and focused on the action and sensation of leaving their physical body, to go with it, and not to lose touch with what is happening. Heavy exit sensations can make this difficult, I know, but they must be 'totally' ignored. Stay focused on th e projection and where the center of consciousness is going. If concentration slips at the wrong time, the real time body can project out, without a strong center of waking consciousness. A reflection of mind will still transfer into the projecting real time double, but the projector's strongest center of consciousness will, in effect, remain behind locked inside the physical/etheric body. This copy will be, in effect, left behind, feeling some degree of paralysis and weakness, thinking it has failed the projection completely, and will usually fall asleep shortly afterwards. In this case, strong memories are created in the physical brain, for the same time period as the projection. The projected double's memories can thus have trouble overwriting these upon reintegration. The whole idea, with this aspect of projection, is to make the 'projection' memories the strongest and most memorable memories for the same time period."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 The above is a complication of the mind split effect, which causes enormous prob lems for projectors. It goes a long way to explaining what may have occurred when (as happens to many people) everything goes fine right up until the exit stage, with all the right sensations: vibrations, rapid heartbeat, falling or floating sensation, et c, and then everything just stops. It just goes away, leaving the almost - projector lying there wondering what happened and why they failed. Most people this happens to also feel exhausted, or partially or fully paralyzed, after their seemingly failed pro jection attempt and soon fall into a deep sleep. The projection, in this case, will proceed without them, being centered in their projected double, without them being aware they have succeeded. In most cases, no memory of the successful projection will b e evident upon waking. FEAR has many colors: 1. Fear of heavy projection exit sensations. 2. Fear of the unknown out of body environment. 3. Religion instilled worry/fear of doing the wrong thing. Fear has many subtle forms. All of these can be progre ssively overcome by understanding the mechanics and dynamics of OOBE and by experiencing the projected state at first hand. Projection out of body requires some bravery and fear is one of the first natural barriers faced by all new projectors standing on the threshold of a conscious exit projection. Fear is a natural barrier, apparently designed to stop people projecting until they are psychologically ready to operate out of their bodies. \"True bravery is not the ability to feel no fear, but is the abili ty to control fear whilst continuing to function in a reasonably normal fashion.\" RB During an oobe, a projector is virtually invulnerable and can pass through solid matter, sit on ground zero during an atomic blast, or even to bask within the heart of a supernova unscathed. The only thing to fear while out of body is 'fear' itself. Nothing else can directly hurt a projector and nothing can get at their physical body and mind during a conscious projection. While it is fairly rare to come across anythi ng nasty or negative during a projection, any troublesome entity a projector might stumble across cannot, therefore, directly harm them. They can, however, show themselves as a form designed to scare the daylights out of a projector, and this can cause ps ychologically damage. This can also result in a subconscious fear of OOBE. It can cause an instinctive, negative baulking type of reaction, which can ruin every conscious exit. This can stop a projector from enjoying conscious OOBE for the remainder of their life, unless they can program themselves to overcome it. If this is already the case, I suggest a course of affirmations and self - hypnosis be used to overcome it.

This is not easy and can take a lot of control, as well as a lot of faith that the heavy physical sensations of early conscious projections will not actually hurt you. The sensations can be 'extremely' physical and violent, especially during the first few conscious exit attempts, but will always progressively reduce during subsequent projections. The physical heartbeat is 'not' actually increased by a conscious exit projection att empt. It is not 'caused' to physically race by the OOBE attempt - although it will often definitely 'feel' like it is racing so fast it seems about to explode. This racing sensation is the heart chakra (primary center) working overtime to provide the ene rgy needed to generate and project the Real Time vehicle. The difficulty here is, again, caused by the real time body attempting to take an 'awake' copy of consciousness out of body. This is something quite different from natural sleep projection, and th erefore can cause some rather extreme energy movement sensations, which are often felt as extremely physical sensations. The heart may, indeed, increase in speed when the heart chakra becomes fully active 'if' the projector becomes frightened. F ear and panic can cause further sensations by way of an 'actual' rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, vertigo, nausea, cramps and pain, etc. The best way to get over this is to concentrate everything on climbing ROPE and getting out of body as 'quickly' as possible - while totally ignoring the racing heart sensation and heavy bodily vibrations. The sooner the projector gets out of their body the sooner these will stop. The heavy physical sensations can, to a great extent, be reduced by regular meditatio n and energy work, which progressively develops the energy body, enabling it to provide and deal with the energies required for conscious exit projection. A smooth and rapid exit from the physical body is, however, the very best way of overcoming this. Please note that 'not' everybody experiences heavy exit sensations, but it is far better to be prepared for a worst case scenario than to be caught by surprise and scared out of a perfectly good projection. Heavy exit sensations, on their own, can also c ause psychological scarring and make each future projection attempt even more difficult to achieve. This is like how you might wince by instinctive reflex action while brushing a once sensitive tooth, even long after it has been repaired and no pain will be felt. Fear of The Unknown Out Of Body Environment: Fear of the out of body environment itself is not easy to get over. This is simply caused by fear of the unknown and most people get some degree of this the first few times they get out. T his type of fear seems related to the natural fear of the dark which all children have to grow out of. This type of fear goes away gradually, as you become accustomed to projection sensations and the out of body environment through progressive personal ex perience. A new projector must be brave and control and ignore this fear, if only for a short time. Even if they still feel strong feelings of fear, they can and must"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 ignore these and go on with their OOBE attempt. Once they get out of body, they'll hav e overcome the first great barrier to OOBE and fear levels will be greatly reduced the next time they get out. Becoming progressively more and more familiar with the out of body environment, through multiple projections, is of the best ways of overcoming this type of fear. Getting out, if only briefly and for the very first time, is the most important goal for any new projector. This will make the out of body environment much more real and it will make it even more achievable next time. Even if a projector only manages the conscious exit a couple of times, the memory and 'reality' of OOBE will be forever instilled into them by those experiences. The knowledge that they can exist apart from their physical body and remain intact, alive and function ing will remain with them forever. This, on it's own, can also greatly help to reduce the fear of personal death, and even the pain of grief felt when a loved one is lost. OOBE provides very attainable first hand experience of what it will be like to die . What is death if not the final projection out of body? If OOBE has been experienced, therefore, they are not going to some strange place or having some totally unknown experience, i.e., death. They are only repeating (albeit with slightly more finalit y) something they have already experienced before. Projecting during daylight hours is the very best way to quickly overcome fear of the out of body environment. There is 'nothing' scary about flying around out of body on a bright sunny day. It's an eno rmously enjoyable experience, to say the very least. Have you every wondered what it would be like to fly like Superman? And, if you worry about meeting something scary: I have never seen or heard of any type of negative or troublesome entity, not even the simple mischievous types, operating out in the open in full sunlight. While it is possible to come across some things inside a building, the chances of meeting something scary are extremely remote if, after the exit, the projector immediately heads out side into the open and into the full sunlight. The action of doing this quickly, immediately after the exit, may also throw a projector straight into the astral planes, again greatly reducing the likelihood of meeting anything scary. Religion Instilled W orry/Fear: Many people worry they are breaking God's laws, or infringing upon something in the Bible, by having OBE's. There are NO direct Biblical references which directly state projection is wrong, evil or even advising against it. In fact, there ar e many references within the bible that mention OBE, i.e., if memory serves me, St Paul speaks on this, when telling of one man's mystical experience: \"whether in or out of his body I cannot tell\". \"If it's not written in the Holy Bible then it 'must' be evil\" is another common flame against OBE. However, the majority of the technological accomplishments of the modern world are also 'not' in the Bible. This does not make them evil in any way. \"OBE is witchcraft, as witches are known to have OBE's, and they therefore must be evil\" is another popular flame against OBE. Well, this is like saying that air travel is evil, simply because Hitler was known to fly in aircraft, or that the night is evil, simply"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 because witches are generally more active at night , or that explosives are evil, simply because some people make bombs out of them to hurt people with. My way of seeing this is: God created the heavens and the universe and everything within them. His creation is perfect and nothing has been overlooked, down to the smallest atom. God also created the integrated physical and energetic subtle bodies within man, and unseen inside His design lays the potential for the natural multi - dimensional mind split effect, which occurs to 'everyone' whenever they slee p. The ability to have conscious out of body experiences is a 'natural' ability and, even though many people find it difficult to accomplish, everyone has the potential for this ability. I think, if God did not want people to have OOBE's, He would have d esigned us a little differently, and made projection impossible? To think otherwise is to claim that God made a mistake, which is to say God, is fallible, which is definitely irreligious and probably goes against all known religious and Biblical laws. My life experience leads me to sincerely believe that God is wise and that HE never ever makes mistakes. Calling For Help: It is possible to call for help from another projector when attempting to project, or to call someone to meet you when you g et out of body. Once you hit the trance state, or feel heavy and are close to falling asleep, mentally call out the person's name several times, as loudly (mentally) as you can. If they are out of body they will definitely hear you, no matter where they are or how far away them might be, and will be drawn to come visit you. If this person is experienced, they may be able to help you out of your body. Another projector, although they may be able to help in other ways, will not, however, be able to actu ally 'pull' another projector out of their body. Any attempt to do so will be perceived by the projector as a psychic/energy body attack (very unpleasant cold shivers, etc) which will tend to break their delicately balanced 'projectable' state. A project or can best help another projector by waiting for the natural projection (sleep projection) to take place and then making them aware they are projecting, helping them to remember it. Good advice at this time would be for them to dive back into their physi cal body shouting, \"I did it!\" to help them cement their oobe memories. Often, when a natural projection occurs, the real time body will drift slowly out of it's physical body and hover just above it, mimicking it's sleeping position. The real time pr ojector in this state is asleep, just as it's physical body and mind are. A helpful projector can best help them attain an OOBE by gently waking the sleeping projector's real time body and urging them to reenter their physical body before it falls too dee ply asleep. If this has already happened, a joint projection can then proceed. In this case, I suggest the novice projector periodically returns to their physical body and keeps a close eye on the time.

Spirits: Personally, I do not advise pr ojectors call out to 'unknown' spirits or 'unknown' guides to help them project, unless they know 'exactly' who or what they are calling, and can verify their credentials as to exactly who and what they are. Calling blindly for any help from anywhere carr ies a high risk of attracting the unwanted attention of undesirable astral wildlife and mischievous spirit entities. Most types of intelligent astral wildlife and spirit entities appear to require some kind of 'permission' before they can interfere with a living person's life. Calling blindly for help can provide an entity with all the 'permission' it needs, albeit obtusely. And, once permission is given in cases like this, it cannot so simply or easily be revoked. It is, I believe, a very unsafe practi ce indeed, to deliberately solicit the help of unknown spirit entities, as any type of open invite or request for help may invite a negative entity to trouble you instead. Calling upon Angels, however, does not carry the same cautions as does blindly call ing upon unknown spirits. Prayers to God (in whatever form or name you believe in) asking for His protection and help, however, are 'highly' recommended and do not carry this same risk. I thoroughly recommend a prayer for protection be 'sincerely' said b efore any projection, even just a few words, regardless of belief or religion - or even the lack of it. Prayers are most effective when said from a deeply relaxed 'quiet' mental state; ie, from in the trance state. If a spirit of some kind does manifest during an OBE, and the projector is not sure if they are genuine or not, a simple test is to ask it to go away and leave you alone, and to return at another time, when called upon. Any good spirit will obey this request, and will return another time when called upon. If a spirit does not leave, or argues against this request, saying it knows better than you what's good for you, etc, then its a pretty safe bet this spirit is not who they say they are. There are certain skills necessary to be learned by an y projector wishing to OOBE at will. There are 'no' safe shortcuts to projection. The difficulties associated with conscious exit OOBE are best thought of as natural barriers, barriers which are there for a 'reason' and which are therefore unwise to avoi d. If there is a friendly spirit or guide associated or interested in the progress of a projector, and they are interested in helping, they will know 'exactly' what the projector is doing and 'when' they are doing it. If they are willing and able to hel p with them learning projection, they will do so, without any request from the projector. The difficulties of conscious exit OOBE are 'natural' barriers and it is unwise to avoid the lessons these hold and the skills that can be gained in overcoming the m. These skills: deep physical relaxation, clearing the mind, concentration, trance, bodily awareness actions, energy raising and the ability to overcome fear, are necessary requirements for successful and safe out of body operations. In a nutshell, if you cannot make it out of your body under your own steam, you should not be projecting at that"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 time. This does not, however, mean you should not keep trying, as once the necessary skills are learned, and you have fulfilled the requirements for OBE operati ons, you will have passed the first natural barrier and will be ready to take your first steps out of your body. Physical Body's Eyes: While this may appear obvious to many people, I have had a lot of queries over this matter. The physical body's eyes must remain closed at all times during a projection attempt. (you wouldn't believe how many times I've been asked about this:) Real Time and/or Astral sight will enable by itself during or just prior to a conscious projection exit. If a projection is to o dark or the projector feels they are blind, I suggest they use the out of body energy raising techniques, as given earlier. It is also possible to create light by visualization, by visualizing a torch or lamp, etc. Many people find they simply have to ask for their sight when out of body and they get it straight away. Another way to overcome darkness is to visualize a well lit destination and use the instant travel method to project there. REM (Rapid Eye Movement) Rapid Eye Movement, common ly called the 'REM' state, often happens during an oobe attempt - often, but not always. This is a natural event triggered by the trance state when the physical body is very tired - when the physical body falls into a deeper sleep than is actually require d, but with the mind still being held awake. The REM condition signposts the ideal time to have a lucid dream, as this indicates the dream mind is becoming active. If fear or other difficulties make OOBE difficult I suggest the projector focus on having a lucid dream at this time, as this will give some type of related out of body experience which will help prepare them for a full blown conscious exit OOBE later on. At this time a 'conscious' lucid dream becomes a viable alternative to a conscious OOBE, especially if REM activity is disturbing and breaking the concentration of the projector. Keep in mind here that a lucid dream can be converted into a Real Time or astral projection if the projector focuses on and 'feels' for their body. They will then ei ther project back to their body, or near to it, and a full OOBE can continue, or is then much easier to attain. LD Note: A good way to attain a lucid dream, if lying down when the REM state hits, is for the projector to stop the OOBE attempt, staying re laxed and turning on their side (not their back) and to imagine a department store setting while allowing themselves to sink gently into sleep. If all goes well, they'll slip directly into a lucid dream with no apparent break in consciousness.

The reason for this contradiction is simply that my continuing research has l ed to an increased understanding of the energy body and how it works - with experience teaching me otherwise in this case:) After any type of energy work it is, traditionally, believed to be important to close all energy centers that have been stimulated or opened. While this idea appears to have some merit on the surface, I have come to the conclusion it is a completely illogical practice. No localized awareness action or visualized action can cause an energy center (chakra) to deactivate or close. Th is applies to any type of energy center, secondary or primary. Experience tells me that no matter how an awareness action is performed at the site of an energy center it will 'always' cause stimulation. It is a mistake to think that any awareness or visu alized action can succeed at closing or deactivating an energy center. This is a little like fanning a spark (inactive energy center) into a flame with an stimulation action (making the spark an 'active' energy center) and then trying to make that same fl ame go out by blowing up on it from a different direction. However it is done, it will continue to fan the flame. Consider this: Most popular chakra opening methods involve visualizing a small door or pair of curtains opening over the site of a chakra. Once this is done that chakra is deemed to have been 'opened'. This method is then simply reversed to 'close' that chakra at the end of the session. Once these doors have been visualized as closing, the chakras are deemed to have been 'closed'. Prim ary chakras are complex non - physical 'vortexes' of energy, each with a great many functions, about the size of the palm of your hand. If you look at just how a visualized 'little door' opening technique like this would affect a powerful energy structure l ike this, it becomes fairly obvious that a reversed action of 'closing' a simple little door would have little or no effect. It would also not affect it in the desired way. If you understand how bodily awareness and Tactile Imaging works, as per the Trea tise, it becomes clear this reasoning is somewhat faulty. Both opening and closing methods involve a visualized or bodily awareness action at the site of a major chakra. Both opening and closing actions will, therefore, each cause some degree of stimulat ion. Primary energy centers cannot be likened to simple mechanical devices that can be switched off or closed by any such visualization or awareness action. Energy centers are, I think I have shown, not simply little doorways that can be opened and shut with good intentions and a little visualization. Some people may dispute this, as energy centers are 'traditionally' supposed to be closed after use; as per popular new - age type theories and literature on this subject. Be that as it may, my logic is soun d and based on repeatable experiments, and energy centers simply 'cannot' be deactivated or 'closed' in this way. If a person thinks they have succeeded at doing this, they will find"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 this is merely a coincidence, and that the energy centers in question we re deactivating on their own anyway. In most cases, primary energy centers will begin deactivating very quickly from the moment relaxation discipline is broken, when physical body movement and normal levels of mental activity are restored. Rever sing the energy 'raising' action and taking energy down through the legs (not through primary centers) however does help reduce activity in primary energy centers. This reversed energy raising action does not involved any type of direct chakra stimulation and will reduces the amount of energy flowing into the energy body, especially through the legs. This reduces the amount of energy available to primary energy centers, thereby reducing activity in them to some extent. This does not, however, involve any focused awareness actions at the sites of primary centers. Energy centers, primary and secondary, naturally reduce their level of activity once relaxation discipline is broken, as well as when they cease to be stimulated or used. The best way to deactiv ate energy centers is to stop stimulating and using them. Energy centers will also cease activity when they become energetically exhausted. This will happen when the supporting energy body circuitry shuts down, becomes exhausted, or for some other reason becomes incapable of providing the required energy flow necessary to maintain primary energy centers in their active state. Note: if no significant continuing energy movement or activity is felt in primary energy centers, after a development session or projection attempt, they should be left alone. An attempt should be made to reduce activity 'only' if continuing chakra sensations are pronounced or become bothersome and uncomfortable. If left alone, they will naturally deactivate very quickly once rel axation discipline is broken and physical movement and activity are restored. Ways Of Reducing Primary Center Activity: 1. Reverse the energy raising action in the legs and arms alone - pushing energy back down and out of the body. 2. Stop focusing awar eness on any primary energy centers. 3. Break mental relaxation and trance and restore normal physical and mental activity. Move, stand, talk, stretch and restore full circulation and movement. 5. Curl up and go to sleep - if this is appropriate. 6. Have a substantial snack or meal."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 7.

YO - YO OOBE Technique: The whole point of any OOBE technique is to exteriorize bodily awareness outside of th e physical body to trigger the projection reflex quickly, whilst the projector remains mentally awake. This, apparently simple, awareness action can, however, be extremely difficult for most people to maintain for more than a couple of seconds. If this i s done only briefly, however, over and over and rhythmically, for long enough, it will also have the effect of triggering the projection reflex. Following is the outline of a new technique I call YOYO. I have used this myself and it seems to have almos t as many good points as the Rope technique, but most people find YOYO much easier. This method is a good alternative if you are having trouble with ROPE. This can also be used as a good preparatory exercise for an OOBE attempt. It helps 'loosen up' the projectable double, even if another technique is to be used for the actual exit. 1. Get yourself into a deeply relaxed state, or into the trance state if possible, as you normally would prepare for using an OOBE technique. 2. Pick a target on the ceili ng above your bed, or on the wall if using a chair. This can be a light fitting or picture (anything) or you can tape a small paper target up above you. 3. Stand on a chair (careful not to fall) and get the feel of what it is like to have your face up cl ose to the target. Feel the changed spatial coordinates. Feel what this new position (up next to the target) feels like from there. Feel where the floor and bed and furniture and windows and doors are now. Memorize what it 'feels' like to be in this po sition, up close to your target."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 4. Instead of using ROPE, shift your awareness out of your body and push it right up next to the target, as if target were right next to your face. Imagine and 'feel' yourself being at the target, right up close to it. H old your awareness there for one second only and then pull your point of awareness back to your body. Feel yourself move right up to the target and, briefly, feel your spatial coordinates in the room change as your bodily awareness changes location. Feel the room move around you, briefly, as you fly up to the target and back to your body. Feel the room change back to normal when you pull your center of awareness back to your body. 5. Bounce your awareness back and forth between the target and your body at roughly one - second intervals (whatever feels most natural). Try and develop a natural rhythm, in and out, in and out, and over and over. 6. When you get used to using this technique, extend your time at the target slightly, just a little bit longer. Always keep this time short enough to be comfortable and achievable so you can do it repeatedly, over and over, with ease. This takes concentration but is quite easy when you get the hang of it. 7. Keep this up and it will trigger the projection reflex just like ROPE. 8. Vary this technique as you see fit, with other OOBE techniques like ROPE, or rolling out of your body, or feeling yourself floating out of body, point shift, etc. You may, for example, trigger the projectable state, feeling vibration s, etc, using YOYO and find it easier to finish off the exit using ROPE, or by rolling out of your body, or with another favorite method. Racing Heartbeat, Disorientation & Pressure: In my opinion, disorientation and head pressure, during or after an O BE or OBE attempt, stem from forced bio - energetic development, caused by an OBE attempt. Any problems resulting from this will settle down over a couple of days. I do not advise further attempts until you feel completely normal again - as things must have time to adjust and develop in response to what has happened - as a muscle must be given time to heal and develop after being overworked and strained. While a logical observation, and partly true, the assumption that the heart chakra is not getting enough energy, and that this is causing it to race during an OBE attempt, is not entirely correct. This matter is far more complex than it appears."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 When you cease a projection causing bodily awareness action, ie, Rope, and observe the throbbing in your heart ch akra slowing, you have actually eased the pressure that was forcing your energy body to generate your projectable double. This eases the load on the heart chakra, thus slowing its activity. The heart chakra is forced to provide a lot of energy, to genera te the projectable double, during an awake induced OBE attempt. Excessive heart center activity, and all other heavy exit sensations, are 'caused' by the presence of 'awake' consciousness, which cause a plethora of bio - energetic conflicts to arise. To su pport this: think how easily you project out of body when your mind is asleep, and out of the bio - energetic equation? When asleep, you'll find you slip out with hardly a murmur from your hear chakra, feeling only a mild, brief falling sensation. At the ve ry worse this level of exit sensations will make you catch the sides of your bed, especially at times when you are drifting in and out of sleep, before actually falling asleep. When awake consciousness is present during an OBE attempt, a true 'complicatio n of bio - incarnated consciousness' arises. Your awake mind changes the whole equation, and the usual bio - energetic projection mechanism comes under a lot of unusual pressure. It finds it must work overtime to provide the energies needed to generate the p rojected double while awake consciousness is present. When awake consciousness is present during projection, the bio - energetic projection mechanism has to overcome the awake mind's conscious control over its physical body, and the 'tension' this automatic ally generates. By partly true, I mean that the heart chakra does speed up when increased energy demands are placed upon it. This can occur during an OBE, when the projected double deliberately draws more energy from its physical/etheric counterpart, whi ch is energetically maintaining its projected double via the Silver Cord. A noticeable heavier thrumming will also be felt from within the perceived chest area of the projected double when this happens, even though it does not have a chest, per se. This is especially noticeable at close range, within 20 feet (6 meters) or so, during a Real Time OBE, and eases with greater distance. But, when heart center throbbing speeds up during a conscious exit OBE attempt (which is especially noticeable during early OBE's and OBE attempts), this is a sign that awake consciousness is throwing a spanner into the works, so to speak. Apart from the 'unavoidable' presence of awake consciousness - which must be overcome through repeated OBE attempt experience (which develo ps the projection mechanism to the point where it can compensate), plus simple bio - energetic development - most of the problems this causes stem from a lack of deep physical relaxation. This is the most 'widespread' problem and general cause of this. The vast majority of would - be projectors do not attain a sufficient state of deep physical relaxation prior to OBE attempts, and then experience heavy exit sensations and problems as a result. \"No way!\" you might say, \"I'm in full trance and so 'must' be deep ly physically relaxed enough for projection to occur. Well, while an understandable assumption, think on this: it is quite possible to attain a fairly deep level of trance (usually too deep for easy OBE) while the physical body still retains sufficient p hysical tension to interfere with the projection mechanism. In a similar way, it is also possible to fall asleep while"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 still full of stress and tension. For example, I can attain a full trance state while standing and even walking - which obviously entai ls physical tension, which obviously would interfere with an OBE attempt, if I attempted one at this time. My suggestion is to read The Treatise on OBE, Version 2.00, parts 1 - 8, and then to spend at least a few weeks practicing deep physical relaxation, and trance work only. Do this 'separately' from OBE attempts, preferably at times when you are wide awake, like in the morning. This makes relaxation and trance work much harder, but has far more development benefits because of this. If after following the above advice, you still have problems, I'd consider the Mind - Split as being the culprit stopping you from 'remembering' your OBE's. If you experience vibrations or other exit sensations prior to the racing heart center sensation, it possible that you had already succeeded at projecting, but had missed the exit: meaning that after your projected double had departed, your physical/etheric aspect was continuing to attempt projection. Under this circumstance, projection is impossible, re the etheric body cannot leave its physical counterpart while a OBE is 'already' in progress. Emotion and Reentry: The emotional content of the reentry phase is 'extremely' important as it strengthens OBE memories. If the mind split is responsible, and it probably is, f or failed OBE attempts, this means your memories of existing in your physical/etheric body are not allowing your OBE memories to 'overwrite' them after reentry. The nature of the physical brain is to record only a single memory for any single time period. During an OBE, two completely separate sets of memory are present - those of the physical/etheric body and those of its projected double. The 'strongest' memory set will be the set retained, as a recallable memory, after an OBE. The memories of the phy sical/etheric body have more of an immediate impact on the physical brain, as these memories are automatically recorded, as per normal physical memory recording. In order for an OBE memory download to take place, and overwrite these memories, they have to be stronger and have more 'impact' than the resident memories. Emotion can thus be used to empower OBE memories, to give them more impact on the physical brain. It is for the above reasons that fearful or exciting, more dramatic, OBE's are more easily remembered than are the more mundane type. I remember during my early days of OBE (when I started doing it deliberately) floating near my physical body trying to work out why I seemed to be failing and losing the OBE memory most of the time. I was tryin g to OBE just about every night, but had only succeeded a few times that year. At these times, my projected double had no problem exiting my physical body. I wondered, as it was so easy, why I was not remembering more of my OBE's. Then I remembered how excited I was during and after these OBE's, and started to wonder....'hmmm, maybe emotion itself had something to do with carrying the OBE memories back into my physical body with me?' I made a successful 'emotional' reentry that night, and remembered my OBE reasoning. I have applied this reasoning ever since then, and have thus had countless"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 successful OBE's.

However, Robert Bruce, who is a metaphysical researcher providing a free service on the Net for enquirers re astral projection and energy work etc. has provided a book which justly deserves an alternative title \" The Muldoon for the Millen nium\". He has gone into great detail concerning the actual dynamics of projection and the various phenomena which have puzzled practitioners for years e.g. dual consciousness, lack of ability in controlling the out of body trip and the difficulty in reca lling astral adventures.

In my own reading, many projectors have provided fair ly abstract explanations concerning these problems which remain, alas, mostly theoretical but Robert Bruce has gone into great detail, after extensive personal experimentation since childhood, exactly how the problems inherent in the puzzling aspects conce rning these phenomena can be eradicated. In the book he devotes considerable space to his innovatory \"New Energy Ways\" which is a description of techniques, which facilitate the build up of energy, which is an essential accompaniment for astral projectio n and other psychical procedures. His description of outings to the various astral planes/sub planes and so on are fascinating and, indeed, thought provoking. I can only recommend this book very highly to those who are keen to get a thorough grounding in the development and understanding of the dynamics of this most fascinating phenomena. I believe Astral Dynamics will emerge as a classic, a worthy successor to the 20th century's \"master\" projector, Sylvan Muldoon. Michael Ross / Scotland / ema il: <Murrs22@aol.com> "}]
