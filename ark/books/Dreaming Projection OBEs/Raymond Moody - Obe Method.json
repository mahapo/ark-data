[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Dr. Raymond Moodyâ€™s Meditation Would you like to have a word with your long-d eparted mother? How about experiencing a hug from your deceased grandfather? The world's foremost expert on the near-death experience a nd the afterlife says he did just that, and you can too, simply by using a mirror and followi ng the easy guidelines offered by Dr. Raymond Moody below. Moody's technique involves gazing into a large mirror, an ancient technique to receive visions. For example, the great seer Nostradamus used this method to see into the future. Here is Dr. Moody's method: (1) Get into a serene state of mind by eliminating caffe ine and dairy products the da y before your encounter. Eat simply, such as only fruit and vegetables. (2) Go to the quietest part of your home. Leave your wristwatch and all jewelry off. Wear only loose, comfortable clothing . It is important to find a comfortable place where you can truly relax . Unplug clocks and phones in that room so as not to be disturbed . The goal is to ease the transition into an altered state of awareness. Posture is important . Sit in a comfortable chair that will support the back of your head, even if you are deeply relaxed. Place a large mirror in front of your chair and arrange it so that you can gaze into it without having to hold your eyes at an uncomfortable angle . (3) Create a mood by soothing yourself with beauty for about 15 minutes by looking or listening to works of art . Art alone is enough to induce altered states in many people. Soft music can go far to stimulate awareness. (4) Gather photographs and personal items of your departed loved one around you. Touch them and remember your loved ones fondly. It is important to imprint that person firmly in your mind. Doing so shouldn't be too difficult. A family album filled with great memories stirs up the conscious as well as the unconscious mind. Family films and videos do the same thing. Some people use articles of clothing associated with the person. Such items include fishing poles, woodworking tools, chess sets, pipes, glasses, old letters, and so on. Anything associated with that person is an effective way of bringing up memories and feelings . (5) In the twilight of the day, light a candle and place it behind you . Dim light from behind usually works the best, although you will have to experiment until you get the lighting just right. T he twilight hours is a time that seems to better inspire altered states in many people . Later, when you become more proficient, you will find that mirror gazing is possible even in bright lights. (6) The technique of mirror gazing itself is remarkably easy. Seated comfortably, relax and gaze into the clear depth of the mirror without trying to see anythin g. Some compare this to looking off into the distance. Properly relaxed, your arms will feel very heavy and the tips of your fingers will tingle as though charged slightly by electricity . This tingling feeling almost always signals the beginning of the hypnagogic state (altered consciousness) . (7) The mirror will most likely become cloudy now. Some people report an im age that resembles the sky on a cloudy day. Others say that the mirror becomes darker. Whatever the case, this change in the clarity of the mirror signals you that the visions are about to appear. (8) Do not direct the experience at first or pose particular questions when the visions appear. It is best to first watch them unfold passively. Just let the images flow . Attempting to guide the images decrease the likelihood that one will see images in the mirror . After you have become more adep t at mirror gazing, putting specific questions into your mind before entering the trance state can be very helpful, especially if your object is self- exploration or self-understanding . Attempting to direct images after they have begun will usually cause them to fade away . Why this happens Dr. Moody is not sure, but hi s guess is that conscious thought brings you out of the hypnagogic state of mind where these images occur. How long do the images last? Usually less than a minute, especi ally for those unable to stay relaxed. Some of Dr. Moody's subjects have been able to maintain images for as long as ten minutes on their first attempt. The more proficient you become at mirror gazing, the longer you will see images in the mirror.

Some may experience all the sensations of a given person, or location, without actually seeing anything. Sometimes, like Nostradamus, you may have the sensation of passing into the mirror, or the images may actually come out to be with you. Whatever the case, it will be obvious when the visi onary experience starts and when it is over. Dr. Moody recommends that you record the experience immediately after the session as you would a dream. Write it down in as much detail as possible. Careful record keeping will help you know what to expect the next time you mirror gaze. It will also show differences between session s and will eventually let you know how to get the most out of your mirror-gazing experience. Recording yo ur experiences will also help you remember them as they really were. If the visions do not occur during a session, then it is necessar y to consider some of the possible factors involved. The most common reason for failing to see anything is trying too hard . People sometimes report that the visions miraculously begin after they give up, or at least after they entertain thoughts of doing so . Distractions are another common reason that visions fail to take place. These can include outside noise and physical discomfort. Perhaps the room is too hot or too cold, or maybe it is just too noisy. Distractions also take place in the form of diet. Some people simply cannot have visionary experiences after eating a heavy meal, though a light one is recommended since it elevates your blood sugar and keeps you from focusing on your hunger. Dr. Moody also emphasizes that exercise is an important component of relaxation . Most people are far more relaxed after even gentle exercise and have lower blood pressure and a slower heart rate to prove it. If you are having difficulty relaxing, or letting your mind wander while mirror gazing, it might be due to a lack of exercise. Some people even use meditation and consider the visions an interesting by-product. "}]
