The concep t of the astral world expanded in time to ref er to what the ancients called \"ghostland ,\" a realm inhabited by etheric entities, disembodied spi r its and high ly developed angelic beings. Under nor m al circumstances the li mi tations of our fi ve physical senses ke e p us from se eing into the astral world. That is b eca use that wor l d is made u p of an energy that is invisible to us, owing to the fact that it is vibrating at a higher rate than the energy that comprises the material world. But ther e ar e ways to p e rceive it oth er than th rough direct e n try into it via astral projection. Clairvoyants and well-trained occultists have don e so all thro ugh the ages . The form er is the passive reci pient of mental impress ions, but th ese are usu a lly fleeting and only moderately revealing. If he is devel o ped enough, though, the occultist can shift from material to astral perceptio n through a conscious act of will, \"just as the operator on the ty pewriter shifts from the small letter ty pe to the capitals,\" in the words of one writer. The perceiver will look into a world that is just as real as ours. It has geography, scenery, inhabitants. There ar e ev en countries and kingdoms. The ast r al wo rld has its own natural laws. It is subject to constant change just as the physical world is. Some theoris t s writing on the subject of astral proj ection have speculated t h at the astral world is in fact a \"rationaliz ed dr eam world,\" a universe of e l emental en e r gies which we shape int o beings, people and places through our own thought processes. In other words, the astral world is a real place but we creat e its manifes t ations in our imaginations. There p r obably is some truth to this idea. Certainl y some of the sights and experience s r e ported by astral explorers sound like thought projections. Bu t at the same ti me so many people have reported the same kinds of things in the astral real m —witn ess, for instance, the testi m onies of many thousands of NDE percipient s —that we ca n reasonably conclude that it has its own independent, objective existence. Once you enter it, you can be c o nfident you will see cert ain things there. A Theosophical View The esote ric thought system known as Theosophy provi des a d e tailed description of the astral world, which it depicts as the rea lm into whic h we pass at physical death and in wh ich we spend a period of time befor e moving on to a higher sphere. Theosophists believe that it is not just disembodied spirits who l i ve in the ast r al but also, write r L e wis Spence says, \"inhabitants . . . of an alt o gether nonhuman nature—lower orders of the devas"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" or angels, an d nature-spirits or elem entals, both good and bad, such including fairies which are just beyond the powers of human vision, and the de mons pres en t to the vision of delirium tre m ens.\" The astral w o rld has seven divisions. The lowest a nd most material of these is called Avichi, a hellish environment in which souls are tortured wit h desires tha t cannot be fulfilled with out the physical body. The souls of cri minals and other depraved persons w i tness the act i vities of th eir counterpar ts on the physical realm a nd are driven to despair because they ca n no longer take part. On their side of the astral border, as one write r puts it, is a dreary \"astral atmosphere of p ool rooms, gambling halls, race track s , brothels and red-light districts\" in whi c h these mis erable souls congregate; these st ructur es exist, alas, only as a symbolic back-drop; the functions such places fulfill on the physical plane are denied the inhabitants of Avichi. The souls in Avichi do not suffer et ern ally. For mos t , the desire s that have gone so long unsatisfied die away, suffering cease s and the soul m oves up to the next astral level. Tho se few incapable of change and moral impro v ement even tually are exhausted by the strain and descend into merciful oblivion. Avichi is so meti me s co mpared to t h e Christian hell, but it is really mo re like purg a tory, because through suffering sins ca n be forgiven and put be hind one. It should be clear that rel atively few p ersons who e n ter the astr al world will experien ce Avichi. Th e great majori ty will end up in one or the other o f th e n e xt th ree divisions. (Avichi, th e lowest of them, is considered the seventh division.) The di vision you w ill end up in is dependent upon the degree of your moral development. Deeper into the Astral The sixth division of the astral world is so m u ch like the physical world that those first entering i t may not even rememb er that, biol ogic a lly and materia lly speaking, they are ill and in bed. Today you feel happier and healthier than you have ever felt. Yo u get out of bed, get dress ed and go out into the world. Out there you see familia r surroundin g s and famili ar faces—bu t soon you begin to sense that something is different. Slowly it dawns on you that this, for all its superficial rese mblance s to the world you k n ow, is in reality an other world. \"As the astral life becomes more and more familia r,\" L. W. Rogers writ es, \"he [the arri val] gets well settled into it and gradually readjusts his viewpoin t to a truer perspe c tive. As time passes he is l ess and less in touch with the affairs of the physical life.\" Yet before they move on , many people use their ti me in the ast r al to expand their know l edge of life, the universe and the many realms of being. Undist racted by the cares and concerns of t h e mundan e world, they devote their energies to t h eir own mo ra l betterment; they may also act as guides to the many thousands of perso ns who daily arrive unprepa red in th e astral worl d. Many are frightened and confused, fearing that they have not been \"saved\" an d are about to spend a n eternity o f torment for not holding t h e proper re ligious views. With the passage of time the astral body loses mo r e and more of its material substance and it"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" ascends gradually to the higher divisions. These divisions are correspon dingly removed from the physical world and in the m the landscapes take on mo re a spirit ual than an e a rthly aura. In fact here the geography is the geography of heaven: beautiful buildings, gently flowing rivers, g reen hills an d m agnificent m o untains. These things are quite real but they are in no way physical; they are t h e mental creations of the spiritual beings who dwell in this land of pure thought. At the first and highest level of the astral worl d, the souls work for no ble purposes and they are free to travel to lower realms if nec ess ary for their work. Beyond the Astral When you leave the astral world, you enter the m e nt al world, also known as the manasic plane or the devachan. It is the home of what are known in Sa n s krit as the devas, angelic beings (in the near- death literature they are called \"beings of light,\" as we already have seen.) By the time you have arrived here, you will have left behind all that remained of the lower emotions that so dominated your existence on e a rth. No w you are concer ned solely with your highest aspirations and you need no longer fear the distract ing effects of sorrow, anxiety, struggle or fear. You are now experiencin g nothing less than total bliss. In her Th e Basic Id eas of Occult Wisdom, Anna Kenne dy Winner describ es life on this plane as follows: \" . . . . people whose highest th oughts have connected th emselves with their famil i es will see around them \"living\" images of their loved ones, which will seem real and responsive to them. People who have been intere sted in philanthrop ic sche m es may construct apparently real Utopias. Scientists wil l have the op portunity to study some of the real inner laws of nature. Musici ans or artists will b e aided and t a ught by the devas who wo rk in those lines, and thus be reborn later with a great enhancement of thei r capacity. In general, an y experience which a man has had of a pure and lofty, or pur ely intellectu a l, nature will be work ed over and mentally digest ed, as it were, until he has gained from it the last possible drop of wisdom and enhanced ability. He can have n o experienc e f o r which the re is not some seed al read y planted—this is not a time for ne w beginnings, but for gathe ring together the essen ce of th e past and building it into his permanent self as a permanent part of his character.\" In due cours e , when all the concret e t h oughts and ex perienc es of the past have been refl ected on and resolved, they in turn are discarded and the soul enters the hig h est subplanes of the ma nasic plane; in Sanskrit these are r e fer r e d to as the arupa, or \"for mles s\" worl ds. By this time the soul body bears no rese mblance whatever to the physical form that once contained it. It is now a globe of living light, pulsating and radiating, sensitive to all impres sion s from all worlds. It is now prepared t o begin anew: to rei ncarnate in a physical body. The Seven Pl anes of Existence The seven pl anes of existence, in othe r words the s e ven planes that you, your spirit need s and wants to go through to become co mplete.

I will now briefly explain these seven planes which hopefully will give you a better insight into your ow n spirit. They are as follows: The Earth Pl ane (Physical) The Astral Plane The Mental Plane The Buddhic Plane The Nirvana Plane The Para Nirvana Plane The God He ad. Imagine seve n circle s completely separ ated from ea ch other, but they are within each other, from the outside circl e, to the next inner circl e, to the next i nner cir c le, t o the next inner cir c le and so on to the last inner cir c le which is t h e centr e of the circl es. T h erefor e you have seven circles within each other. The largest c i rcle or the o u tside cir c le is called th e Earth Plane. The next inner cir c le is called the Astral Plane. The next inner cir c le is called the Mental Plane. The next inner cir c le is ca lled the Buddhic Plane. The next inner circle i s called the Nirvana Plane. The next inner circle i s called the Para Nirvana Plane and the next and last inner circ le, in other words the ce ntre of all the circl es is called the God Head. (The centr e of all). We will now start with the outer circle first which is called the Earth Plane. This is the plane of low material vib r ation. This is where th e spirit in it s f i rst incarnat ion was wayward, irr esp onsible, nasty etc., and then spends the rest of its inc a rnations to becoming a perfe c ted spi r it. The next ste p up, or the next inner ci rcle (the seco nd circle) is called the As tral Plane. Now this plane is more like a stepping stone, where t h e spirit (you) is continuously stepping backwards and forwards from the Ear t h Plane to the Astral Plane for lesson s to be learnt. Then steppi ng forward into the Astral Plane for the corre ctions of those past lesso ns with the help of the Guardian Spirit and the Lords of Karma. The next ste p up, or the next inner ci rcle (the thi r d circle) is called the Men t al Plane. This is where what we the earthl y beings call, the masters and the guar dian spirits, will reside. T h ese are th e perfe c ted spi r its who have volunteere d their servi ces to the Ea rth Plane for the benefit of all human beings. The next step up, or the next inner ci rcle (th e fou r th circle) i s called the Bu ddhic Plane. Now this is the plane wher e the vibration of the spirit become s a lo t faster and more ethe re al and the sp irit’s me mor y of the earth plane now becomes dimi nished. The next ste p up, or the next inner ci rcle ( t he fift h circl e) is c a lled the Ni r vana Plane. This is th e plane of peace and tranquillity and anything to d o with the earth plane has now compl e tely"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" ceased. Th e spirit now s e nses the in c reased pull of the highe r sphe res (t he last two c i rcles), and a sense of eager anticipation now fills t h e spirit as i t awaits the other fifteen parts of itsel f which were separated eo ns ago when it spun off from the God Head. Now the spir it has arrive d at the Par a Nirvana Plane, the sixt h inner cir c l e . This is wh at is called t h e waiting room, and this i s whe re th e reunion of t h e si xteen p a rts of the o r iginal spirit ultimately t a kes place. These are the myst eries that ar e known on ly to the very higher spher es of life. Now the completed spirit has now arrived at the God Head (the very centre of the circle s ). This is the ultimate of the original s p irit and this is the co mpl e te reunion of all energy and light of the sixteen parts of your original spir it. In other words, the evolution of the sixteen parts has now been completed. But this my friend is not what you may th ink is the end. It is definitely not. It has now become th e beginning again. If I may explain a little further, be cause the si xte e n parts have now become one and are now spinning faster and faster within the god head, fast er and faster only to be spun off yet again into sixteen parts again, yes sixteen parts, sixteen individual spirits to start to learn all over again. These sixt een parts, these sixteen spirits, again wil l eventually meet and become as one. But only when all less ons of those sixteen spirit s have been learned and understood. Because for spirit there is a ne ver ending. Because lif e is never endi ng. You must always remembe r this one special thing, and th at is. You ar e spirit and spirit is you. You are an i ndividual an d you are, so m e one very, very special. Heaven & Hell Heaven and hell are reall y just the astral plane, sep arated by vibrational fr equencies. You can say earth is also \"hell\" because it's so low vibrationa lly, along with the lower astr al realms, and the higher astral planes are \"heaven\" because they vibrat e at a very fine rate and are quite gorgeous. But the astral has only 7 l e vels and then you st art getting into the higher planes of existe nce (mental, buddhic, etc.) which is where the \"coll ect ive unconscious\" or \"universal mind\" might exist. Everyone uses diffe rent words f o r these plan es of existenc e (heaven, hell, collective unconscious, etc.) Spirits live in the astral realm , and when you leave the astral realm to the higher realms, you are \"c onsciousness \" and have no vehicle like the physical body or astral form although you can elect to appear in one (Robert Monroe talked about how he would see a blaz e of energy and that energy would tune itself down and appear as a hum an). You are sim p ly Conscious energy at that point. All th ings are vi brations, whether light or sound, so the physical realm is just different vib r ations (coarser) then the astral, the mental and so forth. We are here to learn and lo ve, and as w e do, our vib r ations raise, which is wh en you can st art to tap int o the different pla n es of existe nce. The more I meditate and astral project, the wi der my fr eq uencies become whic h means that I can go to higher planes of existence. When I proj ect, I can pic k up on radio and tv frequenci es, and can sometimes 'see' or 'hear' what some other people cannot. When you die, y o u m i grate to the portion of t h e astral plane that you a re in tune with vibration a lly (hence the whole concept of \"bad\" peo p le go to hell and \"g ood\" people go to heaven). If you saw the higher astral planes, you would kn ow why it's confused for \"heaven\" for it is simply beyond words. The astral realm is also known as the \"em o tional\" realm be cause it react s t o our thoughts. Not only is it an astral counterpart to the ph ysical world (so the astral counterpart of a chair would exist in the astral), b u t it is also what we \"think\" about so a lot of m e ntal \"d ebris\" exists in the astral which is why everyone gets so confused while project ing. This is not all levels though. The"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" higher levels don't seem t o have the as tral thought matter that t h e lower and mid levels d o (I know, because I've se en t h em). People think th at they are not astral projecti n g (despite the unmistakable separation process) b e c a use they see ob jects in the astral that do not necessarily exist in the physical, so they question this reality. The fact is, they ARE astr al projecting, and the astral can seem quite ju mbled at times. And we h u ma ns are n o t the only e n tities that exist in the astral as well... The astral is not just a play land for sleeping or projecting humans. It can be structu red like physical life, where peopl e go to classes, or ev en \"work\" on projects of their choice. Fears People who are inexperienced about Astral Projecti on tend to have m a ny f e ars about it. This is normal. The Astral Planes to the uninitiated is an u nknown and humans tend to be fearful of anything n o t in their normal sphere of daily li ving. It is especia lly frightening to those w h o experienc e astral projecti o n spontane ously and wi th no control . Weird things happen, weird feelings or sounds and tou c hes; even while st ill in the body whi c h can unnerve even \"he-man\" types becaus e they have nothing in the i r past to referen ce this n e w experi enc e to. For those who want to learn and activate their tr ai ning, their first experi ence can still be a bit frightening since this is n o t an everyday occurrenc e . Howeve r, it is rare for anyone, whether new or an old pro, to experience anything neg a tive or ha r m ful from the Astral Planes. Som e wo uld say it's the state of mind that you project fro m yourself w h en entering the Astral P l anes. If you enter with uncondition al love in your heart, have in your mi nd that things will go well and that you will have a wonderful spiritual growing experience, then this is exactly what will hap p en. Nothing can harm you since you are a child of the light. This is true for mo st people. Some never have had a single problem on the Astral Planes. And those that DO have problems, the experienc e most ly stems fro m not knowing what is going on, that others are also out and about and can come visit you whether they are conscious in doing so or not (and m ay or m ay not h ave a physic a l body at th is particular tim e ), or a teacher guid e is awaiting you to acknowledge their presen ce. Th ey'll come u p to touch or speak to the people they are visiting for whatever reason, and without meaning too, scare the heck out of them. Or a sp iri t guide, familiar, or totem animal gets overjoyed that their mist ress or mast er is awaken in g spiritually with conscious awarene ss, and accidentally in their enth usiasm over w helm th eir friend and frighten them. So many things can happen and for so many different r e asons. The best t h ing to do when confronted with somethi n g you are not sure of, but KNOW it' s out of the ordinary, is to stay calm above all els e . Write it all down as so on as yo u ca n. Use your com m o n sense once you h ave your fea r in check to deduce what may or may not be happe ni ng. Go to s e veral sourc es of books, sites, and people for further infor m ation. But again, use commo n sense in accepting anything as gold from the lips or text of anyone. What may be right and true for one pers on may not neces sarily be right and true for you. And most importantly, listen to that inner voice. You will rarely if ever be wrong. Rare is the case of a true full blown astral attack from some negative person or en tity. However, even if it was signaling something negative, you still have power and control at all times. The trick is to keep calm and do n o t f eed it fear or anger. Negative em ot ions give anythi ng negative power. Stay calm and KNOW that you are in co ntrol at all ti m es. You are a child of the light and because of this wonderful gift you AR E protected.

This ca n not be taken advantage of or taken away from you by anyone. Here is your power. Things you can do to avoid problems are to always make protective circl es around you before attempting astral travel. Secondly, and most impo rtantly... . psychic hygiene. If you are a clean happy person nothing negative would even want t o get near you. Make it a habit to clean your aura before and after astral projection. Here ar e t w o methods: Outside met h od: to cleanse, go outside, cast a simple circl e and ground yourself fro m your root chakra to Mother Earth. Do a rhythm breathing [i .e. breath in on a five count, hold for three heartbeats, e x pel on a five count, hold for three he artbeats]. Ce nter yourself . Hear nothing but your heartbeat.

Strange Things A reader just asked me if I've ever seen dragons, mermaids, faeries, unicorns or othe r fantasy creatur es, and if so, what wer e they like. All right! I'm coming out of the closet on this one! I've seen gnomes on the subtle planes ! I withheld this bit of info for fear of being labeled a pure nut, but there's a side to this story that puts it into the credibl e department. Now, while I ' ve seen gnomes, I have not seen any of the others listed above, howe ver, I imagine some m ay exist. Who knows, maybe some myths wer e started beca use someone \"dreamed\" t h em (a disguised projecti o n) and th ou ght it would make for an interesting st ory. Her e is the f a scinating tale of how I saw these gn omes. I d ecide d to do some remote vie w ing for the lottery numbers one after n oon. I did my usual set -up of going to bed, getting comfortable, and then started the p r ocess of moving from beta to theta. A b out 40 or so minutes into it, I felt I had reached the theta state (body total l y asleep, hy pnagog ic im agery starting to form ). This is when I started to probe for the lottery number s . As my third eye open ed up, what I got instead were t w o little gnomes! They both looked male and had the proverbial appe arance of gnomes (dre ssed in rusti c clothing, ver y earthy surro undings, etc.) What was ra ther odd is that one of t h em was drinking out of a tea cup! As the one gnome sippe d his tea, he said to me (in an accent that sounded a bi t Irish), \"Look at the lott ery for seven days and it will be like looking at paper.\" Now, while this tale sounds ridiculous, and you are prob ably rolling your eyes, I did exactly what the gnome told me to do. For the next seven days I we nt to Safeway and as ked to see th e lottery numbers. On the seventh day, an am az ing thing happened."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" It was a wee k end mornin g and I decided to u se my \"My Favorite Technique\" a projection.

I of course went to search for the lottery numbers, thinking I had t o \"go someplace.\" Well, one projectio n was futile, and after awhile I came back. But for some r e as on my body rem ained in an optim a l state and I wa s able to leav e over and ove r. On the sev enth exit I grew frust r ate d and demanded to see th e lottery number s (he n ce the sour ce for my Wi ll article.)An d as I pushed out the force of my will , up popped the daily lottery number s, as clear as the gnome said it would be. Of course the r e s t is written dow n under my lottery article . So I do beli eve I really did see gnomes. But wh y they chose to appear to me and h e lp me, I do not know. I can only sa y on e thing, and that is that I' ve had a very strong attachment to earth and he r creatur es since I can r e c a ll. Even in my drea ms I have draw n \"other rea lm\" tarot ca rds depi cting a nature goddess. So pe rh aps there is some affinity even wit h her subtle realm cr ea tures (natur e is nature).

The Higher Planes You can alm o st think of t h e higher plane as what existed prior to the Big Bang. What w a s before everything you see around you? Befor e man, planet s, solar systems... and even light... was just conscious en ergy. It was formless, no boundaries, an incomprehensionable state of oneness. Here yo u have what we now call the higher plane. But then it wasn’t the higher plane because the re was no lower plane to give it the word “higher”. It ju st was the Onen es s of God. Then the Big Bang happens.. It did explode out, but it di dn’t just explode out physically, it exp l oded out in so many layers we haven’t a clue. From this, w e now have th e mental pl ane, the ethe ric, the astra l , parallel and holographic universes, and even tually the physical. This is th e Creator’s Divine Will now in action. So to go back to the “higher plane” is to go back to The Source. The S o urce before it created ego, separation, and all the experien c es th at appears to be outside of itself."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" There ar e a lot of planes wedged in be tween Th e Sou rce (relati v ely speaking as The Source is part of everything).

The heaven used by many religions is meant to control the masses. How el se can we get people to kill when specifi cally “Thou shalt not kill”? We rewar d them with harems in th e a fterlife, h o norable placement next to God, riches and so forth. From there, we can get them to k ill through hari- k ari, Holy Wars, stoning, burnings, and the like. Burning at the cross sou nds like ancien t history, but “holy me n” were doing this up until recently, and stoning is still commonpl ace in many countries. Jesus was able to perform mi racl es. With all his powers, why did he not just kill his adversary? Sounds easy enough to me. A man wh o can miraculous ly heal al so has the potential to kill . But he chose not to. He knew wh at I know, and that yo u may know. Killing doesn’t get you b a ck to The Source. It is no exaggeration when it was stated that to get to heaven (The Source) is as hard as shoving a camel through the eye of a needle. And you know why the Source is neve r dangled as a carrot to the populace, like the other mid planes are? A real Master woul d have you set your sights higher than the astral plane or where you think the “pearly gates” are. The Source can n ot be used as a carrot because the ego is left behind. This is the greatest f e ar to most people on earth. Fev erish r e aders beg me to assure them that they would like to astral project (or ascend) as long as they don ’t lose their identity (ego). To most people, this is a punishmen t , not a reward. So you h ave to assure them that when they die, they will still be them and still enjoy things they enjoy here when times are optimal. The Source i s energy. When you experience the sou rce, you are part of everything. You have no division, no separation, and no ego. You are size- le ss and without real descr iption. You permeate all matter, on all planes. You then experience what was intended, Divine Will, at its source. There are n o words, no vision, just pure conscious Divine energ y. What do you do there? You do what Divine Will does: Create and experience. You then descend agai n into your creation and experience it. Over and over we create and experience our Div i ne Will.

Dreami ng, both lucid and otherwise, has only provided sporadic accura te inform ation. Wh en I find myself \"dreaming\" and then take control of the dream ( w hich is lucid dreaming) I c a n quite lucidly seek and see very cl ear lottery number s , but they are usually not real, and when they have been real, I can only seem to reme m ber th e last digit. What I do find true, howev er, for \"se e ing the future\" while dr eaming is that what I see of the future is \"symbolic\" or very clos e to the fact. When I say symbolic, I mean, for example, I asked to see th e Sunday paper for the n e xt day, and what I saw was a men's football spor ts team, wea r ing blue. But on the ac tual Sunday paper the next day, it was a women's socce r team (and they were wearing b l ue). While not e xact, symbolically, it wa s accurate (sports team wearing blue). This probably would w o rk for horse races b eca use you could ask for the winning colors. I also once dreamed t h at my boss was packing up a truck at our work and I cried because I kn ew he was le aving and I would miss h i m dearly. The next day his credit ca rd and entry card keys wer e in his out basket and he had been fired. D reams ca n be both symbolic and actual. Sometimes d reams can be confused with as t r al projection. I once saw with absolute clarity snow on our backyard tree, but I didn't know it was going to snow that night. When I got up the next morning, the same tr ee, b a re the night before, was la den with a few inches of white fluffy snow the next m o rning. This was probably an i n voluntary a s tral projection and n o t a dream .

D r . Slate wrote in his book, \"Astral Projection and Psychic Empowerment, \"A study conducted in ou r laborat o ry to investi gate ESP during the out- of-body state found signif icant improvement s in tel e pathy, precognition, and clairvoyance when compared to previous ESP performan ce. On avera ge, the accur a cy of ALL forms of ESP improved around 50% during the out-of-body st ate. I also found several pages on the topi c of time tra v el in Dr. Bruce Goldberg's book, Ast r al Voyages. He states, \"It is relatively simple to traverse ti me wh ile on the astral plane. All one needs to do is focus on a specified period of time in the \"past\" or \"future\" , and he or she will be instantaneously transported there.\" On e technique he recommend s for shorter trips is to imagine a clock face with its hands rapidly turning forward or backward."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" Note: The whole tim e travel co ncept can drive a perso n bu ggy.

This is a very unpredictable science.\" Peggy Chapter 2 The Ast r al Plane Scenery First of all, t h en, it must be understood that the ast r al plane has seven subdivisions, each of which has its corre sponding degree of materiality and its co r responding condition of matter. Alth ough the poverty of physical language forces us to speak of these subpl anes as higher and lower, we must no t fall into the mistake of thinking of the m (or ind eed of the greater planes of which they are only subdivisions) as separate localities in space - as ly in g above one another like shelves of a book-case or outside one another like the coats of an onion. It m u st be understood that th e matter of each plane or subplane interpenet rates that of the plane or subplane below it, so that here at the surface of the earth all exist toge ther in the same spac e, although it is tr ue that the higher varieties of matter extend further away from the ph ysical earth than the lower."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" So when we speak of a man as rising f r om one plane or subplane to anothe r, we do not think of him as neces sarily moving in space at all, but rather as tr ansferring his consciousn ess fro m one level to another - gradually becoming unresp onsive to the vi brations of one order of matter, and beginning instead to answer to those of a higher and more ref in ed order; s o that one w o rld with its scene r y and inhabitants seems to fade slowly away from his vie w , while another world of a more elev ated character dawns upon him in its ste a d. Yet there is a point of view from w h ich there is a certain justification for the use of the terms \"higher\" and \"lower\", and fo r the comparison of the pl anes and subplanes to concentric s h ells. Matter of all the subplanes is to be found here on the surface o f the earth, but the astral plane is much larger than the physical, and extends some th ousands of miles above its surface. T h e law cf gravitation operates on astral matter, and if it w ere possible for it to be left entirely undisturbed it would probably settle into concentric shells. But th e earth is in perpetual motion, both of rotation and revolution, and all kinds of influences and forces are continually rushing about, so this ideal condition of rest is neve r attained, and there is mu ch inter m ingling. Nevertheless it r e m ains true that the higher we rise th e less of the denser matte r do we find. We have a fair analogy on the physical plane. Earth, water and air - the solid, the liquid and th e gaseous - all exist here on the surface but broadly speaking it is true to say the solid matter lies lowest, the liquid next t o it, and t h e gaseous matter higher still. Water and air inte rpenetrat e the earth to a small extent ; water also rises in the air in the shape of clouds, but only to a limited hei g ht; solid matter may be t h rown up into the air by violent co nvulsions, as in the great eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 , when the volcanic dust reached the height of seventeen miles, and took three years to settle down again; but it does settle down eventually, just as the water dra w n up into th e air by evaporation returns to us as rain. The higher we ris e the mor e r a refied does the air become ; and the same is tru e with regard to astral matter. Th e dimensions o f our astral world are co nsiderable, and we are able to deter m i n e them with some a pproach to accuracy fro m the fact th at our astral world touches that of the m oon at perigee, but does not reach it at apogee; but naturally the contact is confined to the highest type of astral matter. Returning to the consideration of thes e subplanes, and numberi ng them from the highest and least material downwards, we find that the y naturally fall into three classes, divisions 1, 2 and 3 forming one such class, and 4, 5 and 6 another, while the sevent h and lowest of all stands alone. The differenc e be tween the matter of one of these class es and the next would be commensura ble with that between a solid and a liquid, while the differen ce between the matter of the subdivisions of a class would rather rese mble th at between t w o kinds of solid , such as, say, steel and sand. Putting aside for the m o ment the seventh, we m ay say that divisions 4, 5 and 6 of the astral plane have for their background the physical world in which we live, and all its familiar accessories. Life on the sixth division is not unlike our ordinary life on this ea rth, minus the physical body and its necessitie s ; whil e as it ascends through the fifth and fourth division s it become s le ss and less material, and is more and more withd r awn from our lower worl d and its interests. The sc enery of these lowe r divisions, then, is that of the earth as we know it; but in reality it is also much mo re: for when we look at it from this different standpoint, with the assistance of the astral sense s, even purely physical objects present quit e a different appearance. As has already been mentioned, one whose eye s are fully opened se es the m , not as usual from one point of view, but from all sides at once - an idea in itself sufficiently confusin g. When we add to this that every particle in the interior of a solid body is as fully and clearly visi ble as those on the outside, it will be compreh ended that under such conditions even the most fa milia r objects may at first be totally"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" unrecogni z able. Yet a moment's consideration will show that such vision approximates much mo re closely to true perc eption than does physical sight. Looked at o n the astral plane, for exam ple, the sides of a glass cube woul d all appear equal, as th ey really are, while on th e physical plane we se e the further sid e in perspective - that is, it appears sm a ller than the nearer sid e , which is a mere illusion. It is this characteris t ic of astral vision which has le d some writ e rs to describ e it as sight in the fourth dimension - a suggestive and expressi ve phrase. In addition to these possi ble source s of error, matt ers are fu rth er compli cated by the fact that this higher sight cogniz es forms of matter which, while still purely physical, arc nevertheless invisible under ordinary conditions. Such, for example, are the particle s composing the atmosphere, all the various em anations which are always being given ou t by everything that has life, and als o four grades of a still finer order of physical matter whi c h, for want of more disti n ctive names, are usually described as ethe ric. The latte r form a kind of system by themselve s , freely interpenet rating all other physical matter; and the investigation of their vibrations and th e manner in which various higher forces affe ct them would in itself const i tute a vast field of deeply interesting st udy for any man of scien ce who posse ssed the r e q u isite sight for its examination. Even when our im agination has fully grasped all th at is comprehended in what has already been said, we do not yet understand half the complexity of the problem; for besid es all these n e w forms of physical matter we h ave to deal w i th the still more nu merous and perplexing subdi visions of astral matter. We must n o te first that every mate ri al object, every particle e v en, has its astral counterpart; and this counterpart is it self not a si mple body, bu t is usually extremely complex, being composed of various kinds of astral matter. I n addition to this each living creature is surrounded with an atmosphere of its own, usually called its aura, and in t h e case of human beings this aura forms of itself a fascinating branch of study. It i s seen as an oval [ ovoid] mass of luminous mi st of highly c o mplex struc t ure, a nd from its shape has someti mes been calle d the auric egg. Theosophical readers will hear with pleasure that e v en at the early stage of his developme n t at which the pupil begins to acquire this fuller s i ght, he is able to assure himself by dir ect observation of the accuracy of the teaching give n th rough our gr eat founder, Madam e Blavatsky, on the subject o f some at least of the \"seven princi ples of man\". In regarding his fellow-man he no longer sees o n ly his outer appearance; almost exactly coextensive with that physical body he clearly distinguishes the etheri c double; while the vitality ( c alled in San s krit prana) is also obvi ous as it is absorbed and speciali z ed , as it circulates in rosy light through o ut the body, and as it eventually radiates from the health y person in its altered for m . Most brilliant and most easily seen of all, perhaps, though belonging to a more refined o r der of matt er - the astral - is that part of the aura which exp ress es by its vivid and everchanging flashes of colour the different desire s whic h sweep acro ss the man's mi nd from moment to moment. Thi s is the true astral body. Behind that, and consisting of a finer grade of m a tter again - th at of the for m -levels of the m e ntal plane - lies the m e ntal body or aura of the lower mind, whose colours, changing o n ly by slow degrees as th e man lives his life, show the trend of his thoughts and the disposition and character of his personality. Still higher and infinitely more beauti ful, where at all clearly developed, is the living light of the causal body, the vehicle of the higher se lf, which shows the st age of development of the real ego in it s passage from birth to birth. But to see these the pupil must have developed the vision of the leve ls to which they belong. It will save the student muc h trouble if he learns at once to re gard these aur a s not as mere e m anations, but as the actual manifestation of the ego on their resp ective plan es - if he understands that this is that ego which is the real man, not the various bodies wh ich on the lower planes rep res en t him."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" So long as th e reincarnati ng ego remains upon the plane which is his true home in the formless levels, the vehicle which he inhabits is the causal body, but w h en he descends into the form-level he must, in order to be able to function upon them , clothe hims elf in their matter; and the matter that he thus attracts to himsel f furnishes h i s mind- body. Similarly, descending i n to the astral plane he forms his astral or desire-bo dy out of its matter, though still retaining all the other bodies, and on his still further descen t to this low est plane of all the physical body is for m ed according to the etheri c mould supplied by the Lords of Karma. Fuller accounts of these auras will be found in my book Man, Visible and Invisible, but enough has been said here to show that as they all oc cupy the same spac e, the finer int e r p enetrating the grosser, it needs care f u l study and much practi ce to enable the neophyte to distingu ish clearly at a glance the one from the other. Neverth e les s the human aura, or more usually some one part of it only, is not infrequently one of t h e first purely astral objects seen by the untrained , though in such a case its indications are naturally likely to be mis understood. Though the astral aura f r om the brilliancy of its fl ashes of colour may often be more con s picuous, the nerve-eth er and the etheric double are really of a much dens er order of matter, being w i thin the limits of the physical plane, though invisible to ordinary sight. If we e xamine with psychic faculty the body of a newly-born child, we shall find it permeated not only b y astral matter of every degre e of density, but also by the several gra d es of etheri c matter. If we take the t r ouble to trace these inne r bodies backwards to their origin, we fi nd that it is of the latter that the ether i c double - the mould upon which the physical body i s built up - is formed by the agents of the Lords of Karma; while t h e astral matter has been gathered together by the desc ending ego, not consciously, but automatically, as he passes throug h the astral plane. (See Manual No. IV, p44) Into the composition of the etheri c double must en ter somethin g of all the different grade s of etheri c matt er; but the p r oportions may vary greatly, and are deter m ined by several factors, such a s the race, sub - race, and type of a man, as well as by his individual karma. When it is remembered that these four subdivisions of ma tter are made up of numerous combinations, which, in their turn, form aggregations that ent er i n to the composition of the \"atom\" of the so called \"element\" of the chemist, it wil l be seen that this second principle of man is highly complex, and the numbe r of its possible variati on s practically infinite. So t h at, however complicated and unusual a man's karma may be, those in whose province such work falls are able to give a m o uld in accordance with which a bod y exactly suiting it can be formed. But for information upon this vast subject of karma the previous manual should b e consulted. One other point deserves mention in connection with the appear ance of physical matter when looked at from the astral plane, and that is that the higher visi on, when fully developed, possesses the powe r of magnifying at will the minutest physical particle to any desired size, as though by a microscope, though its m agnifyin g po wer is enormously grea ter than that of any microsc ope ever ma de or ever likely to be made. Th e hypothetical molecul es and atoms postulated by scienc e are v i sible realities to t h e occult stu d ent, though the latter re cogniz e s the m as much more co mple x in their nature than the scientifi c man has yet discovered t h em to be. Here again is a vast field of study of absorbing intere st to which a whole volume might readily be devoted; and a scientific i n vestigator who should acquire this astral sight in perfectio n, would not only find his experiments with ordinary and known phenomena immensely facilit ated, but would also see stretching bef o re him entirely new vistas of kno wledge needing m o re than a lifetim e for their thorough exam in ation. For exam ple, one curious and beautif u l novelty br ought to h i s notice by the developm ent of this vision would be the existe nce of other and en tirely different col o urs beyond the limits of the ordinarily visible spect ru m, the infra- red and ul tra-violet rays which scien c e has discovered by other means being plainly perceptibl e to astral si ght. We must n o t, however, allow ourselves to follow these fascinating bye-paths, but must resume our endeavour to give a general idea of the appearance of the astral plane. It will by this ti me be obvious t h at though , as above stat ed, the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" ordinary obj ects of the p h ysical world form the b a ckground t o life on certain levels of t h e astral plane, yet so much mo re i s seen of thei r real appe arance and characteristi cs that the general effect differs wid e l y from that with which we are famili ar . For the sake of illustration take a rock as an example of the simple r cl ass of objects. When regar ded with trained sight it is no mere in ert mas s of stone. First of all, the whole of the physical matter of the roc k is seen, ins t ead of a sm all part of it; secondly, the vibrations of its physical particles are p e r ceptible; thir dly, it is seen to possess an astral counterpart composed of various grad es of astral m a tter, whose particles are also in constant motion; fourthly, the Universal Di vine Life is c l early to be seen working in it as it works in the w h ole creation, though naturally its manifestations differ gre a tly at su ccessive stages of its descent i n to matter, and for the sake of convenience e a ch stage has its own na me. We reco gniz e it fir s t in the three e l emental kingdoms; when it enters the mine ral kingdom we call it the mi neral monad; in the vegetable kingdom it is describ e d as the vegetable monad, an d so on. So far as we know, there is n o such thing as \"de a d\" m a tter. In addition t o all this an aura will be seen surr ounding it, though this is much less exten d ed and varied than in the case of the higher kingdoms; a nd its appropriate elemental inhabitants may be seen - though these should more prop erly be desc r i bed as gnomes, a variet y of nature-spirit. This is not the place to treat fully the subject of the I ndwelling Life; further explan ations will b e found in Man, Visible and Invisiblend other Th eosophical works. Also se e a later chapter of this book. In the case of the vegetable, animal, and hu man kingdo ms, the co mplications are naturally much mo re numerous. It may be objected by some read ers that no such complexities as these are describ e d by most of the psychics wh o occasionally catch glimpses of the astral world, nor are they reported at s e ances by the entities tha t manifest th ere; but w e c a n readily ac count for this. Few untrained persons on that plane, whether living or dead, see things as they really are until after long experience; even those who do see fully are o ften too daz e d and confused to understand or reme m ber; a nd among the small mino rity who both see and re me mbe r ther e are hardly any who can translate the recollection into language on our lo w er plane. Many untrained psychics nev er examine their visions scientifically at all; they just obtain an impre ssion which may be quite corre ct , but may als o be half fals e, or even w h olly misleading. All the more probable does the latter hypothesis b ecome when we take into consideration the frequent tri c ks played by sportive denizens of th e other world, against which the untrained person is usually absolutely defe nceles s. It must also be reme m be red t h at the regular inhabitant of the astral plane is under ordinary circumstances cons ciou s only of the objects of that plane, physical matter being to him as entirely invisible as is astr al matter to the majority of mankind. Since, as before re ma rked, every physical object has its as tral counterpart, which is visible to him, it may be thought that the distinction is trivial, yet it is an essential part of the symmetri cal conception of the subject. I f , however, an astral entity consta ntly works through a medium, these finer astral sense s may gradually be s o coarsened as to beco me insensible to the higher grades of matter on their own plane, and to include in their purview t h e physical world as we see it instead ; but only the trained visitor from t h is life, who is fully conscious on both planes, can depend upon seeing both clearly and simultaneously. Be it understood, th en, that the complexit y exists, and that only when it is fully perceived and scientifically unravell ed is there p erfe c t se curit y against deception or m i stake. For the seventh or lowest subdivision of the astral plane also, this physical world of our s may be said to be the background, though what is seen is only a distorted and partial view of it, si nce all that i s light and good and beauti ful seems invisible.

I do not mean by this that the subplane is wholly im aginary - t h at it has no objective existence. It lies partly on the surface of the earth, and pa rtly (perhaps mos t ly) beneath that surface, interpenet rating the solid crust.

Most students fi nd the investigation of this section an extremely unpleasant task, for there appear s to be a sense of density and gross materiality about it which is indescribably loathsom e to the liberated astral bod y , causing it the feeling of pushing its way through some black, viscous fluid, while the inhabitants a nd influences encountered the re a re also usually exceedingly objectionable. The first, second and thir d subdivisions, though occupying the same space, yet give the impre ssion of being much further r e moved from this physical world, and cor respondingly less material. En tities inhabiting these levels lose sight of the earth and its belongings; they are usually deeply self-a bsorbed, and to a large extent crea t e their own surroundings, t h ough these are sufficiently objective to be perceptible to other entiti es and also to clairvoya n t vision. This region is the \"summerlan d\" of which we hear so much at spiritualistic seances, and those who descen d from and describe it no doubt speak the truth as far as their knowledge extends.

There have been various names used which ra nge from \"The Old Knowle dge\", \"The Hidden Understandi ng\" to the \"Wisdom Reli gion\"; all refer to the same body of information. When this knowledge is first approached it is somewhat diffi cult to understand and pr esents quite a challenge to established c o ncepts and ideas.

Thi s energy does not come from the higher astral planes and relates to energies that are no longe r of use to the human kingdom. They will be an extremely rare quality of future endeavour when their restrictions are properly com p rehended. Wo rking with such energy in this period is re ally a sign of laz i ne s s and its use of no benefit and only serves to confuse people. Astral plane energy can be seen in o u r conscious outlook. When we us e t h e lower en e r gies, desi re and personal need pr ed ominate, occ a sionally resulting in actions that could be regar ded as mor e animalistic than human. This is frequ e ntly seen in mob or crow d activities where th ese energies have been stirred into activity. This approach is not ne w to those people who utilise such ene r g ies for their own gain. When the u pper range of astral ene r gies have b e gun to be used, per s onal desire and emotiona l instability give way to an increasing awareness of the activities of Love. The need then b ecomes one of aspiration and the person begins to atte mpt to make this Gre a t energy a reality. This is se en in cons ciousness as th e re cognitio n and re sponse to othe rs with comp assion, unity, understanding, brotherhood and all the other ac tivities of applied Love. Such ene r gy that can be found on the upper sub planes of the astral plane when correctly used stimulate the heart of the human kingdom.

In this way a thou ght form beco mes essentially independent of human input and now having very powerful energy assoc i ated with it can easily effect some one having little emotional or desire contr o l with whom it comes in contact. For m o st people, though t form s on the astral plan e which prod uce difficulty are desc ribe d as astral glam our and by our intell igent daily a c tivities of co nstructive r e gard for each other they are gradually dissipated. However thought forms produced by many millions of men and women over long lengths of time exist on the lower astral sub planes and have strong ener gies associated with them. They have become capable of existence without the need for human input. They occasionally appear in human consciousnes s wher e ther e is damage to the cord of energy from the soul to ma n caused by some form of mental we akness whic h is often in the use of drugs.

Psychic ene r gy is the radiated energy from the astr al plane and should never be conf used with the energy of the soul. When we sl e e p at night, the activities of co nsciousness are r e m oved from the brain and become centred in the astral body . Although m o st of us are unaware of activity when we return t o daily consciousnes s, during sleep there is a constant process oc currin g which could be describ e d as teaching. Many important developmen ts in our growth begin o n the astral plane and on ly filter back into waking consciousnes s as drea ms, words, pictu res or thoughts which if not written down soon become lost i n daily n o ise. Particularly in this time of change, it is worthwhile to keep some form of record of this activity and make an effort to consider what has been retaine d. The Brothers of Light actively work on the astral plane and when we approach sleep with t h is awareness a nd a momen t s quiet focusing, much c a n be achieved. One of the p u rposes of p r ayer before sleeping is t o assist the astral consci ousness in f o cusing in a particular way which improves the opport unity of constructiv e development. The final ap proach to the astral plan e in this extrem ely brief regard is from th e point of view we call death. Many races past and present have a reasonably good und erstanding of this activity which effect s us all, but Western thought, so proud of i t s sophist ication, has yet t o develop an intelligent approach and awareness. Perhaps we believe to o strongly that \"ignorance is bliss\" Death needs to be far more se riously considered, not only from how it effe cts those wh o suffer fro m the grief of lost contact based on great friendship and love, but also how we can assist those people who are approaching thi s stage of Life. This do es not refer to the intelligent efforts achieved by medical assis t ance during this time.

Essentially, it is an activity associated with the withdrawal of soul consciousness fro m the body of form or hu man and its eventual retur n to the soul . That aspect of conscious energy whic h had been absent, once more be comes part of the soul . Death to man is birth to the soul . This withdra w al of conscious energy begins in the physical bod y of man, no rmally commencing whe n the energy t h at the soul was seeking to develop ha s been completed to some degr ee. T h is energy, which is our consciousnes s, is extracte d from the b r ain at the point of finial soul activity in the physical body. All the me mories store d are re moved in the last few se conds although at this point time has cea sed to be significant and the activity unfolds quite slowly. Soul consciousnes s after this has been completed is n o longer active in the bod y , all th at is l e ft is the physical shell. For the majority of peopl e , consciousn ess begi ns again in a worl d not unlike that which had rec ently bee n experienc e d , but one where the phy sical laws are quite differ e nt. The rather desperate an d chaotic aspects of the pr evious life no longer exist and there is what could be best describ e d as peace. Frequ e ntly called heaven, this is the astral plane being experienc e d by the astral body of each perso n, and for most this is on either the 4t h or 5th sub plane. Soul consciousness, still expressed th rough men and women co ntinues on the astral plane and life goes on, even though there is no longe r contact wit h the dense planes of physical matter . Activities of conscious development continue but without the conf usion or distractions found previously. Time h a s no relationship on this p l ane. Eventually, when all aspects of astral plane consci ousness have been explored and development to the level being s o ught by the soul has b een reached, a ttention is then withd r awn from th e astral form body and re-focused in the mental plane. From th e perceptions of man this appears as the recognition of the individual consciousness being a part of all consciousnes s. Man stands on the top of the mountain a nd sees w i thin the light the Light within. This lessor c o nsciousness then beco mes a part of the collective consci ousnes s of the soul body. This is the eterna l aspect of e a ch of us. C y cles pass and eventually the soul s e eks expr essi on once mor e and man is born. What remai ns on the astral plane after the soul ha s extracted its conscious n ess is the as tral shell body, n o t un like the physical body left behind in an earlier per i od. This shell body retains some degree of re s i dual consciousness as it d i ssipates to become part of the collecti v e astral plane energy. Unfortunately this natural process is o ften haltered creating various degrees of damage by contact through physical plane mediums. Trance mediums do establish astral plane contact but their ene r gy very often feeds an astral shell body giving it lif e long after the soul has departed.

As w e d e vel o p the use o f the mind a nd learn to f o cus this en ergy with st rength, the human kingdom will find the fear and confusion previous ly associated with death begins to fade. With the successful focus on the mental plane this Light bums away all illusion. The Divi n e Spark grows and the conscious ene r gy of Love from the soul fuels the Fire. THE PL ANE OF MIND Every perso n is master o f their own wisdom. Understandi ng the struct ure and developing the abilit y to work with the energies of the plane of mind is of great importance to the human kingdom for it is here that t h e first dire c t contact between the soul and its expression man can be established. Pre sently modern man is the inheritor of abilities on this plane which have been achieved by many thousands of men and women who have, after great effort, passe d beyond our view. Each race develop s some aspe c t of consciousnes s or energy and it is the destiny of wh at we simply ter m \"West e r n man\" to work with these en ergie s of the plane of mind to improve a nd build the contact betwee n soul and man. This is not something new and has been achieved by many people individu ally over vast lengths of time. How e ver what is new in our response to this plane of energy, is that for the first time in our long history there ca n be a collective approach by the human kingdom to this contact. If this is succ essful, and there is every indication that it will be, the level of consciousness caus ed by improved soul/personality contact will have a very pr onounced effect on all physical life on this planet. Spiritual energy, magnetically attracted by man from the soul and t h en radiated out, will constructivel y stimulate the development of all ki n g doms. From the point of view of man it will open up areas of conscious awareness that will gi ve a greater appreciation of the Whole as it relates to the part. Universal M i nd will become a realit y rather than an expression of vaguely understood words. How can this be achieved practically? Presently much of the energy of thou ght for m a ny people is centred on the astral plane, producing a conscious outlook based on emotion and desire. Only infrequently do we use the ene r gy of mind, however when w e begin to recognise its potent ial and cle a rly see the c o nstructive e ffects, both individually and collectively, our focus and attentio n then becomes centr ed on this plane of energy. When this oc curs, astral t h ought slowly but with gr eat certainty fades and we each move forward in response to e volutionary urge. The plane of mind offers vast potential to all who use this ene r gy but an understanding of its structur e, however brie f, is a necess ary first step . When this is achieved then come s the opportunity for further development. The plane of mind, like that of the ast r al plane, is divided up i n to seven sub planes, each repr esenting a range of e n ergy which is refle cted i n consciousness."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" The thre e u pper planes are the domain of the soul bo dy or c a usal body and as yet are infrequentl y contacted by man. This is someti me s refe r r e d to as the \"higher conscio u sness\" but this is a ter m which is too vague to be of any real use. The densi t y of matter at these levels tends more towards light than form. The lower fo ur sub planes are the mos t used by man and it is on one of these that the men t al unit of each of us is located. As we incr easin g ly beco me more orienta t ed towards the use of the mind this unit will be found in the upper sub planes of the lower mind. The plane of mind can be considered a s having two poles; one being used by man and the other by soul, until the uniting of both raises the light and ene r gy of this plane in accordance with e volution. The soul is connected to ma n by the energy of mind and this is responded to by each of us via the brain. Without a well stocked b r ain, active and capable of responding free fro m re strictions the re can be little reactio n to the ener gies of mind. It is in this regard that the significance of education can be see n. Where th e brain is either not activate d or is prese nted with information that is false, misleading or intentionally biased, this immediat el y places a restriction on the development of the mind. This c a n be not only extremely difficult for the individual to overcome, but also gr eatly damaging to the society. Societies are in a constant state of development but the direction they take is totally dependant on the base of education they evolve from and where this is treated cas u ally, social decay always begins. Limits withi n education can often be quite difficult to recognise or respond to when they become part of a group or racial outlook, but when they can cl early be seen every effort should be attempted to overcome th em. Some societi es re strict ed ucation to a particular gender, male b e ing considered mor e important than female. Other s use p o litical outlook, race or religious belief as a base for educational development , whilst the Weste r n approach, having freed itself from thes e obvious restri ctions plunges into education based on economics. How o ften do we he ar such phrases as \"knowledge economy\" or see educatio n being sold as a commodity with profit as the only goal ? Is this not a rest riction? Realistically we need edu c ated societi es in order t o develop, but by placing such obvious rest rictions on education and the necessary bias in outlook that must inevitably accompany them, we limit the potential of e a ch me mber of the group. Ideas, ideals, understandings and activities re main either undeveloped or lost to a s o ciety that actively limits its education to a p a rticular bias that excludes th e true significance and need for g reater e ducational development. For anyone who is interested contemplation on the concept of \"freedom of education\" will indicate future possi bilities in this area. The human kingd o m cannot develop without the active relationship of soul, mind, brain being established. Surely this is the reason for education? The proce ss of energy transferen ce fro m the soul to man is always achieved by focused, active consciousness. When the l o wer mind is directed to wards the upper mind, cau s al body or soul, the energy respo n se appears as an idea or concept. This then enter s the lower mi nd eventually becoming an ideal. As this takes on a more defin i te shape it becomes what is termed a concret e thought or thought for m which the brain can respond to. The original idea, havin g great beauty and possibil i ty, is change d in quality during its journey through an undeveloped mind, eventu ally what is produced and present e d to the human kingdom"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" is an extremely distorted view of the origin al response. Howeve r when the mind and brain are relatively cle a r and cause little distortion to the ide a from the upper planes of mind, then what is present e d to the human kingdom produces great be ne fit and constructively influences patt erns of growth. The relationship betwe e n the soul and its ex pression in time and space, the per s onality or man begins to develop an d the potential of uni on b ecomes a definite possibility. All this begins with education an d is developed by meditation. The mind of people in the West is relatively ne w, particularly when compared to many of the cultures and races of the past, but its ability of wh at is termed focused in tel ligence shows greater collective potential than has p reviously been seen. The relativ e youth of our mind does ca use difficulties i n developme n t which when clearly se en need to be addressed. Intellectual thought is an ability of the low er mind which when it becomes over developed generates an excess of en ergy that repels the uppe r mind energi es and essent i ally closes off any flow that can occur. The s o ul begins to be separ ated from its personality which initially c a n be extremely damaging and i f continued - fatal. It is not uncommo n to encounter an over active intellect but the beauty of the ideas being reached for in such a fashion can never be achie v ed regardless of effort. Intell ect is need ed to be develo ped by all of us but its excessive use sh ould be avoided. The concr e te mind can often fixate on an idea or id eal which is new to it. Once it has bee n accepted there is an absolute refus al to acknow l edge the nee d for further developmen t. This also generate s a body of energy that repels upper min d energy from ente ring. Similarly the seeking for power over other people which is totally dependant upon all the energie s of the lower mind, sets up the same condition. All these situat ions are not uncommon. Psychology i n the future as it begins to recognise t h e sub planes of mind and their range of effect s on consciousness, will play an extremel y significant role in assisting developing education of the lower m i nd. This is the beginning of esoteric psychology. A rule that has been used in the past by men and women who have sought t o develop th e relationship of soul and personality by improving th e ability of the mind is equally of vale today. \" No thought or activity that carries w i thin it the seed of separatism is acc e pt able\" For some this is considered the greatest sin, as it isolates the soul and its expression man from each other. The ene r gy of Love and the Light of wisdom are opposed. The dual nature of edu c ation needs to be r ecognise d in the intel ligent development of th e brain and m i nd. The goal for such education needs to be to im prove the flow of ideas from the upper m i nd or soul to the lower mind or man and th eir applicati o n via the brain to daily activity. This we are well capable of ac hieving as th e present high levels of mind development indicate. Study, meditation, contemplation and application rem ain th e best indivi dual approach at this ti me and can be enhanced where group work is undert aken in all t h ese areas. May the Light of wisdom within the soul reach you with stren gth. "}]
