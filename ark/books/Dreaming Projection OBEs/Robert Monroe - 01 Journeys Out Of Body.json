It was an interesting exper ience, to say the least, when I publicly became a member of a highly suspect group labeled Psychic, Sensitive, Freak, and, more generous ly, Parapsych olo-gist The publication of the book quite thoroughly \"blew my cover\" as a reasonably orthodox busin ess executive. However, a good many of the results were totally unex pected, and some of the serious trepidations were unfounded. For exam ple, the fact that I was (and still am) well grounded and active in the material world of business helped greatly in the serious consideration of the book material. Another facet: I shoul d have had more faith and confidence in the business mind as I know it. I had always maintained that business and industry resp ected \"somet hing of value\" without particular regard to its ori gin. If it works, u se it. Still, I was greatly concer ned about the reactio n to the book of the board of directors of the corporation of which I was preside nt. (Who would want such an unstable person running their multi-million dollar operationl) At the first board meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after the book publication, no one mentioned it. Nor did I. However, as we cruised up the canal in the board chairman's yacht, on our way to dinner at the country club, the chairm an's wife came up from below deck with a copy of JOURNEYS in her hand, \"Bob, will you autog raph this for me?\" she asked. I com plied, more than a little self- consci ous and surprised. I should not have been. \"Interesting stuff,\" the chairman called over his shoul der as he steere d for the yacht club dock. \"My wife is a real psychic. I never mak e a major busin ess deal without a reading from her. It works, too.\" Needless to say, I was not asked to resign. Actually, I found little or no adver se effect on my busin ess relatio nships as a result of the public disclos ure of this \"private\" side of my life. Instea d, many broad new a venues opened up to me, totally un expect ed. Who could have guessed that I would speak on out-of-body experienc es at such an august and conservati ve body as the Smithsonian Institutio n! It actua lly happened. Another miscalculation, or so it would seem: it has been stated that JOURNEYS was a book ahead of its tim e, that seri ous interest in the type of material it contains is only now reaching significant levels. This may have been true, yet what was it tha t precipit ated such changes in a mere four years? I like to think a chicken- or-the-egg questio n is appropriate, that this book was and is part of a trigger or cata lytic process that is now in chain reactio n. This proce ss states simply; it's O.K. to have strange experie nces, to consid er seriously as natural those events and activities beyond the present ability of our physical sciences to replicate or meas ure. Existence beyon d death is one of these. Another decision made about the time of publication: that my conscio us mind or sel f had insufficient experie nce and/or training to control in toto the scope of such non- physical ex ploration. This was brought about first by the boredom and impati ence of here-to-there- and-back tests in our physical world. Who wants repe atedly to take an hour dressing in preparation (wire up to instrum ents, develop a careful separ a tive state) just to go from bedroom to kitche n (Virginia to California or Ka nsas). Second, many expla nations were tak ing place far"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"beyon d my consci ous understanding and control —which inferred that the physical, consci ous \"I\" actually had very limited ideas as to where to go and what to do. Thus I made an importa nt decision. For the most part, I would set up the conscious out-of-body state, then turn the action over to my total self (soul?). My present consci ousness would go alon g for the ride, as a part of the whole. The results have been: ecstatic, illuminating, confusing, awe-inspir ing, humbling, reassu ring— experie nce and explor ation far beyond my ability to conceive of, most of it an apparent educational program that I am absor bing bit by bit. The proble m as I sense it is simple. Event ually, a quant um jump in conscious ness will be required to reduce the material to a practical \"something of value\" level. What does this mea n? Does that great consci ousness chang e take place while still alive physicall y? Or in another reality, later? Who are the instructors, the helpers? Precisely bit by bit, we are beginn ing to approach the answers in our research at the Institut e. Yes, a research facility wa s formed and became active in 1972. Our w ork has attracte d the interest and co-op eration of physicists, psychologists, biochemists, engin eers, educators, psychiatrists, corp orate preside nts, statisticians, many of whom serve on our board of advise rs. Among the eleven thousand plus pieces of mail received to date, many sighs of relief were reported. The secret could be talked about without the need for sanity hear ings. Thus the book is serving its primar y purpose. Over seven hundred persons have participated in our re search and experimental training program. Our first Explor er Team has six members. Some fifty more are waiting f or our facility to handle their final indoctrination, and their number is growing daily. W e hope to be able to expan d shortl y in physical space, equipment, and personnel so that we can ab sorb the backlog and the increas e. This year, training programs at the Institute may qualify for credit at the college and uni versity level. Meanwhile, our Explor er Team of six is bringing back data faster than we can process it, far more rapidly an d diverse than I alon e could accumulate. That which we have sorted is ove r whelming in its import. The fact of conse nsus and agreement from six different explor ers—ea ch unaware of the other's ex periences except in joint operations—has had a formidable im pact upon those who have examin ed the material. The detail s will be reporte d in another book which is in preparation. A lot of action to pack into four years. It only st rengthens the concept of accelerated chang e at work—esp ecially the change in human needs. I have reviewed JOURNEYS again carefully for this new e dition. I'm happy to say that nothing has to be altere d in the light of later experie nce. The basics are still the same. From the point of my experim ental level at that time, it is still accurate .

Box 57 Afton, Virginia 22920"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION In our action-oriented society, whe n a man lies down to sleep , he is effectively out of the picture. He will lie still for six to eight hours, so he is not \"behaving,\" \"thinking pro - ductivel y,\" or doi ng anyth ing \"significant.\" We all know that people dream, but we raise our children to regard dreams and other experi ences occurring during sleep as unimportant, as not red in the way that the events of the day are. Thus most people are in the habit of forgetti ng their dreams, and, on the occasi ons when they do remem ber them, they usuall y regard them as mere oddities. It is true that psychologists and psychiatrists regard the dreams of patients as useful clues to the malfunctioning of their personalities; but even in this application dreams and other nocturnal exper iences are generally not treated as red in any sen se, but only as some sort of internal data processing of the human comp uter. There are some important excepti ons to this general put-down of dreams, but for the vast majority of people in our societ y today, dreams are not things that serious people con cern themselves with. What are we to make of a person who takes except ion to this general belief, who claims to have had exper iences during sleep or oth er forms of unconsciousness that were not only impressive to him, but which he feels were real? Suppose this person claims that on the previous night he had an experience of flying through the air over a large city which he soon recog nized as New York. Further, he tells us that not only was this \"dream\" intensely vivid, but that he knew at the time that it was not a dream, that he was really in the air ove r New York City. And this conviction that he was redly there sticks w ith him for the rest o f his life, despite our reminding him that a sleeping man couldn't really be fiying b y himse lf in the air ove r New York City. Proba bly we will ignore a perso n who make s such a report, or we will politely (or not so politely) inform him that he is bec oming a little weak in the head or crazy, and suggest that he see a psychotherapist. If he is insisten t about the reality of his experie nce, especially if he has other strange experi ences too, we may wi th the best of intentions see about com mitting him to a mental hospital. Our \"tra veler,\" on the other hand, if he is smart, will quickl y learn not to talk about his experie nces. The only p roblem with that, as I have found from talking to many su ch people, is that he may w orry about whether he's going c razy. For the sake of argument, let's make our \"trave ler\" even more troubling. Suppose in his account he goes on to say that after flying o ver New York City for a while he flew down to your apartment. There he saw you and two oth er people, unknown to him, conversing. He describ es the two peo ple in detail, and mentions a few things about the topic of conver sation occurring in the minute or so he was there. Let's suppose he is corr ect. At the time he had his experi ence, you were holding a conversation on the topic he men tions with two peo ple who fit our \"traveler's\" descripti ons. What do we mak e of things now? The usual reaction to a hypothetical situati on of this type is that it is all very interesti ng, but as we know that it coul dn't possibly happen, we needn't seriously think about what it might mean. Or we might comfort ourselves by invoking the word \"coincidence.\" A marvelous word, \"coincidence,\" for relieving me ntal upsetsl Unfortunately for our peace of mind, there are thousands of instanc es, reporte d by normal people, of exactl y this sort o f occurrence. We are not dealing with a purely hypothetical situation."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Such events have been termed traveling clair voyance, astral projection, or, a more scienti fic term, out-of-the-body experi ences (OOBEs). We can formally define an OOBE as an event in which the experi encer (i) seems to perceive some portion of some environment which could not possibly be perceived from where his physical body is known to be at the time; and (2) knows at the time that he is not dreaming or fantasizing. T he experiencer seems to possess his normal con scious ness at the time, and even though he may reason that this cannot be happening, he will feel all his norma l critical faculties to be prese nt, and so knows h e is not dreaming. Further, he will not decide after awaken ing that this was a dream. How, the n, do we understand this strange phe nomenon? If we look to scientific sources for information about OOBE s we shall find practically none at all. Scien tists have, by and large, simply not paid any att ention to these phe - nomena. The situati on is rather similar to that of the scien tific literature on extrasensory perce ption (ESP). Phenomena such as telepathy, clairvoyance, precogniti on, and psycho kinesis are \"impossible\" in terms of the current physical world view. Since they can 't happen, most scientists do not bother to read the evidence indicating that they do happen; hence, not having rea d the evidence, their belief in the im possibility of such phenomena is reinforced. This kind of circular reasoning in support of one's comfortable belief systern is not uniqu e to scientists by any me ans, but it has re sulted in very little scienti fic research on ESP or OOBEs. In spite of the lack of \"hard\" scienti fic dfcta, there are still a number of definite conclusions one can make from reading what material there is. First, OOBEs are a universal human exper ience, not in the sense that they hap pen to large numbers of people, but in that they have happened all through recorde d history, and there are marked similarities in the exper ience among people who are otherwise extremely different in terms of cultur al backgrou nd. One can find reports of OOBEs by housewives in Kansas which closely r esembl e accounts of OOBEs from ancient Egyptian or orienta l sources. Second, the OOBE is generally a once- in-a-lif etime expe rience, seemingly experie nced by \"acci dent.\" Illness es some times bring it about, especially illnesses which are almost fatal. Great emotional stress some times brings it ab out. In many cases, it simp ly happens during sleep without our hav ing any idea of what might have caused it. In very rare in stances it seems to have been brought about by a deliberate attem pt. Third, the experie nce of an OOBE is usu ally one of the most profound experiences of a perso n's life, and radically alte rs his beliefs. This is usually expre ssed as, \"I no longer believe in survival of death or an immort al soul, I know that I will survive death.\" The person feels that he has directly experienc ed being alive an d consci ous without his physical body, and therefore knows th at he possesses some kind of soul that will survive bodily death. This does not logicall y follow, for even if the OOBE is more than just an interesting dream or hall ucination, it was still occur ring while the physi cal body was alive and functioning and therefore may de pend on the physical body. This argument, however, m akes no impressi on on those who have actually had an OOBE. Thus regardless of what positio n one wants to take on the \"reality\" of the OOBE , it is clear ly an experie nce deserving consi derable psychological study. I am certain that our ideas concerning the existence of souls have resulte d from early experie nces of people having OOBE s. Considering the im portance of the idea of the soul to most of our religions, and the importa nce of religion in people's lives, it seem s"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"incredi ble that science could have swept this problem under the rug so easily. Fourth, the OOBE is generally ext remely joyful to those who have it. I would make a rough estimate that between 90 and 95 per cent of the people who have this experie nce are very glad it occu rred and find it joyful, while 5 per cent are very frighte ned by it, for the only wa y they can interpret it, while it is ha ppening, is that they are dying. Lat er reac tions of the person as he attem pts to interpret his OOBE can be rather negative, however. Almos t every time I give a speech on this subject, someone comes up to me afterward and thanks me for talking about it They had had the experi ence some time before, but had no way of explain ing it, and worried that they we re going \"crazy.\" Fifth, in some instances of OOBE s the descr iption of what was happening at a distant place is cor rect and more accurate than we would expect by coinci dence. Not the majority, by any me ans, but some. To explai n these we must postulate either that the \"hallucinatory\" exper ience of the OOBE was combined with the operation of ESP, or that in some sense the perso n really was \"there.\" The OOBE then becomes very real indeed. The fact that most of our knowledge about OOBEs comes from reports of once-in-a- lifetime experienc es puts us at two serious disadvantages. The first of these is that most people cannot produce an OOBE at will, so this preclu des the possi bility of studying the m under precise laboratory condi tions. The secon d disadvantage is that when a person is sud denly thrust for a brief period of time into a very novel environment he may not be a very good observer. He is too excite d and too busy trying to cope with the strange ness of it. Thus our reports from the once-in-a-lifetime people are very rough. It wou ld be of great advantage in studyi ng OOBE s to have trained \"travelers\" available who could produce the experi ence at will and who generally had the charact eristics of a good reporter. The book you are about to read is very rare. It is a firsthand accoun t of hundreds of OOBEs by a person who is, I beli eve, a good reporter. Nothing like it has been published in many years. Robert A, Monr oe is a successful busin essman who began experiencing OOBEs quite unexpectedly over a decade ago. Coming from an academic family and having more than the average intellectual training, he realized the unusualness of these experie nces and began taking systematic notes from the begin ning. I shall not say more about his experi ences per se; his accou nts in the rest of this book are too fascinating and lucid to warrant further introduction here. Instea d, I shall note the qualities he possesses that make him a good re porter, and which give me a good deal of confidence in his accou nts. When most people have a profound experience, especially one with religious import, careful questioning will usua lly re veal that their original accou nt of it was not so much an ac count of what happened as of what they thought it meant. As an exampl e, let us suppose that what really happens to a perso n is that he finds himself floating in the air above his body, in the middle of the night; while still sur prised at this, he perceives a shadowy, dim figure at the end of the room, and then a blue circle of light floats past the figure from left to right. Then our experiencer loses consci ousness and wakes up to find himself in his body. A good reporter will describ e essentially that scene. Many people will say, in perfectly good faith, something like, \"My immortal soul was raised from the tomb of my body by the grace of God last night, and an angel appeared. As a symbol of God's favor, the angel"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"showed me a symbol of wholeness' I have often seen distortions this great when I've been able to questio n an individua l about exact ly what happened, but most of the published accounts of OOBEs have not been subject ed to this kind of questioning. The statements that God's will caused the OOBE , that the dim figure turned into an angel, that the blue circle was a symbol of wholeness are all things that are part of a person's interpret ation, not his experie nce. Most people are not aware of the exten t to which their mind automatically interprets things. T hey think they are perceivi ng things as they are. Robert Monroe is uniqu e among the small number of peo ple who have written about repeated OOBEs, in that he rec ognizes the extent to which his mind tries to interpret his experie nces, to force them into familiar patterns. Thus his accounts are particul arly valuable, for he works ve ry hard to try to \"tell it like it is.\" The initial series of laboratory studi es we were able to do occur red over a period of several months between September 1965 and August 1966, while I was able to use the facilities of the Electroe ncephalographic (brain wave) Laboratory of the University of Virginia Medical School. On eight occasio ns Mr. Monroe was aske d to try to pro duce an OOBE while hooked up to various instruments for measuring physiological functions. He was also asked to try to direct his moveme nts during the OOBE into the adjoin ing room, both to observe the activity of the technic ian moni toring the recording equipment and to try to read a five-digit r andom target number, which was plac ed on a shelf six feet above the floor. Measure ments were made of Mr. Monroe's brain waves (the electro encephalogram), eye movements, and heart rate (the electrocardiogram). The laboratory was, unfortunately, not very comfortable for lying still f or prolonged periods; we had to bring an army cot into the recording room, as there was no bed there. One of the connections for recording brain waves, the ear elec trode, was of a clip type that caused some irritation to the ear, and this made relaxation somewha t difficult. On the first seven nights during which he attempted to produce an OOBE , Mr. Monroe was not succe ssful. On his eighth night he was able to produce two very brief OOBE s, and these are descri bed in some detail in his own words on pp. 60-72. The first brief OOBE involved witnessing some unrecognized people talking at an unknown location, so there was no way of checking whether it was \"fantasy\" or a real perception of event s happening at a distan ce. In the secon d brief OOBE, Mr. Monroe reporte d he couldn't control his movements very well, so he did not report on the target num ber in the adjacent room. He did correctly describ e that the laboratory technic ian was out of the room, and that a man (later identified as her husband) was with her in a corridor. As a parapsychologist, I cannot say that this \"proves\" that Mr. Monroe really knew what was happening at a distance: it is hard to assess the improbability of such an event occur ring after the fact. Nevertheless, I found this result quite encouraging for one of the initial attempts to bring su ch an unusual phenomenon into the laboratory'. My next opportunity to work with Mr. Monroe in the laboratory came when he visited me in California during the summ er of 1968. We were able to have a single laboratory sessio n under much more comfortable circumstances: a nor mal bed was available, rather than a cot, and we used a differ ent type of electro de for meas uring brain waves which was not physicall y uncomfortable. Under these condi tions, Mr. Monroe was abl e to produce two brief OOBEs,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"He awoke almost imme diately after the first OOBE had ended, and estim ated that it had lasted eight to ten seconds. The brain-wave reco rd just before he awoke again showed a Stage 1 pattern, with possibly a single rapid eye movement occurring during that time. His blo od pressure showed a sud den drop, a steady low lasting eight seconds, and a sudden resurgence to normal. In terms of Mr. Monoe's experie nce (see his description of this techn ique on p. 70), he reported that he \"rolled out\" of his body, found himself in the hallway separating his room from the recording room for a few seconds, and then felt a need to get back into his body because of a difficulty in breathing. An assistan t, Joan Crawford, and I had been watching him on a closed -circuit television set during this time and we saw him move his arm slightly away from his throat just b efore he awoke and reported. Mr. Monroe tried again to produce another OOBE that would be evidential in terms of ESP, coming over and seeing the recording room and reading a target number on a shelf in that room. His brain- wave pattern showed much light sleep, so after three quarters o f an hour, I calle d out to him over the intercom to remind him that we wanted him to try to produce an OOBE. A while later, he reporte d having p ro duced an OOBE, but being unsure of his orientati on, he followed a wire which he thought led to the recording room, and instea d found himself outsid e in a strange area that he never re called seeing before. He decided he was hopelessly disor iented and came back to his body. His de scription of that area matched an interior courtyard of the building that he would indeed have found himself in during an OOBE if he had inadvertently gone in exactl y the opposite directio n he shoul d have. It is not absolutely certain that he had never seen this courtyard while visiting my office earlier in the day, so this experie nce is not in itself good evidence for a paranor mal component to the OOBE. In terms of physiological changes, he again showed a Stage 1 dream ing pattern, with only tw o rapid eye movements in the whole period and no clear-cut blood pressure drop on this occasio n. Mr. Monroe's experienc es, those of many promi nent mys tics through out the ages, and all the data of ESP indicate that our current physical view of the world is a very limited one, that the dimensions of reality are much wider tha n our current concepts. My attem pts and those of other investi gators to mak e these experie nces behave in an acceptable fashion may not work out as well as we would like. Let me give two exampl es of \"experiments\" with Mr. Monroe which were impressive to me person ally, but which are very difficult to evaluat e by our ordinary scient ific criteria. Shortly after completing the first series of laboratory ex periments, I moved from the east coast to California. A few months after moving, my wife and I decided to set up an exper iment. One evening we would conce ntrate intensely for half an hour, in an attempt to help Mr. Monroe have an OOBE and come to our home. If he were then able to de scribe our home, this would produce good data on the para-psychological aspects of his OOBE s. I telephoned Mr. Mon roe that afternoon, and told him only that we would try to direct him across the country to our home at some unspeci fied time that night, without giving him any furt her details. That evening I rando mly select ed a time which, I believed, would occur well after Mr. Monroe would be asleep. My rando m selectio n came out 11 P.M. Cali fornia time, or 2 A.M. east coast time. At 11 P.M. m y wife and I began our concen tration. At 11:05 p.m. the telephone rang, interrupti ng it. We did not answer the telephone, but tried to contin ue our concentration until 11:30 P.M. The following morning I tele phoned Mr."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Monroe and told him only th at the results had been encouraging, and that he should write down an inde pendent account of what he had experienced for later com pariso n against our independent accou nts. On the evening of the exper iment, Mr. Monroe had the following experienc e, which I quote from the notes he mailed me: \"Eveni ng passed uneventfully, and I finally got into bed about 1:40 A.M., still wide awake (north-south position). The cat was lying in bed with me. After a long period of calming my mind, a sense of warmth swept over my body, with no break in consci ousness, no pre-sleep. Almos t immediately, I felt something (or some one) rocking my body from side to side, then tugging at my feet! (I heard the cat let out a com plaining yell.) I recogni zed immediately that this had some thing to do with Charlie's experiment, and with full trust, did not feel my usual cautio n (about strangers). T he tugging a t the legs con tinued, and I finally manage d to separate one Second Body arm, and held it up, feeling around in the dark. After a moment, the tugging stop ped, and a hand took my wrist, first gently, then very, very firmly, and pulled me out of the physical easily. S till trusting, and a little excited, I ex - presse d willingness to go to Charlie, if that was where he (it) wanted to lead me. The answer came back affirmatively (al though there was no sense of personality, very businesslike). With the hand around my wrist very firmly, I coul d feel a part of the arm belonging to the hand (slightly hairy, muscu lar mal e). But I could not \"see\" who belonged to the arm. I also heard my name called once. \"Then we started to move, with the familiar feeling of something like air rushing around the body. A fter a short trip (seemed like five secon ds in duration), we stop ped and the hand released my wrist. There was com plete silence and darkness. Then I drifted down into what seemed to be a room. . . .\" I've sto pped quoting from Mr. Monroe's notes at this point, except to add that when he finished this brief trip and got out of bed to telep hone me it was 2:05 A.M., his time. Thus the time match with my wife and I beginni ng to con centrate was extremely good: he felt the tug pulling him from his body within a minute or so of when we started to con centrate. On the other hand, his continuing description of what our home looke d like and what my wife and I were doing was not good at all: he \"perceived\" too many people in the room, he \"perceived \" me doing things I didn't do, and his descri ption of the room itself was quite vague. What do I make of this? This is one of those frustrating events that parapsychologists encounter when working wi th poorly controlle d phenomena. It is not evidential enough to say that it was unqu estionably a paranormal effect, yet it is difficult simply to say that nothing happened. It is com forta ble to stick w ith our common-sense assumptions that the physi cal world is what it seems to be, and that a man (or his sense organs) is e ither located at a certain place and able to observe it or he is not. Some OOBE s reported in the literature seem to fit this view, while others have a disturbing mixture of cor rect perceptions of the physical situation with \"perceptions\" of things that weren't there or did n't happen (to us ordinary obs ervers). Mr. Monroe reports a number of such mixed ex periences in this book, espec ially his seemi ng to \"communi cate\" with people while he is having a n OOBE, but their never remem bering it. The secon d puzzling \"exp eriment\" occurred in the fall of 1970 when I briefly visited Mr. Monroe in Virginia, en route to a conference in Washington. Staying o vernight, I requested that if he had an OOBE that night, he should come to my bedr oom and try to pull me out of my body so I could have the experience too. I reali zed at the time"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"that I made this request with a certain amount of ambival ence: I wanted him to succee d, yet another part of me did not. More on that later. Sometime after dawn that morning (I had slept somewhat fitfully and the light was occasi onally waking me), I was drea m ing when I began vaguely remembering that Mr. Monroe was sup posed to try to get me out of my body. I became partially consci ous, and felt a sense of \"vibratio n\" all around me in the dream world, a \"vibration\" that had a certain amount of in definable menace connected with it. In spite of the fear this arous ed, I thoug ht that I should try to have an OOBE, but at that point I lost my thread of consciousness, and only r e member waking up a while later, feeling that the exper iment was a failure. A week later I received a letter from a colleague in New York, the well-known parapsychologist Dr. Stanley Krippner, and I began to wonder if it really was a \"failure.\" He was writing to me about an experience his stepdaughter, Carie, who I am quite fond of, had the same morni ng I was having my \"dream.\" Carie had spontaneously reported to her father that she had seen me in a restaura nt in New York City on her way to school that morning. This would have been roughly ab out the time I was having the dream. Neither she nor her father knew that I was on the east coast . What do I make of this? This was the first time in years that I had consciously attempted to have an OOBE (I have never, to my knowledge, succeeded), and while I had no con scious memo ry of having one, a friend reports seeing me in a restaura nt in New York City. Even more puzzling, I w ould have no desire in the world to go to a restaura nt in New York City, a place I dislike intensely, if I were havin g an OOBE, although visiting C arie and her family is always very pleasant. Coincidence? Again, something I would never presen t as sci entific evidenc e of anything, but something I can't dismiss as meaningless. This last incident illustrates an attitude toward OOBEs that I nave observed in myself, although I do not like to ad mit it, which is that I am somewhat afraid of them. Part of me is very interest ed in the phenomenon scienti fically, an other part o f me is excited at the prosp ect of perso nally ex periencing it. A third part of me knows that an OOBE is some thing like dying, or ope ning up part of my mind to an unknown realm, and this third part is not at all anxio us to get on with it. If OOBEs are \"real,\" if the things Mr. Monroe describ es cannot be dismiss ed as an interesting kind of fantasy or dream, our world view is going to change radically. And uncomfortably. One thing that psychologists are reasonably sure of about human nature is that it resists cha nge. We like the world to be the way we think it is, e ven if we think it's unpleasant. At least we can anticip ate what may ha ppen. Change and uncertainty have possibilities of unsettling things happening, especially when that change doesn't take account of our de sires, our wills, our egos. I have tried to talk mainly about straightforward scienti fic studies of OOBEs in introducing this book, but now w e get to what may be the most important aspect of the subje ct. Mr. Monroe's experiences are frightening. He is talking about dying, and dying is not a polite topic in our society. W e leave it in the hands of priests and ministers to say com forting words, we occasionally joke about it, and we have a lot of ag gressive fantasies about other people dying, but we don't really think about it. This book is going to make you think about death. You are not going to like some of the things it says and some of the thoughts it insp ires. It will be very tempting to dismiss Rober t Monroe as a madman. I would suggest that you not do that.

It is placed here on the assum ption that most reade rs skip such preliminaries to get to the meat of the matter. In this case, the following is the crux of it all. The primary purposes for the releas e and publication of the material conta ined here are (i) that through dissemina tion as widely as possible, some other human being— perhaps just on e—may be saved from the agony and terror of trial and error in an area where there have been no concret e answers; that he may have comfort in the knowledge that others have had the same experienc es; that he will recogni ze in himse lf the phenomenon and thus avoid the trauma of psychother apy, or at the worst, mental breakdown and comm itment to a mental institutio n; and (2) that tomorrow or in the years to come, the formal, accep ted sciences of our culture will ex pand their horizo ns, concepts, postu lates, and resea rch to open wide the avenues and doorwa ys intima ted herein to the great enrichment of man's knowledge and understanding of himse lf and his comp lete environment. If one or bot h of these aims are served, whenever and wher ever it may be, this is sufficient reward indeed. The presentation of such material is not design ed for any p articular scientific group. Rather, the principal attempt is to be as specific as possib le in languag e understandable to scientists and laymen alike, with avoidance of ambig uous generaliti es. The physicist, che mist, life scientist, psychia trist, and philosopher may each use more techn ical or specialized termin ology to state the same premise. Such in terpretati on is expected. It will indic ate that the plan of com munic ation is workable, that the \"plain\" talk does convey the proper meaning to a wide base rather than to a narrow pinnacle of specialists. It is expect ed, too, that many interpre tations will be con tradictory. The most difficult mental process of all is to con sider object ively any concept which, if accep ted as fact, will toss into discard a lifetime of training and experience. Yet m uch has already been accep ted as fact on far less direct evidence than that presen ted here, and is now \"acc epted.\" It is th e hope that the same will apply to the data included here. It is ind eed the most difficult mental process of all, this objective-consi deration business. Once in a lifetime is enough. Let's look for a beginning to this candid report of a highly person al exper ience. In the spring of 1958 I was living a reasonably norm al life with a reasonably normal family. Because we appreciated na ture and quiet, ours was a country environment. The only u northodox activity was my expe rimentation with techniques of data learning during slee p—with myself as the chief subject. The first sign of deviation from the norm took place on a Sunday afternoon. While the rest of the family had gone to church, I cond ucted an experim ent by listen ing to a particu lar tape recording in a highly isolated environment It was a simple attempt to force concentration on a single intelligent-signal source (aural) with lowered signal input from the other senses. Degree of retention and recall would indicate the success of the technique. Isolate d from other sights and sounds, I listen ed to the tape. It cont ained no unusual or stray suggestion. Most si g nificant in retrospec t was the strong suggestion to remem ber and recall all that took place during the relaxatio n exercise. The tape ran its course with no unusual result. My recall was thoro ugh and compl ete because it"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"had been a product of my own efforts and thus familiar to me. Perha ps too much so, as no retention and recall of original or new materi al was possi ble in my case. The techniq ue would have to be utilized with some other subject When my family returned, we all had brunc h, which con sisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, and coffee. Some unimpor tant controvers y occurred at the table, which was not germane to the problem. A little over an hour later, I was seize d with a severe, iron-hard cramp which extend ed across my diaphragm or solar plexus area just under my rib cage. It was a solid band of unyieldi ng ache. At first, I thought it was some form of food poisoning from brunc h. In desp eration, I forced myself to regurgitate, but my stomach was empty. Other members of my family who had eaten the same food showed no signs of illness or dis comfort. I tried exercising an d walking, on the assumpt ion that it was a cramped abdominal muscle. It was not appen dicitis, as my appendix had been removed. I could breathe properly in spite of the pain, and my heart appeared normal in pulse rate. There was no perspiratio n or other symptoms whatsoe ver—just the hard, tense, locked- in-place rigidity of a band of muscles in the upper abdomen. It occurred to me that perhaps some factor in the recording had caused it In going over the tape and the written copy from which it had been made, I found nothing unusual. What suggestio n there was, I co mplied with, seeking to relieve any unconscious suggestio n that might have been ap plied. Still, no relief. Perha ps I should have phoned immediately for a doctor. However, it didn' t seem that serious, nor did it bec ome any wo rse. But it didn 't get any better, either. Finally, we did phone for medical help. All of the local doctors were away or playing g olf. From one-thirty in the afternoon until around midnigh t, the cramp and pain continued. No typical home medication seemed to alleviate it. Sometime after twelve I fell asleep from pure exhaustion. I woke up in the early morning, and the cramp and pain were gone. There was muscle soreness through out the af flicted area, much as one gets from overcoughing, but no more. What caused the cramp in this area is still unknown. It is m entioned only bec ause it was the first out-of-the-ordinary event, physical or otherwise, that took place. In retrospect, perhaps it was the touch of a magic wand, or a sledge hammer, although I didn't know it at the time. Some three weeks later, the second major event entered the picture. There had been no further recorded tape experi mentation, because the suspicio n was strong that the cramp was som ehow related. Thus there was noth ing that appar ently triggered the event. Again, it was a Sunday afternoon and the family had gone to church. I lay down on the couch in the living room for a short nap while the house was quiet. I had just become prone (head to the north, if that had any m eaning), when a beam or ray seemed to come out of the sky to the north at about a 30° angle from the horizon . It was like being struck by a warm light. Only this was dayli ght and no beam was visible, if there truly was one. I thought it was sunlight at first, although this was im possible on the north side of the house. The effect when the beam struck my entire body was to cause it to shake violently o r \"vibrate.\" I was utterly powerless to move. It was as if I were being held in a vise."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Shocked and frightened, I forced myself to move. It was like pushing against invisible bonds. As I slowly sat upright on the couch , the shaking and vibration slowly faded away and I was abl e to move freely. I stood up and walked around. There had been no loss of consci ousness that I was aware of, and the clock showed that only a few seco nds had elapsed since I had stretched out on the couch . I had not closed my eyes, and had seen the room and heard outdoor noises during the entire episode. I look ed out the window, e specially to the north, although why and what I expected to see, I don't know. E verything looked normal and seren e. I wen t outside for a walk to puzzle over this strange thing that had happened. Within the following si x weeks, the same peculiar condi tion manifested itself nine times. It occur red at different pe riods and locales, and the only com mon factor was that it began just a fter I had lain down for rest or sleep . Whenever it took place, I fought myself to a sitting position, and the \"shaking\" faded away. Alth ough my body \"felt\" the shaking, I could see no visible evidenc e that it was doing so. My limited knowledge of medicine envision ed many pos sibilities as the cause . I thought of epilepsy, but I understood that epileptics had no memory or sensa tion in such seizures. Furthermore, I understood that epilepsy is heredit ary an d shows signs at an early age, and neither was evident in my case. Second was the possibility of a brain disorder such as a tumor or growth. Again, the symptoms were not typical, but this could be it. With trepidation, I went to our longtim e family physician, Dr. Richard Gordon, and explai ned the symptoms. As an internist and diagnos tician, he should have had what answers there may have been. He also knew m y medic al history, such as it was. After a thorough physical, Dr. Gordon suggested that I had been working to o hard, that I get m ore sleep and take off a little weight. In short, he could find nothing wrong with me physicall y. He laugh ed at the possibility of a brain tumor or epil epsy. I took his word for it and returne d home relieved. If there was no physical basis for the phenomenon, I thought, it must be hallucinatory, a form of dreaming. There fore, if the condition came again, I would observe it as ob jectively as possible. It obliged by \"coming on\" that very evening. It began some two minu tes after I lay down to sleep. This time, I was determined to stay with it and see what hap pened rather than fight my way out of it As I lay there, the \"feeling\" surged into my head and swept over my entire body. It was not a shaking, but more of a \"vibratio n,\" steady and unvarying in frequency. It f elt much like an electr ic shock running through the entire body without the pain involved. Also, the frequency seem ed somewhat below th e sixty-cycle pulsation, perhaps half that rate. Frightened, I stayed with it, trying to remai n calm. I coul d still see the room around me, but could hear little above the roaring sou nd caused by the vibrations. I wondered what would happen next. Nothing happened. After some five minutes, the sensation slowly faded away and I got up feeling perfectly normal. My pulse rate was up, evidently due to the exciteme nt, but no more. With this result, I lost much of my fear of the con dition. In the next four or five occurrences of the vibration, I dis covered little more. On one occasi on, at least, it see med to develop into a ring of sparks about two feet in diameter, with the axis o f my body in the center of the ring. I could actua lly see this ring if I close d my eyes. The ring would start at the head and slowly sweep down to"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"my toes and back to the head, keeping this up in a regular oscillatio n. The time of the cycle seemed to be some five seconds. As the ring passe d over eac h section of my body, I could feel the vibra tions like a band cutting through that section. When the ring passed over my head, a great roaring sur ged with it, and I felt the vibrations in my brain. I attempted to study th is flaming electrical-seeming ring, but could discover no reason for it, or wha t it was. All of this remain ed unknown to my wife and children. I coul d see no reason to worry or conc ern them until some thing definite was known of it I did take a friend into my confidence, a well-known psychologist, Dr. Foster Bradshaw. If it had not been for him, I cannot predict where I wou ld be at this time. Perha ps in an institut ion. I discusse d the matter with him, and he was most inter ested. He suggested it might be some form of hallucination. Like Dr. Gordon, he knew me well. Conseq uently, he laughe d at the concept that I was in the begin ning stages of schizo phrenia or the like. I aske d him what he thought I should do. I shall always reme mber his answer. \"Why, there's nothing else you can do but look into it and see what it is,\" Dr. Bradsh aw replied. \"Anyhow, it do esn't seem you have much choice. If it happened to me, I'd go off in the woods somewhere and keep trying unt il I found the answer.\" The difference was that it was happening to me and not to Dr. Brads haw, an d I couldn't afford to go off in the woods, either literall y or figuratively. I had a family to support, among other things. Several months passe d, and the vibration condition con tinued to occur. It almost became boring, until late one night when I was lying in bed just b efore sleep. The vibrations came and I wearily and patiently waited for them to pass away so I coul d go to sleep . As I lay there, my arm was drap ed over the right side of the bed, fingers just brushing the rug. Idly, I tried to move my fingers and found I coul d scratch the rug. Without thinking or realizing that I could move my fingers during the vibration, I pushed with the tips of my fingers against the rug. After a moment's resistance, my fin gers seem ed to penetrate the rug and touch the floor under neath. With mild curiosity, I pushed my hand down farther. My fingers went through the floor and there was the rough upper surface of the ceiling of the room below. I f elt around, and there was a small triangular chip of wood, a bent nail, and some sawdust. Only mildly interested in this daydream sensati on, I pushed my hand still deeper. It went through the first-fl oor ceiling and I felt as if my whole arm was through the floor. My hand touched water. Without excite ment, I splashed the water with my fingers. Suddenly, I became fully aware of the situatio n. I was wide awake. I could see the moonlit landscape through the window. I coul d feel myself lying on the bed, the covers o ver my body, the pillow und er my head, my chest rising a nd falling as I breathed. The vibrations were still p resent, but to a lesser degree. Yet, imp ossibly, my hand was playing i n a pool of water, an d my arm felt as if it was stuck down through the floor. I was sur ely wide awake and the sensation was still there. How could I be awake in all other respects and still \"dream\" that my arm was stuck down through the floor? The vibrations started to fade, and for some reason I thought there was a connection betwee n my arm stuck through the floor and their prese nce. If they faded away be - fore I got my arm \"out,\" the floor might close in and I would lose an arm. Perha ps the vibrations had made a hole in the floor temporarily. I did n't stop to consider the \"how\""},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"of it. I yanked my arm out of the floor, pulled it up on the bed, and the vibrations ended soon after. I got up, turned on the light, and looke d at the spot beside the bed. There was no hole in the floor or rug. They were just as they al ways had been. I look ed at my hand and arm, and even looked for the water on my hand. There was none, and my arm seem ed per fectly normal. I looked about the room. My wife was sleep ing quietly in the bed, nothing seem ed amiss. I thought about the hallucination for a long time before I was abl e to calm down enough to slee p. The next day I considere d actually cutting a hole in the floor to see if what I had felt was there on the subfloor—the triangular chip of wood, the bent nail, and the sawdust. At the time, I coul dn't see disfiguring the floor because of a wild hallucination. I told Dr. Brads haw of this episode, and he agreed that it was a rather convincing daydream . He was in favor o f cut ting the hole in the floor to find out what was there. He in troduced me to Dr. Lewis W olberg, a psychiatr ist of note. At a dinner party, I casua lly mentioned the vibration phe nomenon to Dr. Wolberg. He was only polit ely interest ed, and evidently in no mood for \"business,\" for which I couldn't blame him. I didn't have the courage to ask him about the arm in the floor. It was bec oming fairly confusing. My environment and perso nal experie nce had led me to expect some kind of an swers or at least promising opinions from modern technol ogy. I had an above-normal scientific, engine ering, and medical backgroun d as a layman. Now, I was faced with something where answers or eve n extrapolation was not quickl y available. In retrospect , I still cann ot envisage having drop ped the matter entirely at any time . It may be that I could not have done so if I tried. If I thought I faced incongruities at this point, it was be cause I did not know what was yet to come. Some four weeks later, when the \"vibrations\" came again, I was duly cautio us about attempting to move an arm or leg. It was late at night , and I was lying in bed before sleep. My wife had fallen asleep beside me. There was a surge that seemed to be in my head, and quickl y the condition spread through my body. It all seemed the same. As I lay there trying to decide how to analyze the thing in another way, I just h appened to think how nice it would be to take a glider up and fly the next afternoon (my hobby at that time). Without considering any conseq uences—not knowing there would be any—I thoug ht of the pleas ure it would bring, After a moment, I became aware of somet hing pressing against my shoulder. Half- curious, I reached back and up to feel what it was. My hand encountered a smooth wall. I moved my hand along the wall the length of my arm and it ; continued smoot h and unbroken. My senses fully alert, I tried to see in the dim light. It was _ a wall, and I was lying against it with my shoulder. I imm e diately reasoned that I had gone to sleep and fallen out of bed. (I had never don e so before, but all sorts of strange things were happening, and falling out of bed was quite pos sible.) Then I look ed again. Something was wrong. This wall had no windows, no furniture against it, no doors. It was not a wall in my bedroom. Yet so mehow it wa s familiar. Identifi cation came instantly. It wasn't a wall, it was the ceiling. I was floating against the ceiling, bouncing gently with any movem ent I made. I rolled in the air, startled, and looke d down. There, in the dim light below me, was the bed. There were two figures lying in the bed. To the right was my wife. Besid e her was some one else. Both seemed aslee p."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"This was a strange dream, I thought. I was curious. Whom would I dream to be in bed with my wife? I looked more closely, and the shock was inte nse. I was the someone on the bed! My reaction was alm ost instantaneous. Here I was, there was my body. I was dying, this was death, and I wasn't ready to die. Somehow, the vibrations were killing m e. Desperately, like a diver, I swooped down to my body and dove in. I then felt the bed and the covers, and when I opened my eyes, I was looki ng at the room from the perspective of my bed. What had happened? Had I truly almost died? My heart was beating rapidly, but not unusually so. I move d my arms and legs. Eve rything see med normal The vibrations had faded away. I go t up and walked around the room, looked out the window, smoke d a cigarette. It was a long time before I had the courage to return to bed, lie down, and try to sleep. The following week I returne d to Dr. Gordon for another physical examination. I didn 't tell him the reason for the visit, but he could see I was worried. He carefully examin ed me, ran blood tests, fluoroscopes, electroc ardiograms, pal pated all cavities, ran urinalysis, a nd about everything else he could think of. He checked very carefully for indications of brain lesion s, and asked me many questio ns relating to motor action of various parts of the body. He arranged for an EEG (brain-wave analysis), which evidently showed no unusual problem. At least he never reported any to me, and I am sure he would have. Dr. Gordon gave me some tranquilizers, an d sent me home with orders to take off weight, smoke less, get more rest— an d said that if I had a problem, it was not a physical one. I met with Dr. Bradsh aw, my psychologist friend. He was even less helpful and far from sympathetic when I told him the story. He thought I should try to repeat the experie nce if I coul d. I told him I wasn't ready to die. \"Oh, I don't think you'll do that,\" Dr. Bradsh aw stated calmly. \"So me of the fellows who practice yoga and those Eastern religions claim they can do it whenever they want to.\" I aske d him \"do\" what. \"Why, get out of the physical body for a while,\" he re plied. \"They claim they can go all over the place. You ought to try it.\" I told him that was ridiculous. Nobo dy can travel arou nd without their physical body. \"Well, I wouldn't be too sure,\" Dr. Bradshaw replie d calmly. \"You ought to read something about the Hindus . Did you study an y philosophy in college?\" I said I had, but there was nothi ng I could recall about this traveling-without-the-body business. \"Maybe you did n't have the right philosophy professor, that's what it seems to me.\" Dr. Bradshaw lit a cigar, then looked at me. \"Well, don't be so closed- minded. Try it and find out As my old philosophy professor said, 'If you're blind in one eye, turn your head, and if you're blind in both eyes, then open your ears and listen.' \" I aske d what to do if you were deaf, too, but I didn't get a reply. Of course, Dr. Bradshaw had every reaso n to be casual about it. It was happening to me, not him. I don't know what I would have done without his pragmatic approach and his wonderful sense of humor. It is a debt I shall never b e able to repay. The vibrations came and went six more times before I got up the courage to try to"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"repeat the experie nce. When I did, it was an anticlimax. With the vibrations in full force, I thought of floating upward—an d I did. I smoothly floated up over the bed, and when I willed myself to stop, I did, floating in mid-air. It w as not a bad feeling at all, but I was nervous about falling suddenly. After a few secon ds I thought myself downward, and a moment later I felt myself in bed again with all normal physical senses fully operating. There had been no discontinuity in con scious ness from the moment I lay down in bed until I got up after the vibrations faded. If it wasn't real—just a halluci na tion or dream —I was in trouble. I could n't tell where wake-fulness stopped and dreaming began. There are thousands of people in men tal institu tions who have just that problem. The secon d time I attempted to disassoci ate deliberately, I was succe ssful. Again I went up to ceiling heigh t. However, th is time I experi enced an overwhelmi ngly strong sexual drive and could think of nothing else. Embarrassed and irri tated at myself because of my inability to control this tide of emotion, I returned back into my physical body. It wasn't until some five episodes later that I discovered the secret of such control. The evident import ance of sexua l ity in the whole subject is so great that it is covered in detail later. At the time, it was an exasp erating mental block which held me within the confines of the room where my physi cal body lay. With no other applicable termin ology, I b egan to call the condition the Second State, and the other, non-physical body we seem to possess the Second Body. So far this termin ology fits as well as anyth ing else. It wasn't until the first evidential exper ience which could be checked that I seriously considered these to be anything but daydream s, hallucinations, a neurotic aberratio n, the be ginnings of schizophrenia, fantasies cause d by self-hypnosis, or worse. That first evidential experience was indeed a sledge hammer blow. If I accepte d the data as fact, it struck hard at nearly all of my life experie nce to that date, my training, my concepts, and my sens e of values. Most o f all, it shatter ed my faith in the totality and certainty of our culture' s scientific knowledg e. I was sure our scientists had all the answers. O r most of them. Conversel y, if I rejected what was evident to me, if to no one else, then I would also be rejecting what I respecte d so greatly: that manki nd's emancipation and upward struggle depends chiefly upon his translation of the unknown into the known, through the use of his intellect and the scienti fic principl e. That was the dilem ma. It may have been truly the touch of a magic wand and a gift bestowe d I still don't know."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2. SEARCH AND RESEARCH What does one do when faced with an unknown? Turn away and forget about it? In this case, two factors negat ed that possibility. One was nothing more than curiosit y. The sec ond: how ca n one forget or ignore an elephant in the living room? Or more to the point, a ghost in the bedroom? On the other side of the scale were the conflicts and anxi eties, very real, very disturbi ng. There was no question that I was deeply afraid of what might happen to me if the \"con dition\" continued. I was much more concern ed about the possib ility of a growing mental illness than a physical dete rioratio n. I had studie d enough psychology and had enough psychologist and psychiatrist friends to comp ound such fears. Moreover, I was afraid to discuss the matter with these friends. I was afraid that I would then be classi fied as their \"patients,\" and lose the closen ess that equality (normalcy) brings. Non-professional friends in business and comm unity wou ld be worse. I would be labeled a freak or psychotic, which could seriously af fect my life and the lives of those close to me. Finally, it seem ed to be something to keep from my family. It seem ed unnecessary that they worry along with me. It was only the definite need to explain odd actions that forced the disclos ure to my wife. She accept ed it reluctan tly beca use there was no other real choice, and thus she became a worried witness to incidents and event s much in contradiction to her religious training . The children were then much too young to understand. (Later, the matter became commonplace to them. Away at college, my older daughter reporte d that after she and her roommate had looked around the empty dorm room one night, she said, \"Daddy, if you're here, I think you better go no w. We want to get undressed for bed.\" Actually, I w as two hundred miles away at the time, both physicall y and otherwise.) Gradually I bec ame more accustomed to this strange ad dition in my life. More and more, I was slowly able to control its movements. In a few ways it had actually become helpful. I had become reluctant to part with it. The mystery of its very presence had aroused my curiosit y. Even after I had determined that there was no physiologi cal cause, and that I was no more insane than most of my fellow men, the fears persisted. It was a defect, illness, or deformity that had to be hidden from \"normal\" people. There was no one to talk to about the problem, other than an occasi onal meeting with Dr. Bradshaw. The only other solution seemed to be some form of psychotherapy. But a year (or five or ten) of daily inte rviews costing thousands of dollars with no promis ed results didn't seem very efficient. It was very lonely in those early days . Finally, I bega n to exper iment with this strange aberration , keeping notes of each event. I also began to read in areas of study long neglected in my life pattern. Religion had not greatly influenced my thinking, yet it seem ed that this was the only remaining body of the writings a nd knowledge of man in which I coul d look for answers. Beyond childhood churchgoing and rare attendance with a friend, God and church and religion had meant little to me. In fact, I hadn't given the matter much thought one way or another, as it sim ply didn't evoke my interest In my super ficial reading of past and prese nt Western philosophies and religions, I found vague references and gen eralities. Some seemed to fit as somebody's attem pt to de scribe or explain similar incidents. Biblic al and Christian writings offered many of these, all without specific causes or cures. The best advice seemed to be to pray,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"meditate, fast, go to church, absolve my sins, accept the Trinity, believe in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, resist Evil, or resist no t Evil, and give myself to God. All of this did nothing but add to the conflict. If this new thing in my life was \"good,\" i.e., a \"gift,\" then it evidently belonged to saints, or at least saintly types, according to reli gious histor y. I felt that qualification for sainthood was cer tainly a bove and beyond me. If this new thing was \"evil,\" then it was the Work of the Devil, or, at the least, of a demon trying to posse ss or disp ossess me, and shoul d be exorcised. The orthodox minist ers of organized religion whom I met politely accepted the latter view to varying de grees. I got the feeling I was dangerous and heretical in their eyes. They were wary. In the Easte rn religions I found more accep tance of the idea, as Dr. Bradshaw had indicated. There was much talk of the existence of a non-physical body. Again, such a condi tion of being was the product of great spiritual development Only Masters, Gurus, and other long-trained Holy Men had the ability to leave their physical bodies temporarily to achieve indescribable mystical insights. There were no de tails, and no pragmatic expla nation of what was me ant by spiritual develop ment. Implied was that in the practices of secret cults, sects, lamaseries, etc., such details were com mon knowledge. If this were true, what or who was I? Certainly too old to start life anew in a Tibetan monastery. T he loneliness be came acute. Evidently, there were no answers. Not in our culture. It was at this point that I discovered the existence of an underground in the United States. The only fa ctor missing is that no laws exist aga inst its function nor is there official persecution and prosecution involved. This underground only occasio nally intermi ngles in part with the worlds of business, science, politics, academia, and the so-called arts. Further more, it definitely is not limited to the United States, but infiltrates all of Western civilization. Many people may have heard of it vaguely or ca sually have come in contact with it, and passed it off as just people with queer ideas. For one thing is usua lly certain: members of this underground who are respecte d in their communities don't talk about the interest or beliefs that qualify them for mem bership unless they know y ou too are in the club. They have learned from exper ience that to be outsp oken brings censur e —from their minister s, customers, employers, or even friends. I susp ect the membership may run into millions—if all would admit to their qualification. They are found in all walks of life: scientists, psychiatrists, physicians, housewives, college stude nts, businessmen, teen-agers, an d at least a few ministers in formal religions. This group meets all the qualifications of an underground movem ent. They gather in small groups, quietly and often semi- secretly. (The events are often publicly announced, but you have to be \"with it\" before you can understand the no tice.) Th e particip ants usually discuss affairs of the under ground only w ith other members. Other than family or close friends (who are probably also members), the community doesn't know of this secret interest and life of the under ground member. If you asked him, he would deny such mem bership because often he doesn't realize he really is so associat ed. All are to some degree emotionally and intellec tually dedicated to a cause. Finally, the underground has its own literature, language, technology, and to some exten t demig ods."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"At the moment, this undergroun d is highl y disorganized. In fact, there is no organization whatsoever in the usual sense of the word. Rarely, even, have the local groups gone so far as to adopt a title or nam e for thems elves. So far, they are simply small but regular gatherings held in someone's living room, or a bank's conference room, or quite possibly a church rector y. This group of individuals is groping in the dark and seem s to take many diverse pathways—yet the goal is the same for all. However, like other kinds of underground move ments, if you have become a member and you visit another city, you inevitably mee t other members. It isn't planned. It just \"h appens.\" Who comprises this undergroun d? First, the professionals. At one end are the parapsychologists, very few in number. These are men who have legitimat e doctor ates from recog nized universities, who have publicly con ducted research into ESP. The most well-known of these is Dr. J. B. Rhine , for merly of Duke University, who conducted and comp ounded simple statistical probability card tests fo r some thirty years. To his satisfaction, he proved statistically that ESP is fact. His results are looked upon dubiously and for the most part unacceptably by the majority of psychologists and psychia trists in the United States . There are others in the same categor y. Andrija Puharich, J. G. Pratt, Robert Crookall, Hornell Hart, Gardner Murphy all come under this classifi cation. If you are a member, these are familiar names. The professional spectru m runs the gamut from the para-psychologist to the roadsi de palmist who cl aims to be a gypsy or Ne w Delhi Indian, and who charges five dollars for a quick five-min ute stock \"reading.\" Areas of interest are quite di verse, but all have interconnecting bonds of common beliefs in one way or another. The mass underground looks to the professionals for in formation and guidanc e, and gives them something akin to hero worship. Anyone who W rites a Book, Organizes a Foun dation, Conducts Research, has a Majo r Experience , Studied with a Great Professional, Gives Psychic Readings, Conducts Classes in Mind and/or Soul Development, Heals by Faith, is an Accredite d Astrologer, Minister of Divine Science or Spiritu alism, Trance Medium, Outer-S pace Saucer. Devotee, Hypnotist—these are the professionals. Most derive all or part of their income from this activity. Many have deep professional jealousy for each other, and often are inclined to be suspicio us of techniques and theories propounded outside their particul ar activity. They may even subtly deride or look with tolera nt, superior amusement at results unrela ted to their specialty. This could well explain why, as of now, there is no organizatio n in the underground. Yet, in spite of themselves, the professionals are drawn to one another. Their common interest forces this. There are no others with whom they can share their thoughts and expe riences as equals and with understanding. This is not in any w ay intended to cast aspersi ons or dis credit upon the professionals. They are a completely fasci nating and wonderful group of people. Each in his own way, whatever it may be, is seeking after Truth. What a dull world it would be without them once you have become a member of the underground. For the underground consu mer, there are magazines, news papers, lectures, book clubs (at lea st fifty new und erground books are published each year, many by top houses), and even TV and radio programs. The latter, evidently put to gether by overeage r members, have not been successf ul be cause the undergroun d is still very much a minority g roup. The basic public reaction is: \"You don't really believe in that"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"stuff, do you?\" Who, then, make s up the mass of this underground? Con trary to what one might expect, they are not merely a con glomerate of silly, uneducated, super stitious, unreasoning misfits. True, some of the like are included, but at no greater percentage than is found in the general population. As a matter of fact, if it could be surveyed, it is quite proba ble that their average IQ would be far above that of a general cross sect ion of Western humanity. The common bond or cause that draws them together is sim ple. All have a belief that (1) man's Inner Self is neither understood nor fully expressed in our contemporary society; an d (2) this Inner Self has capabilities to act and perform mentally and materially to a degree unknown and unrec og nized by modem science. These are people whose prime avocation is to read, talk, think, discuss, and partici pate in anything \"psychic\" or \"spiritual.\" This is all that is nee ded for membership. Perhaps you are in the club and didn't realize it How do these people \"get\" that way? The most common answer is to experience or be a part of some phenomenon that cannot be explain ed by modem scienti fic, philosophic, or reli gious teachi ngs. One type of perso n shrugs it off, sweeps it under the rug, and forgets about it. The other, who eventually be comes a member, tries to find some answer s. I qualifi ed for membership because I coul dn't find any other source of information. Unfortunately, the information I was looking for was very sparse indeed, even in this strange new-old world. But at least there were those who seriously consid ered the possibility that the Second State could and did happen. It soon became apparent that the underground started more than a hundred years ago, or earlier, when present-day science began to organize man's concepts and rid them of unreasoning, unsupported \"knowledge.\" In such efforts to purify, anyth ing that did not or had not yet met the test of empiricism was ruthlessly discarde d by intellectual leader ship. Those who continued to hold any of the discarded beliefs fell into disrepu te. If they stu bbornly persisted and still wi shed to be active and accepted in society, they ha d no choice but to go underground with their secret ideas while maintaining another image publicly. Man y who refused to practice this deceit became Martyrs. To date, in this enlighte ned society, the same attitude still exists to a very great extent. Of the professionals who are known by their fellows as proponents of parapsychology or anything similar , there may be five who s till command ad miration and respect publicly from their profession, be it medicine, psychology, psychiatr y, or the physical science s. At this stage, I believe I have met all five. Sadly, I am little wiser, through no fault of theirs. They just do n't know muc h about the Second State or Seco nd Body. Most o f all, I enjoy the people I have met in the under ground. I've found them in small towns, big ci ties, in busi ness, in church groups, in universities, and even in the American Psychiatric Associ ation! As a rule, they are truly gentle people. They are jolly, with a warm sense of humor. They are a happy group who can laugh when necess ary at their own serious interest. Whether intentionally or not, they are the most altruistic and empathetic cross sect ion of hu manity I have known. It mu st be no accident that they are the most religious in the true sense of the word. If this appears to be a curt dismissa l of all other sources and materi al uncovered in the \"psych ic\" writings a vailable, it is no t so intended. Each has its own version of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Truth, and perhaps there are indeed many Truths. I have sat in seances with trance mediums and asked definite questions, received vague answers w hich were to me pure evasions when a straightforward reply would have meant so much. Yet, later, to my astonishment, in one such case I participated in a Second Body exper iment that verified (to me and others) the authenticity of this medium's ability. Truth here is truly a mystery! The work of Edgar Cayce, virtually a latter-day saint in the psychic world, was without doubt most evidential and well investigated , but unbelievable in terms of presen t-day scienc e and medicine. Most de finitely, here was truth un folding, and history may not record it except in some dim archives. Today, some twenty years a fter his death, no more is known as to how his ability w orked and what it was than on the day he died. Cayce's readings were help ful, but are exceed ingly di fficult to bring into concret e focus as they relate to Second State existence . He confirmed it, but did not explain. Much of his materi al in this area is cloud ed by the haze of a strong reli gious conditioning. This leaves it open to interpretation, so Cayce translators (ministers?) have sprung up to provide such intercessio n. There are others even now who evidently can perform similar ly to Cayce. One gave quite accurat e physical reports of me, and provided some general data on my Second State activities which were neither enlighte ning nor provable. They did convince me of the validity of her ability, b y all means. Again, another Truth (to me and others who participat ed), but no direct answers that could be used in a court of law. Several \"psychics\" performed \"life readings\" for me. They included wide generalizations, but were unable to give dire ct, straightforward answers to simple questio ns. If genuin e (and who am I to say they ar e not?) these psychics must be defi nitely limited in their specif ic perception. Either that, or they sutler problems in translation from symbols to articulati on. I can well appreciate how this latter might occur. It was in my readings and conta cts with this branch of human thought I fondly call the undergrou nd that I finally found strong glimmerings of what was happening to me. If I hadn't been involved personally, I would not have believed what I found. At the same time, it was comforting to discover that I was not unique. What was it all about? Simply, I was per forming \"astral projection.\" Dr. Brads haw ha d given me the clue, although he himself had heard about such things only remot ely. As tral projection, to the uninitiated, is a term given to the technique of leaving one's physical body te mporarily an d moving abo ut in a non-material or \"astral\" body. Man y con notations have been given the word \"astral,\" and many inter pretati ons, scienti fic and otherwise. The word \"scient ific\" is used cautiously, because the modern scienti fic world, in the West, at least, neither recognizes nor is seriously aware of even the possibility of such things. In the obscure histor y of mankind, it is an entirely dif ferent matter. The word \"astral\" has dim origins in early mystical and occult events which involve witchcraft, sorcer y, incanta tions, and other seeming foolishness which modem man looks upon as silly and super stitious nonsense. As no attempt was ma de to delve deeply into this area, I still do n't know what the word \"astral\" means. Thus I prefer to stick to the terms \"Second Body\" and \"Second State.\" This type of literature, which still flo urishes, depicts an astral world composed of many levels or pla nes, which is where people go wh en they \"die.\" The person who"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"travels around in his astral body can make short visits to these places, talk with \"dead\" people, participa te in activities \"there,\" and come back to tie physical body apparently non e the worse for wear. There have been times when I have fervently hoped (prayed!) for the latter to be true. In order to perform this miraculous feat, one had to be arduously trained, or, better still, \"spiritu ally develop ed,\" accor ding to the occultists. These teachings have supposedly been handed down secretl y through histor y to enlight en those who had become advanc ed enough to receive them. Evidently, from time to time, there were those who r evealed the secre t or accid ently learn ed the technique. In the past, they have been canonized, castigated, cremated, laugh ed at, and locked up for such public revelation. This doesn't make the future seem very promising, in my case. Parad oxically, much of the data contained in my notes tends to confirm this occult approach to the subject—which came as quite a shock. Using liberal interpret ation and trans lation into the modern idiom, much of it fell neatly int o place. Also, much was left unsai d, although I do not know w hy. Accordi ng to the literature of the psychic underground, the religious-mystical history of man const antly makes reference to this Second Body. Lon g before Christianity and the Bible appeared, cultures in Egypt, Indi a, and China , to name a few, held the Second Body idea as stand ard operating proced ure. Historians have found these references again and again, but evidently consigned them to the mythology of the times. If one reads the Bible from this point of view, the belief is conf irmed many times in both the Old and New Testa ments. In the Catholic Church are found consiste nt reports of saints and other religious figures having such experienc es, some of them willfully. Even in Protest antism, devout fol lowers have reported the out-of-body experie nce during some form of religious ecstasy. In the Orient, the concept of a Second Body has long held a natural and accep ted position of reality. Again, this is an entire study in itself, and there are numerous undergrou nd books and authorities on oriental cultures that affirm the concept of a Second Body. There are supposed to be in exist ence today those adepts, lamas, monks , gurus, and the like who exercise mental and physical powers—including Second Body activity—that are completely at odds with present sci entific knowledge. Largel y, these have been ignored in our materialistic society be cause they can 't be duplicated in the laboratory. In the files of various psychic research organizatio ns here and abroad, there are hundreds of case-histo ry repo rts of out-of-body experie nces. Such reports go back at least a hundred years, and many more are found in various writings of the past. They are there for anyon e who wishes to investigate the phenomenon. Virtually all of such reporte d experiences are spontaneous one-time-only eve nts. Usually, they have come at a time when the individu al was either physicall y ill or debilitated, or during an intense emotional crisis. All seem to be highly sub jective, yet the great mass of these reports is evidential in it self. During this century, se veral impressive collecti ons of these experiences have been published and should be re - quired reading if one pursues the subject. The weakness in all of them is apparent: most are basically reportorial, sup plemented by conjecture. No specifics based upon direct examin ation or expe rimentation are includ ed. Reason? Evi dently, there has been no such solid research performed. In very rare instanc es there are published records of in dividuals who could"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"deliberately and willfully induce the Second State and move about in their Second Body. There may be more, but only t wo stan d out in recent history . If others have and are performing this act, they have kept the results to themselves. The first of these is Oliver Fox, an Englishman who was acti ve in psychic research and practices. He published fairly detailed reports of out-of-body experie nces and techniq ues for achieving th is state. Except in the undergrou nd of 1920, his work receive d little attention. Yet he very definitely attempted to bring t he experience into the framewor k of un derstanding of his era. The secon d and most well-known was Sylvan Muldoo n, who publis hed several works on the subject in collaboration with Hereward Carrington, over the period 1938-51. Mul doon was the \"projectionist\" and Carrington was a consiste nt researcher in psychic phenomena. To date, their books have been the classics in the field, and offer interesting reading. In my after-the-fact investigation, I again wondered at much that obviously had been omitted. Also, little or no empir ical experim ental tests we re made to provide data for a serious yet obje ctive investiga tor. The most recent has been a book by the author Yram. (A woman ? Mary backwar d?) It too offered several clues, but no solid continuity relating to my case. Signific ant attem pts at scienti fic study and evaluation have been made recently b y several noteworthy men, such as Hornell Hart, Nandor Fodor, Robert Crookall, and others with good academic backgrounds. Most of these are relativel y free of the distorting factors present in so much of the under ground literature, and their titles will be found along with other recent publications in the Bibliography. All serve to verify the fact of the existence of the Second Body, bu t bring f orth little or no concrete data at the experimental, non-philosophic level. Again, how ca n one discuss experim ents that have not taken place? The most consiste nt problem encountered in associati ng with the underground has been to avoid submergence of the analytical approach in the vast morass of theological thought and belief. Once, not too long ago, man thought electri city was God; before that, the sun, lightning, and fire. Our science s told us these ideas were ridiculous, and tried to show us through experim entation. Perhaps the Second Body operat ing in the Second State can provide the quant um jump to prove God empiric ally. Th en there will be no more under ground. The psychic undergroun d provided me with many new fr iends, but few speci fic answers to such questions as, What do I do now? To my surprise, they look ed to me for answers. There appeared to be only one remai ning path to take. Hundr eds of experiments spread over twelve years, and still conti nuing, have brought forth conclusions that seem ines capable yet alien to my environmental conditioning. In the material to come, the test will be yours."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"3. ON THE EVIDENCE In the fall of 1964 an interesti ng meeting was held one eve ning in Los Angeles. It was comp osed of some twenty asso rted psychiatrists, psychologists, scientists, et al —and my self. It was a most rewarding evening. The purpose of the meeting was to examin e with sincer ity and seriousn ess Hie experie nces and experiments which have been condensed herein. After several hours of interrogation by the group, it was my turn. I asked two simpl e questions of each of them: \"If you were going through what I have been experiencing, what would you do?\" It was the definite opinion of the majority—more than two thirds—th at every effort should be made to continue, such experimentation in the hope of enlight ening and ex panding man's knowledg e of himself. Several half seriou sly stated that I shou ld run, not walk, to the nearest psychiatrist. (None presen t offered his services.) The secon d question: \"Would you, personally, take part in experime nts that would lead to the creation of such unu sual activity in yourself?\" Here, the pattern changed somewh at. About half stated their willingness to particip ate. Oddly, i n this group were some of those who were most skeptic al of the reality of such experi ences. Of course, this gave me the opportunity to nudg e gently those who w ere in favor of continued exper i ments. When it cam e to the dive into the cold, strange waters, let some one else do it And in many ways, I don't blame them. If presented to me twelve years ago, I doubt that I would have volunteered. Why did the group bother to assem ble? Curiosity, perhaps. Or again, it may have been some of the evidential material that had been accumul ated, I hope the latter. Here are some of the key reports from the notes, which aroused their interest. 9/10/58 Afternoon Again, I floated upward, with the intent of visiting D r. Bradshaw and his wife. Realizing that Dr. Brads haw was ill in bed with a cold, I thought I would visit him in the bed room, which was a room I had not seen in his house and if I could describe it later, could thus document my visit. Again came the turning in air, the dive into the tunnel, and this time the sensation of going up hill (Dr. and Mrs, Brad shaw li ve in a house some five miles from my office, up a hill). I w as over trees and there was a light sky above. Mome ntarily, I saw (in the sky?) a figure of a round ed human form, seem ingly dressed in robes and a headpiece on his head (an oriental conce pt remains), sitting , arms in lap, perhaps cross-le gged a la Buddha; then it faded. I don't know the meaning of this. After a while, the uphill travel became difficult, and I had the feeling that the energy was leaving, and I felt I wouldn't make it. With this thought, an amazing th ing happened. It felt precisely as if some one had placed a hand under each arm and lifted me. I felt a surge of lifting power, and I rushed quickl y up the hill. Then I cam e upon Dr. and Mrs. Brad-show. Th ey were outsid e the house, and for a moment I was confused, as I had reach ed them before I got to the house. I didn't understand this beca use Dr. Brads haw was sup posed to be in bed. Dr. Bradshaw was dre ssed in light overcoat and hat, his wife in a dark coat and all dark cloth es. They were coming toward me, so I stopped. They seemed in good spir its, and walked past me unseeing, in the direction of a small er building, like a garage, Brad trailing behind as they wa lked. I floated around in front of them, waving, trying to get their attention without result. Then without turning his head, I thought I hear d Dr. Bradshaw say to me, \"Well, I see you don't need help any more. \" Thinking I had made contact, I dove back into the ground (?), and returned to the office, rotate d into the body and opened my eyes."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Everything was just as I had left it. The vibration was still pr esent, but I felt I had enough for one day. Important aftermath: We phoned Dr. and Mrs, Brads haw tha t evening. I made no statement other than to ask where they were betwee n four and five that afternoon. (My wife, upon hearing of the visit, said flatly it was not possibl e, could not be so because Dr. Brads haw was hom e in bed sick.) With Mrs. Bradsh aw on the phone, I asked the simple question . She stated that roughly at four twenty-five they w ere walk ing out of the house toward the garage. She was going to the post office, and Dr. Bradshaw had decided that perhaps some fresh air might help him, and had dresse d and gone along. She knew the time by back- checki ng from the time they ar - rived at the post office, which was twenty minutes to five. It takes roughl y fifteen minutes to drive to the post office from their house. I had come back from my trip to them at approxim ately four twenty-seven. I aske d what they we re wearing . Mrs. Bradsh aw stated she was wearing black slacks, and a red sweater which was covered with a black car coat. Dr. Brads haw was wearing a light hat and a light- colore d top coat. However, neither \"saw\" me in any w ay or were aware of my presence. Dr. Bradshaw had no memory of saying any thing to me. The great poi nt is that I had expect ed to find him in bed, and didn't. The coinci dences involved were too much. It was not import ant to prove this to anyon e else. Only to me. It proves to me—truly for the first time—that there might well be more to this than normal science and psychology and psychiatry allow—more than an aberration , trauma, or hall ucination— and 1 needed some form of proof more than anyon e else, I am sure. It is a simple incident, but unforgettable. In this visit to Dr. Bradsh aw and his wife, the time of visit coinci des with the physical event. The autosuggestion halluc ination factor is negative. I expect ed to find Dr. Brad shaw in bed in the house, but did not do so and was puzzled by the inconsistency.

(4) Indeterminate, may have observed both in similar dress, but expected to find only one (Dr. Brads haw), in bed clothes. 3/5/59 Morning In a motel in Winston-Salem: I woke up early and went out to have breakfast at seven-thirty, then returne d to my room about eight-thirt y and lay down. As I relaxed, the vibrations came and then an impression of movement. Shortly therea fter, I stopped, and the first thing 1 saw was a boy walking alo ng and tossing a baseball in the air and catch ing it. A quick shi ft, and I saw a man trying to put some thing into the back seat of a car, a large sedan. The thing was an awkward-looki ng device that I"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"interpret ed to be a small car w ith wheels and electr ic motor. The man twisted and turned the device and finally got it into the back seat of the car and slamm ed the door. Another quick shi ft, and I was stan d ing beside a table. There were peo ple sitting aroun d the table, and dishes covered it. One person was dealing what looked like large white playing cards around to the others at the table. I thought it strange to play cards at a table so covered with dishe s, and wondered about the overlarge size and whiteness of the cards. Another quick shi ft, and I was over cit y streets, about five hundred feet high, looking for \"home\" Then 1 spotted the radio tower, an d remem bered that the motel was close to the tower, and almost instant ly I was back in my body. I sat up and looked around. Every thing seem ed norma l. Important aftermath: The same evening, I visited some friends, Mr. and Mrs. Agnew Bahnson, at their home. They were partially aware of my \"activities,\" and on a sudden hunchr I knew t he morni ng event had to do with them. I aske d about their son, and they called him into the room and asked him what he was doi ng between eight-thirt y and nine that morning. He said he was going t o schoo l. When asked more specifically what he was doi ng as he went, he said he was tossing his baseball in the air and catching it. (Althoug h I knew him well, I had no knowledge that the boy was in terested in baseball, although this could be assum ed.) Next, I decided to speak about the loading of the car. M r. Bahnson was asto unded. Exactl y at that time, he told me, he was loadi ng a Van DeGraff generator into the back seat of his car. The generator was a large, awkward device with wheels, an electric motor, and a platform. He showed me the device. (It was eerie to see physicall y some thing you had observed only fro m the Second Body.) Next, I told about the table and the large white cards. His wife -was excited at this on e. It seems that for the first time in two years, be cause they had all arisen late, she had brought the morni ng mail to the breakfast table and had passed out the letters to them as she sorted the mail. Large white playing cards! They were very excited over the event, and I am sure they were not humoring me. In this morning visit to Mr. Bahnson and his family, the time of visit coinci des with actual events. Autosuggestio n hallucination, negative; no consci ous intent of visit, although unconscious motivation possible.

In our attem pts to find some answers, anywhere, we had come in contact with Mrs. M., who purportedly had mediumistic powers. I have and still have the highest regard for her as a perso n of great kindn ess and integrity. However, in two \"sittings\" in which we par ticipate d, I came away with the definite impression that Mrs. M.t although deeply sincer e, was acting out some form of split perso nality when she went into a trance. The \"guides\" who took over her body(?) and spoke through her vocal cords were to me nothing more or less than mani festations of this. This implied not that I thought Mrs. M. delib erately created this illusion, but that it happened as a result of a self-induced hypnotic state, and she truly had no knowledge of what took place, I was sure that in no way was Mrs. M. attempting to \"fake.\" She wasn't and isn't that type of person. What left me unconvinced was that when I had asked her guides— her dead husband and an American Indian—certain questio ns as they spoke through her, I receive d evasive re plies. The best I could get was, \"You will discover this through your own sources.\" This at the time seem ed to me to be a simple way to avoid an answer that could be veri fied in other ways. It is important that 1 point out my co m - plete skepticism of Mrs. M. and her guides. Yet what happened last night and the report today utterly confuses me. R.G., a friend of Mrs. M., had suggested that I attem pt to \"visit\" a seance to be held by Mrs. M. in a New York apartment Friday nigh t (last night). I half agreed, stat ing that I certainly wasn't sure that it was possi ble. Frankl y, when Friday night came, the meeting had slipped my mind (conscio usly at least). Here is what took place . After a norma l evening at home, my wife and I went up to bed around eleven-thirty. My wife fell asleep almost immediately, as I coul d tell from her steady, de ep breath ing. As I lay there, evidently dee ply relaxed and possibly half- asleep, I suddenly felt that \"walking over your grave\" coldness and the hairs on the back of my neck started to rise. I looked across the half-darkened roomt fearful yet utterly fascinated. I don't know w hat I expe cted, but stand ing in the doorway leading from the hall was a white ghost like figure. It actually looked like the traditional figure of a ghost—some six feet tall as it stood there, with a flowing shee tlike material draping it from its hea d to the fioor. One hand was reaching out and holding onto the door jamb. I was comp letely frightened, and I had no chance to con nect the figure with anything I had done. The moment it be gan to move toward me, I cringed in half-terror and at the same time felt I had to see what it was. Almos t immediately I felt hands place d over my eyes so I coul dn't see. I kept putting the hands away in spite of my fear until"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"finally the ghostlike form was beside the bed, not a foot away from me. Then someone took hold of my upper arms, gently, and I moved up out of the bed. With this, I calme d down, evidently bec ause I felt that whatever it w as, it was friendly. I didn't struggle or resist. Immediately, the re was a quick se nse of movement and we (I then felt there were two of them, one on each side) were suddenly over a small room, as if we were looking down on it from the ceiling. In the room below w ere four women. I looked at the two beings on each side of me. One was a blond male, the other dark-haired, almost oriental. Both seem ed to be quite young, in their early twenties. They were smiling at me. I spok e to them and said they would have to excuse my attitudes as I was unc ertain of what I was doing. Then I floated down to the only empty chair and sat down in it. A tall large woman in a dark suit sat opposite me. A woman in what looked like an ankle-length white robe sat next to me. The other two were indisti nct. A woman's voice asked if I would remem ber that I had been there, and I assur ed her that I certainly w ould. Another woman said some thing about cancer, but that is all I could get. Then one of the women (the one in the dark suit) came over and swung over the side of my chair, and draped her self right on top of me! I didn't feel her weight, but for some reason, she got up suddenly. There was laughter, but my mind was on other things. Evidently, the contact with the woman who sat on top of me had altered things. Just at that moment, I heard a male voice said, \"I think he's been away long enough; we'd better take him back. \" I was torn between going and staying, but didn't argue. Almost instantly, I w as back lying in my bed and that was it —except that my wife had been awake during the entire time. She stated that I alternately gasped, made moaning and -whimpering noises, and then seem ed to do little or no breathing at all. Other than that, she hadn't seen or hear d anything, except that our cat aslee p in the room had awak ened and had been extremely ne rvous. My wife was quite up set and worried. I'm sure 1 would have been too, if I had gone through the same with her. The \"meeting\" certainly des erved checking, so I phoned R.G. and discove red several things. First, there were four women at the stance. At my request, they were gathered together at the same apartment (very small living room) wearing the same clothes. The woman in the dark suit was of identical build as I saw, and she inadvertently \"sat\" in the chair \"reserved\" for me. This had taken place later in the eve ning, after eleven- thirty, when the stance had been long over, and the four were sitting aroun d talking. The tall woman had jumped up out of \"my\" chair when the rest called out, \"Don't sit on Bob!\" They laugh ed at the joke. One of the other women had worn a long white housecoat. The words about my remembering were not spoke n orally (that super mind com-munication again?), but one of the women had stated she was working at Cancer Memorial Hospital the following day. I had met the other two women previously, M rs. M. and R.G., but the two herein described were then strangers to me. Four women, the clothes of two, the build of one, the sitting in the chair, the sitting o n top of me and jumping up, the laught er, the small room, the \"cancer\" reference—that's too much co incidence even for me, and beyond my ability to hallucinate that properly. I'm convinced. But the two men. Does Mrs. M. truly comm unicate with her dead husband and an Indian? I didn't know u ntil after ward that he had been a blond!

R.W., a busi nesswom an whom I know quite well through long work as sociati on, and a close friend aware of my \"activities'' (but somewhat skeptical still, in spite of rather unwilling participa tion), has been away this week on her vacation up on the New Jerse y coast. I do not know exactl y where she is vaca tioning other than that. Nor did I inform her of any plan ned experiment, simply bec ause I hadn't thought of it until today (Satu rday). This afternoon, I lay down to renew expe ri mentation, and decided I would make a strong effort to \"visit\" R.W. wherever she was. (Rule one in my case always has been that I am most success ful going to someone I know •well—an d the opportunity does not come up too often.) I lay down in the bedroom about three in the afternoon, went into a relaxatio n pattern, felt the warmth (high or der vibrations), then thought heavily of the desire to \"go\" to R.W. There was the familiar sensation of movement through a light blue blurred area, then I was in what seemed to be a. kitchen. R.W. was seate d in a chair to the right. She had a glass in her hand. She was looking to my left, where two girls (about seventeen or eighteen, one blond and one bru nette) also were sitting, each with glasses in their hands, drinking something. The three of them were in conve rsa tion, but I could not hear what they were saying. I first approached the two girls, directl y in front of them, but I could not attract their attention.

I said that this time I was going t o make sure that she remembered. \"I will remember, I'm sure I will\" R.W. said, still in oral conve rsation simult aneously. I state d that I had to be sure she would remem ber, so I was going to pinch her. \"Oh, you don't need to do that, Til remember\" R.W. said hastily. I said I had to be sure, so I reach ed over and tried to pinch her, gently, 1 thought. I pinched her in the side, just ab ove the hips and below the rib cage . She let out a good loud \"Ow,\" and I backe d up, because I was som ewhat surprised. I really hadn't expecte d to be able actual ly to pinch her. Satisfied that I had made some impressi on, at the least, I turned and left, thought of the physical, and was back almost immediately. I go t up (physically !), and went over to the typewriter where I am now. R. W. will not be back until Monday, and then I can determine if I made the contac t, or if it was another unidentifiable miss. Time of return, three thirty-five. Important aftermath: It is T uesday after the Saturday of the experim ent. R.W. returne d to work yesterday, an d I asked her what she had been doing Saturday afternoon be tween three and four. Knowing my reaso n for asking, she said she would have to think about it and let me know on Tues day (today). Here is what she reporte d today: On Saturday between three and four was the only tim e there was not a crowd of people in the beach cottage where she was staying. For the first time, she was alon e with her niece (dark-haired, about eighteen) and the niece 's friend (about the same age, blond). They were in the kitchen-dining area of the cottage from about three-fifteen to four, and she was having a drink, and the girls were having Cokes. They were doing nothing but sitting an d talking. I aske d R.W. if she remem bered anything else, and she said no. I questioned her more closely, but she could not remem ber anything more. Finally, in impatience, I asked her if she remembered the pinch. A look of compl ete astonishment crossed her face. \"Was that you?\" She stared at me for a moment, then went into the privacy of my office, turned, and lifted (just sli ghtly!) the edge of her sweater where it joine d her skirt on her left side. There were two bro wn and blue marks at exactly the spot where I had pinch ed her. \"I was sitting there, talking to the girls\" R.W. said, \"when all of a sudden I felt this terrible pinch. 1 must have jumped a foot. I thou ght my brother-in-law had come back and sneaked up behind me. I turned aroun d, but there was no one there. I never h ad any ide a it was you!

THE HERE-NOW One of the most common quest ions that arises during any discussi on of the Second Body and the Second State is: Where do you go? In evaluation of all exper iments, there evolved what seem ed to be three Second State environments. The first of these was identified as Locale I, for lack of a better nomenclature. More appropriately, it coul d be called the \"Here-Now.\" Locale I is th e most believab le. It consists of people and places that actually do exist in the material, well-known world at the very moment of the experiment. It is the world repre sented to us by our physical senses which most of us are fairly sure does exist. Visits to Locale I while in the Second Body sho uld not contain strange beings, events, or plac es. Unfamiliar, perhaps, but not strange and unknown. If the latter is the case, then perception is distorted. Thus it is th at the only evi dential results provable by stan dard methods of confirmation have taken place while moving a bout via the Second Body in Locale I. All of the ex periments in Cha pter 3 were made in Locale I. Even so, these and others in the same categor y are pitifully few in propor tion to all the recorded experim ents. On the surface, it see ms quite simple. Get out of the physical and into the Second, then go visit George and make contact, come back into the physical and report. Nothing to it If only it we re that easy! Yet the factors present that make it difficult are recognizable. Recognitio n of a problem pre sumes an eventual solution one way or another, and perhaps it will be so in this field. Let us take first the factors of direction and identification. Suppose, for exam ple, fully consci ous and in your physical body, you were able to soar through the air rather than walk on the ground or ride in a car. You discovere d this ability, an d decided to fly over to George's house to demonstrate how it works. Your hous e or your laboratory is on the out skirts of a large city. George lives in a subdivision on the other side of town. On a sunny afternoon, you start o ff. Naturally, y ou rise high in the air so as to avoid obstacl es of trees, buildings, etc. Uncertain, you don't go too high. You want to be able to rec ognize landm arks which might be difficult to see from five thousand feet. Therefore, you stay low, abo ut a hundred feet off the ground. Now, which way to go. You look for points of familiarity. It is at that moment you realize you have a problem. You don't have a compass course to Geo rge's house, and it wouldn't do you any good if you did. You don't have a compass. Undaunted, you decide to cut across the city, using the familiar buildings and streets as guide posts. You have driven the route many times, so you shou ld find your way easily. You start o ff over hous es and streets, and almost immedi ately you become confused. The familiar has suddenly be come unfamiliar. You look back, and you have difficulty finding your own house even at close range. It takes a mo ment to realize why this is so. You have been earthbound, and your entire point of view has been from a level of less than six feet. Most of the time, we habitually look straight ahead or down ward. Only occasi onally do we look up, when some thing attracts our attention. Even such an upward-looking angle of vision has little relations hip to looking down from one hundred feet. How long would it take for you to recog nize your own home if you were shown a photograph taken from directly overhead? The same applies to all \"familiar\" surroundings, streets, buildings, cities, and people. You may get to George's house, but it will take you a long time. You may no t identify"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"it from a distan ce of fifty feet because you know only the appearance of the front of his house, and you approach it from the back. It is not a failing peculiar to you. Pilots of aircraft, their attention diverted for a moment, have become \"lost\" within two miles of the airport when flying at low level in bright daylight. For a mo ment, everything below is co mpletely unfamiliar. Only navi gational instruments can bring the quick orientation needed. It is easy to see how this problem can be compounded when your frien d George lives in another city some distanc e away, where you have never v isited, and when you have not seen pictures of the house. Of course, if he painted a fluo rescent yellow \"X\" on the roof, with a ten-million-candle-power beacon of light, with similar markers on streets and highways along the route, you just might make it. Now let's take the same trip in the Second Body and ex amine it comparatively. Again, you are overhead one hun dred feet, floating in the air, this time with no physical body. It is a bright sunny day, but your \"see ing\" is somewh at im paired. You still are not fully accusto med to the technique of \"how\" you are seeing. As a result, your vision is disto rted in one way or another. You can work your wa y slowly from over your home to George's house much as you would if in the physical body. It would be the same slow process under less favorable visual conditions. There is a better, faster way. Happily, the re seem to be built-in directional senses if their use can be mastered. The \"if\" is the catch. As noted elsewhere, you \"think\" of the perso n at the end of your destination—never a place, but a perso n—and use the method prescribe d. In a few mo ments, you are there. You can watch the landscape move under you if you wish, but it's a little discon certing when you rush head long toward a building or tree and go right through it. In order to avoid such traumas, forget about seeing during the traveling process. You never quite get over the physical-bo dy conditioning that such things are solid. At least I have not. I still have the tendency to move in the direction of the door to leave, only to realize again the situatio n when my Second Body hand goes through the doorknob. Irritated with my - self, I then dive through the wall rather than the door to rein force my awareness of the Second State charact eristics. In conju nction with this conveni ent homing instinct that is una ffected by dista nce, you are faced with a further problem, which is that the automatic navigational system is too ac curate. It works by what and of whom you think. Let one small stray thought emerge dominantly for just one micro secon d, and your course is deviated. Add to this the fact that your conscious mind may be in conflict with the super consci ous as to what should be that destination, and you can begin to appreciate why so many experim ents to produc e Locale I evidential data have ended in failure. It some times causes one to ponder how there have been any such results when the difficulties are considered. As an experiment, try to concentrate for just on e minute upon a single action or event or thing which you \"dislike\" emoti onally and intellectually (the superconscious expressing its will) without the intrusio n of any un related thought. It takes something more than practice, as you will discover. Here are some examp les of misdirection, cause d by an in terrupting thought, taken from the notes: 4/12/63 Late Afternoon Temp. 40s, humidity low, bar ometer high.

Th en I stopp ed. 1 looked to see where I was, and found I was sitting on the edge of the roof of a two-story house, with what seemed to be the back yard below me. There was a woman working in the yard, with a broom in her hand. As I watched, she turned to walk into the house. Just as she was about to enter, something made her look up di rectly at me. With a frighte ned start, she scuttled into the house, slamm ing the door. I felt that I shoul d leave, embar rassed at having frighte ned the woman. I used the physical moveme nt return signal, and came back easily, ent ering the physical without difficulty. Time away, seven minutes, ten secon ds. Comment: Wonder what she saw sitting on the eave.

There was no answer to my quer y, and I sensed wari ness and cauti on on their parts. I asked again, and the boy turned and evid ently was about to reply when one of the men said, \"Don't tell him!\" Evidently, they were afraid of me f or some reaso n. I apol ogized for m y nervo usness and expl ained I was still new to the non- physical busin ess, turned, and left, not wishing to make them uncomfortable. Return to physical uneventful. Time away, eigh teen minutes. Comment : No con - nectio n with Dr. Puharich's activities at the time, as he re ports. Wrong destin ation again, no valid ation possibl e. Why does my presenc e create such fear? This inability to control desti nation has been and still re mains the chief barrier to the prod uction of consiste ncy and repeat ability.

I asked her where she lived and what year it wa s, but she could n't give me an answer so I turned to the two on the bed.

I asked them what year it w as, but they didn't seem to understa nd (no time conc ept in the superconscious?). I conc entrated on the man, and asked his name and where he lived. He replie d nervously. 1 moved away as he became more distur bed, and look ed out the window for area identific ation. Outside the window was a small roof, such as over a porch. Bey ond was a street, with many trees and a grassy island strip in the middle. There was a car parke d at the curb, a dark-colore d sedan. I sens ed a need to return to the physical, and turne d back to the three people. I asked if the y would like to see me \"take off\" and the little girl w as eager, and the two adults appeared relieved . I used stretch tech nique, shot up throu gh the ceiling, and returne d to the physic al without problems. Reaso n for recall: Throat dry from oral breat hing. Time away, forty-two minutes. Comme nt: Through a check by phone, I have locate d this fami ly at the address which the man gave me. W ould it be appr opriate to visit them physic ally on some pretext? From th is, it can be seen that a much more exte nsive and organized effort would be required for massive valid ation of Seco nd Body activities in Loca le I. One subject and seve ral assorte d scien tists and psych iatrists are not enough. Also, it can be noted that unexpected visits to unpr epared perso ns can't be helped at this stage of control. Perhaps much could be gained if such people coul d be interviewed as to what they saw and felt at the time of the intrusio n. The difficulty lies in loca ting these people. It is the exce ption that enough data is ob tained to identify the plac e visited , as in the above. Also, it is i nteresting when possibl e to determine the in consistencies of obser vation of Locale I activities while in the Sec ond State. Excep t in unusual insta nces, most \"visu al\" input registe rs in sha dings of black and white.'This seems true under any lighti ng condi tions. However, strong light and shadow create wrong perceptions. For example, a strong light reflect ing from the dark hair of a man brings the impres sion that he is blon d rather than dark. F or examp le, from the notes: 5/5/61 Temp. 6os, humidity high, barometer medium, physicall y neutral. After dinner, early even ing, in planned attempt to visit D r.

There was a man sitting at the table , writin g on paper. He resemble d Dr. Pu harich, but he was more light or blo nd-haired. I greet ed him, an d he looked up and smiled , then stated that he would spend more time on our project, apologizing for bei ng so neglectful . I said I und erstood, then felt uneasiness to return to the physical, and expl ained I had to leave. He stated that he reali zed my need for cautio n, and I turned and quickly headed back to the physical. Re-e ntered without difficulty, with right arm cir cula tion dow n from lying on it awk wardly, which was evident reason for recall. Com ment: In checki ng with Dr. Puharich, the locale was right, and action s were correct, but he has no memory of visit. Strong overh ead light may hav e caused the reflection of \"blond.\""},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The preceding also illustrates the problem of communica tion. Dr. Puharich, awake and aware that specific attempts to \"visit\" him were being made, had no consci ous recollectio n of any su ch meeting. All other factors checked accurat ely, ex cept for the reporte d \"conversation.\" This has happened so freque ntly in such instances that it became the source of much discussi on. At first, it was sugg ested that I was fanta - sizing these communications. It seem ed probable that in so doing, I was merely calling upon my knowledge of the visitee — at the unconscious level—to create an \"authentic\" conversa tion. This theory receive d a setback when a number of such comm unications brought out data known only to the secon d party. Still another difficulty of Locale I travel lies in the time factor. Inconveniently, the best periods for deep relaxation so necessary to create the Second State occur late at night. Therefore, it is quite natural to take advantag e of such in stances when possible. Less effort is required, and the sepa ration is much more rapid. However, the physiolog ical and psychological conditions that help induce the state are unpre - dictab le and not known fully. T his inconsistency brough t numerous occasi ons when experim entation for purely evi den tial data ended in failure. The person to be visited was per forming no reporta ble act other than lying in bed sound asleep. These were discounted completely as evidence. Most pe ople perform this \"act\" every night. Similarly, atte mpts at validation during daylight hours brought their share of compl ications. With no promise of \"contact\" at a specific minute or hour, most people involved went about their normal affairs. Thus when such \"visits\" were made, they were not necessarily discover ed in a uniqu e or unusual act or con dition. As a result, the small, normally inco nsequential acts observed during these visits often were but vague memories to the contactee when confirmation was nee ded. We have a great tendency to forget details of routine actions in life. You can prove this to yourself . Simply atte mpt to recall precisely in detail what you were doing at, say, three twenty- three yesterday a fternoon. If it was a routin e task, chan ces are you will remember only the doing, if that much, Exact detail s will escap e you. Yet the experimentation in visiting Locale I is ext remely important, perhaps at the moment more so than anything else to be attempted. For only t hrough evidential visits in Locale I can sufficient evidential data on the Second Body and the Second State be obtained. Sufficient, that is, to bring a bout serious study by authoritative scienti fic groups of our time. Only through such concentrated and extensive study can a breakthr ough of a revolutio nary natur e be obtained as regards the Second Body, and applied to the basic knowl edge of man. Anything less, and it will remain an unsolved enigma at best, and at worst a ridiculed and unacceptable fantasy to both philos opher and scientist. For this reaso n, the recurring th eme in the reports of experim ents is: Get evidential data.

As a \"side slee per,\" it made no difference which side; each was equally uncomfo rtable due to the electro des attached to my ears. After a sembla nce of ease, I attempted to relax natu rally, but was unsuccessful. I went finally into the fractional relaxation pattern (coun t up from number one, associ at ing each number with a body part starting with feet, fixing close d eyes in direction of bod y part as number and mental com mand to relax were thought). Exp erienced usual mind \"drift\" at various points, and forced attention back to re laxati on techn ique. Went throu gh entire sequence without complete relaxati on, so 1 started again at the beginning. After about forty -five minutes of this without attaining full relaxa tion, I decided to take a break, sat up (halfw ay), and called to the technician. I sat up partially, smo ked a cigar ette, and talked with the technici an for ab out five or eight minutes, then decided to try again. After some time spen t in attempting to ease ear-electro de discomfort, conc entrated on ear to \"numb \" it, w ith partial success. Then went into fraction al relaxation tech nique again. Halfway through the second time aroun d in the pattern, the sense of warmth appeared with full consci ousness (or so it seeme d) remaini ng. I deci ded to try the \"roll-out\" metho d (i.e., sta rt to turn over gently, just as if you were turning over in bed using the physical body). I started to feel as if I we re turning , and at first th ought I truly w as mov ing the physica l body. I felt myself roll o ff the edge of the cot, and brace d for the fall to the floor . When I didn't hit immediately , I knew that I had separated. I moved away from the physical, and through a darkened area, then came upon two men and a woman. The \"seei ng\" wasn't too good, but got better as I came closer . The woman, tall, dark-haire d, in her forties (?), was sitting on a love seat or co uch. Seated to the right of her was one man. In front of her, and slight ly to her left, was the secon d man . They all were strangers to me, an d were in convers ation whic h 1 could not hear. I tried to get their attention, but coul d not. Finally, I reached over, and pinc hed the woman (very gently I) on her lef t side just below the rib cage . It seeme d to get a reaction , but still no communication. 1 deci ded to return to the physic al for orien tation and start aga in. Back into the physical was achieved simply, by thou ght of return. Open ed physica l eyes, all was fine, swallowed to wet my dry throat, close d my eyes, let the warmth surge up, then used the same roll-out technique. This time, I let myself float to the floor besi de the cot. I fell slowl y, and coul d feel myself passin g through the various EEG wires on the way down. I touch ed the floor lightly, then could \"see \" the light coming through the open doorway to the outer EEG rooms. Care ful to keep \"local, \" I went under the cot, keeping in slight touch with the floor, and floatin g in a horizontal posi tion, finger tips touching the floor to keep in position, 1 went slowly through the door way. I was looking for the technician, but could not find her. She was not in the room to the right (control conso le room) , and I we nt out into the brightly light ed outer room. I look ed in all directions , and sudd enly, there she was. However, she was not alone. A man was with her, stan ding to her left as she faced me. I tried to attract her attention, and was almost immedi ately rewarded with a burst of warm joy and happiness that I had finally achieved the thing we had been working for. Sh e was truly excited, and happily and excitedly embraced me. I respo nded, and"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"only sligh t sexu al overtones were pres ent which I was near ly able to disreg ard. After a moment, I pulled back, and gently put my han ds on her face, one on each cheek, and thanked her for her help. However, there was no direct intelli gent objective communication with her other than the above. None was tried, as I wa s too excite d at finally achieving the separation and staying \"local.\" I then turned to the man, who was about her height, with curly hair , some of which drop ped over the side of his fore head. I tried to attract his attenti on, but was unable to do so. Again, reluctant ly, I decid ed to pinc h her gently, which I did. It did not evoke any resp onse that I not iced. Feeling somethin g callin g for a return to the physical, I swung aroun d and went throu gh the door, and slippe d easy back into the physical. Reas on for discomfort: dry throat and throb bing ear. After checki ng to see that the integration was complet e, that I \"felt \" normal in all parts of the body, I ope ned my eyes, sat up, and called to the technici an. She came in, and I told her that 1 had made it finally, and that I had seen her, however, with a man. She replied that it was her husba nd. I aske d if he was outside , and she replied thai he was , that he came to stay with her durin g these late hour s. I aske d why I had n't seen him be fore, and she replie d that it was \"policy\" for no outsiders to see subj ects or pat ients. I ex presse d the desire to meet him, to which she acced ed. The technicia n remove d the electro des, and I we nt out side with her and met her husb and. He was about her heig ht, curly-haired, and after several conver sational amenities, I left. I did not quer y the techn ician or her husb and as to anyt hing they saw, noticed, or felt. How ever, my impres sion was that he definit ely was the man I had observed with her during the non-physic al activity. My seco nd impression was that she was not in the cons ole room w hen I visited them, but in anot her room, standi ng up, with him. This may be hard to determine , if there is a firm rule that the tech nicia n is su pposed always to stay at the consol e. If she can be convi nced that the truth is mo re imp ortant in this case, per haps this seco nd aspect can be validat ed. The only support ing evidence other than what might have appeared on the EEG lies in the presenc e of the husb and, of which I was un aware prior to the experiment. This latter fact can be verified by the technici an. Important afterma th: In a report to Dr. Tart, the tech nicia n confirmed that she was in the oute r hall with her husband at the time of the indicat ed \"separation.\" She also confirmed that I did not know he was present , and that I had not met him previous ly. Dr. Tart stat es that the EEG shows definite unusual and unique tracing s during time of activity."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"5. INFINIT Y, ETERNITY The best introd uction to Locale II is to suggest a room with a sign over the door saying, \"Please Check All Physical Con cepts Here.\" If getting accusto med to the idea of a Second Body was an uneasy experie nce, Locale II may be hard to take. It is certain to produce emotional effects as it steps solidly upon what w e have accept ed as reality. Furtherm ore, many of our religious doctri nes and the interpret ations thereof become open to questio n, It is en ough to say that only a small part of the visits into Locale II via the Second Body has provided evidential data, for these visits do not easily lend themselves to proof. Therefore, much of the Locale II material is cauti ous extra polation. However, several hundred experim ents in this particul ar area have provided definite consiste ncies. If A plus B equals C sixty-three times, there is a high order of prob - ability that A plus B will equal C the sixty-fourth time. Postulate: Locale II is a non-material environment with laws of motion and matter only remot ely relate d to the physi cal world. It is an immensity whose bounds are unknown (to this experimenter), and has depth and dimension incom pre hensible to the finite, consci ous mind. In this vastness lie all of the aspects we attribute to heave n and hell (See Chapter VIII), which are but part of Locale II, It is inha bited, if that is the word, by entities with various degrees of intelli gence with whom communication is possi ble. As noted in the percentile analysis in a later chapter, the fundamentals are altered in Locale II. Time, by the stand ards of the physical world, is non-existent. There is a seque nce of events, a past and a future, but no cyclical separation. Both contin ue to exist cotermin ously with \"now.\" Measure ments, from microsec onds to millennia, are useless. Other measurements may represen t these factors in abstract calcu lation, but this is uncertain. Laws of conservation of energy, force field theories, wave mechanics, gravity, matter struc ture—all remai n to be proved by those more versed in such fields. Superseding all appears to be one prime law. Locale II is a state of being where that which we label thought is the wellspring o f existence. It is th e vital creative force that pro duces energy, assembl es \"matter\" into form, and provides channels of perception and comm unication. I suspect that the very self or sou l in Locale II is no more than an organized vortex or w arp in this fundamental. As you think, so you are. In this environment, no mechanical supplements are found. No cars, boats, airplan es, or rockets are needed for transportation. You think move ment, and it is fact. No tele phones, radio, television, and other comm unication aids have value. Comm unication is instant aneous. No farms, gardens, cattle ranche s, processi ng plants, or retail outlets are in evi dence. In all experimental visits, no food energy needs were indicated. How energy is replac ed—if it is truly spent—is not known. \"Mere\" thought is the force that supplies any ne ed or desire, and what you think is the matrix of your action, situa tion, and position in this greater reality. This is essenti ally the mess age that religion and philosophy have been attempt ing to conve y througho ut the ages, although perhaps less bluntly and often distorte d. A facet learned in this medium of thought explai ns much . It is: Like attracts Like. I didn't realize there was such a rule that acted so specifically. It had been to me nothing more or less than an abstraction. Project this outward, and you begin to appreciate the infinite varia tions found in Locale II. Your destination seems to be grounded compl etely within the framework of your inner most const ant motivations , emotions,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"and desires. You may not consciously want to \"go\" there, but you have no choice. Your Sup ermind (soul?) is stronger and usual ly mak es the decision for you. Like attracts like. The interesti ng aspect of this thoug ht world (or worlds) of Locale II is tha t one does perceive what seems to be solid matter as well as artifacts common to the physical world. These are brought into \"existence,\" evident ly, by three sources. First, they are the product of thought of those who onc e lived in the physical world, the patter ns of which still remai n. This is acco mplished quite automatically, wi thout deliberate intent The secon d source is thos e who liked cer tain material things in the physical world, which they have re-created apparently to enhance their surr oundings in Lo cale II. The third source I assu me to be a higher order of intellige nt beings more aware of the Local e II envi ronment than most inhabitants. Their purpose seem s to be that of simulation of the physical environment—temporarily, at least —for the benefit of those just emer ging from the physical world, after \"death.\" This is done to reduc e trauma and shock for the \"newcomers\" by introduc ing familiar shapes and set tings in the early conversion stages. By this time, one can begin to understand the relationship of the Second Body to Locale II. Locale II is the natural environment of the Second Body. The principles involved in its action , composition, percep tion, and control all corre spond to those in Locale II. This , then, is why the majority of the experimental travel attempts took me involuntarily somewh ere into Locale II. The Second Body is basic ally not of this physical world. To apply it to visits to Geo rge's house or oth er physical destinations is like asking a diver to swim down to the ocean bed without scuba gear or pressur e suit. He can do it, but not for long, and not too many times. On the other hand, he can walk a mile to the store daily wi thout ill effects. Thus travel to points in the physical world is a \"forced\" process in the Second Body sta te. Given the oppor tunity of the slightest mental relaxatio n, the Supermind will guide you in your Sec ond Body into Locale II. It is the \"natu ral\" thing to do. Our traditional concept of place suffers badly when ap plied to Locale II. It seems to interpenetrate our physical world, yet spans limitless reach es beyond compr ehension. Many theor ies have been offered in literature through out the ages as to the \"where\" of it, but few appeal to the modern scientific mind. All of the experim ental visits to this area have helped little to formulate a more accept able theory. The most accep table is the wave-vibration conce pt, which presumes the existenc e of an infinity of worlds all operating at different freque ncies, one of which is this physical world. Just as various wave fre quencies in the electro magnetic spectru m can simult aneously occupy space , with a minimum of interacti on, so might the world or wo rlds of Locale II be interspers ed in our physical- matter world. Except for rare or unus ual conditions, our \"natural\" senses and our instrum ents which are extensio ns thereof are compl etely unable to perceive and report this potential. If we consider this premis e, the \"where\" is an swered neatly. \"Where\" is \"here.\" The history of man's science s supports this premis e. We had no idea that sounds existed beyond the range of human hearing until we developed instruments to detect, measure, and create them. Until comparatively recently, th ose who claimed they coul d hear what others could not were consid ered insane or persec uted as witches and sorcerers. We were able to perceive the electromagnetic spect rum only in terms of heat and light until the last century. We are still un aware of the capacity of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"the human brain, an electroc hemical or ganism, in terms of transmissio n and recepti on of electro magnetic radiation. With this gap unbridged, it is easy to understand why modern science has not begun to consi der the ability of the human mind to penetrate an area where no serious theory has been promulga ted. There is so much to report on Locale II that it would be impractic al to quote direct ly from the hundreds of referential pages of notes. Visits nea r and far in Local e II compris e most of the reporting througho ut succee ding chapters. It is the summ ation of consiste nt experi ences that may bring the pat tern into focus and pose questions that plead for answers. For every known, there may be one million unknowns, but at least here is a starting poi nt. In Locale II, realit y is com posed of deepest desires and most frantic fears. Thought is action, and no hiding layers of conditioning or inh ibition shield the inner you from others, where honesty is the best policy beca use there can be nothing less. Under the basic standards describ ed above, existenc e is in deed different. It is this difference that creates the great prob lems of adjustme nt even when attempting to visit there while in the Second Body. The raw emotion so carefully repressed in our physical civilization is unle ashed in full force. To say that it is overwhelmi ng at first is a massive understatement In consci ous physical life, this condition would be considered psychotic. My first visits to Locale II brought out all the repressed emotional patterns I even remote ly consi dered I had—plus many I didn' t know existed. They so dominated my actions that I returne d completely abashed and embarrass ed at their enormity and my inability to control them. Fear was the dominant theme—fear of the unknown, of strange beings (non-physical) , of \"death,\" of God, of rule-breaki ng, of dis covery, and of pain, to nam e only a few. Such fears were stronger than the sexual drive for union, which, as noted elsewhere, was in itself a tremendous obstacle. One by one, painfully and laboriously, the explo ding un controllable emotional patterns had to be harnessed. Until this was acco mplished, no rational thought was possible. Without rigorous consist ency, they begin to return. It is m uch like a slow learning from unsanity to calm objective reaso n ing. An infant learns to be \"civilized\" in its growth through childhood to adult status. I suspect the same thing occurs all over aga in in the adaptation to Locale II. If it does n't happen during physical life, it becomes the first order of business upon death. This implies that the areas of Locale II \"nearest\" the physical world (in vibratory frequency?) are peopled for the most part with insane or near-insane, emotionally driven be ings. For the most part, this seems to be true. They inclu de those alive but asleep or drugged and out in their Second Bodies, and quite probably those who are \"dead\" but still em otionally driven. There is evidenc e to support the former, and the latter seems probable. This near area, quite understandably, is not a pleasant place to be. It is a level or plane where you \"belong\" until you learn better. I don't know wha t happens to those who don't learn. Perha ps they stay there forever. Th e moment you disassoci ate from the physical via the Second Body, you are on the fringes of this close- by section of Locale II. It is he re that one meets all sorts of disjointe d personalities and animate beings. If there is som e protective mechanism for the neophyte, it was not apparent to me. Only by cautious and sometimes terrifying e xperimentation was I able to learn the art or trick of passing through the area. I still am not pre cisely sure of all items in this learning process, and so have prese nted only the obvious. Whatever the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"process, I happily have not encountered trouble in these passag es for several years. Aside from the tormentors and the several outright con flicts noted in the following reports, the principal motivatio n of these near inhabitants is sexua l release in all forms. If con sidere d as the produc t of recent civilizations—i ncluding those both \"alive but sleeping\" and \"dead\"—it is quite simple to understand the need for release from repression .of this basic need. The key is that all those in this near sectio n at tempt sexuality in terms of the physical body. There is no recognitio n or knowledge of the sex drive as it is ma nifested in more distan t parts of Locale II. With the lingering condi tioning of our own society, it w as difficult to avoid participa tion at times, as response was automatic. Hopefully, one learns to control this factor. Like attracts like. To date, I have not observed the death process in any experime nts. However, the conclusion that some form of ex istence in Locale II follows life activity in the known physical world goes beyon d conje cture. Experienc es similar to the fol lowing, consiste nt in content over the past twelve years, may be explained by som e other conce pt. At this time, nothing else fits quite so neatly. On one occasion, I had just le ft the physical when I felt an urgent need to go \"somewhere.\" Yielding to the insistence, I moved what seem ed to be a short distanc e and stopp ed suddenly in a bedroom. A boy was lying in the bed, alone. He seemed about ten or eleven in age, and that now-familiar inner identity p erception was at work rather than just \"see ing.\" The boy was lonely and afraid, and seemed ill. I stayed with him for some time, trying to comfort him, and finally left when he had calme d down, promising I would return. The trip back to the physical was uneventful, and I had no idea where I had been. Several weeks later, I left the physical and was about to conce ntrate on a given destin ation when the same boy m oved into view. He saw me and moved close to me. He was be wildered, but not afraid. He looke d up at me and asked, \"What do I do now?\" I could n't immediately think of how to reply, so I put my arm over his shoulder and gave him a comforting squeeze. I thoug ht, who am I to instruct or give directions at what seemed a vital mom ent? The boy w as reassure d by my pres ence, and relaxed . \"Where do I go?\" He asked it matter- of-factly. I said the only thing that seem ed logical at the time. I told him to wait right where he was, that some friends of his would be along shortly, that they would take him where he was sup posed to go. This seem ed to satisfy him, and I kept my arm around him for a while. Then I became nervous with a signal from the physical body, and patted him on the shoulder and left. Re turning to the physical, I found my neck stiffened from being in an awkward positio n. After straightening out, I suc ceeded in going int o the Second Body again to look for the boy. He was gone— or at least I could n't find him. An interesting sidelight. The next day the newspap er carried the story of the death of a ten-year-old boy after a lingering illness. He had died in the afternoon, shortl y before I had begun the experiment. I tried to think of some accep t able excuse to approach his parents and get m ore confirma tion, and perhaps relieve their grief, but could find none. Only when you have passed the \"raw emotion\" stage do you move into the innumerable various but evident ly organized activity clusters of Locale II. It is imposs ible to convey to an other the \"reality\" of this non-physical eternity. As stated"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"by many in centuries past, it must be experienc ed. Most import antly, in many of the places visited, the in habitants are \"still\" human. Different, in a changed environ ment, but still w ith human (understandable) attributes. On one visit, I end ed up in a parklike surrounding, with carefully tend ed flower s, trees, and grass, much like a large mall with paths crisscrossing the area. There were benches along the paths, and there were hundreds of men and women Strolling by, or sitting on the benches. Some were quite calm, others a little apprehensive, and many had a dazed or shocke d look of disorientation. They appeared uncert ain, unknowing of what to do or what was to take place next. Somehow I kne w that this was a meeting place, where newly arrived waited for friends or relatives. From this Place of Meeting, these friends would take each newcom er to the proper place where he or she \"belonged.\" I coul d not think of any reason to stay longer—ther e was no one nearby I recog nized—so I returne d to the physical without incident. Another time I deliberately set out to explor e in the hope of finding one answer to bring back. Upon disassoci ating into the Second Body, I started to move rapidly as I conce ntrated upon the thought, I wish to go w here there are highe r intelli gences. I kept conce ntrating as I sped swiftly through a void that seemed endless. Finally, I stopped. I was in a narrow valley which seem ed normal in all respects. There were men and women in ankle-length robes, dark in color. This time, I decided for some reason to take another tack. I approached several of the women, and asked them if they knew w ho I was. All were quite polite , and created me with great re spect, but gave negative answers. I turne d away, and asked the same question of a man in a monk's robe who seemed hauntingly familiar. \"Yes, I know y ou,\" the man replied. There was a strong sense of understanding and friendship in his attitude. I aske d him if I truly knew w ho I was myself. He looked at me as if he had met an old and dear friend who now had amnesia. \"You will.\" He smiled gently as he said it. I aske d him if he knew who I had been last. I was trying to get him to say my name. \"You were last a monk in Coshocton, Pennsylvania,\" he replie d. I started to get uneasy, an d apologetically left, returning to the physical. Recently, a Catholic priest friend took the trouble to in vestigate this possibility of past-life monasticism. To my surprise and his delight, there is an obscure monastery near Coshocton. He has offered to take me there for a visit, but time (courage?) has not been available. Perha ps later . . . I could report many more of these experiences without fully de scribing the scope and dimension of Locale II. There have been visits to a group that appeared to be in uniform, which operated highly technical equipment and identified themselves as the \"Target Army\" (the mind's interpretation of what was said). There were hundreds, each waiting fo r \"assignments.\" Their purpose was not disclos ed. Another visit took me to a well-organized city, where my presence was immediately constru ed as hostile. Only by tak ing evasi ve action—running, hiding, and finally lifting straight up—was I able to avoid \"capture. I do not know w hat threat I impli ed to them. In a more direct fashion, the appearance of very aggres sive actions tended to confirm again that Locale II is not solely a place of serenity a nd non-conflict. On another trip, I was accosted by a conventionally dressed man. Warily, I waited to see"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"what he would do. \"Do you know or remem ber Arrosio LeFranco?\" He aske d the quest ion bluntly. I replie d that I did not, still caut ious. \"I am sure you will remember if you think back, \" the man said firmly. There was a subtle demanding in his attitude which made me uneasy. I replie d that I was sure I didn't remember any one by that name. \"Do you know anyone at all down there?\" he asked. I had just said that I did not, when I sudd enly went limp, and the man grabbed me. He took one of my arms, and I felt someone else take another, and they started to drag me in the directio n of what seemed to be three bright spots of lights. I struggled, and finally broke loose when I reme m bered to use the \"go-to-physical\" signal. I moved away rapidly, an d after a short time was back in the office and into the physical. Evidently—h opefully—I ha d been mista ken for some one else. Still another trip had \"human\" attribut es. I had arrived in no particular place, just a grayness, and was trying to decide what to do when a woman approached me. \"I am from the ——— Chur ch, and I am here to help you,\" she said calmly. She came close, and I imm ediately sens ed the female sex uality b ut held back as I didn't think the ——— Church in tended this kind of help. I was wrong. After a bit, I thanked her and turned to see a man standing nearby, watching. He \"spoke\" in a strong voice, heavy with sarcasm. \"Well, now are you ready to learn the secrets of the universe?\" I mask ed my embarrassment by asking who he was. \"Albert Mather!\" He almost shouted it. I also got the im pressio n that he was calling me by this name. \"I hope you're ready,\" he went on, his voice rising in anger, \"be cause nobody took the trouble to tell me when I was back there. \" I didn't hear the rest. It was as if a roar of static interfered. I moved away, not sure how his anger would vent itsel f, and returned to the physical uneventfully. In checki ng, I found no significant histori cal record of an Albert Mather (long a), w ho seems to have no relation to the minister Cotton Mather of the eighteenth centu ry. Other experiences in Locale II were more friendly, as in dicate d elsewhere. In most, there is no discer nible pattern as to what attracted me to some of the strange situatio ns. Per haps this will come eventually. Two unusual recurring con ditions must be added to the coverage of this area. A number of times, the motion of travel, wh ich is usually r apid and smoot h, has been interrupt ed by what feels like a violent, hurricanel ike gust i n the spatiality through which one moves. It is as if you are being blown away by this uncontrolled force, tossed haphazardly arou nd, end over end, like a leaf in a gale. It is im possible to move against this torrent or do anything but let it carry you. Finally, yo u are tossed near the edge of the current, and you drop out, unharmed. There is not hing to identify it, but it feels natural rather than artificia lly created. The secon d condition is the sign in the sky. I observed this on five or six occasi ons when escorte d by the \"Help ers.\" It is a n incredi ble series of crude symbols strung in an arc directly across one section of Locale II. When moving thr ough the area, everyone has to go around this barrier, as it is solid, im movabl e, immutable. The symbols, as best my \"seeing\" could determine, were crude, sticklike illustratio ns of a man, an older woman, a house, and what look ed to be algeb raic equati ons. It was from one of the \"Helpers\" that I learned the story of the sign. He told it with some"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"humor, almost apologetically. It seems that an almost measureless time ago, a very wealthy ( by what standards is not known) and powerful woman wanted to ensure that her son would get into heave n. A church offered to guarante e this to her, provided she paid the church a tremendous sum of money (sic). The woman paid the church but her son did not get into heaven. In anger and revenge, she used her entire remaining wealth and power to have the sign put up in the skies of heaven so that through out all eternity, all who saw it would know of the dishonesty and rascalit y of that particul ar church. It was a job well done. The names of the woman, her son, and the church are lost in antiquity. But the sign re mains, impervious to the efforts of scientists through the ages to bring it down or destroy it. The source of the apology an d slight embarrass ment is not the perfidy of some obscur e sect, but the inability of anyon e to take down the sign! As a result, all studies of scienc e in this part of Locale II must necess arily inclu de it. It w ould be much the same if some one artifici ally created an element betwee n cobalt and copper. If you stud ied chem istry, by necessity you would have to include this \"od d\" element. Or, if a huge artificial moon were created and it was beyon d our scienc e to bring it down, students of astronomy would include it in their lesso ns as a comm on fact. That's the story as it was told to me. The greatest difficulty is the inability of the consci ous mind, trained and conditioned in a physical world, to accept the existen ce of this infinite Locale II. Our young Western mental sciences tend to deny its exi stence. Our reli gions affirm it in a broad, distorte d abstraction. Accep ted sciences contra dict such a possibility, and can find no supporting evidence through their instrume nts of research and measure ment. Most o f all, there is the Barrier. Why it exists is not truly known by anyone , at least in the Western world. This is the same screen that lowers when you awaken from sleep, blot ting out your last dream—or the memory of your visit to Locale II. This is not to imply that every dream is the product of a Locale II visit. But some of them may we ll be the trans lation of Locale II experiences. Translation—the symbolization of Locale II exper ience-is not necessarily par t of the Barrier. Rath er, it would seem to be the effort of the conscious to interpret superc onscious Locale II events which are beyond its ability to comprehend or pictorialize. Obser vation via Sec ond Body in Locale I (Here-Now) proved that the most ordinary functions or actions were subject to misinterpretation, especially when ob served ou t of context. Locale II, an environme nt totally un familiar to the conscious, offers that much greater margin for interpretative error. As can be inferred, I suspect that many, most, or all human beings visit Locale II at some time during the sleep state. Why such visits are necessary, I d on't know. Perha ps one day, some year, our life sciences will unravel this knowledge and a new era will be born for mankind. With this will come an entire new scienc e based upon Locale II data and our re lationship to this wondrous world. Some day. If mankind can wait that long."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"6. REVERSE IMAGE Parad oxically, the scientist today can conceive far more easily o f the possibi lity of the area here labeled Locale III than that of Locale II. Why? Because it fits his latest discoveries in physics, small bits of evidence he has uncovered in his experime nts with matter bombardment, accelerators, cyclo trons, etc. The best way to get acquainted with Locale III is to take the significant experim ents leading up to it directl y from the notes. 11/5/58 Afternoon The vibrations came quickly and easily, and were not at all uncomfortable. When they we re strong, I tried to lift out of the physical with no result. Whatever thought or combi nation I tried, 1 remained confined right where I was. I then remem bered the rotating trick, w hich operates just as if you are turning over in bed. I starte d to turn, and recognized that my physical was not \"turning\" with me. I moved slowly, and after a moment I was \"face down,\" or in direct opposition to the placement of my physical body. The moment I reach ed this 180° position (out of phase, opposite polarity?), there was a hole. That's the only way to describe it. To my senses, it seem ed to be a hole in a wall which was about two feet thick and stretched endlessly in all directio ns (in the vertical plane). The periphery of the hole was just pre cisely the shape of my physical body. I touched the wall, an d it felt smooth and hard. The edges of the hole were relatively rough. (All this touching done with the non-physical hands.) Beyon d-through the hole—was nothing but blackness. It was not the blackness of a dark room, but a feeling of infinite distance and space, as if I were looking through a window into distant space. I felt that if my vision were good enough I could prob ably see nearby stars and planets. My impressi on, therefore, was of deep, outer space, beyond the solar system, far in an incredibl e distan ce. 1 moved cautiously through the hole, holding onto its sides, and poked my head through carefully. Nothi ng. Nothing but blackness. No people, nothing material. 1 ducke d back in hurriedly be cause of the utter strangeness. I rotate d back 180°, felt myself merge with the physical, and sat up. It was broa d daylight, just as when I had left what seemed a few min utes before. Lapsed time: one hour, five minutes! 11/18/58 Night The vibrations came in strong, but nothing more. Again, I thought to try the rotation . When I did, it worked, and I rotat ed slowly into the 180° position. There was the wall and the hole and the blackn ess beyond . This time I was more cautious. Carefully, I reached a hand through into the black ness. I was astounded when a hand took mine and shook it! It felt like a human hand, norma lly warm to the touch. After the handshake, I withdrew my hand quickl y. Slowl y, 1 reach ed into the hole again. The hand shook mine again, and place d a card in it. I withdrew m y hand and \"looked\" at the card. It gave a specific address. I returne d the card through the hole, shook hands again, withdrew my hand, rotated back to normal, merged with the physical, and sat up. Most un usual. I will have to investigate this address on Broadway, if it is in New York. 12/5/58 Morning I rotate d again, and again found the hole. Still with a note of caution, I appr oached"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"the hole, and this time reach ed through with both hands. Instantly, both were grasped by two oth er hands. Then for the first time in all my experi mentation, my name was called. A voice— feminine, soft, low-pitched, and urgent (fust as if someone were trying to wake me up from sleep without startling me too much)— called, \"Bob! Bob!\" I was startled at first, then recovered and asked, \"What is your name?\" (always looki ng for evi dential material!) When I \"said?* these words, there seemed to be intense motion or acti vity, as if my words had created the effect of dropping a stone into a still lake or pond-like rippling, scurrying, crackling, etc. The voice repeat ed my nam e, and I repe ated my questio n, still with the two hands holding mine. To be sure I was compl etely conscious, that I was actually somehow saying the words correctly, I withdrew m y hands, rotated in the 180°, blended with the physical, sat up physi cally, and vocally spoke the question . Satisfied, I lay back, rotated , and called the questio n through the hole again. No answer. I kept trying, until I began to feel the vibrations weakening, and knew I co uldn't hold the condition any longer. I then rotated back into the physical and normalcy. 12/27/58 Night Upon setting up the vibrations, I again found the hole as expecte d. I gathe red up courage, and slowly poked my head through the hole. The moment I did, I heard a voice say in utter excitement and surprise, \"Com e here quick! Look! \" I could see no one (this could be due to my closed-eyes condi tioning in order to hold the vibration effect, i.e., physi cal seeing distracts). Th ere was still blackn ess. The other party didn't seem to be coming, so the voice called again, urgently and excitedly. T he vibrations seemed to be weaken ing, so I putted back out of the hole and rotated back into the physical without incident. 1/15/59 Afternoon The vibrations came finally, and 1 rotated to exam ine the hole again. There it was, at 180°. I was a little nervous when I reach ed through with one hand. Then I mentally smiled and relaxed, saying to myself, well, be it hand, daw, or pawt I'm friendly. With that a hand took mine and squeezed it, and I returned the grasp. I definitely sensed a feeling of friendli ness from the other side. I returne d to the physical by rotation after a. Wile difficulty. In my excitem ent, 1 forgot both rotatio n and return to normal signal! 1/21/59 Night As a preliminary, I tr ied the hole again. Rotati on went smoothly after the vibrations started, and I then reached one arm deep into the hole. When I reached in with the other arm, some thing sharp seem ed to dig into the palm of my hand, like a hook, and dug in more deeply when I tried to withdraw it. I finally did so, somewha t shake n. It felt as if the \"hook\" had gone right through my hand. It was not necessarily pa inful, but the effect was disturbing. I rotated to the physical and looked at my right hand, physicall y. There were no marks or feeling (although the sensation of the penetration aftereffect was present). 1/25/59 Night Another hole experi ment, with the same patter n of vibra tions and 180°. Again I"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"carefully reached into the hole. A hand again took mine and held it firmly (no hook!). Then the hand passe d mine over to a second hand. I slowly re leased the second hand and felt upward. There was def initely an arm attached to the hand, and a shoulder I was about to explor e more, when the vibrations seem ed to soften, and I pulled my arm back and rotated to the physical. There was no indication of the need to return to the physical, no cramped arms or legs, n o noises. Probably a momentary sound cause d the return. 2/5/59 Afternoon Perha ps my concer n with the hole is justifi ed. I followed the same approach pattern, vibrations and 180° rotation, reache d into the hole, and at first felt nothing. I reached deeper, and suddenly it felt as if I had thrust my hand into electrically charged hot water (most accurate descr iption). I withdrew it very quickl y, rotated, and sat up physicall y. The physical hand felt numb and tingling. From the position of my body, there was no evidence of poor circulatio n. The numbness and tingling slo wly disappeared in about twenty minu tes. 2/15/59 Afternoon I experime nted with going in and out vertically, then ro tated to the hole. Gathering courage, I pulled myself through in a sweeping rush, just as a swimmer might pull himse lf through a hole under water. I felt the other side of the hole, and the wall was similar to \"my\" side. I tried to \"see\" but there was still not hing but the deep blackness. I decid ed to settle the matter once and for all. I shoved away from the hole and performed the stretch-out in a direction exactl y on a line away from the hole. I started to move, slowly, and soon accelerated rapidly. I kept moving more rapidly, yet with only a slight sense of fric tion over my body. Moving at what seemed a very high speed, I went on, waiting and expecti ng to \"get\" somewhe re. After what seem ed a very long time, I bega n to be concerned. I still \"saw\" nothing, felt nothing. Finally, I began to get ne rv ous. Fears about becomi ng lost began to creep in. 1 slowed, stopped, turned around, and stretched out back in the directio n of the hole. It took just as long to get back as it did to go. I was quite worried when I finally saw the light through the hole up ahead. I dove for it, went through, rotated, and sat up physicall y. Time away was three hours, fifteen min-utes! 2/23/59 Night The hole is populated! This evening (seven-t hirty), I went through vibration and 180° rotatio n, and this time with out much hesitat ion, I pulled myself through and stood up. I immediately felt myself in the presenc e of someone stand ing there. I sensed his presence rather than saw him (impres-siont male). For some unaccountable reaso n that I do not yet understand, even recollected now in tranquility, 1 dropp ed thankfully in front of him and sobbed. After a moment, I calm ed down, carefully backed away, went through the hole, rotated back into the physical, and sat up. Who was it? And why did I act so emotionally? 2/27/59 Night Determi ned to find some more (or even one!) answers abo ut the hole, I went through the vibration and 180° rota tion pattern, and deliberately went through. It was still black and dark, but not unpleasant, no hands, no prese nce. I could feel something"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"solid under me, so 1 tried very hard to open my eyes and \"see.\" I did, and everything came into view. 1 was standing near a building (more like a barn than a house) on what was a wide, meadowlike area. I thought I would try to soar up into the sky (deep clear bluef no cloud s), but I coul dn't seem to get off the ground. Maybe I had weight here. There was what looked like a ladder a hundred feet or so away, and I went to it and realized it was a tower of some kind, about ten feet tall. Like a bird needing take- off room, I climbed the tower to the top, leaped away in take-off— and fell promptly to the ground with a solid thud! I guess I was surprised as a bird with clipp ed wings must feel. I got to my feet, and realized how foolishly I w as acting. I was not following the proper procedures. Even \"here,\" they had to be followed. I held up my hands and arms in the stretch-out position, and went up easily. I moved slowly over the meadow, enjoying the view and explorati on, when sud denly som ething flew past me. 1 turned just in time to see it hea ding for the wall and the hole. I was afraid for some reason that this was some thing that would go thr ough and try to enter my body, so I wheeled in flight and dove for the hole. Too late, I realized that what I thought was the hole was a window in the side of the building—a nd then I was through the window an d in blackn ess. I felt around in the dark, and there was the outline of the hole. I went through, rotate d, and sat up in the physical. Everything looked normal, and I was in the right place, the time passage was O.K., so back I went! Vibrations were still st rong, so I rotated 180°, went through the hole and out into brightness . More observant this trip, 1 noticed two people, a man and a woman, sitting in chairs near the outside of the building. I could n't make contact with the man, but the woman (no physical identification other than this) se emed to know I was there. I aske d her if she knew w ho I was, but I coul d get nothing other than a sense of awareness on her part. The vibrations started to fade, so I back ed away, dove into hole, rotate d, and sat up. Total time of the entire episode was forty minutes. What can be made of these experime nts? Taken at face value, they ad d up at the least to an unusual hallucination. At most, the observations show a develo pmental pattern. First, there seems to be nothing in written histor y of such experiences as these to offer a comp arison. These were not spontaneous incide nts, but deliberately pla nned and system atically repe ated. As such, they w ould appear to be unique. Second, the exper iment was repea table by formula: (1) the setting up of the \"vibration\" condition; followed by (2) a 180° rotation; and (3) the appearance of the \"hole.\" The exper iment was performed not once but at least eleven times. The 180° rotation offers interesti ng speculation. The refer ence to \"out of phase\" and the apparent identical displace ment in exact opp osition deserves the attention of the physicist. W ave-form studies of phase relatio nships applied in this case might provide a fruitful theory. The blackness of the hole was evidently a matter of my own limitati on in \"seeing.\" Through the early experime ntation, the restriction of vision was self-imposed, as I felt this was a requisite for maintaining the vibration condition. The evi dence seems to"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"point to this in the succe ss in seeing when I decided or tried to see, and did. It would have been interest ing indeed if I had utilized my vision during the long explor a tory \"flight.\" Much might have been learned. The experi ence of the \"hands\" defies expla nation. There is no evidence to indicate that I was conditioned or suggested into the first discover y of the hand. Second and later such exper iences, however, coul d well have been of this source. But this in no way invalidates the first of these impressions. The card with the address might fall into the classi fication of past memories, associated with the handshake of a first meeting. Unexplained still is the \"digging\" of the \"hook\" into my hand. The calling of one's name is not uncommon under other circumstances. There are numerous records of such sourcel ess voices, both in the waking and sleep states. Various psycho logical theories have been formulated to explain the event, with partial succe ss. Most interesti ng is the report concer ning the evident dis covery by some other party of my penetration through the hole. In accord with published reports of other experim enters, penetration of the \"hole\" was visible to a person or intelli gence at some location other than the immediate vicinity. If this followed the pattern of other such reports, the time ele ment would be identical. There is no means to verify this one way or another. My emotional reaction to the meeting with the \"Someone\" had many of the aspec ts of a mystical experience. It is signif icant that I felt a sense of humble ecstasy which triggered an emotional release. That was the begin ning. A series of experiments followed that were remarka ble in their consiste ncy of data, and defied any histo rical expla nation. The curious intellect cannot dis miss the collective experience as halluc ination. Locale III, in sum mary, proved to be a physical-matt er world almost identical to our own. The natural environment is the same. There are trees, houses, cities, people, artifacts, and all the appurtenances of a reaso nably civilized society. Th ere are homes, families, businesses, and people work for a living. There are roads on which vehicles travel. There are railroads and trains. Now for the \"almost.\" At first, the thought was that Lo cale III wa s no more than some part of our world unknown to me and those others conce rned. It had all the appearances of being so. However, more careful study showed that it can be neither the present nor the past of our physical-matter world. The scienti fic development is inco nsistent. There are no electrical devices whatsoever. Electricit y, elect romagnetics, and anyth ing so related are non-existent. No electric lights, telephones, radios, television, or electric power. No intern al combustion, gasoline , or oil were found as power sources. Yet mechanical power is use d. Careful ex amination of one of the locomotives that pulled a string of old-fashioned-looking passenger cars sh owed it to be driven by a steam engine . The cars appeared to be made of wood, the locomotive of metal, but of a different shape than our now obsol ete types. The track gauge was much smaller than our standard track spa cing, smaller than our narrow-gauge mountain railways. I observed the servicing o f one of the locomotives in de tail. Neither wood nor coal was use d as a therm al source to produce steam. Instead, large vatlike containers were carefully slid from under the boiler, detached, and rolled by small cart into a building with massive thick walls. Th e containers had pipelike protuberances extendi ng from the top. Men work ing behind shields performed the removal, casually"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"cautio us, and did not relax their automatic vigilance until the con tainers were safely in the building and the door closed. The contents were \"hot,\" either through heat or radiati on. The actions of the techn icians all seem ed to indicate the latter. The streets and roads are different, again princip ally in size. The \"lane\" on which vehicles travel is ne arly twice as wide as ours. Their version of our automobile is much larger. Even the smallest has a single bench seat that will hold five to six people abreast The stand ard unit has only one fixed seat, that of the driver. Others are much like living-room chairs, placed around a compartment that measures some fifteen by twenty feet. Wheels are used, but without inflated tires. Steering is done by a single horizontal bar. Motive power is co ntained somewher e in the rear. T heir movem ent is not very fast, at something like fifteen to twenty miles per hour. Traffic is not heavy. Self-powered vehicles exist in the form of a four-wheeled platform which is steere d by the feet acting upon the front wheels. A mech anism pumped by the arms transfers the en ergy to the rear wheels, much like the children's \"rowing wagons\" of some years back. These are used for short dis tances. Habits and custo ms are not like ours. What little has been gleaned implies a historical backg round with different events, names, places, and dates. Yet, w hile the stage of man's evolution (the conscious mind translate s the inhabitants as men) seems to be identical, technic al and social evolution are not completely the same. The major discover y came soon after I gathered the cour age for extended exped itions into Locale III. In spite of early indications, the people there were not aware of my presenc e until I met and \"merged\" temporarily and involunt arily with one who can only be descri bed as the \"I\" who lives \"there.\" The only explan ation I can think of is that I, fully consci ous of living and being \"here,\" was attracte d to and began mo mentarily to inhabit the body of a person \"there,\" much like myself. When this took place—and it bega n to be an automatic process when I went to Locale III—I simply took over \"his \" body. There was no awareness of his mental presence when I temp orarily displ aced him. My knowledge of him and his activities and his past came from his family, and what was evidently his brain memory-bank. Though I knew that I was not he, I coul d feel objectively the emotional patterns of his past. I have wondered what embarrassment I have caused him as a result of the periods of amnesia created by my intrusions. Some must have brought him much distress. Here is his life: \"I\" There—at the first intrusion , was a rather lonely man. He was not particul arly success ful in his field (architect- contractor), and not too gregarious. He came of what might be classi fied as a low-incom e group, and suc ceeded in going to the equivalent of a minor college. He spent much of his early career in a large city in an ordinary job. He lived on the secon d floor of a rooming house, and took a bus to work. It was a strange city to him, and he made few frie nds. (The bus, incidentally, was very wide, seating eight abreast, and seats rose behind the driver in successivel y higher tiers, so that all could see the road ahead.) My first intrusio n caught him just a s he was getting o ff the bus. The driver looked at him suspiciously when I tried to pay a fare. It see ms that none is charged. The next intrusion came at an emotional crisis. \"I\" There met Lea, a wealthy y oung woman with two childre n, a boy an d a girl, both under four years of age. Lea was a sad, wistful, and somewhat preoccu pied perso n, who seemed to have ex perienced some major tragedy in her life. This had some re lationship to her former husband,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"but was not clear. \"I\" There met her quite accidentally, and was deeply attracte d to her. The two children found in him a great comp anion. Lea appeared only mildly interest ed at this first meeting. Her greatest response lay in his attention to and warmth for the children. A short time later an intrusion occurred just as Lea and \"I\" There had announced to friends—her friends—that they w ere going to be \"married\" (this has a slightly different connota tion). There was much consternation among the friends, chiefly due to the fact that it had been only thirt y days (?) since some major event had occurred in Lea's life (divorce, her husband's death, or some physical debilitation). \"I\" There was still g reatly attracted, and Lea was still sad and introspective. A later intrusion came when Lea and \"I\" There were liv ing in a house in a semip astoral surrounding. The house sat on a low hill, had long rectangular windows, and very wide eaves much like those of a pagod a. The railroad curved around the hill some three hundred yards in the distance, the tracks com ing in from the right in a straight line, then across the front of the hill, then aroun d to the back and to the left There was deep green grass fr om the steps of the house, down over the roll of the hill. Behind the house, \"I\" There had an office, a one-room building where he worked. On this occasion, Lea entered the office and came over to the desk just as I had replac ed \"I\" There. \"The workmen want to borrow som e of your tools,' she said. I looke d at her blankly. I w as not sure what to say, so I aske d her what workmen. \"The men working on the road, of course.\" She had not yet sens ed anything wrong. Before I reali zed what e ffect it would have, I said there were no men working on the road. With this, she looked at me intently, with a growing suspicio n. I was thoroughly unsure of what to do next, so I left his body and returned through the hole. Another eventful intrusion came when \"I\" There had set up his laboratory. He was not fully qua lified to perform research, but he had decided he could make some kind of new discove ries. He had (perhaps with the assista nce of Lea's wealth) taken a huge storage building, divided it internally into small rooms, and was cond ucting some kind of exper i ments. In the middle of one, I displaced him in his body, but was unable to calcul ate what was next in his routine. Just then, Lea came in, with visitors, principal ly to show the kind of work he had achieved in the renovated building. I (in \"I\" There's body) stoo d there unable to speak when Lea asked me to tell them of the work I had been doing. Somewhat embarrass ed, Lea led the couple out into an other room. I hesitated when perhaps \"I\" There would have followed. I tried to \"feel\" any pa ttern of activity that he might have been doing. The best I coul d get wa s that he had been trying to develo p new forms of theatrical entertain ment, designing theater stages, lighting, and sets, all in an attempt to make watching a play a strongly subjective ex perience. With only this partial success in his recall, I left his body wh en I heard them returning so as to avoid further comp licating his life. A vacation in the mountains was under way at another in trusion point. \"I\" There, Lea, and the two childre n were riding along a winding mountain road, each on the self- propelled vehicle describ ed elsewhere. I \"took over' inad vertently just as they w ere reachi ng the bottom of one hill and had started up another. New to the device, I tried to make it go up the next hill, and soon rolled off the road and into a small pile of dirt. The rest waited while I tried to get back on the road, and I muttered that there were better ways to get arou nd than this. This triggered some thing in Lea, and she"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"suddenly beca me quiet. Why, I didn 't know. (I 'm sure \"I\" There did.) I tried to tell her that I was not who she thought, then realized that this was only m aking it worse. I \"left,\" returning to the hole and the physical body. In later intrusions, \"I\" There and Lea no longer lived to gether. He had met with som e success, but some action of his alienated her. Alone, he has thought of her consta ntly, and deeply regretted the weakness that made him displease her. He met her casua lly once, in a large city, and pleaded with her to let him visit her. She told him she would let him do so, and see how things worked out. She lived in the equiva - lent of an apartment, on the third floor of a reside ntial build ing. He promised to come. Unfortunately, \"I\" There lost or forgot the address she gave him, and at the last intrusio n, was a lonely and frustrated man. He was sure that Lea would interpret his loss of the address as indifference on his part and another examp le of his instability. He was working, b ut was spending his idle time trying to find Lea and the children. What can be made of all this? In view of the less than idyllic circumst ances, it scarcely qualifies as an escape from reality via the unconscious. Nor is it the type of life one might select to enjoy v icariously. One can only spec ulate, and such specu lation of itself must consider concepts unac ceptable to prese nt-day science . However, the \"dual but dif ferent\" life activity may len d a clue to the \"where\" of Locale III. The most import ant assum ption is that Local e III and Lo cale I (Here-No w) are not the same. This is bas ed upon the differences in scienti fic development. Local e III is not more advance d, perhaps even less so. There is no time in our known history where scienc e was at the Local e III stage . If Locale III is neit her the known past nor the present, and not the probable future of Locale I, what is it? It is no t a part of Lo cale II, where only tho ught is nee ded or used . It might be a memory, racial or oth erwise, of a physical earth civilization that predates known histor y. It might be another earth- type world locate d in another part of the universe which is somehow acce ssible through mental manipula tion. It might be an antimatter duplicate of this physical earth-world where we are the same but different, bonded to gether unit for unit by a force beyond our present compr ehen sion. Dr. Leon M. Lederman, Professor of Physics at Colum bia University, has stated: \"Basic physics is co mpletely consist ent with the cosmo logical conception of a literal antiworld of stars and planets composed of atoms of antimat ter, which is to say negative nucle i surrounded by positive electro ns. We can now ente rtain the intriguing idea that these anti-worlds are populated by antip eople, whose antiscientists are perhaps even now excited by the discover y of matter'"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"7. POST MORTEM Any acknowledg ment of the existenc e of the Second Body im mediately demands the questio n mankind has pondered since the day he learned to think: Do we live on? Is there life beyond the grave? Our religions say believe, have faith. This is not quite enough for the syllogistic think er who seeks valid premises that are clear-cut, leading to an inesca pable conclusi on. All I can do is be as reportorial and objective as one can be in a basically subjective experie nce. Perhaps my premises will be valid to you as you read them. I first met Dr. Richard Gordon in 1942, in New York. H e was an M.D., a specialist in internal medicine. We became friends, and he became our family doctor. He had a very suc cessfu l practice, built up over the years, an d possessed a rare cynical- sarcastic sense of humor. He was a down-to-earth realist with the wisdom of experie nce. He was in his fifties when we first met, so I never knew him as a young man. He was shor t and thin, with straight white hair, tending to bald ness. Dr. Gordon had two conspicuous mannerisms. He had decided to live a long time, evidently, and so paced himself very carefully. He walked deliberately in a slow, careful stride. He hurried only when absolutely necess ary. More correctly, he strolled when he walked, with studied casualness. Second, when someone visited him in his office, he would glance out from the inner doorwa y and stare intently. He didn't say \"hello\" or nod or wave. He simp ly stared as if he were saying, \" Now what in hell's the matter with him! \" Without ever having spok en of it, Dr. Gordon and I had a very warm and close rapport. It was one of those things that happen without explan ation, with no logical reason. We had not too much in common, other than the fact of going going t hrough a life experience at nearly the same moment in histor y. In the spring of 1961 visited Dr. Gordo n at his office and had lunch with him there, cooke d over a Bunsen burner by his long-time nurse. He looked tired and preocc upied and I com mented about it. \"I haven't been feeling too well,\" he replied, and then flared up into his usual self. \"What's the matter, can't a doctor get sick onc e in a while!\" I laugh ed, and suggested he do something about it, such as seeing his family physician, \"I will,\" he said absently, the n back up to his normal self, \"but first, I'm going to Europ e.\" I said that sounded fine. \"Already have the tickets,\" he went on. \"We've gone a number of times before, but this time I want to see a lot of the places we've missed. You ever been to Greece, or Turkey, Spa in, Portugal, Egypt?\" I said no. \"Well, you ought to,\" he said, pushing his food away. \"Go when you have the chanc e. You wouldn't want to miss see ing places like that. I'm not going to miss my chanc e.\" I said I wou ld do my best, but that I didn't have a fat prac tice that would wait around for me to return. But he was serious again. \"Bob?\" I waited for him to continue. \"I don't like the way I feel,\" he said carefully. \"I don't like . . . w hy don't you and your"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"wife come to Europe with us?\" I wish we had. Dr. Gordon and his wife sailed to Spain a week or so later. There was no word, so I assum ed they w ere sunn ing them selves somewhere in the Mediterrane an. Six weeks later, Mrs. Gordon phoned. The doctor had taken sick in Europe and they had to cut short their trip. He had refused treatment overseas, and had insiste d that they return home instead. He had been in great pain, and had gone immediately into the hospit al for an explorat ory oper a tion. I was una ble to see him in the hospital, but I was kept informed of his condition by his wife. The explorat ory opera tion was a success. They found what they were looking for, an abdominal cancer, beyon d treatment. Nothing more could be done but to make him as comfortable as possib le. He would never leave the hospital. Alive, that is. Or more aptly, physi cally alive. With this news, I f elt I must find some way to see Dr. Gor don. It was all quite clear now, as most things are in retro spect. I am sure he knew of his cond ition that day in his of fice. After all, he was an internist He certainly could have read the signs and symptoms in his own very perso nal labora tory. That was the reason for the sudden trip to Europe. He definitely wasn't going to miss his last chance! And he didn't The need to talk with Dr. Gordon seemed urgent. In all of our conversations, I had never me ntioned my \"wild talent\" or what I had been going throu gh. I think I was afraid he would have thrown back his head and laughed, then sent me to his psychiatrist son. Now it was different. He was racing somet hing where per haps I could help him for a chang e. I didn' t know how w hat I had gone through could help, but I had a deep conviction that it would. I tried again and again to see Dr. Gordo n, but only his wife was permitt ed in his room. I finally asked Mrs. Gordon to help me get in to see him. She explain ed that the docto r was in such pain that he was kept under deep sedation most of the time. Thus he was very rarely lucid and consci ous. Usually he recogni zed her early in the morning, but even this didn't happen every day. I told her that I had something im - portant to tell him. I didn't elaborate. Even in her sorrow, she seem ed to recognize that I intended to bring a messag e be yond that of a com forting friend. The intuitive woman found a solution. \"Why don't you write him a letter,' she suggested. \"I'll take it to him.\" I said I was afraid he wouldn't be able to read it. \"If you write it,\" she said, \"I'll read it to him, when he's conscio us enough to understand it.\" And so that was what we did. She read it again and again to Dr. Gordon whenever he was consci ous. She told me later that these repeated readings were at his request, not at her sugg estion. Was there something in the letter he wanted to place firmly in his mind? When I heard this, I felt a great sense of regret. Perha ps he would not have leaned back and laugh ed, after all. We might have shared much more if I had only ga thered the courage to discuss my \"activities\" with him. Here are perti nent excerpts of the letter to Dr. Gordon: \". . . and you remember all the tests and exami nations you gave me becaus e you knew I wa s worried about something. Well, that was when it started. Now as long as you are in the hospital for a while, you might just try it and find out for yourself.

An d don't tell your wife to send me to that psychiatrist son of yours. It ta kes more than Freud to solve this one. Besides, he's making enough money as it is. \"In all of our conversations, it didn't seem appropriate to bring up this subject. But as long as you're going to be tied down, give it some seriou s consideration. It might be useful later on, and I hope you can discove r a few things about it that I have passed over. It all depends upon whether you can also develo p the ability to 'leave' your physical body wh ile loafing in that hospital bed. If so, you might find many ways that it can be helpful. It may be one way to ease physical pain. I don't know. Gi ve it a try. \"... With all the sincer ity I can muster, I urge you, Dick, to think about it. You will have passe d a major milest one when you do no more than accept the idea that this secon d, non-physical body of yours actual ly might exist.

If you can hang onto this, you need not have fear. Then, and only the n, try the formula I have written here. I don't know the effect of any me dication you may be taking.

Just let me know. . , .\" Mrs. Gordon did not let me know if he actually did try. I felt it entirely ina ppropriate to query her too specifically at the time. She was muc h too sadly o verwrought with the knowledge that Dr. Gordon's condition was termin al. I still am not sure that she realized my letter could be constru ed as suggested training for death. Dr. Gordon dropped into a coma several weeks later. He died peacefully without regaining consciousness. For se veral months I thought about an attempt to \"go\" to Dr. Gordo n, wherever h e was. He was the first person close to me who had died since the develo pment of my \"wild talent .\" I was both curious and objective. It was the first such op portunity. I w as sure that Dr. Gordon wouldn't mind—if he did continue to exist. Not knowing abo ut such things, I decided he would prob ably n eed some rest before I interfered with whatever he was doing. Also, I needed to sum mon up some additi onal courage on my own. This was an experi ment I hadn't tried before. It might be truly dangerous. Then, on a Saturday afternoon, I made the attempt. It took about an hour to get into the vibrational state, and I finally swung up out of the body ment ally yelling, I w ant to see Dr. Gordon ! After a moment, I started to move rapidly upwar d, and soon all I coul d see was a blur of motion and feel what seem ed like a rush of very thin air. Al so, I felt a hand under my left elbow. Somebody was helping me get there."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"After what seemed an endless journey, I suddenly stopped (or was halte d). I was standi ng, somewhat dazed, in a large room. My impression was that it was an institutio n of some kind. The hand under my elbo w moved me to an open doorway, and stopped me just inside the door, where I coul d look into the adjoin ing room. A male voice spoke almos t directly into my left ear. \"If you stand right here, the doctor will see you in a minute.\" I nodded agreement, and stood there waiting. A group of men were in the room. Three or four were listening to a young man about twenty-two who was excite dly relating something to them, comp lete with gestu res. I didn't see Dr. Gordo n, and kept expecting him to appear at any m oment. The more I waited, the warmer I seem ed to feel. Finally, I beca me so hot that I was ext remely uncom fortable. I didn't know what was causi ng me to feel so hot, and I wasn't sure I could stand it much longer. It actua lly felt as if streams of perspirat ion were running down my face. I knew that I couldn't stay much longer; I couldn't take the heat. If Dr. Gordo n didn't appear soon, I wou ld have to go back without seeing him. I turned and looked again at the group of men, thinking that perhaps I should ask them about Dr. Gordo n. At just that moment, the short, thin young man with the big shock of hair stopped in the middle of his conversation, and looke d at me intently for a moment. After the simple short glance, he turned back to the other men and contin ued his ani mated discussion, The heat became unbearable, and I deci ded I had to leave. I coul dn't wait for Dr. Gordo n. Using a motion I had learned, I moved quickly upward and away from the room. It was a long journey back. After reintegrating, I checked my physical body. I felt cold, a little stiff. Certainly t here were no streams of perspiration running down my chee ks. Disappointed, I sat up and made notes of the trip. I had failed for some reason. I had not been able to find Dr. Gordon. Time away from the physical was two ho urs. There is a stubb orn streak in my here dity. T he following Saturday I tried again. Just at the moment I left the physical body and started to yell for Dr. Gordo n, a voice spoke right beside me, almos t irritated. \"Why do you want to see him again ? You saw him last Saturday!\" I was so surprised that I dropped back into the physical almost instantly. I sat up and looked around the office. There was no one in the room. Everything was norma l. I thought of trying again, but decided it was too late for another attem pt that day. Last Saturday. There was nothing importa nt about last Saturday. It hadn't worked. I went back through my note s for \"last Saturday.\" And there it was. \"The doctor will see you in a minute.' And what could have been a minute later, a short, thin young man with a shock of hair had turned and looked at me intently. He had looke d at me without saying a word, as if he were thinking. What I had noted was a perfect description of what Dr. Gordon would have been at twenty-two inste ad of seventy. This seem ed to lend more credence to the experienc e than anything else. I had expecte d to see a man of seven ty. I did n't recogni ze him because he was not what I expecte d. If I had suggested this as a hallucination, I conc eivably would have met a seventy-year-old Dr. Gordon. Later, at a visit to the home of Dr. Gordon's widow, I manage d to see an old photo of Dr. Gordon when he was twenty-two. Of course, I didn' t tell Mrs. Gordon why I wanted to see the picture. It matched perfectly the man I saw, and who saw me"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"\"there.\" She also mentioned that at that age, he was very active and eager, always in a hurry, and had a big sh ock of blond hair. Someday I will try again to visit Dr. Gordon. Another time, in anticipation of a move out of state, we sold our home when a buyer suddenly cam e along. As a tem porary measure, we rented a house for the year prior to our move . . It was an interesting place built on a pinnacle of rock di rectly over a small river. We rented it through an agent, and never met or came in conta ct with the owner. My wife and I took the master bedroom, which was on the main floor. About a week after we moved in, we went to bed and my wife fell aslee p almost immediately. I lay there in semidark-ness and looke d through the floor-to-ceiling windows at the night sky. Without willing it, I f elt the familiar vibrations begin, and wondered if it would be all right to let it hap pen in the new location., Our bed was positioned off the north wall. To the right of the bed, if you were lying down, was the door to the hall. To the left of the bed was the doorway into the master bath room. I was just in the act of lifting out of the physical when I noticed something at the doorwa y. It was a white form the general size and shape of a perso n. Having b ecome extremely cautious about \"strangers,\" I waited to see what would happen. The white form moved into the room, around the bed, and passed within a foot of my side of the bed as it went into the bathroom. I could see that it was a woman of medium height, with dark straight hair and rather deep-set eyes, not young, not old. She was in the bathroom only a few mom ents, then emerged and started around the bed again. I sat up—non-physicall y, I'm sure—a nd reached out to touch her, to see if I really could. Seeing the motion, she stopped and looked at me. When she spoke, I could hear her quite clearl y. I coul d see the win dows an d drapes behind her and through her. \"What are you going to do about the painting?\" It was a woman's voice, and I could see her lips move. Not knowing w hat to say, I tried to give a satisfactory answer. I said I would take care of it, don't worry. With this, she smiled slightly. Then she reach ed out with both her hands and took my hand in hers, clasping my hand between both of hers. The hands felt real, normally warm and alive. She gave my hand a little squeeze, gently dropped it, and move d around the bed and out the door. I waited, but she didn't return. 1 lay down, activa ted the physical, then slid out of bed. I went to the hall door and looked into the other rooms. There was no one there. I went through all of the downstairs rooms and found nothing. Then I made out my notes, went back to bed, and slept. A few days later I met the psychiatrist who lived in the house next to us, Dr. Samuel Kahn. (I kept meeting psychia trists this casually!) I asked him if he had known the people who owned our house. \"Yes, yes, I knew them quite well,\" Dr. Kahn said. \"Mrs. W. died about a year ago. After that, Mr. W. refused to go into the house, just m oved out and didn't come back.\" I said it was too bad, that it was a fine house. \"Well, it was her house, you understand,' Dr. Kahn re plied. \"Matter of fact, she died"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"right there in the house, in the room you're sleepi ng in.\" I said that was interesting. She must have liked the house very much. \"Oh, she did,\" he replied. \"Very fond of paintings. Had them hung all over the place. But the house was pretty muc h her whole life.\" I aske d him if he happened to have a photo of Mrs. W. \"Let me see.\" He thought for a moment. \"Why, yes. I think she was in on a group picture taken at the club. I'll see if I can find it.\" Dr. Kah n came back a few min utes later. In his hand was a photograph showing some fifty or si xty men and women, most of them simply heads as they sto od in rows. Dr. Kah n studied the pictur e. \"She's in here somewhe re, yes, I'm sure.\" I looke d over his shoulder at the picture. In the secon d row was a familiar face. I touched it with my finger and asked Dr. Kah n if this was Mrs. W. \"Oh yes, ye s, that's Mrs. W.\" He looked at me curiously, then with realization. \"Oh, you must have found a picture of her in the house some where.\" I said yes, that was it. Very casually, I a sked him if Mrs. W. had had any unusual mannerisms or the like. \"No, not that I can remember,' he answered. \"But I'll think about it. There must have been something.\" I thanked him, and started to leave. I turned when he called. \"Wait a minut e, there was one item,\" Dr. Kahn said. I aske d what it was. \"Why, whenever she was happy or grateful, she took your hand in both of hers, palm to palm, and gave a little squeeze. Does that help?\" That helped. With experie nce, I became a little more convinced that I coul d take such chanc es in areas that were certainly unu sual. A very close friend, Agnew Ba hnson, was abo ut my age and we had much in common. I had known him for about eight years. He was a pilot, among other things, and flew freque ntly in his company airplane. One of his research interests was antigravity, which we discuss ed many times. He had a labora tory where he conducted experiments in this field. Among matters we discuss ed relative to his gravity studies was the questio n of how on e or even two people could demonstrate any e ffective results in antigra vity in this age of massive re search teams and extremely expe nsive instrumentation. On a business trip to New York in 1964, I found myself in my hotel room with an hour to spare in the afternoon. I de cided to take a nap. I lay down on the bed, and had just started to drop off to sleep when I heard Mr. Bahnson's voice. \"There is a way to prove antigravity. All you have to do is to demonstrate it yoursel f, and you have been trained to do it\" I sat up, fully awake. I knew w hat the voice was referring to, but I hadn't had the courage to try it. But why did Mr. Bahnson's voice sound so real in this dream? I looked at the clock by the bed, and it was just a bout three-fifteen. I was too wide awake now to sleep, so I got up and went out When I returned home two days later, my wife was very quiet I aske d her what was wrong. \"We didn't want to upset you with all you had to do in New York,\" she said, \"but Agnew Ba hnson is dea d. He was killed trying to land his airplane in a small field out in Ohio. \" I reme mbered Mr. Bahnson's voice in New York. I asked her if he had been killed two"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"days ago, at about three-fifteen in the afternoon. My wife looke d at me a long rime before she said, 'Yes. That was when it happened.\" She didn't ask how I knew. S he was past that long ago. I didn't make any a ttempt to \"go** to Mr. Bahnson for sever al months. I presumed without any kn own reason that he needed rest. It had something to do with a violent death, and I'm still not sure I was right Finally, I g rew impat ient On Sunday afternoon I lay down with the deliberate intent of going to visit Mr. Bahnson. After about an hour of preparation, I finally made it out of the physical, and began to travel rapidly th rough what seemed to be nothing but darkness. I was me ntally shouti ng, Agnew Bahnson I, again and again as I traveled. Suddenly, I stopped, or was stopped, I was in a rather dark room. Someone was holding me very still in a standing po sition. After a moment of waiting, a cloud of white gas seem ed to blow up through a small hole in the floor. The cloud took form and some sense told me it was Mr. Bahnson, although I could not see him too well or identify his features. He spoke immediately in an excited and happy way. \"Bob, you'll never be lieve all of the things that have hap pened since I've been here!\" There was no more. At a signal from someone, the cloud of white gas lost its hum an form and seemed to recede back into the hole in the floor. The hands on my elbows steere d me away, and I took off back to the physical. That is the way Mr. Bahnson would have been—too in terested in new things and new experie nces to waste time in the \"then\" or the past Just like Dr. Gordo n. If it was a self-induced hallucination, at least it was origi nal I have never read anything like it. Does that explai n the time coincid ence in the New York hotel room? There is one more. In 1964 my father died at the age of eighty-two. Although I had been rebellious in early years against paternal authority, I felt quite close to my father in later years. And I'm sure he felt close to me. He had suffered a stroke sever al months before which had left him almost compl etely paralyzed and incapable of speec h. The latter was evidently most vexing, as it would naturally be to a man who was a linguist, whose life had been devoted to the study and teaching of langu ages. During this period, when I visited him, he made desperate, heart-rending attempts to speak to me, to tell me some thing. His eyes pleaded that I understand. Only slight moans came from his lips. I tried to com fort him, talked to him. He tried his best to answer. I coul dn't tell if he even understood my words. My father died quietly in his sleep one afternoon. He had lived a full life, a success ful one, and his death brought min gled sadness and a sense of releas e. Again and again, I have realized the import ance of some of the down-to-earth beliefs and concepts that I learned from my father. I will always be grateful. This time, with one very close to me just recently dea d, I had much less trepidation than before. Or perhaps familiar ity, at least the sense of it, bred a little less caution and more faith. The only reason that I waited several months was one of conven ience. Other pressing matters in my personal and busi ness life seemed to preven t the necessary ability to relax. Ho wever, I wo ke up at about 3 A.M. on a week-night and felt that I could try to visit my father. I went through my ritual, and the vibrations came easily a nd swiftly. In moments, I"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"disengage d without effort, and was up and free in the darkness. This time, I didn't use the mental yell. I concentrated upon the personality of my father and \"reach ed\" to be where he was. I bega n to move rapidly through the darkness. I coul d see nothing, but there was the tremendous sense of motion cou pled with the pull of thick, liquidlike air rush ing past my body. It is muc h like the feeling of plunging through water after a dive. Suddenly, I stopped. I do not recall anyon e stop ping me this time, nor could I feel the hand on my elbow. I was in a dim room of large proportions. I seemed to know that this was like a hospital or convales cent home, but no treatment as we know it w as practiced here. I started to look around for my father. I didn't know what to expect , but at least I looked forward to a joyful re union. There were sever al small rooms off the main room where I stood. I looke d into two of these, and in each there were several people who paid little attention to me. I began to wonder if I had come to the wrong plac e. The third room was no larger than a monk's cell, with a small window abo ut shoul der height in the wall opposite the door. There was a man leaning against the wall near the win dow, looking out. I saw only his back as I entered. Then he turned and saw me. His fa ce register ed utter as tonishment, and my \"dead\" father spoke to me. \"What are you doing here!\" He said this in exactl y the manner a person would use who had traveled halfway around the world and then met someone to whom he had just said goodbye back home. I was too excited to speak, and just stood there, hoping for the joyful reunion I had expecte d. It came immediately. M y father reached forward, grabbed me under the armpits, and happily swung me high over his head and down again, just as I remem bered so well as a small child, just a s most fathers have done with their small sons. He put me down on my feet again, and I was con fident enough to speak. I aske d him how he was feeling. \"Much better now,\" he said. \"The pain is gone.\" It was alm ost as if I had reminded him of somet hing he wanted to forget. The energy seemed to drain out of him, and he turned away, appearing tired. As I watched him, he seemed to forget I was there. He looke d thinner, and about fifty, base d upon pictures we have when he was that age. I sens ed that the meeting was over. There could be no more for now. Q uietly, I moved back out of the room, turned and \"reached\" out, and returned to the physical body. It took much less time to return than to go. Was it that way? Was the pain so intense in those last days w hen he couldn't make himse lf understood to get help to ease that pain? If that is true, what a terrible prison his body must have been. Death was ind eed a blessing. Will I try to \"see\" him again? I don't know, I do n't know if I should. There are many oth er exper iences, less personal, but equally impressive. They all led me to an inescapable empiri cal conclusion, which alone justified the many, many hours of anguish, uncertainty, fear, loneliness, and disillusio n; which was a point of embarkation on what some call the Quantum Jump in thinking and the begin ning of a new view point and perspective; which permitt ed the pains and pleas ures of Here-"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Now to drop into their proper category of importance (what is a minute, hour, or year in an infinity of existen ce?); which opened a doorway to a reality t hat may ultima tely prove incom prehensible to the consci ous human mind, yet will contin ue to tantalize the curious and incrimi nate the intellectual. Is this my answer? Compound these experie nces with the knowledge that the human personality can and does operate away from the physical body, and there can be but one. If there is to be a Great Message herein, this may suffice. If the human being has a Second Body, if that Second Body sur vives what we call death, if perso nality and charact er con tinue to exist i n this new-old form—wha t then? Again, an age-old questio n that pleads for an answer. To date, in twelve years of non-physical activities, I find no evidence to subst antiate the biblical notions of God and afterlife in a place called heave n. Perhaps I have found this and simply haven't recognized it. It is q uite possible. It may be that I am not \"qualified.\" On the other hand, much of what I have encountered could be some basics which have been distorted through hundreds of years. Let's start with prayer, w hich is sup posed to be a direct comm unication with God . As we are taught to pray today, it i s as if a chemical formula is recited without any knowledge of the original intent or me aning of the ingredients. Or the way our children sing \" London Bridge Is Falling Down,\" with no knowledg e of the original meaning of the song. Our entire civilization is filled with such irrational habits. Evidently, pra yer is one of these. Somewhere, some one knew how to pray. He tried to teach others. A few learn ed the methodology. Others absorbed only the words, and the words themselves became altered and changed over the years. Gradually, the technique was lost, until accidentally (?) rediscover ed periodically through the ages. In the latter cases, only rarely has the rediscoverer bee n able to convince others that the Old, Established Way is not quite right This is all I can report. The Old, Established Way is not enough. Or as I say, perh aps I am not qualified. Worse still, it may be that my prayer training was insu fficient or im - proper. At any ra te, it didn 't work for me. Here is an illustration. On one non-physical excursion, I was spe eding through nothing back to the physical with eve rything apparently well under control. Without warning, I rammed into a solid wall of some impenetrable material. I wasn't hurt, but I was utterly shocked . The material was hard and solid, and seem ed to be made of huge plates of steel overlappi ng slightly and welded to gether. Each had a slight curvature as if: part of a globe. I tried to push through it, but could not. I wen t up, down, to the right, and to the left. I was absolutely sure my physical body lay beyond this barrier . After what seemed an hour of scratching, clawing, and pushing at this barrier, I prayed. I used every prayer I ha d ever learned, and made up a few special ones. And I mea nt every word more than I had ever meant anyth ing in my life. I was that frighte ned. Nothing happened. I was still plastered against the bar rier, un able to get through and back to my physical body. I panicked. I clawed, screamed, and sobbed. After this proved futile, I finally calm ed"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"down only out of emotional ex hausti on. Feeling lost, I lay there and rested, clingin g to the cold, hard wall I don't know h ow long I lay there until the ability to think objectively returne d. But it did. I couldn't stay there forever —o r at least I didn't want to. It see med an impossible situa tion. Where before had I encountered an apparently impos sible situation? I reme mbered. Years be fore, a friend and I had purchased an airplane whose flight charact eristics we did not know. T he only r eason we bought this particular plane was that it was cheap and in good condition. After several practice flights around the field, we deci ded to take it up for acrobatics. With borrow ed parac hutes, we took off and headed up to around ten thous and feet. We took it throu gh several lazy eights, a few sloppy loo ps, and several spins. Everything seem ed all right. After climbing back to altitude, we nosed the ship down slightly and popped stick and rudder to go int o a snap roll. The next thing we knew, w e were in a spin. We center ed stick, an d forward, the accept ed recovery proce dure. It had worked before beautifully. But not this time. The spin be came flatter, faster, and was developing a whiplike action. Opposite rudder against the spin, bursts of power, no ne had any e ffect on the spin. If anything, the spin worsened and the ground was coming up fast. Bill looke d around from the front cockp it, his face white. He yelled at me over the wind roar, \" We better get out of here!\" I was ready to leave too. The only thing th at kept me there a few mo re seconds was the possible loss of the airplane for which I had saved so long. I reasoned, We've tried everything excep t the procedure that violates the rules, the one thing no t to do if you're in a spin. Pull back on the stick. W hat did I have to lose? I pulle d back on the stick. T he ship straighte ned out of the spin immediately and gathered flying sp eed. I rolled it until the earth was whe re it belonged. We landed safely and crawled out shakily and sat on the ground. We had fallen into an outside spin. Neither of us had seen such a spin be fore, much less tried one. I reme mbered the outside spin. I tried to apply the con cept as I lay there panting against the barrier. Forward, up, down, right, lef t—no good. There was Just one remaining direction , although my knowledge said definitely it was not right. It coul dn't make things any w orse to try, so I did, and only a few mo ments later, I was back in the physical shaken but safe. Which way? It w as obvious in hindsight: away from the barrier, back in the direction from which I had been travel ing. Why this worked, I don't know. Nor do I know what the barrier w as. Perha ps it cou ld be rationa lized that prayer did work. I did get back, didn't I? If it did, it was not in the manner that religion taught me. No helping angel came hurrying to give me aid and comfort Another time, I was visiting my brother and his family overnight Shortly af ter retiring to the guest room, I went to bed for some much needed rest. If it has any bearing, the headboard of my bed backed against the wall sep arating my room from that of my four-year-old niece. Her bed was directly against the same wall As I stretche d out in the dark, the familiar surge of vibra tions came, and I decided to slip out for a moment just to test being in this condition away from home. The moment I left the physical, I became aware of three beings in the room. I stayed cautio usly close to my physical body as they came nearer. They started to pull at me, not hard, but deliberately as if to see what I would do. They were having a good time"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"at it. I tried to stay calm, but there were three of them. I wasn't sure I coul d get back into the physical quickl y enough before they pulled me away. So I prayed. Again, I used every prayer I knew. I asked God to help me. I praye d in the name of Jesus Christ f or help. I tried a few saints I had heard of through my Catho lic wife. The result? My tormentors laughe d loudly and worked me over mo re enthusi astically. \"Listen to him pray to his gods,\" one chuckl ed, most con temptuously. \"Listen to him!\" I think I got a little angry after that. I began to push back, got close to my physical body, and dove in. I wasn't exactl y fighting back, but I certainly did n't remain passive. I sat up in the physical most relieved to be back. Even as I sat up, I heard a child crying. It was comi ng from the room beyon d the wall. I wa ited several minutes, expecting my sister -in-law to come and calm the little girl and get her back to sleep . After some ten minutes, the little girl, J., still had not stopp ed. I got u p and went out to the adjoining bedroom. My sister-in-law had the little girl, who was still sobbing deeply, in her arms and was trying to com fort her. I aske d what was wrong, and could I help? \"She'll be all right in a little while, I think,\" my sister -in-law replied. \"She must have had a nightmare or bad dream, and I can't seem to wake her up.\" I aske d how long the girl had been crying. \"Oh, just a few minutes before you came in. She isn't like this. She usually sleeps very soundly.\" I offered again to help if needed, and went back to my room. Some time later little J. quiete d down and evidently went to sleep. Was my niece's trancelike nightm are a coinci dence? Or perhaps some new pra ying tech nique is needed on my part There are many more such incide nts, but they followed much the same pattern when I attem pted the conventio nal and accept ed approach to prayer. There are, however, m ore positive prospect s to report re-garding heaven and hell. If they exist, they are somewher e in Loca le II. In non-physical trips to Locale II, often there is a \"layer\" or area which one must pass through, as mentioned earlier. It see ms to be the part of Locale II close st to Here- Now, and in some way most related. It is a gray-black hungry ocean where the slightest motio n attracts nibbling and tormenting beings. It is as if you are the bait dangling in this vast se a. If you move slowly and do not react to the curious \"fish\" who come to investigate, you pass through without much incident. Move violently and fight back, then more excited denizens come rushing in to bite, pull, push, shove. Could this be the borders of hell? It is easy to conclude that a momentary penetration of this nearby layer would bring \"d emons\" and \"devils\" to mind as the chief inhabitants. They seem subhuman, yet have an evident ability t o act and think independently. Who and what are they? I don't know. I haven 't taken the trouble to stay there long enough to find out. Only by terri fied trial and error did I find the method to pass through in reasonable peace. In these worlds where thoughts are not only thing s, but are everything, including you, your pois on or perf ection is of your own making. If you are a remorseless killer, yo u may en d up in that part of Locale II where all are of the same design. This truly would"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"be hell for such people, for there would be no innocent, defenseless victims. Project this outward, and you can begin to perceive the myriad variations. Your destin ation in the heaven or hell of Locale II see ms to be grounded comp letely within the frame work of your deepest constan t (and perhaps non-conscious) motivations, emotions, and personality drives. The most con sistent and strongest of these act as your \"ho ming\" device when you enter this realm. I am sure of this because it always works this wa y when I have traveled non- physicall y in Locale II. It works th is way whether I want it to or not . The least stray desire at the wrong time, or a deep-seated emotion I wasn't aware of, diverts m y trip in that 'like\" directio n. Some of the resulting destin ations have had all the aspects of hell to me. Others might possibly be const rued as heaven, and some differ in practice only sli ghtly from our activities in Here-Now. So. If Locale II see ms to have portions of hell and doesn't quite live up to our notions of heaven , what then? Where do we look for the guidepost? Where are the God and heave n that we worship? Have I missed something? And yet, at times, in visiting Loca le II, a very unusual event periodically occur s. It makes no difference where in Locale II, the event is the same . In the midst of normal activity, whatever it may be, there is a distant Signal, almost like heraldic trumpets. Everyone takes the Signal calmly, and with it, everyone stops speak ing or whatever he may be doing. It is the Signal that He (or They) is comi ng through His Kingdom. There is no awestruck prostratio n or falling down on one's knees. Rather, the attitud e is most matter-of-fact It is an occurrence to which all are accust omed and to comp ly takes absol ute prece dence over everything. There are no excep tions. At the Signal, each living thing lies down—m y impression is on their backs, bodies arched to expose the abdomen (not the genitals), with head turned to one side so that one does not see Him as He passes by. The purpose seems to be to form a living road over which He can travel. I have gleaned the idea that occasionally He will select some one from this living bridge, and that perso n is never seen or heard from again. The purpose of the abdominal exposure is an expression of faith and compl ete submissiven ess, the abdomen being the most vulnerable part of the body or the area that can suf fer damage most easily. Th ere is no movement, not even thought, as He passes by. Everything has come to a momen tary standstill, full and compl ete, while He passes. In the sever al times that I have experienced this, I lay down with the others. At the time, the thought of doing otherwise was inconceivable. As He passes, there is a roaring music al sound and a feeling of radiant, irresistible living forc e of ultimate power that peaks overhead and fades in the dis tance. I remember wondering once what would happen to me if He discove red my prese nce, as a temporary v isitor. I wasn't sure I wanted to find out. After His passing, everyone gets up again and resume s their activities. There is no comment or me ntion of the inci dent, no further thought of it There is complete accept ance of the event as an ordinary part of their lives, and this is th e great yet subtle difference. It is a n action as casual as halting for a traffic light at a busy intersecti on, or waiting at the rail road crossing when the signal indicates that a train is coming; you are unconcerned and yet feel unspoken respe ct for the power represen ted in the passing train. The event is also"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"impers onal. Is this God? Or God's son? Or His represe ntative? Three times I have \"gone \" to a place that I cann ot find words to describ e accurately. Again, it is this vision, this in terpretation, the temporary visitation to this \"place\" or state of being that brings the mess age we have heard so often throughout the history of man. I am sure that this may be part of the ultimate heaven as our religions conce ive it It must also be the nirvana, the Samadhi, the supreme experi ence related to us by the mystics o f the ages. It is truly a state of being, very likely interpreted by the individu al in many different ways. To me, it was a place or condition of pure peace, yet ex quisite emotion. It was as if you were floating in warm soft clouds where there is no up or down, where nothing exists as a separate piece of matter. The warmth is not merely aroun d you, it is of you and through you. Your percep tion is daz zled and overwhelm ed by the Perfect Environment. The cloud in which you float is swept by rays of light in shapes and hues that are consta ntly cha nging, and each is good as you bathe in them as they pass over you. Ruby-red rays of light, or something beyon d what we know as light, because no light ever felt this meaningful. All the colors of the spectrum come and go co nstantly, never harshly, an d each brings a different soothing or restful happiness. It is a s if you are within and a part of the clouds surrounding an eternally glowing sunse t, and with every changing pattern of living color , you also change. You respo nd and drink into you the eternity of the blues, yellows, greens, and reds, and the complexities of the interm ediates. All are familiar to you. This is where you belong. This is Home. As you move slowly and effortlessly t hrough the cloud, there is music around you. It is not some thing of which you become aware. It is the re all the time, and you vibrate in harmo ny with the Music. Again, this is more than the music you knew b ack there. It is only those harmonies, the delicate and dynam ic melodic passages, the multivoiced counter point, the poignant overtones—it is only those that have evoked in you the deep, incoherent emotion back there. The mundane is missing. Choirs of human-sounding voices echo in wordless song. Infinite patterns of strings in all shades of subtle harmo ny interweave in cyclical yet develo ping themes, and you resonate with them. There is no source from which the Music come s. It is there, all around you, in you, you are a part of it, and it is you. It is the purity of a truth of which you have had only a glimpse. This is the feast, and the tiny tidbits you tasted before, back there, had made you hope for the existence of the Whole. The nameless emotion, longing, nostalgia, sense of destiny that you felt back there when you stared at the cloud-layered sunse t in Hawaii, whe n you stood quietly amo ng the tall, waving trees in the silent forest, when a mu sical selection, passag e, or song recalled memories of the past or brought forth a longing for which there was no associated memory, when you longe d for the place where you belonged, whether city, town, cou ntry, nation, or family—thes e are now fulfilled. You are Home . You are where you belong. Where you always shoul d have been. Most import ant, you are not alone. With you, beside you, interlock ed in you are others. They do not have names, nor are you aware of them as shapes, but you know the m and you are bonded to them with a great single knowledg e. They are exactly like you, they are you, and like you, they are Home. You feel with them, like gentle waves of electr icity passing between you, a completeness of love, of which all the facets you have experienced are but segmen ts and in compl ete portions.

Each of the three times I wen t There, I did not return voluntarily. I cam e back sadly, relucta ntly. Som eone helped me return. Each time after I returne d, I suffered intense nostalgia and loneliness for days. I felt as an alien might among strangers in a land where things were not \"right,\" where everything and everyone was so different and so \"wrong\" when compared with where you belonged. Acute loneliness, nostalgia, and some thing akin to homesickness. So great was it that I have not tried to go There again. Was this heaven? Once I tried to simulate There, on this world. I reme mbered as a child swimming in a pool that had underwater deep-hued colored lights set in the walls. I remembered spe cifically wh ich poo l had featured such lights. Our country ho me had a swimming pool, so I set to work. We installed underwater lights, and I used color on the lights. Try as I might, I coul dn't get the deep hues I remem bered. Too much power was required. Also, we put in an under water speaker so that you coul d lie in the water, with your ears subm erged, and listen to music from the system in the house. This worked quite well. But it was not There, or close to it. There was one peculiar item. Upon visiting the site of my childhood, the pool I remem bered was there, but it did not have colore d lights under the water. No one, including old friends who swam with me in the pool, could remember this pool as ever havin g colore d lights under the water. Reality, Reality!"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"9. ANGELS AND ARCHETYPES One of the greatest enigmas of this w hole affair is that some one— or more than one —has been helping me f rom ti me to time in such expe rimentation. Perh aps they are with me ever y time, and I am just not aware of them. I do not know who these helpers are or why they are helping me. They certainly do not seem to be guardia n angels, although a more conventionally oriented personality might so interpret them. They do not always respon d when I need help, nor are they alw ays responsive to praye r. Mental anguish and scream ing have some times brought one of them. More often, they help me when I do not ask for help—or again, when I am not aware of asking. Their assistance seems to be more of their choos ing and deliberation than mine. They are rarely \"friendly\" in the sense that we understand the term. Yet there is a definite sense of understanding, knowledg e, and purposefulness in their actions toward me. I feel no intent on their part to bring harm to me and I trust their directio ns. Much of the help has been subtly appl ied. For exam ple, the \"hands\" that boosted me up the hill to Dr. Brads haw's hous e were obviously help ing me to achieve what I desire d. I did not see who was assisting me. However, just p rior to the assistan ce, I saw some one sitting y oga-fashion, with robes and headpiece. Was this the \"helper\"? In Chapter 10, the robed man with the hauntingly familiar eyes and face who responded to my anguis hed plea when I was trying to rid myself of the \"parasites\" paid little atten tion to my emotional distress. Yet he had obviously co me to help. He came as a result of my problem. Still, he offered no words of comfort, nor did he attempt to calm or reassure me. I never sa w the helper who to ok me on the voyage to visit Dr. Gordon in Locale II. I felt his hands and heard his voice, no more. The same applied to the helper who, a week later, comm ented that I had already made the trip when I at tempted to do so again. There is som e inherent acceptance of the assista nce without question. Rarely has it occurred to me at the time to turn and identify the helper. It see ms a rather natural thing. The two young m en who took me to the apartment after the seance meeting do not seem to fit into the typical cate gory here. There was a definite sense that they cam e for that particular purpose and nothing else. This brings u p the next peculiarity. Of all the helpers from whom I have obtained some repeatable identification, only one have I been able to identify a secon d time. In my visit to Agnew Bahnson in Locale II, som eone held me in position to see him. The feeling of gentle but firm hands on each side of me was very strong. The same hands, turning me aroun d to leave, much as one steers a blind per son, could not have been more vivid. It was another case of a helper respo nding to a specific desire on my part. When I panicked, screame d, and prayed against the barrier on my way back, no help came. When I was being teased and tormented by the entities, no help came. When I was at tacked by the beings so savagely, no help came. More ac curately, if it did, I was not aware of it What is the difference? How do \"they\" decide when to help, and when to leave me alone? I don't know. Most o f all, who q uietly insisted that I return to the physi cal when I drifted in that"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"seemi ngly etern al bliss? I don't know whether to be grateful or sad for that particular help. I don't classi fy the \"host\" (Chapter 12) as one of the same helpers, yet he may well have been. He is one of those whom I would have no difficulty recognizing if I saw again. He was different in that I did get an impressio n of warm friendliness and comra deship, but he was in some manner not quite the same as I—old er, knowledge able in another field. He was dif ferent in that he came forward and offered his help. This was one of the few times that the option was mine. Strangely, the other times I needed help badly, none ap peared—e.g., the wild experie nces of seem ing to be in some one else's physical body (Chapter 12). On the surface, this would appear to have been a most seriou s situati on demand ing immediate aid. The notes show no indication whatsoever o f anything other than extrication through my own efforts. There is no evident pattern as yet. Here are several of the many ot her reports in the notes that may illust rate some hidden points about the helpers. 9/14/58 Early evening, on the porch, into relaxat ion system. Im mediate high-freque ncy vibration. Experim ented flipping in and out of the physical. On one, had difficulty in re-entering. Two hands took my hips and rolled me into proper position. I mentally sent my thanks, but didn't know w ho it was. 3/18/62 Afternoon E.W. was visiting u s, and we both decided to rest before dinner, about five in the afternoon. We went into adjoining rooms. Almost imme diately after I lay down, I heard voices, and it soun ded as if E.W. was discussi ng some thing with some one else. At the time, I thou ght I was hearing him physically talking to the other person in the hatt outside the door. (E.W. reporte d he went imme diately to sleep, did not speak with anyone prior, and has no recollection of the event at all.) Immediately after hearing this muffled conversation, I lifted out of my body, and a voice spoke almost over my shoulder. \"If you feel you must know, I guess we'll have to tell you.\" With this, some one took me by the arm, and I went along willingly. We traveled what seemed a long distance and ended up in a darkened house. My distinct impressi on was that it was a club, fraternity, or similar headquarters. There were quiet people in a room to the right, and I seem ed to know there were other people far upstairs somewh ere. As I stoo d there waiting, w hat looked like a 16mm. film projector started, and I saw a white light frame on a wall or sc reen, much the same shape as a motion picture. In hand writing, black on the white, was this messa ge: For pure psychic results, take six drops of a chemic al in a glass o f water. I became excited at this, and moved over to the projector to try and reverse it to read the message again so that I coul d be positive that I had read it correctly. I kept fumbling for the reverse switch, but was unable to find it. (The picture had gone by this time.) I th en saw what looked like film un winding on the floor, and I thought I had broken the mecha nism by tampering with it. This made me nervous, and I headed"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"back for my body to avoid trouble, returned, and re-entered easily. 5/3/60 Afternoon I lay there, fully conscious, vibrations speeded up to noth ing but warmth sensation, eyes closed. I was abo ut to lift out when two hands held a book in front of my close d eyes. The book was riffled, turned around on all sides so that I coul d see that it was a book. The book was the n opened, and I starte d to read. The gist of what I read was that in order willfully to bring back a condition, it was necessary to re create the feeling of a similar experience that had occur red in the past (i.e., was a part of your memory). I took this to mean that one shoul d think of the \"feeling,\" rather than the details of the incident. Sever al illustrations were given, then gradually the book went out of focus as the vibrations faded, and try as I might, I coul d not continue reading. Finally, I sat up physically and made notes. 3/9/59 Night As I lay there with the vibrations strong in the dark, the special black darkn ess I coul d \"see\" with my closed eyes, the darkness grew brighter in one spot, as if clouds were parting, rotting back, and unfurling, and finally a white ray of light came through from somewh ere above my head. (I could still he ar the noises of family activity in the house and was still comp letely aware of time-space . I was still hom e and com pletely consci ous.) I became excited, but managed to keep in stasis. A small mountain peak seem ed to grow in the center of the white ray, just w here it hit the cloud s. I gathere d courage, and asked for the fundamental answer to my basic questions. I don't know wh y I did, but it seem ed to be what I should do. A rich, deep voice— yet not a voice, and certainly not my con scious mind, as I was waiting expecta ntly—an swered. \"Are you sure you do want to know?\" It cam e more from the light ray. I replie d that I was sure. \"Are you strong en ough to take the true answers?\" There was little inflection and no emotion in the delivery. I replie d that I thoug ht I was. I w aited and it see med a long long time before the voice spoke again. \"Ask your father to tell you of the great secret.\" I started to ask exactl y what was meant, but one of the family came up the stairs noisily and switched on the light in the hall outside my room. With the click of the light, the white ray of light faded slowly, no matter how hard I tried to make it stay, and the clouds went from gray to black. When the clouds had faded completely, I opened my eyes. (There was absolutely no transitio n from \"vision\" to sleep ing to waking. I had been awake as we define it, from all in dications, througho ut the period.) It was indeed a moving expe rience, but not classi fied as out-of-body. Since then, I have explored this in two directions . I have tried to re-create the experie nce without success. Second, I wrote to my physical father, who was still ali ve and very in terested in these events. I posed the question without giving him the source. He wrote back an elusive answer, stating that there were perhaps a half- hundred, and asking which one I wanted. The other \"father\" has yet to give me the answer either. 3/15/59 Night"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"In trying to follow up, here is what took place. As I lay down in the relaxing procedure, I men tally repeated the words, \"Father, guide me. Father, tell me the great secret.\" After several minutes, there was a sudden blackout, and I was standi ng in a room with a high-be amed ceiling. I left the house and started across a platform to some kind of waiting conveyance (like a train), then stopped and turned. Some one had called to me. A tall, thin, rather dark-skinn ed woman in a long, straight dress or robe stood almost beside me. My first imp ression was that she was Negro with small and even features, dark straight hair, and evenly cut bangs across the forehead. (In ret rospect, I realize from the descripti on, she could have been Middle Eastern or Eg yptian, but not oriental, as I would have noticed the eye structure.) She told me that I had done some thing wrong, the implicati on being in a wrong manner rather than evil. I aske d her what it was, and she said she would show me. With that, we started to move , and walked around the corner of a large building. We stepped into a large paved courtyard. We stopp ed, and it was exactl y as if we were watching a three- dimensional life-sized motio n picture in full color. A group of people was stan ding to the left, and they ga ve the impression of authority. To the right, lying in the court yard, was a small, dark-haire d girl who looked about twelve or thirteen years old. She seemed bound, or help less in some way. I was in the scene, and I was simultaneously standi ng beside the woman watching. I could sense every action of the \"I\" in the scene, every emotion. The men of authority told the \"I\" in the scene that he must perform certain harmful functions on the girl. He felt that he shouldn't do this, and the girl pleaded with him not to. He turned back to the authorities, to avoid carrying out their orders. The authorities were very casual about the whole affair, especially the girl's tears. They stated that if he did not perform the function (religious? ), others were arriving soon and they would do it inste ad. They added that it would be better for the girl if he performed this act instead of the oth ers, th at it would be less harmful to the girl. Reluct antly, the \"I\" in the scene turned and followed out the orders of the authorities. A few moments later, the woman led me out of the courtyard and we stoo d on the platform again. (I lost contact with the \"I\" in the scene the moment we turned away.) \"Now do you understand?\" she asked. I dazedly state d that I did not, and she looked at me stead ily, rather sadly, and turned away. Not knowing wha t to do, I thought of the physical, took a long time getting back, and finally re-entered. I sat up and thought about this one for a long time. Who was the woman? What was the great secret? Looking at my own life history here, I am beginning to know. 8/18/61 Afternoon The hands and the book again. This time, in the office. Three in the afternoon, rainy, humid weather, if that has meaning. Vibrati ons were present, completely conscious and awake. I checke d and tested by opening my physical eyes several times and looking at the clock. Time passage was as it felt it sho uld be. Again, the hands place d the book before my closed eyes. T he book was turned over, riffled, and held in many positions in very obvious movements to make sure I recogni zed it as a book. I thought of trying to see the title on the end of the book, and promptly the end was held for me to see, but the print was too small, or I was too myopic. Try as I might, I could not read it."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Finally, I ga ve up, and the book was opened and I saw both printed pages. Again, I tried to read it, but it was just out of focus. Finally, I me ntally sug gested that I might be able to read it if I took one letter at a time. In respo nse, a letter jumpe d out of a line and I just barely sa w it as it flew by. I checke d and rechecked carefully and laboriously, an d got four words: \"Evoke unhappy beings by ...\" I tried and tried to read more, but evidently I conc entrated too hard, as it on ly became more difficult. I notice d the large white billow y clouds overhead, and this distra cted me. The rain had stopped. It was clea ring. I wanted to go ou t and soar up among the mountains and valleys in the sky. With this, I started to lift out slowly. The hands closed the book, took it away, and a tolera nt, amused, and friendly thought sprung into my mind : \"Well, if the soaring is that good, go to it.\" It was as if a teacher had given up, for the moment, trying to keep the attention of a child too restless to concentrate. I soared out through the door, up into the sky, had a won derful time among the clouds, and returned without inci dent.

INTELLIGENT ANIMALS Throughout man's history, the reports have been consist ent. There are demons, spirits, goblins, gremlins, and assorte d sub human entities always hanging around humanity to make life misera ble. Are these myths? Halluci nations? For once, sup - pose we don't dismiss the topic before we take a good long look. Perhaps all such things do originate in the imagination. The question is, fro m what source does the imagina tion con jure up these beings? The following exce rpts from the notes offer several possibilities. 4/18/60 Morning I lay down on the couch aroun d ten, and started fractional relaxat ion. The room was bright in morning daylig ht. Half way through the secon d time around, the vibrations started. After a moment of \"tuning\" (with my jaw), I opened my physi cal eyes to see if the vibrations would continue. They did. With physical eyes open, I decided to try and \"lift out\" to see what happened to my vision. The clock was in full view. My time orientation was norm al, accor ding to the sec ond hand. I was just a bout eight inches over the physical when I saw a movement out of the corner of my eye. Walking up beside my body was a human-appearing body (I could see only the lower half with my head in the position on its side , by turning my eyes to the right). It was nud e, no clothes, and male. He seem ed in size to be about ten years old, some three feet tall, thin legs, little pubic hair, undeveloped genitals. Calmly, as if it were a daily occur rence—like a boy swinging onto his favorite horse— he swung a leg over my back and climbed on me. I could feel his legs arou nd my waist, h is small body pressed against my back. I was so comp letely sur prised that it didn't occur to me to be afraid (perhaps his size had something to do with that)! I waited rigidly, and by rolling m y eyes to the right, I could see his right leg hangi ng over my body, less than two feet away. It looked like a per fectly normal ten-year-old boy's leg. I was still hovering just o ut of the physical, and cautio usly wondered who and what this was. \"He \" seemed comp letely unaware that I knew of his presence, or if he was, he didn't care. I felt that I didn't want to confront whoeve r he was in an environment where he was obviously m ore at home than I, so I retreated quickl y back into my physical body, cu t down the vibrations, and started to write these notes. I don't know w hat it was. I realized that I simply did n't have the courage to turn around and get a good look at \"him\" (if I coul d have). It w as certainly hu manoid in form, but upon reflection, it didn 't have the feeling of human intelli gence. It (he) seemed more animal, or som ewhere in be tween. I felt insulted at the complete assura nce with which he came over an d climbe d on my back. He seemed confident that he would not be detected, perhaps through long associa tion with humans to whom he was invisible. If it was a hal lucination, that's very real imagining—in broad daylight, with the secon d hand of the clock sweeping, and with two sen ses reporting. 4/28/60 Night About seven-thirty in the office, I went through the count-out proce dure and the vibrations came in nicely. I started out carefully—an d felt some thing climb on my back! I re membered the little fellow from before, and certainly didn't want to try to go somewh ere with him hangi ng on my back. I let the vibrations continue, and reach ed"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"down my side to get hold of his leg, not sure that my non-physical hands wouldn't go right through it. I was quite surprised when my hands did touch some thing! The consiste ncy felt much like flesh, normally body -warm, and somewhat rubbery; it seemed to stretch. I pulle d, and the more I pulled, the more it stretched. I finally pulled what I thought was all of it off my back, excep t for a leg which seem ed to be under my body. I finally got that out too, and pushed the entire mass onto the shelf be side the couch. (It still seemed very much alive.) It seem ed to be trying to get ba ck on me, and I had to hold it away. It got to be quite a struggle (no viciousness on his part, just a n effort to get back on top of me), and I was getting a little panicky. I w as in over my head again! I thought of lighting matches and trying to burn him up, to do something, any thing. There seem ed no way to prevent him from climbi ng back on me until the moment I re-entered the physical. Having talked the last episo de over with various people, I followed their various instructio ns. I tried to stay calm , but it wasn't easy. I crossed myself several times, with no effect. I repeated the Lord's Prayer fervently, but that didn't hold him at bay; then I screamed for help. Then, as I was trying to hold off the first, a second climbed on my back! Holding the first off with one hand, I reache d back and yanked the secon d off me, and floated over into the center of the office, holding one in each hand, screaming for help. I got a good look at each, and as I looked, each turned into a good facsimile of one of my two daughters (the psy chiatrists will have a good time with this one) I I seemed to know imm ediately that this was a deliberate camouflage on their parts to create emotional confusion in me and call upon my love for my daughters to prevent my doing anything more to them. The moment I realized the trick, the two no longer ap peared to be my daught ers. Desperate for a solution, I thought about fire, and this seemed to help a little. However, I got th e impressi on that they were both amused, as if there was noth ing I could do to harm them. By this time, I was sobbing for help. Then I saw some one else coming up out of the corner of my eye. I first thought it was another one, but this was very definitely a man. He simply stopped a short distanc e away and watched what was taking place with a very serious ex pressio n on his face. I got a very good look at him. First, his eyes were very familiar to me. They reminded me somewha t of a paternal cousin's, light in color, a little sunke n. He had his hair cut evenly a round his head, including bangs across his forehead, and short across the pate, almos t bald. He wore a dark robe down to his ankles. I could not see his feet. My first reaction was that he had come to help the \"en tities,\" and that frighte ned me even more. I was still sobbi ng when he slowly approached us; I was down on my knees, arms outstretched, holding off the two little beings. The man was very serious, spoke not a word to me, nor did he even seem to look in my directio n. When he came close, I stopp ed my struggling, and sank to the floor pleading for help. Still with no recognitio n of me, he picked up each of the little beings, cradle d one in each arm, and looke d down at them. As he held them, they seem ed to relax and go limp, limbs and necks drooping. Sobbing my thanks, I moved over to the couch, slippe d into the physical, still feeling the vibrations , and sat up physi cal and looked around. The room was empty."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"After a twenty-four hour contemplation of the event, I have at least some speculation. There is the possibil ity that the entire thing could have been hallucination or dream su perimposed over my complete consci ousness. If so, I can see how those with paranoia have great difficulty in choosing which is rea lity. If it is sym bolism, it is fair ly evident. The \"entities\" aroun d me are no more than a product of me. The visualization of them as my children is pretty hard to inter pret in any other way than to show they are mine (I created them, my childre n). Therefore, they belong to me, and are neither good nor bad. I still don't know what they are. Are they disasso ciated parts of me, or tho ught entities I have created from continuing thought patterns habitually? What do I do about them? Who does the man in the robe repre sent? This will take more than twenty-four hours to under stand. However, the next time, if there is one, I certainly w ill try to maintain a more calm object ivity, less fear, and an analytical approach. 5/21/60 Night I was lying deeply relaxed, late evening , in the bedroom. The vibrations started evenly, and I quickly notice d the small leg thrown over my body (non -physical, I assum e). I felt the small body hanging onto my back. Carefully, I reached around (non-physical?), and felt the small back superim posed on mine. I patted the little shoulder gently (intending understanding) and carefully lifte d the small body and pushed it away from mine. I waited, and it didn't come back or atte mpt to come near. Not wanting to push my luck, I re-entered the physical, sat up, and made these notes. 5/27/60 Night After lifting out, I again felt what I knew to be one of the rubbery entities on my back. No words or actio n, just the small body clingin g warmly to my back. This time, I did not get too frightened, and managed to pull at the thing slo wly. I pull ed, and called to God to help me (at the insiste nce of several people who are more theologically inclined than I). Again, the thing stretched as I putted, but didn't come off completely. I remembered the visualized thought of fire, and that it hadn't seemed much use, but had helped a little. This time, I tried thinking of electri city. I visualized two piec es of highly charged wire. I me ntally stuck them into the side of that part of the entity that I had pulled off. Immediately the mass deflated, went limp, and seem ed to die. As it did, a batlike thing squeak ed past my head and went out the win dow. I felt that I had won. I felt deep relief and went back down into the physical, reintegrated, and sat up (physicall y). 8/25/60 Night It happened again this trip. Just as I was getting u nder way, several \"things\" attached themselves to various parts of my body (non -physical). I say things because it was in total dark ness, and I wouldn't or cou ldn't see. They seemed almost like small fish, about eight or ten inches long, and they at tached themselves like the parasitic \"sucker \" fish in the ocean. I pulled them off and pushed them away as best I could, but they (or others) came back immediately. They weren't vicious, just tr oublesome. Finally I we nt back in the physical to get rid of them."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"11/3/61 Night I've discove red something new ab out the \"suck ers.\" There is almo st a layer of them; sometimes you pass through it, but most of the time you don't, or you move through so fast it is not noticed. This time, I stop ped right in the middl e of the layer as the \"fish\" came cluste ring around, attracted by me. Instead of reacting as before, I simply waited, comp letely imm obile. After a few mom ents, they de tached themselves and moved away. Then there was nothing, just blackn ess. I started to move, and back they came l I stop ped, waited, and again they move d away. This time, I moved slowly. One or two cam e back, but that is all. I then went upward, and on to the other places . It was as if I were bait in an ocean of fish. 7/13/60 Night This must be recorded, as it may contrib ute in some way. In hotel room in Durham with my wife in bed beside me, late at night. I was just ab out to fall aslee p, when I sense d someone or som ething in the room. Without realizing at first what had happened, I rushed up out of bed to defend myself and my wife. Immediately, I w as attack ed by some thing I could n't see in the darkness. It fought at the animal level, i.e., tried to bite and scratch, and for what seem ed an eternity, w e fought in three dimensions through the room. I coul d not see in the darke ned room (or were my eyes closed?), and it was only through sheer determination that I fought it step by step over to the window a nd hurled it out. It apparently had no human or intelligence charact eristics. It see med pure animal and about four feet long, like a large dog. By the window, a fter disposing of it, I turned and realized for the first time that I was not in the physical. (My hand was right through the closed window! ) I floated over to the bed, and there were two bodies lying und er the covers. I moved close to the watch on the night table, and could see by the luminous dial that it was two thirty- five. I remem bered that I was closest to the night table, and floated over, went down, rotated, and was back \"in.\" I sat up physically, and the room was quiet , dark, and empty. I look ed at the watch on the night table. The time was about two thirty-eight. 10/27/60 Night Went to bed tired, late, around 1:30 A.M., an d mentally set myself to have no \"activities.\" Just as I started to sleep (no conscio usness lapse in seque nce, no separation from physical noticeable, but I did feel a sense of releas e just prior), I was attack ed by some thing. It had no apparent personality, no r was I abl e to see it. However, I knew this one was incredi bly vicious with an intent to \"take\" some thing that was min e which first required getting r id of \"me\" (not necessarily the physical \"I,\" but the \"I\" who has the ability to act independ ently of the physical) . This struggle was not like fending off an animal. It was a no-holds-barred affair, silent, terrifyingl y fast, and with the other seeking out any we akness on my part. I did not fight back savagely at first, because I was bewildere d. I merely tried to defend myself. However, the \"thing\" fighting me seem ed to move from nerve center to nerve center, and some of the holds and pressur es it applied were excruciating. I knew that if I did not fight back, I would lose, and losing seem ed as vital as losing existe nce. I then started to fight back with equal intensity, sa vagely and with desperation. The thing fighting me knew e very weak spot, and used them. We fought for what seem ed like hours, and gradually I felt I might truly lose. I felt that this couldn't go on forever, and realized that I was som ehow out of the physical. Still fight ing, I steered the battle"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"in the direction of my physical. When we were very close and directl y over it, I dropped back \"in.\" It was the only w ay I could think of to end the fight without losing. I opened my eyes (physicall y) and sat up. The room was quiet and empty. The bedclothes were undist urbed, so evi dently there was no actual physical motion involved. My wife slept besid e me undisturbed. I got up and walked around the room, looked in the hall. Everything ap peared normal. It coul d have been a dream. If so, it was most vivid, and certainly did not follow the usual pattern of dreams that I have . (I have long come to recogni ze pure release- type dreams, which reflect the day's tensions or long-f elt inner anxieties, which can be likened to multiple feedback or \"monkey chatter.\") The superimposure of the room perfectly as the backgrou nd for the action plus consci ous control of action tends to negate the dream concept. After some twenty minutes of calming myself down, I re turned to bed. I was natur ally relucta nt immediately to try to sleep again. I did not want a recurrence of the fight. I knew of no way to prevent it. I tried what seemed to be the only answer. (The alternative was to stay awake all night, and I was muc h too tired.) I lay there and repeated, \"My mind and body are open only to constructive forces; in the name of God and good, I am going into normal restful sleep. \" I did, and awoke at my usual time in the morni ng. Before sleep came I had repea ted the phrase at least twenty times. The use of such phrasi ng indicates the seriou sness and con cern I felt at the time, which will be recogni zed by thos e who know me well in that I felt the need to look for help and protecti on in the manner that I did. In truth, there was no alternative whatsoever. In retrospect, I still cann ot find an alternative, nor do I know of any method, place, person, reli gious practice (that I would be sure of), drug, or anything else in my fund of knowledge, experience, and information that would absolutely guarante e protect ion against whatever a ttacked me. However, there must be something other than the pure \"fighting back\" in self-defense, even if you don't know what you are fighting. It was the same defense mecha nism you would use if you were attacked by an animal at night in the jungle. You don't stop to find a way to fight in the middle of the fight. You don't stop to find out what attacked you. You fight to save yourself, with what you have now, the moment the animal attacks. You fight desperately, not thinking at the time how to fight, why you fight, whom you fight. You have been attacke d; the unprovoked attack in itself seems to indicat e to you that whatever is a ttacking you is not good, or else it would not attack you in this man ner. Defense is aut omatic, instinctive, with no thought ex cept survival, which is bas ed on the premise that it is wrong to surrender to som eone or som ething whose qualities (ap parent unprovoked attack, blind desire to kill) you abhor.1 1 Of late, visits from the \"demons\" have been infrequent."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"11. GIFT OR BURDEN? Early in the experimentation, a side effect began to manifest itself. It was not an out- of-body activity as such, but took place in states of deep relaxatio n prior to any separation. It is e vidently called in the trade \"precognition.\" As I was lying down, my mind stilled and body relaxed, without my voli tion, the \"vision\" would occur . There would be a hissing sound, localized in the forebrain, and I would get the sensati on of a small rectangul ar door, hinge d at one end, swinging down ward to an angle of about 45°. This expose d a perfectly round hole. Immediately there after, I would see and semiexperience an event or incid ent like a dream , except that I retained all of my consci ousness and sense awareness. The dream would be superi mposed di rectly over outsi de stimuli. I coul d percei ve both quite read ily. I could not and cannot produce the effect at will. It merely ha ppened or was triggered by some non-consci ous mech anism. At first, I paid no particular attention to the phenomenon, attributing the dream visions to releas e of material from the unconscious. A major event brought it strongly to my at tention. It is important enough to take directly from the notes. During the early morning, the \"valve\" opened again, and what I saw has concer ned me only be cause it was so vivid. I wa s about to board a comm ercial airpla ne. Standing by the door of the plane waiting wa s D.D., a man I've kno wn for more than ten years. I got on the plane and took a seat. I noticed that there were plenty of seats and the plane was almos t ready to go, so I was sure my friend would make it aboard. I notic ed a group talking up in front near the door, and they joined a young Negro man who h ad just come in the door. They were very jolly, and were glad the young Ne gro was going along. The group was composed of two olde r Negro men, an older white man, and the young Neg ro. They noticed that the plane was about to leave, so they all went down the aisle past me and took their seats. I leaned forward to see if my friend would get on, and in doing so, I beca me aware that the woman in front of me was agitate d. Just as the plane was starting, m y friend got abo ard and took a seat. I was about to get up and go over to join him when the plane started to move and I sat back. The plane started down the runway and seemed to take a long time to get off, and I grew a little tense. We finally took off, and we climbed low over boulevard streets (winding, with cloverlea f intersectio ns). We stayed at low altitude and the plane climbed very little. In a few moments, I hear d the stewardess speaking through the plane's speaker system. She stated that in a few minutes the pilot would decid e whether to take the plane on one of two routes, the one to the left (going ar ound) or the \"under the wire\" route. After a few moments' wait, I n oticed that the plane passe d a given point (low over a city)t and I reali zed before the hostess spoke again that we were taking th e \"under the wire\" route. When the hostess an nounced it, her voice seemed a bit too light and too casua l, and I coul d sense a slight tension in her, too. Looking out the plane window, I sa w the area ahead with wires stretche d out in every directio n. The plane approached and went under the wires, sta ying very low. I was tense, and watched ahead looking for openings in the wires that we coul d climb up through. Then up ahead, I could see the end of the wires over us, and there was sunlight beyond. I began to relax sli ghtly because it looked like we were going to make it. At that moment, the plane dropped suddenly and bounced against the street. As it did, some thing broke off the plane very near me, and I jumpe d (or fell) to the street some six or eight feet below me. I watched where I had fallen as the plane"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"moved upward and away from me after the bounce, and then plung ed off to the right and into an empty spa ce betwee n two buil dings. Huge clouds of smoke partially obscur ed the crash. My first reaction after the crash was to thank God for the miracle that saved me. The secon d was that my family would be worried because they knew I h ad taken this flight, and that I shou ld get w ord to them. The third was tha t I shou ld hurry over to the wrecked plane to try and save some of the others, even though I knew it was of no use. I got up and went over to the plane wreck, and as I approached I could see flames through the smoke. The pilot (in leather jacket and cap) walked up and looked at me rather dazedly and asked why I of all his passengers shoul d be picked as the one to be saved, I aske d this quest ion myself, then the valve closed . 7/24/59 I am about to leave on what may be the first of four plane trips. This first will be to North Carolina . At the thought of the trip, I have a shaky feeling. This has made me pause to think, and in view of other incide nts, to review the experience relate d on 7/5/59. I am always slightly concerned when I travel by airplane, as I believe everyone is. I do not think anything is going to happen on the North Carolina trip, but I may have the wrong interpret ation. But what do I do if a similar incident occurs at the beginning of one of these three trips—an exact parallel to the 7/5/59 incident! Do I get of f the plane? Or is it imp ossible to break the pattern? My read ing states that I will survive, but survival may m ean, in this case, death-transition, or that I see death not as death, but I am still \"alive\" I honestly do not know w hat I will do. How ever, to all who love me—a nd I hope there are many—in the event that there is such an incident, and that the proper interpretation means that I do experie nce death- transition rather than continuing life here, please do not be unhappy over it. For I honestly, de eply feel that it is a transiti on, and much as I will regret the many things that I would never do here, some deep nostalgia, some great longing that I have tried to fulfill in a fumbling way here, I believe will again become actuality if 1 go \"Ho me.\" For more than ever, I be lieve that the physical body is but a machine for the use of \"I.\" Therefore, once \"I\" have departed, the body shou ld mean nothing. No grave, no vault, the body as such is unim portant. \"I\" am not there. By the same token, because of my interest, if any such event should occur, the \"I\" will try to estab lish comm unica tion with those who are intereste d. (What could prevent this* and it is certainly a possibility, is t hat the \"other plane, place \" may o ffer the same questions as here, there may be more important matters there.) I do not know, 1 can't promise. But rest assu red, those who kno w me will have little difficulty in recogni zing an actual communication. This is not in the least intended to be morbid, and perhaps I am overly sensitive these days, but I simply w ant to have it on record, so that in some small way, others may be enlight ened if it comes to pass. I do not want this to occur, I don't feel I'm \"ready,\" and the thought of going t hrough it mak es me very contemplative and sober . Yet I am at least partially prepar ed for it. 10/23/59 This is written some twelve wee ks after the previous entry. Four of the twelve weeks were spent in a hospital, the remai n der in a recuperative period at home. But first thing s first. The previous entry found me con cerned with what seemed to be a problem of portent, and the definition of survival. By comparison with the \"dream,\""},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"here is how it worked out. Recognitio n 1: I started on the trip, as indicated, a trip to North Carolin a. The first indication of similarity occurred when I got into the bus that takes passengers from the New York airline termin al to Newark Airport. I entered and sat down on the right, in the secon d seat from the front. Sitting there, I was overwhelme d with a sense of familiarity. It was the position I was in relative to the door, and the pattern of the door ran, and the door shield . This made me alert, as I thoroughly recognized this ''place ment\" as what I originally inte rpreted in the precognition as the airplane. It was not the airplane, it was the bus to the airport. Recognitio n 2: Four men entered the bus, three in dark suits, one in light, laughi ng and joking . (See earlier compari son, interpretation before as Negro and white.) Recognitio n 3: A woman took the seat direct ly in front of me. She became very uncomfortable and agitated . However, it was not because of me, but because of the porter's handling of one of her packages outside. Recognitio n 4; The impression of my friend D.D. sta nding by the door waiting, the last to get on. I look ed out where the bus driver wa s waiting besi de the door for any last-min ute passengers. His face and build reminded me instantly of my friend, enough to be his brother. Photographic verification of this was to come. (The mind, when unable to identify truly, picks the nearest thing to it in the mind's exper ience.) He then got in, closed the door, the last to enter, and slippe d into the driver's seat almost directly opposite me. Recognitio n 5: In taking the Jersey Turnpike, the bus \"flies low and slow,\" or that could be the impression if comp ared to flying. The turnpike is built over most of the surrounding streets and roads. As I look ed at the unfolding roads and curving boulevards as we traveled above them, the instant sense of familiarity and recognitio n came again. Only it wa s not the airplan e (the original mistak en concept)t but the bus. Recognitio n 6: At the airport, I was quite alert after the early signs. The plane was late in arriving, so I waited around the lobby. As I sat on a bench, I heard a woman's voice speak ing of east and west conc ourse over the P.A. system. The hollowness of the sound was again strongly familiar (east and west, left and right). Recognitio n 7: When the plane finally did load, I mom en tarily debated whether or not to take it, not from fear, but because of the uncertainty of what \"survival\" meant. I fi - nally decid ed that it was unavoidable, that if 1 waited for a second flight, it would only prolong the incident. 1 boarded the plane, very alert, and we taxied out for take-off. Then the hostess announced on the intercom that we would fly at six thousand feet. That confirmed the low altitu de. We finally took off, and prompt ly ran into a thunderstorm with a great deal of lightning display. This confirmed my impres sion of an under-the-wires (electricity) flight, long a recog nizable symbol to me. Midway during the storm, the pilot decid ed to chang e alti tude (this was not announced), but we flew up out of the storm, and landed in North Carolina without incident. Upon landing, I deci ded that my interpreta tion of the accident was wrong, and promptly forgot about the whole thing. Four days later, on a Mond ay morni ng in the middle of a quiet, friendly chat in an office, I suffered what was late r diagn osed to be a heart attack (coronary occlusio n), and was taken to the hospital. I did not believe it was a heart attack, and had no idea that it was until I was informed of it after an examin ation in the hospital compl ete with EKG. It took much persuading that it was so, and for a reason. In every physical"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"examin ation I ever ha d, including two the previous week by two different insurance doctors, my heart was always pron ounced very sound, with such statements as \"You'll never have to worry about your heart\" and \"That's one thing you won't die of, any he art problem.\" My mind was thoro ughly conditioned against that possibility. It seems that my mind would not accept the precognitive inference of a heart attack. This seem ed impossible. Therefore, it selecte d a catastro phe that was possi ble in its memory experie nce, i.e., an airplane crash. (The mind takes the nearest seem-alike.) Thus the heart attack came through in the form of an airpla ne crash, which was accept able as a possibility. The four weeks in the hospital were eased by use of sug gestive therapy on recorded tape, which worked wonders with my morale and seem ed to speed my reco very. No experi ences of a psychic nature came about in the hospital, which I finally deduced was cau sed by the sedatives (barbiturat es) which were given to me every three hours. At home, my. reco very followed a standard proce dure with no recurring symptoms to date. It goes without saying that I observed very intently after that when the \"valve\" decided to open. Each time the vision presented fitted exactl y with events that occurred days, mont hs, or years later. Examples of these include a visual descripti on of the in terior of a house, including paint and trim, that was selecte d by my wife for us in a Southern city. I recognized it immedi ately and it was ide ntical to the description in the notes made two years previously. Most unusual was the fact that at the time of the precogniti on we had no plans or intention of mov ing sout h. Another was that five minutes before the broad cast of a recorde d program, the valve opened and I \"saw\" the tape breaki ng sharply and the reels running wildly. Some ten min utes later, during the broadcast, the tape did break and was hastily reset. Such breakage had never ha ppened before dur ing a broadcast, so this was not a common concer n. Further, I had made all editing splices myself, and knew they we re tight. The break was caus ed by a splice made by som eone else who had used the tape previously. A third: In the office, the valve opened, to reveal a red light with the words \"Oil Pressure. \" An hour later, driving hom e in a nearly new car, th e red Oil W arning light flashed on. Again, this was not a subco nscious worry. The car had less than five hundred miles since it was new, and had just been checked. The new car ha d an oil leak—s omething one does not expect or worry about with a new auto mobile. There are some eighteen more, all of which are personal incidents of varied magnit ude, previewed via the valve and later coming to pass exactl y as noted, allowing for minor errors in interpretation. To date, a pattern of consistency has been establis hed: H (Hissing sou nd) + V (Valve-opening sensation) = F (Future event vision). On the premise that this formula has been applicable and proved twenty-two times, what of the other cases listed in the notes where F has not yet taken place? Without further com ment, here are some where the formula has not been proved as of this writing, 8/3/60 Air hiss/ valve: An airplan e passes overhead, obviously i n trouble, with flaps and landing gear lowered. It crashes behind a nearby hill and my family and I rush over to"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"try to help. When we get there, the plane is burni ng slowly with a deep red glow. 1 recogni ze the glow and the slow burning as some thing different than an ordinary gasoline fire, and warn the others to stay back so they w ill not be injured by it, as there is nothing we can do for the dead occupants. 11/5/61 Air hiss/ valve: 1 am standing alone outside my house. The sky is mo stly clear , with a broken cloud cover to the north. I see a group of aircraft emerge from the cloud cover, jus t above it. They approach, and I note that they are not typical aircraft or rockets. Behind the first wave is row after row of the strange aircraft, literally hundreds of them. They are not like any airpla nes I have seen before. No wings are visible, and each mach ine is gigantic, some three thousa nd feet across. Each is shaped like the head of an arrow, V-sha ped, but with no fuselage as in our swept- wing airplanes. The V shape is not a lifting surface, but houses the occupants in two or three decks. They sail majestically overhead, and I feel a tingle of awe at the mighty power they rep resent. 1 also feel fear, because I some how know that these are not man-made. 10/20/62 Air hiss/ valve: I am with other people in a suburban street. Looking up, 1 see what appear to be airplanes through a large break in the clouds. I take a closer look, and realize these are a type of aircraft I have never see n before, evidently powered by something other than propellers or jets (impressi on is of a unique form of rockets, but not chem ical). Three of the aircraft dive down in a descending turn, and I can see they have black sides and white square windows, but no wings to speak of. The three make a low pass over a nearby street Houses and buildings collapse in their wake, not from bombs but from some thing emitted from the machines themselves. We all dive for a ditch for safety. 6/12/63 Air hiss/ valve: My family and I are in a situation where the whole population of the city we live in is trying to leave. Gasoli ne is unavailab le, electric power has been shut off. There is a great sense of fatality among everyone. It doesn't seem to be the product of atomic war, and there is no con cern as to radioactive fallout. There is principal ly a feeling of doom and the breakup of civilization as we know it due to something momentous having take n place , a factor beyon d human ability to control. 4/11/64 Air hiss/ valve: My family and I are in a large city, and there seems to be great trouble. Everyone is trying to leave. I leave •what seem s to be an apartment to try to find some way for us to get out into the country. Out in the street, the whole city is in a turmoil and panic, with cars stalled and jammed to gether, much like an anthill that has been disturb ed. There are many more, personal, general, specific, local, worldwide. Only time will bring con firmation. I hope some of them are hallucinations."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"12. ROUND HOLES AND SQUARE PEGS Among the many mysteries encountered, there are several that stand out as being apparently unm otivated yet deeply profound. My only h ope is that others more technic ally or philosophically ori ented can perceive in them purpose and reaso n which I cannot. Here are a few of those which do not seem to be of Local es II or III . 8/23/63 Evening I lay down to take a short napt not for any extraphysical activity, at seven-seventeen, in the den, on the couch. The moment I stretched out horizontally and closed my eyes, there was a tremendous soundless explosi on. There was no time lag. It occurred about two seco nds after I closed my eyes. T he blast slamm ed me across the room and against the wall in the opposite corner, where I slid to the floor. My first thought was that there actually had been some kind of explosi on in the house, as the light fixtures overhead seemed to be sputtering, throwing off blue sparks, then the wires themse lves melting. (The lights were turned off when I lay down, the room half- dark.) It see med to me as if some huge short circuit had taken place in the wiring. There was a tingling sensation similar to electrical shocks (not like the vibra tions I have mentioned so many times). Then I look ed across the room. My physical body was still ly ing relaxed on the couch . I coul d see it plainly. It was then that I seriou sly consi dered another possibility. This might be death, true death, instead of the typical out-of-body experi ence. This situat ion was such an unusual thing. Perha ps I had died, my heart had stopp ed. I was still a little dazed from the explosi on, but I was not afraid nor did I panic. If this was death, so be it. I lay there in the corner for some time, trying to collect myself. I felt around under me, and I thought I felt the rug, but I was not sure. At least some thing, felt solid under me. Then I deci ded that I shou ld try to get back in the physical, even if I failed. I would lose nothing by trying. With a great effort of will, I floated upward and over to the couch, then down. There was a wrenching effect, and I found myself half in my physical body. I re alized the half-condition, wriggled and squirme d, just as you w ould wiggle your han d to put on a glove. In a moment, I was \"whole\" again. I sat up (physically ) and turned on the light. Everything seem ed normal, the house was quiet, my body see med normal, except that I was covered with goose- pimples. I was quite shake n by the experie nce and still don't know w hat caused it and why. Was it an explosi on of a non-physical category? Was it an intern al thing, in me, or was it the effect of some outside force? In retrospect, there seem ed to be nothing unusual in my physical, emotional, or men tal condi tion at the time to trigger it. In analysis o f the best recall I can muster of the instant of the explosi on, it was as if some stray beam had swept through the room and just hap pened to catch me impers onally in its path , the effect of which was to \"blow\" me out of the physical. Following this thought, I got the impressi on that the beam was the product of some experim ental device not fully developed by the researchers who were testing it, i.e., all of the effects were not known to them. It strikes an associ ative memory relatio nship with the three-way device experienc e."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"5/5/59 Afternoon Today I learned about a strange device that is sup posed to work three ways. About five, I deci ded to try working a for mula for the conditi on (1-2o/LQ ). I lay down on the bed, thought of the force field diagram, then started the twenty count. I did not seem to be achieving any r esult, and then turned my head. My eyes were open and I glanced at the sun through the window ( the day was sun ny, and the window w as to the west). Imm ediately, the vibrations faded in, and I closed my eyes and lay back. The vibrations were a tingling in the back of my head. I followed the jaw movem ent pro cedure, and they seemed to get stronger or weaker depending on my position, as expecte d. Finally, I determined the peak tuning position of my jaw (this is the way I can expre ss it). The vibrations were strong in my head, a little too strong, so I \"move d? them down into my chest, then experienced plac ing them in various parts of my body, that is to say, making them stronger in a. given part. Each time they passe d over my lower right side I got a burning sensation, either in the liver, kidney, or lower right co lon (foreign body or chemical there?). This had happened before, although I do not re member menti oning it. I mentally \"wanted?' upward , and I floated up. Some stray thought must have come forth, be cause I imme diately rolled in the air and dove through the floor. I mom entarily heard a band playing (l ike turning past a radio station on the dial), then I was stand ing in an un finished house, with no windows insta lled as yet, and ma terials and scraps lying around on the rough floor. Through the window w as a rural countryside, trees and fields, and the house was evidently in the side of a hill, looking down into a slight valley and onto the low hill on the other side, I looke d down, and there was a device, about eightee n inche s long, on the floor. It appeared to be laid there just temporarily while the operator \"went to lunch.\" I picked up the device curiously, never having seen anything like it. It w as rodlike, with three attachments spaced along it. I hel d it up and looked along the rod and inadvertently aimed it at a man standing on a patio outside the open window who m I hadn't notice d before. Nothing happened, and then the man turned and noticed me. He moved out of sight for a moment, then entered through a doorway to the right an d came up to where I was stand ing. He smiled, and to my best recall, appeared to be perfectly normal. Seeing the device in my hand, he indicated that he would show me how to use it. Pointing to the tube (an open-ended cylinder) on the front of it, he showed me how to \"focus\" the device by mov ing the tube or cylinder back and forth, away for a narrow bea m, and toward you for a wide, evidently more gentle, beam or ray. He then told me to point it throu gh another window ope n ing where a second man outsid e was talking stead ily and animatedly with some one outside our rang e of vision. He said to push the cylinder forward for a narrow beam. I did, and pointed the device at the man outside just as you would use a rifle. I saw nothing, no beam or ray, emitted from the device. However, the man beyon d the window op ening in stantly slump ed in his chair as if he were dead. I turne d to my host, frighte ned and worried that I had unintentionally killed, the person outside. He smiled, and told me to point the device again at the unconscious (?) man outsid e, this time pulling back on the focusing device to produce a wide beam. I did, and the unconsci ous man sat up and resum ed his con versation as if nothing had happened. My host then led me outside, and I asked the secon d man if he had felt anything. He stopped his conversatio n, looked at me puzzled, and said no, he hadn't. I aske d him"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"if he re membered going t o sleep or any laps e of time, and again he replie d in the negative and turned away to continue his con versation. The man who was my host looke d at me and smiled, then took me over to the other side of the house overlooking the valley, indicating that he would show me another thing the device could do. He pointed toward the distan ce. A small fire was burni ng brightly on the hillside some three hundred yards away, with smoke curling up into the sky. He told me to use the narrow beam, and aim at the fire. I did, and immedi - ately the fire went out. The flame shut off as if suddenly ex tinguished. The smoke held for a moment or so longer, then it too was gone . I grew very excite d about the gadget, and asked my host to describe it to me. He did gladly. It w as composed of three parts, he told me. The cylinder was a focusing device, which I understood. In the middl e was a spiral coil, which he said was the power source. Behind the power source were three finlike plates (like those found in a rectifi er), wh ich he ex plained were not too important in that they w ere only sh ields to protect the user. He rubbe d his thumb over them and they b ent, showing their flexibility. He asked me if I was sur e I understood. I replied that the affair looked like a large triode (the closest thing I coul d think of resembl ing the layout patter n). He nodded excitedly an d replied, '\"Yes! A triode!\" Feeling that I had to go and could n't stay longer, I thanked him for all of the information, and he said he would see me again at (unremembered). My mind recogni zed the place, evidently, an d I said yes, the Cadena Azul. ( This was a prod uct of my South American visit, and it seem ed a natural way to say whatever I w as trying to say—blu e network.) My host started to nod yes, the n gave me a blank , uncomprehending look, and I realized that my impression was right but that he didn't understand the Spanish term. I then went back to the unfinished room, and \"took off\" upward with a stretch-leap. I went up what seem ed to be only t wo or three floors, then stopp ed. The place looked like my office room, but was empty. No furniture, no couch, dust on the floor and windows—and no physical body! I reali zed this was the wrong \"pl ace\" (time?), that where I wanted to be was still \"up \" I started up again, through the ceiling, and after eight or ten floors, emerged in my proper office room, sank down into my physical body (had a little difficulty with one arm), the n merged comp letely. I sat up and opened my eyes. T he clock indicated one hour, five minutes time lapse. I sketch ed the device, then started these notes. A device that puts people to sleep, wakes them up, and puts out fires. Someday I'll try to build the device. 3/11/61 Night . , . and I thought I had made a normal return to the physical. I opened my eyes, an d I was in a strange bed. A strange woman was beside the bed, and she smiled as she saw me awaken. An older woman stood behind her. They expresse d happiness that I had finally com e to, that I had been ill for a long time, but that now I would be all right. They helped me get out of bed, and I was dressed in some sort of robe (like a dressing gown; their dress seem ed normal to me), and I knew for sure I wasn't the person they thought 1 was. I tried to tell them this, but they only hu mored me and seemed to think I was still in some form of delirium. I aske d what day it wa s, and they only smiled understandingly as if I wasn't yet fully orient ed (1 wasn'tl). I was going to ask for a calendar, then decided it was better simply to find out the year, I asked the younger woman, who seemed to be my wife (or the body's w ife), and she replie d that"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"it was 1924, ac cording to the Greek (?) method of calculatin g time. 1 was sure that I coul dn't stay there any long er, and despite their strong objections, went out a door into the open air. I stood there and tried to move upward, and I got the feeling I had to move up, very far up. I tried to take off, but they were holding onto me. Nothing happened and 1 became worried. I knew I w as in the wrong plac e. I then remembered the breath ing trick, and started to breathe in the gasping manner through half-closed lips. I started to rise slowly, up above the building, which was U- shaped, still fe eling them trying to restrain and hold me back. I breat hed hard and fast, faster, and I move d faster until the familiar blue blur was all around me. Suddenly, 1 stopped, and I was high in the air ove r a landscape of countryside dotted with houses. It looked familiar, and I thoug ht I saw what was our house and buildings between road and river. I dove for the house, and in the next moment I was merging w ith the physical. I sat up, whole again, and looke d around gratefully. 1 was in the right place! 8/17/60 Night This was a misdirected attempt, to understate by an in calculable margin. I went through the 1-2O/LQ proced ure at around 11:30 P.M., in the bedroom. I went out with the thought of visiting Agnew Bah nson, and started on the wind blown type of trip, but returned to the physical almost imme diately—or so I thoug ht. I wasn't lying in bed, I was standi ng. The room wasn't my room. A man, big an d round-shouldered, was sup porting me on my left. He was much taller than I, and his shoul ders seem ed to glisten. Holding me up on my right was a young girl. They were forcing me to walk around the room, and I was having di fficulty walking, so they were half-supporting me under each arm. I heard them comm ent about my hands, that there was som ething wrong or unusual about them. They were not unfriendly, but I knew po sitively that I was in the wrong place I kept my head, luckily, and employed the stretch and shot up out of wher ever and whatever I was, and after only a moment or two, merged again with a physical body, I looked around carefully (physicall y) before I moved . I was back in my own physical body, my own bedroom. It was a long time before I turne d over and was abl e to get to sleep! 11/23/60 Night This was a most unusual and vivid experie nce, and I don' t know if I want any more like it. I went to bed late, very tired, around two in the morning. The vibrations came in promp tly without induction, and I deci ded to \"do some thing\" in spite of the need for rest. (M aybe this is rest. ) After moving out easily, and visiting se veral places in quick se quence, and remembering the rest need, I attempted to get back to the physical. 1 thought of my body lying in bed, and almost immediately, I was lying in bed. But I quickly realized some thing was wrong. Th ere was a boxlike contra ption over my feet, evidently to hold the sheet off my legs. There were two pe ople in the room, a man and a woman dresse d in white whom I recogni zed as a nurse. They were talking softly a short distance from the bed. My first thought was that something had gone wrong, that my wife had discover ed me in some kind of coma and had rushed me to the hospital. The nurse, the sterile atmosphere of the room, and the bed all supported this. But something still did n't feel right After a moment, the two stop ped talking and the woman (nurse) turned and went out"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"of the room, and the man approached the bed. 1 grew panicky b ecause I didn't know what he was going to do. I beca me more so as he bent over the bed and held gently but firmly onto each of my arms at the bicep s, and looked at me with bulging, glistening eyes. Worst of all, I desperately tried to move, but could not. It was as if every muscle in my body were paraly zed. Inwardly, I writhed in panic , trying to get away as he brought his face down closer to me. Then to my utter aston ishment, he bent over further and kissed me on each cheek, and I actually felt his whiskers; the glistening in his eyes w as tears. He then straightened up, re leased my arms, and walked slowly out of the room. Through my terror, I knew that my wife had not taken me to the hospital, that this man was a stranger, that I was again in very much the wrong plac e. I had to do something, but all the will I cou ld muster didn't have any ef fect. Slowly, I bec ame aware of a hissing in my head, much like a strong ste am or air hiss. Through some dim knowing, I conce ntrated on the hiss and began to pulsa te it, i.e., modulate it soft and loud. I made the pulsating go faster and faster in freque ncy, and in a few moments it had accelerated to a high-order vibra tion. I then tried to lift out and succee ded smoothly. Mo ments later, I was conve rging with another physical body. This time, 1 was cautio us. I felt the bed. I heard familiar sounds outside the room. The room was dark when I opened my eyes. I reached for the place where the light switch should be, and it was there. I turne d on the light and sighed with great, great relief, I was back. 6/7/63 Night After some time, I started to leave, and outsid e the house, I met a woman who was \"flying\" also, and she reminded me that we would be late in getting back (where, I don't know) , and that we might have trouble getting in. Then we approached what seemed to be a large institut ion (hospi tal?), and happily went directl y through a door without open ing it, apparently to avoid the guard who was waiting (and a bed check or reporting in late, which implied some penalty). Inside, we split up, and immediately a man (friendly, doctor type) said that he would take care of me, that I shoul d wait in the secon d office to the right. I did, although I got con fused about which office, because each of the offices had several people in them in deep conversatio n, and I remained unnoticed. However, I waited in the second, and finally the man entered and exam ined me, and stated that I would need treatment. He then spoke of titration, and a treatment rising to 1500 c.c., then receding back again to normal (whatever that means); I asked him why the treatment was necessary, and he replie d so that the universe (or humankind) can develop and improve. I again asked why (meaning why the need for improveme nt), and he didn't answer. I wa s som e what apprehensive about the treatment. Then shortly there after, I felt the need to return to the physical and did so without incide nt. 7/13/61 Afternoon-Night On a visit to Cape Cod, I arrived in Hyannis somewhat tired, and lay down in the afternoon for a rest. Upo n relaxa tion, the usual lifting-out process occurred, and I found my self drifting over the back area of a house, near the garage. A dog was in the yard (a large, Germa n shepherd type), and when he noticed me, he barked excitedly. A man came aroun d the edge of the house (right side, facing the rear), pulled a gun, and aimed it at me. 1 withdrew hurriedly be fore I coul d realize that"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"perhaps bullets couldn't hurt me. I returne d, lay in bed and thought it was over, and was able to recall no more than the fact that the man seemed very tall. That evening, after going to bed, the surge came again, and I drifte d out. I was floating over several houses, trying to de cide what to do, when suddenly this tall man appeared in front of me (the same one), and stopped me merely b y being in my way. I got an impressi on of calm strength. He asked me why I wanted to see the Presid ent. 1 was surp rised at first, because 1 didn't have any particular desire to see Eisen- hower (that was my mind's connotation of Preside nt), but I made up an idea of a plan for peace, and told the tall man about it. He then asked how \"we can be sure you are loyal to the United States.\" 1 replie d, still con fused, that I was sure proper information on me was in Washington. He then said, after a moment, that I could not see the President at this time. I conse nted agreeably, and returned. Lying in bed, thinking it over, I first realized that Eisenhower was no longe r Preside nt of course. I also suddenly had the very deep conviction that Kennedy had a psychic bodyguard (or rather mindg uard). I then realized that Kennedy might be there in Hyannis that weeken d. I got u p and went downstairs, found the local paper, and on the front page was the story that Kennedy was arriving in Hyannis that afternoon. (I had not seen a paper for the past two days.) These represe nt a samp ling of the many \"event s\" that defy classi ficaton, especially in terms of plain, everyday dreams. It may be that each is but a fragment of a living mural, someday to be seen in its en tirety. I hope one does not have to \"die\" to obtain the total view. The greatest proof of the existence of any particular phe nomenon is consist ency through repeated observation. Only through such reasonably care ful analytical experim ents, or as much so as I could make them, did I com e to the conclu sion of the unqualified existence of the Second Body. I do presum e that all of us have one. I cannot conceive of being that unique. If it exists, wha t is it like? What are its charact eristics? Through several hundred tests, here are excerpts from the notes. 6/11/58 Afternoon I opened my eyes again, and everything seemed normal, except the vibration and the roar-rumble still in my head. I closed my eyes and they both grew in strength. I decided to try to lift up and I floated up off the couch, over the center of the room, and floated downward very gently, like a feather falling. I touched the floor, and my head and shoul ders seemed to be against the rug, with my hips and feet angling up into the air. It was as if my head had more weight than the rest of me, more gravitic attraction, but all of me was gentl y attracted to the earth. I still seemed to have weight, little as it was. 7/19/58 Afternoon I was again on the couch, feeling very smooth vibrations . I opened my eyes and looked around, and everything seem ed normal and the vibrations were still there. I then moved my arms, which were folded, and stretched them upward as I lay on my back. They felt outstretched and I was surprised (I am past proper use of the word astounded) when I looked, for there were my arms still folded over my chest . I looke d upward to where I felt them, and I saw the shim mering outlines of my arms"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"and hands in exactl y the place they felt they w ere! I looked back at the folded arms, then at the bright shadow of them outstretched. I could see through them to the books helves beyond . It was like a bright, glow ing outline which moved when I felt them move or ma de them move willfully. I wi ggled my fingers, and the glowing fingers wiggled, and I felt them wiggle. I put my hands to gether, and the glowing hands came together, and I felt my hands clasp each other. They felt just like ordinary hands, no different. For nearly ten minutes, I lay there, attem pting to compare this strange evidence, to determ ine differences. Visually, I could see my arms folded over my chest. Simultaneously, I coul d see the glowing outli ne of my hands and arms reach ing out above me. I tried to move the physical arms, but could not do so. I tried to move the glowing a rm-outlines, and they \"w orked\" perfectly. I tried to feel with my physical arms, but could determine no sensation. With the glowing ou tline arms, I claspe d my hands together, and they f elt completely norm al. I rubbed the outline hands over each outline fore arm, and the arms felt normal, solid to the touch. I moved one outline hand to the shelf by the cot, and I coul dn't feel the shelf! My outline hand went right through it. The vibrations started to fade, and I quickl y moved the glowing outline arms and hands back to my chest. It felt exactl y as if I slippe d on long-sleeved gloves, and then I could move my physical arms. I didn' t want to get cau ght outside-even just my arms— without the vibrations. I don't know w hat would happen, if anything, and maybe 1 don't want to find out. 5/5/60 Night Several times, I had felt someone, a body, warm and alive, pressed against my back the moment I left the physical body. After my experie nce with the \"thought forms \" and the otherst I had naturally bec ome quite cautious. Each time I felt this \"entity\" on my back, I quickl y moved back into the physical. I was sure that it was more of the \"thought children\" or perhaps some sex-distorted being, al though I had detect ed no sexual overtones. 1 was prudent, not exactly prudish, but certainly frighte ned. The latter impres sion was confirmed when I noticed that the face resting on the back of my non-physical neck had whiskers! Strong whiskers, like a man needing a shave . Also, I coul d hear the panting of his breath right in my ear. This was no mild thoug ht-child. This was an adult male, panting with passi on, thoroughly sexually deviate d or wh y would he pick on me, another male? Would I have felt differently if it had been a female form? In all honesty, I'm sure I would have. I'll have to get him away from me, 5/22/60 Night The whiskers were the clue! I need no longe r worry about the \"man\" on my back. He's still there, but now I know w ho he is. This time, after being scared back into the physical some five times, I got up a little more courage. I moved out slowly, just o ut of the physical, and felt the body on my back the same as before, the whiskered head on the back of my neck, the panting in my ear. Caref ully, so the moveme nt would not be taken as a hostile one, I reach ed back and moved the palm of my hand over the face behind me. It had whiskers , and they we re very real. The panting contin ued, the body stayed there pressed to my back, so I re-entered the physical. I sat up physicall y, and thoug ht about it. As I did so, I pensively moved my hand"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"across my chin. I needed a shave, I thoug ht absently, the n stopp ed. I rubbed my chin again. The feeling was too familiar. Just exactl y the same as when I rubbe d the chin of—could it be? Then I noticed that my throat was dry , as if I had been breathing through my mouth, as one does when . . . There was one way to find out. I lay down, and after a short while, I was able to generate the vibrations. Slowly I moved out of the physical. Yes, I felt it. There was the body again, the whiskers against my neck, the panting in my ear. I reach ed back carefully and felt the face with the whiskers . It was the same as my own. I held my breath, or thoug ht of so doing, and the panting stopp ed in my ear. I breat hed again, once, twice, then held my breath again. The \"body\" behind me panted in exact synchronization . The warm body clinging to my back was me! I went back into the physical, sat up, and thought about it. The question is, wh ich was which? Thinking it over, it seemed that the one in back—the one I could hear and feel—was the physical \"I\" and the \"I\" in front was the mental or real \"I.\" I assu me this because the physical sensations and related ac tion were in the rear body, while thought was in the front \"I.\" Confusing, but very real. From then on, I had no problem when I experie nced the sensation. Speak of people being afraid of their own shad ows! 8/8/60 Afternoon I conducted another interesti ng experiment. After lying down, and working through the count -up proce dure, the vi brations surged in strong and rough, then smoothed as they took on a more rapid frequency (starting just arou nd 30 c.p.s., as nearly as I can determ ine, and speeding up until I felt them only as a sense of warmth). I decided to lift out slowly to examine the process. I tried, and out came the glowing legs, th en the hips, but no more! I coul dn't get my chest and shoulders out, try as I might. It was very strange. I spen t the entire time moving the legs and hips up and down. I observed them visually with my physical eyes, which seem ed to be astigmatic. Several times, 1 tried moving m y legs up out of the physical, then to the right, and let them fall; when I did, they floated slowly down, touched the side of the couch, then draped over to the floor. They bent around and over the edge of the couch as if they had no bones, just like a slow-motion version of a piece of cloth falling loose ly and bending where it made conta ct with a solid object. There was no notice able aftereffect when I re-entered and sat up. Time away was twenty-two minutes. 9/16/60 Afternoon I was out of the physical, again on a Saturday, trying to keep \"local,\" i.e., staying in the same room. Again I noticed the strange rubbery elasticity o f this other body. I could stand in the middle of the room and reach out to touch the wall som e eight feet away. At first, my arm didn't come anywhere near the wall. Then I kept pushing my hand outward, and suddenly the texture of the wall was against my hand. Just by pushing out, my arm had stretched to twice its length with out my noticing anything different. When I relaxed the push ing out, the arm came back and seemed normal. This confirms the other evidenc e that you can make it just ab out whatever shape you think of, conscio usly or unco nsciously. If left alone, it reverts to your nor mal humanoid shape. If you consci ously think it into a given shape, I suspec t you take that form. You might conve rt temporarily into the shape of, for example, a cat or a dog. Could this be the source of the werewolf and vampire bat mythology? I'm not so"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"sure I want to give it a try. 10/10/62 Night I have found another clue to the \"how do you look when you're not physical\" questio n. In the early evening, around seven-thirty, I deci ded to try to visit R.W. in her apartm ent some eight miles distant. I was sure she would be awake (non- physicall y, of course). I had no difficulty, and found myself immediately in a living room. There was what I thought to be R.W. sitting in a chair near a bright light. I moved toward her, but she didn't seem to pay an y attention to me. Then I was sure she saw me, but she seemed fright ened. I backed away, then started to speak, but something pulled me back to the physical, and I found myself in my bed room, in the physical, the vibrations fading. The reason for recall was that my arm was asleep and tingling from lack of circulati on. I was lying on it the wrong way. There was a most unusual aftermath. The next day R.W. asked me what I was doi ng the night before. I asked her why, and she stated, \"I was sitting in the living room after supper, reading the paper. Something made me look up, and there on the other side of the room was something hanging and waving in the air.\" I aske d her what it looked like. \"It was like a filmy piece of gray chiffon\" she said. \"I could see the wall and chair behind itf and it started to come toward me. I was frightened, and I thoug ht it migh t be you, so I said, 'Bob, is that you?' But it just hu ng there in mid-air, waving slightly. I then asked again if it was you, and if so, please go home and don't bother me. Then it backe d away and faded out quickl y.\" She asked if it was rea lly me, and I said I thought it might be. \"Well, next time, say som ething so I'll be sure it's you,\" she answe red. \"Then I won 't be so scared\" I assured her I would. At least I'm not a very bright-hued ghost, and I don't have human shape—sometimes. 11/21/62 Night This time, I deci ded to make it a purely \"loca l\" trip. I started to float across the room toward the door, then I re membered that I don' t need to use doors under these condi tions. I turned and went straight to the wall, expecting to slide right through it. I didn't! When 1 came up against the wall, I se emed to be unable to penetrate it. It felt just like a wall when you physically push against it with your hands. I reasoned that there was som ething wrong. I have been through walls ea sily before. I shoul d have been able to go through it. With this, I pushed with my outstretched arms against the watt. There was a moment of resistance , then I went through, just as easily as if the wall were water. But there was one difference. As I went through to the outside , I felt and identified every layer of material in the wall—the paint, the plaster, the lath, the sheathing, and finally the shingles on the outside . It was muc h like the hand through the floor. Why the unusual resistanc e at the first try? 2/15/63 Night This was a most unusual experim ent. After \"lifting\" out easily, and holding control in the same room, I finally got up the courage to go back and carefully examine the physical body rema ining on the bed. I started down slowly, reaching out in the semid arkness. (There was only light from the twi light through the windows, and I"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"couldn't see too well, and perhaps this was good. There is some kind of revulsion about seeing your own physical body.) I reach ed down carefully to touch my physical head, and my hands touched feet! At first, I thought I had drifted somewh ere else, and I felt my toes. My left big to e has a thick nail due to a long-ago mash ing by a dropped log. T his big toe (left) did not! I felt with my hands to the right foot. The big toe on the right foot did have the thick nail. Everything was reversed, like a mirror image. I felt up the body slowly, and from the toe on, I couldn't tell if it was reversed or not. The point is, I could feel the physical. My hands didn't seem simply to go through it. It was very eerie to feel my face with the closed eyes as if it were another person's. I got close enough actually to see the face. It was 1, all right, but just a little distorte d. Either that, or I'm a lot less acceptable-looking than my ego and pride will admit to. I never h ave thought myself to be handsome, but at least I thought I was a little better than this! Strange, the reversal. Floati ng in the half-darkness, I could have swung ar ound and become disoriented. But the thick nail was on the right foot instea d of the left. I must exam ine this further. 3/18/60 Night A query from Dr. Bradsh aw prompted this one. After be ing out and close by, I thought I wou ld try to find out if I wear clothes in the non-physical, to try to answer his ques tion. I had never bothered to find out before, I suppose basically beca use I don't have too much of a preoccu pation with clothes . They are for me principa lly for comfort and warmth. I felt my second, non-physical body. T here was skin with goose bumps, but no clothe s. Not this time, anyway. 2/23/61 Night I got out of the physical by the \"log roll\" process, then started across the room. Something seemed to be holding me back. It was like trying to walk slowly in water, pulling with arms and legs and getting nowhe re. Suddenly, there was a tug at my back (not painful), and I cartwheele d back ward, in an arc, feet over head, and re- entered the physical. I sat up, physicall y, and someone was kno cking at the door (my daughter). What was it that pulled me back so defi nitely? The \"cord\" I have since read of? 7/7/60 Afternoon This was an experiment I don' t want to try again. I was in the charged Farad ay cage (copper screen mesh, above ground, D.C. cha rge 5okv.). / attempted to move through the cage. I got out of the physical OK, then I seem ed to be entangled in a large bag made of flexible wire. The bag gave when I pushed against it, but I could n't go through it I struggled like a trapped animal in a snare, and finally went back into the physical. In thinking it over, quite evidently it w as not the wire itsel f, but the electrical field pattern set up in fundamentally the same shape as the cage, but more flexible. Maybe this could be the basis for a. \"ghost catch er!\" 10/30/60 Afternoon At about three- fifteen I lay down with the intent of going to visit E.W. in his house some five miles distant. After some difficulty, I managed to move into the vibrational state, then out into the room, away from the physical. With a mental aim at E.W. I"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"took off and moved slowly (comparatively). I sudd enly found myself over a business street, moving slo wly about twenty-five feet above the sidewalk (just abo ve the top edge of the second-story windows). I recogni zed the street to be the main street of the town, and recogni zed the block and corner over which I passed. 1 drifted along over the side walk for several minutes, and noticed a filling station on the corner, where a white car ha d both rear w heels off in front of two ope n grease rack doors. I was disap pointed in that I had not gone to E.W., my destina tion. Seeing nothing else of interest, I deci ded to return to the physical, and did so with out incident. Upon return, I sat up and tried to analyze why 1 had not gone where I intended. On an impulse, I got up, went down to the garage, and drove the five miles to his town. My thought was at least to make the trip profitable, and check on what 1 saw. 1 got to the same corner on Main Street, and there was the white car in front of the two open doors. Little evidential pieces like that help! I look ed up at the approxim ate positio n I had been over the sidewalk, and got a surprise. At just abo ut the exact heigh t I had floated over the sidewalk were power primaries containing fairly h igh voltage electrical current. Do electri cal fields attract this Second Body? Is this the medium through which it travels? Tonight I finally reached E.W. at home. It see ms that my aim wasn't too far off. At approximately three twenty-five E.W. was walking down Main Street, and I was following directly over him, as near ly as we can figure. 1/9/61 Night In respo nse to a question brought up in discussi on with Mrs. Bradsh aw, I decided to see if there truly was a \"cord\" between the physical and the Second Body. In the past, I had not noticed any if there was, excep t for an odd tugging action at times. With this in mind, I went through the memory proce dure, in the late afternoon, near dusk. I worked out of the physical via axis rotation, and remain ed in the room sev eral feet up and away from the physical. I turned to look for the \"cord\" but it was not visible to me; either it was too dark or not there. Then I reach ed aroun d my head to see if I could feel it coming out the front, top, or back of my head. As I reach ed the back of my head, my hand brush ed against something and I felt behind me with both hands. Whatever it was exten ded out from a spot in my back directly between my shoulder blades, as nearly as I can determine, not from the head, as 1 expect ed. I felt the base, and it felt exactl y like the sprea d-out roots of a tree radiati ng out from the basic trunk. The roots slanted outward and into my back down as far as the middle of my torso, up to my neck, and into the shoulders on each side. I reached outward, and it form ed into a \"cord,\" if you can call a two-inch-thick cable a \"cord.\" It was hanging loosely, and I could feel its texture very definitely. It was body-warm to the touch and seem ed to be composed of hundreds (thousands?) of tendonlike strands packed neatly togethe r, but not twisted or spiraled. It was flexi ble, and seemed to have no skin covering. Satisfied that it did exist, I took off and went. The basic characteristics noted have been confirmed many oth er times in various ways. Still, there appears to be no method to validate such evidence except by personal experi ence and observation by others. Perhaps this will come, in time. Let us see, then, what we have learned from the pre ceding. First, this Second Body has weight as we understand it. It is sub ject to gravitational attractio n, although much less than the physical body. T he physicist might explai n this, of course, by saying that it is a question of mass, and anyth ing that can interp enetrate a wall must have so little density as to be able to sift through the space betwee n the molec ular mat ter"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"structure. Such little density implies very little mass—b ut it still may be matter. This is further supported by the half-out exper iment, where the legs and hips were separated, then allowed to drift downward and drape over the bed. The low-density mass fell as a feather would fall. Pushing through the wall may be an exam ple also. The initial resistanc e may be caused by some form of surface tension, vibrationally speak ing, which, once broken, permits the less dense mass to pass between the wall molec ules. Perha ps some speculative physi cist ca n take it from there. Second, this Second Body is v isible under certain condi tions. To be visible, it must either reflect or radiat e light in the known spectru m, or at the least a harmonic in this area. Based upon the report in the arms and legs experim ent, I seemed to be viewing radiate d light, but only around the perimeter of the body form. The rest w as invisible under day light co nditions. It must be considered, too, that my per ceptual and sensory me chanisms may or must have been in some height ened or altere d condition which made this \"see ing\" possible. The \"gray chiffon\" seen by R.W. under arti ficial light and in a fully conscious state may be somet hing else again. From the descripti on, this may f all in the reflected-light category. Taken as reported, there evidently are condi tions where a fully con scious observer can be visually a ware of the presence of the Second Body. What such conditions are, I do not know. Third, the sense of touch in the Second Body seems to be very similar to that in the physical, i.e., when the hands felt each other, the sensation seem ed identical. The same seem ed true in the report of the search for the \"cord.\" The hands could feel and touch the non-physical self, and it was flesh touching flesh according to the sensory receptors, with the exception of the hair follicle type of skin protub erations. Also, there are indicati ons that the non-physical hands can touch the physical body, with much the same result—as wit ness the experime nt with the return for direct examin ation, begin ning with the toes. This is borne out again in the \"man on the back\" experience, where I felt the physical body in direct proximit y with the non- physical by parts of the body ot her than my hands. It would seem that in a so-called \"local condition,\" the Second Body can perceive and touch physical objects as well. Fourth, the Second Body is ve ry plastic and may t ake what ever form is suitable to or desire d by the individual. The ability to \"stretch out\" the arm to three times its normal length points to such elasticity. E xtrapolated, one could con ceive of the entire non- physical travel as the incredible stretching out of some subst ance emanating from the physi cal. The \"snap back\" to the physical when the desire or will to \"stay out\" is termin ated lends credence to the idea. The appearance of the Second Body as a waving piece of filmy cloth defies analysis o f any kind to date, but may ag ain indi cate plasticity. If no special form is transmitted by the mind or will at a given moment, we can assume that the familiar humanoid shape is main tained through some automatic thought-habituality. Fifth, there exists the possibility that the Second Body is a direct reversal of the physical. This is sup ported by the \"log rolling\" rotatio nal separation and by the experim ent involving the explor ation of the physical body as it lay inert on the couch . There was the head-to-foot discover y, which may we ll be explai ned by the dislocation in semid arkness. However, coup led with the big-toe identification, it deserves consider ation. There are suggestions of this in other reports, which were relegated initiall y to disori entation and purely sub jec tive respons es. The reversal conce pt may in some way have an association with the antim atter theory. Sixth, direct investigatio n tends to support the premise of a connecting \"cord\""},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"betwee n the physical and the Second Body, as described many times through the ages in esoteric literature. What purpose is ser ved by this connecting link is at this time unknown. It can be speculated that the Second Body and the intelligenc e inhabiting it still exe rt control over the physical via this communicating link. It seems probable that messag es also travel by this method to the Second Body from the physical, as witness the call to return from the poor circulation in the cramped arm, and the warning knock on the door. If the connection is ma intained, it must be truly a highly elastic substa nce much like the Second Body itself in order to stretch the seemi ngly in finite distances called for. Seventh, the relations hip betwee n the Second Body and electr icity and electro magnetic fields is quite significant. The exper iment in the Farad ay cage points to this, as does the positioning of the Second Body over the street, in or adjace nt to the field set up by the primar y elect rical current or in the electrical current itself."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"14. MIND AND SUPERMIND Having d escribed the \"physical\" aspects of the Second Body, it would seem most import ant to exami ne how the mind ap parently operates in reaction to the Second Body experie nce. Students of the mental sciences may disput e the terminol ogy used herein, since no attempt is mad e here to review the phenomenon in psychiatric, psychological, or physiologi cal terms. Rather, it is hoped that this sectio n, as well as the previous one, will have common meaning for all sciences and scientific minds , and that it will act as a bridge to further explorati on for every intellectual interest. The question posed most often is: How do you know y ou aren't dreaming, that what you experienc e is not hing more than a vivid drea m or a halluci nation of some sort? This does deserve some answer other than the counter-question: How do I know my waking e xperience is real? As reported elsewher e, I was certain that these experie nces were dreams or hall ucinations for a long period in the early stage s. They were seriou sly considered as something more only w hen evidential data began to accum ulate. The experi ences differ from the typical dream state prin cipally in the following w ays: (1) Continuity of some sort o f conscio us awareness ; (2) Intellectual or emotional (or blends of the two) de cisions made during the experie nces; (3) Multivalued perception via sens ory inputs or their equivalents; (4) Non-recurrence of identical patterns; and (5) Development of events in sequence that seem to in dicate a time lapse. The most certain statement that can be made is that when the condition exists, y ou are as aware of \"not dreaming\" as you are when you are awake. The same standards of wakeful-ness can be applied with the same positive result. This is what is so disconcerting in the early experim entation. The dual ity of existenc e is compl etely contradictory to all available scientific training and human experience. Again, the ultimate proof of such affirmation is to experienc e one's self in this state of being. Is this a product of self-hypnosis with attendant post-hypnotic suggestion? Quite probably the method of induc tion and establishment of the condition relates to hypnosis in many ways. Hypnosis itself is a phenomenon of which very little is understood. \"Suggestion \" as employed in hypno sis may be part of the activation process. However, great care has been taken to avoid any indirect suggestion or any stimuli that would induce hallucinated experie nce. When more is known of the factors involved in hypnosis, an interrela tionsh ip with the practices involved here may appear. If the mind does act differently, what are the points of diversion? Generally, it seem s that the consci ous mind (or the entirety of the individua l) gradually passes through a learning process. In retrospect, the effect is an evolutionary ada ptation and accept ance of the consci ous mind into a rele gated portion of a whole. The total is an equal blend of conscious, unconsci ous, and Supermind (transcen dent self?), all fully aware of the others. However, this amalgam ation is effective only in the Second State. If it conti nues in the physi-"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"cal environment, the effect is noticeable only to a limited In the earlier penetration into the Second State, thoug ht and action are dominated almost entirely by the unconscious, subjective mind. Attempts at rationa l understanding seem buried in an avalanche of emotional reaction. All primary subjective drives are strongly evident, demanding to be heeded and/or satisfied. It is imposs ible to deny th eir exist ence. Basic fears which you believed to be erased are the first to come forth. These are followed or joine d by the equally st rong drive for sexual union, which will be exami ned else where. Together, these present two soli d strikes against continued develo pment of the Second State. Throughout mankind's history, fear and sexuality have been the major mo tivating and control charact eristics in all forms of social organization. It is th erefore understandable that they play such a vital part in the Second State. Slowly, the conscio us mind begins to act upon this ap parently unorganized, illogical mass, to bring order and ob jective perception into it. In the beginn ing, it seems an imposs ible task. In the later stages, the consci ous mind de velops a symbiotic relatio nship with it. Only rarely do matters get out of hand. This is not to say that the consci ous mind is in full control in the Second State. Rather, it is merely a modulator of a master or driving force. Who is the master ? Call it Sup ermind, soul, greater self —the label isn't important. It is imp ortant to know that the conscious mind auto matically responds to commands of the master without ques tion. In the physical state, we seem only dimly a ware of this. In the Second State, it is a natural occurrence. The Super mind knows unquestionably what is \"right,\" and problems result only whe n the conscious mind stubbornly refuses to recognize this superior knowledge. The source of knowledge of the Supermind leads down many avenue s, most of which seem beyond our consci ous-mind-world perception. Heredity is the most acceptable of these, and the most insufficient With this continuing adaptation in progress, we can deduce certain observabl e premis es. These lead to conclusions appli cable to the Second State environment. Thought-action synchronicity. W hereas in the physical state action follows thou ght, here they are one and the same. There is no mech anical translation of thought into action. One gradually appreciates the existence of thought as a force in itself rather than as a trigger or cat alyst. It is primarily an emotional thought force, which is gradually mold ed into co herent action. It is the thought of movement that creates the action. It is the thought of the person to be visited that de termines the destination. Also, it is th e supermind's needs that create movement into unknown areas, often without an immediate consci ous awareness of the motivating forces. Thought patter ns carried over from physical activities strongly influence respon ses in this Second State of existe nce. It is astou nding to discover how m any sm all thought habits one has \"grown,\" and how em barrassed one often feels at the automatic quality of them. Although no purely physical habits, needs, or desires (e.g., hung er, pain, smoking) seem to be carried over as such, minor annoying thought patterns and condi tioning appear to confuse and divert attention. The exceptio n to all of this is the sexual drive, an d even this is tainted by artifici al social standards and the habits they have produced. Here is an illustration of a minor habit carry-over fro m the notes . 6/11/63"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"When they ca me close to me, each taking an arm to lead me through the area, my hand went to my right chest pocket, to feel if the bulk of my wallet was still there, so that it wou ld not be taken. It took some moments to realize that there was no wallet (perhaps no coat), nor was there any inte nt on the part of the two who held me to take my non existent wallet. This is the price of living in crowds in the big city! Little habits like these do get in the way, and you run into them again and again. The method of dispo sal is to recog nize them, one by one. Once they are identified they are no longer bothersome. The same is true of thoughts in relatio n to the shape of the physical body. For example, if you have been conditi oned to acute awaren ess of nakedness, you will automatically think you are clothed—and so you are. The form of your physical body is car ried over in replica down to the last hair follicle and scar, unless you deliberately think otherwise. Conversel y, if your thought habits have been in other directions, you may take whatever f orm is mo st conven ient, deliberately or oth erwise. I suspect that one may modify the Second Body into whatever form is desire d. Once the thought is discard ed, the Second Body will drop back into its ha bitual humanoid shape. This opens up some interesting speculation into man's mythology. If one wished to exper i - ence the existenc e of a quadru ped, the Second Body might be transformed temporarily into a large dog, and some one with Second State vision (there probably are many such people) might enco unter a werewolf. Or the fables of half man, half goat/h orse could be the result. One might \"think\" wings and fly, and be transformed momentarily into a vam pire bat It seems less impossi ble when one experim ents with the power o f thought in the Second State. To put it another way, there seems to be nothing that thought cannot produce in this new-old other life. This in vites a note of caution in large red letters: be absolutely sure of the results you desire, and constantly in control of the thoughts you engender. Percepti on chang es. This is the area of most significant yet most incom prehensible alterati on. Because we have learned no other way of dealing with it, all sensory input is translated at first into terms and meanings appreciated by the five physi cal senses. For exam ple, when one begins to \"see\" in this un familiar shape, the impressi on is that this \"seeing\" is much the same as optical recept ion by the physical eyes. Only later do you discove r empirically that this is not the case. It isn't physical \"seeing\" at all. You learn that you can \"see\" in all direct ions at once, without turning the head, that you see or don 't see according to the thought; and that when exam ined objectively, it is m ore an impression of radiati on rather than a reflection of light waves. The same applies to other physical senses. You believe at first that you are hearing people \"speak\" to you. Early, you perceive that no \"ear\" has received a sensory messag e. In some other way, you have received the mess age (thought) and your mind has translated it into understandable words. Touch seem s to have the most definite relatio nship to its physi cal counterpart. Smell and taste have been consp icu - ously abs ent to date. Most interesting is the evidence that none of these modes of perception works wholly automati cally. You seem to be able to turn them \"on\" or \"off\" at will. There also seem to be a few new me ans of sensory input. One of these is identification of other human entities (living, dead?) not by how they \"look,\" but through an undisguised awareness of their prime perso nality habits and thoug hts."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"This is most remarkab le, because it seems infallible, with the innermost self appearing to radiate patterns, much as the composition of a star or a piece of metal can be analyzed by its spectrog raph. I suspe ct that such emanations cannot be shut off by the individu al, so there can be no covering ove r of the inner self to hide it from view. Another is the ability to comm unicate with others at a level above conscious awareness. This has been performed with living pe rsons awake and asleep. It is quite possible that it also takes place among people living in the physical state who are completely unaware of it. In the Second State, it is speci fic and utterly natural. There are many incid ents reporte d in the notes of such comm unication while the other person is in consci ous physical conversatio n with a third party. The most frustrati ng part of this is that the communicant rarely has any m emory of it afterward. Also, it is only with difficulty that such contact is opened with a person physicall y awake. It is like trying to rouse a perso n from a sound, deep sleep . It may be that this communicating portio n of the mind is actuall y aslee p during periods of physical consciousness. Free association or regressive hypnotic techniqu es should bring recall from such sources when needed. One problem is encountered periodically in perce ption dur ing the Secon d State. It may be more comm on in percep tion by physical means than has been reporte d, and thus not unique. I refer to the question of the mind's identification of perso ns, places, and things which up to that moment have been unknown and unperceived previously. In the quest for evidential data and self-orientation, the mind seems to act strongly in response to an unformed thought comm and to \"Identify!\", without modification or equivocation. Therefore, when an unknown or apparently im possible situation, place, person, or thing is en countered, the mind comes up with some kind of answer rather than no answer w hatsoever. The answer take s the form of rationalization, if it can be called that; or more commonly, a search is ma de of past memories and experiences to produ ce proper identification. It com pares the situation under which the object or actio n is perceived with past perso nal experie nce. If there is not hing to coinci de exactly with the observed data, the mind invariably r eports the most similar memory an d states, \"This is the object or act ion you are seeing.\" It is only af ter critical analysis that some sembl ance of what actually was perceived comes to light. There are many good illustrations of this phenomenon. One of the best is the visit to Mr. Bahnson's house in the morni ng. The mind, having no reference in its memory of the object being placed in the back of the car (Van DeGr aff generator), identified properly its ap proxim ate size, the round, wheellike protuberance on a post, and the base plat form, and reported erroneously that it was a child's automo bile. The mind properly reported the boy and the baseball, because this was a part of its me mory- bank data. However, it ran into a problem on the motion of Mrs. Bahnson in handing out the morning mail. This was reported as \"dealing cards,\" but the mind was fac ed with the incongruity of playing w ith large white cards (letters) at a table filled with dishes. The idea of \"card playing\" was the least impossible similar event in the memory associ ation, so that was the unit retained. Of equal interest was the experi ence of the airpla ne crash reporte d in Chapt er 11. Here was a whole series of events filled with muc h sensory da ta, filtered by the mind's past associati ons. Added to this was the rapid superi mposure of information,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"so that the seque nce of events in time added to the confusion. The impressi on of taking a trip by airplane was quite accurat e. However, the mind \"forgot\" that there was a bus trip to the airport first. Conseq uently, in reporting the loading of the bus, the impressi on was that this was the airplan e. In boarding the bus, the mind perceived the driver waiting besi de the door. In an attempt to identify the man, the memory was search ed and the most similar perso n in past experience (D.D.) was selecte d as the person encountered. (The physical similarit y between the bus driver and D.D. whe n comp ared later was most remarka ble.) Recognitio n of the woman in the seat ahead and her discom fort was another form of misinter pretation. The, dis comfort or anxiety was accurate, the reason wrong. The mind had not determined the cause of the woman's anxiety, so it relat ed it to the individu al, as some answer was demanded. Then, the flying lo w and slow over streets was a perfect de scription of the event itself—t he bus traveling the turnpike to the airport—except that the mind was still fixe d on the idea of flying in an airplane. The mind still hel d fixedly on the \"fact\" that the plane flight had already begun. When the plane encountered the storm, the mind reporte d the plane flying un der power and telephone wires because it could not translate directly the effect of the storm. Most si gnificant was the mind's interpretation of the \"accident\" or catastrophe. It \"saw\" what appeared to be a dis ruption of the heart activities. This was an imposs ible situa tion, an inconceivable event based upon its experien ce. In the face of this past data, the mind was forced to \"Identify!\" Experience said the observed catastrop he was not possib le. Therefore, it selecte d an airplane crash as an event that would be believed and acceptable as a possibility. From this, the difficulty of accurate ly reporting the ob servance of unknown material can be understo od. If it proves this complex in familiar environments, one can well imagine what takes place when that which is perceived has no rela tionsh ip whatsoever to previous experience. Only by labo rious trial and error have a few facts been assem bled, and these may not all be comm on with the interpretation of other minds with other experience backgrounds. This is the reason for the need for others to experienc e the same conditions. The entire picture may become clear with the help of such additional reports. Of the few facts that have been properly tagg ed, there are the \"flying\" and \"falling\" dreams. I am quite certain that such dreams are but memories of some degree of Second State experience, I have often become aware of experie ncing the flying dream during sleep , only to discover tha t I was act ually floating out in the Second Body as I brough t con sciousne ss to the incident. This involuntary action happens most freque ntly without any conscio us effort. It may w ell be that many people do have this experience during sleep, but just don 't remember it. A dream of riding or flyi ng in an airplan e has a similar con notation. The mind, refusing to accep t the possibility o f flying without mech anical help due to memory experie nce, conjures up an airpla ne to ration alize the event Again, when consci ousness and full awareness are brought into play, th e \"airplan e\" disap pears. There you are, high in the air, with no logical means of support. It is most disconcerting until you get use d to the idea. Falling dreams were also repeat edly exam ined in my early experiments. It is a common \"feeling\" in quick reinte gration of the Second Body with the physical. Evidently, the prox imity of the physical causes it to accept relayed senso ry sig nals"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"from the Second, which is \"falling\" into the physical. By the same token, the process of \"falling\" asleep often brings f orth a \"sinking\" sensa tion. By trying it again and again, the effect is prod uced by the separ ation of the Second from the physical, and the sensory imp ressions are split be tween the two. Perhaps the same sinking sensati on takes place when one loses consciousness from other causes, such as fainting, application of anesthesia, etc. Intelligenc e measurement On the surface, except for the addition of sensory abilities just not ed, there seems to be no imme diate opening of new v istas of knowledg e and informa tion. There is no jump in IQ by the standards applied in the physical world. There is indeed a new kind of intellect at work, but it is in a form that seems incom prehensible. This composite mind uses the experiences of living in the physical, but applies them only w hen they \" fit\" the event or incide nt Sometimes actions take place that seem utter nonsense to the conscious mind, and their validity is recogni zed only a fter the event. After a significant number of experime nts, one becomes aware that the conscious mind in itself, even with its mem ory-recall patterns, is insufficient for the task of full compr ehen sion. There is too much to be evaluated that is beyond the scope of consci ous personal experience. Again, this demands a continuing need to organize the available data into com prehensive form, and to add to that body of knowledge through the evidential experience of other consci ous minds. This conscio us mind has recogni zed its limitati ons! Memory patterns. If the conscio us intellect does not seem improved, the memory storeh ouse is anot her matter. One of the early chang es is the gradual flooding of the memory with events, places , people, and things that have no relations hip in any w ay to one's current physical life activities or past experience. Nor do they seem to have any be aring on the visits to Loca les II or III. The source of these memories still remains a mystery. They are sensed and recalled while in the Second State. For ex ample, I have a vivid memory of a plac e where I used to live —the roads leading up to it, the shape of the land, its locat ion in relation to the road, and the surrounding landscape. It is not a good piece of land, but I seem to have worked hard for it and it was all I could afford. I had intentions of building a house on it some day. There is the memory also of three connected buildings on a city street—old buildings, some eight stories high. The top floors of these buildings (similar to old apartm ent buildings) have been joined into one large living area, with large, high - ceilinge d rooms. One has to step up or down slightly to go from one room to another due to the difference in floor levels. This was a place I visited, not too often, sometime, some where. There are many more, probably unimportant in relatio n to the whole. It is impo rtant to know, howe ver, that these are directly the product of Second State experim entation. Of what value they are, beyon d to confuse, I have yet to learn."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"15. SEXU ALITY IN THE SECOND STATE Throug hout the entire experiment ation, evid ence began to moun t of a factor mos t vital to the Seco nd State . Yet in all the esoteric literature of the underground, there is no men tion of this, not so much as one word of con sideration or expl anation. This factor is se xuality and the physical sex drive. If the Sec ond State data is contem plated as fact, th is business of sex amon g humans has someh ow become thor oughly confus ed, distorted, and badly misunder stood. In a nation where over 90 per cent of the practicing psy chiatrists are Freudian, much mention is ma de of this factor. Virtually n o thought or action stems from any other motiva tion, if we subscribe wholly to this theory. With the label of \"evil\" long pinned to the subject, the underground probably ignores it as something grossly \"mate rial\" and unworthy of any bearing in spiritu al develop ment. Much the same pattern has applied to religions, formal and otherwise. Like food, this necessity was manipulated in man's histor y again and again under artificia l rules and taboos to exerci se control over the mass populace. To a great extent, this still applies as a basic control over our desires and ac tions. Watch almost any Americ an TV comm ercial to ob serve one facet. Listen to a hell-fire-and- damnation preacher for another. Study the uncensored histor y of any m ajor civi - lization or reli gion for the long look. In the underground, there were rumors based upon mild evidence that many well- known \"psychics\" were high ly sexed individua ls. The more sophisticated group claimed knowl edge of this parall el, but nothing was synthesized from it. Gurdjieff, the famous early-twentieth- century my stic, wa s repo rted to have stated that if there had been two obstacles to achi eving the mystical state such as the sexual one pre - sented, he wouldn't have achieved it. It is imp ossible to describ e how deeply I now ap preciate and understand Gurdjie ff's comment. For I have been sub jected to the same environmental concepts and conditioning as any Am erican. Even now, af ter a deconditioning process, I sense echoes of guilt and sin in attempting to bring some candor to this section . Yet I kno w this would be an incom plete report without it. Here are some excerpts from the notes in the early experi mental stage. 5/7/58 Late night, bedroom, low humidity, no moon, 1 was physi cally tired, mentally calm. I lay down to sleep, and the vi bration pattern develo ped some five minut es later. I got up courage to try a \"lift-out\" thoug ht, and moved out and up slowly and steadily to about five feet over the bed. I was trying to decide what to do when I was filled with a great desire for sexual satisfaction. It was so strong that 1 forgot everything else. I looked around and spotted my wife lying bel ow me on the bed. I went down and tried to wake her so we coul d have a sexual act, but was unsuccess ful—she wouldn't wake up. I felt that the only w ay I coul d achieve results would be in the physical, so I dove back into the body. The vibrations started to fade almost imme diately. By the time I sat up physicall y, the sexual desire had gone comp letely. This is very strange; I didn't know I had such strong undercurrents of desire. 6/1/58"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Late night, bedroom, average humidity, clou dy. 1 was sleepy, bu t mentally alert. The vibrations came in some two minut es after lying down to sleep . I lifted straight out and up by the \"think\" method, and was overwhelme d again with the sex urge, for the fourth time in a row. I can't shut it off, no matter how h ard I try. Disgusted with myself, I went back into the physical. The vibrations were not in evidence when I sat up. There must be a way to shut it off! 7/29/58 Late night, office, average humidity. I was somewha t tired, but mentally alert . I think I have found the answe r to the sex m aniac in me—it worked this time with amazing results! The vibrations came in gently, and I waited until they see med strong, then \"thought\" up, and there I was over the bed again. Again, I look ed all through the office for a female. As in the past, every time I tried to think of going fa rther than ten feet from the physical body, the sex idea stopped me. The new te chnique was that instea d of fighting the idea of sex, or i g noring it, or d enying its exi stence, I thoug ht, yes, the idea of sex is a very good one and we (I) must do somet hing about it. I will in just a little while, but first, I want to go so mewhe re else. With a start, 1 shot up through the ceiling and in just a few seco nds, I was in another room. They were sitting at a table and there was a long white book on the table. I was excited, but quickly became worried about getting back, and thoug ht urgently of my physical body. With a rush, I felt myself wiggling into my body. I sat up physically on the couch, looked around, and everything seem ed normal, includ ing myse lf. But I had at last left the imme diate vicinity. I wo nder who the two people were. From this, it can be seen that the sex d rive was never ac tually conqu ered. Instead, it was set aside, put off for the moment while I fully recogni zed and acknowledge d its exist ence. Actually, the idea came from what used to be called the \"Gene Autry love scene. \" In his typical Western, Gene would fight the villains to save the girl, and lead her to the corral fence. He would move close to her and make remarks about how pretty her hair was, just like a sorrel. The girl, with love in her eyes, would move in. Just as you {and the girl) were sure he was going to kiss her—even after she had asked him to kiss her—ol d Gene would say, \"I shore will, Susy Jane— but first, I want to sing y ou a little song.\" And from nowhere, he'd pull out a guitar an d sing about horses. After the song, he never did kiss th e girl becaus e the picture ended before he got aroun d to it The idea of delaying instea d of denying pro ved to be the means of emancipation from the domination of the sex dr ive. The drive remain ed, and still does, and will return given the least opportunity. And those opportunities do arise in the Second State, but in a different form. \"Different\" is actually a very inadequate description. The sexual action-reaction in the physical seems but a pale imita tion or a feeble attempt to duplicate a very intimate Second State form of communion and comm unication which is not at all \"sexual \" as we understa nd the term. In the physical drive for sexual union, it is as if we are somehow remember ing dimly the emotional peak that occurs among people in the Second State, and translating it into a sexual act. If you find this difficult to accep t, try to exami ne objectivel y your own sexua l desires specifically, without the conditioning fac tors to which you have been expos ed. Take away the rules and taboos, and look closely w ithout emotional bias. It can be done. Perha ps you too will wonder how manki nd could have been so greatly misdirected. Here is the closest possib le analogy to the Second State experience, of which"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"physical sexuality is merely a shadow. If the opposite charged poles of electrost atics could \"feel,\" as the unlike ends approach one another, they w ould \"need\" to com e togeth er. There is no barrier that can restrain it. The need increas es progressively with nearness. At a given point of nearness, the need is comp elling; very close, it is all-enco mpassing; beyon d a given point of nearness, the attraction-need exerts tremendous pull and the two unlik es rush togeth er and envelop one another. In an immediate mo ment, there is a mind(soul?)-shaking interflow of electro ns, one to the other, unbalanced charges become equalized, peaceful contended balance is restored, and each is revital ized. All this happens in an instant, yet an eternity passes by. Afterward, there is a calm and serene separation. It is as normal and natural as this. It may be difficult to reduc e this vital functional emotion to a simple and truly natural need, to nothing more or less than the application of a law of physics at another level. Yet many test s consist ently support this premise . The distillate of this conclusion did not come easily, as there were almost insurm ountable barriers to overcome. The first of these was the conditioned responses set up and in grained by the rules and taboos of our social structure. Ini - tially, these were carried over into the Second State. Here is a good example from the notes. 9/16/59 Upon deciding to \"see \" I became aware of my position in the room. The office was dimly lit an d I was above the ta ble and some eight feet away from the couch, where I could make out my physical body half-visible in the dark. Then, near the door, I saw a form, certainly hum anoid, moving to ward me. Immediately, I \"knew\" that this person was female. I was still cautious , but I was figh ting the sex ur ge, which was rising in spite of any self- will. \"I am a woman.\" It seem ed to be a low, woman's voice. I said that I knew she was, trying to hold back. The sexual overtones in her voice were unmistakable. She came even closer. My mind translated that she was inde ed a woman, and the epitome of sexua l attracti veness. I back ed away, torn by de sire and the fear of what might happen if I actual ly did have a sexual relationship while in the Second Body, and the possi ble \"disloyalty\" to my wife. Finally, m y fear of possible un known consequences overcame the desire, and I hastily dived back into the physical body, reassocia ted, and sat up. I looked around. The room was empty. The moment I thought about the event, my physical body reacted and became stimu lated. I wen t outside for a walk be fore returning to make these notes. Maybe I am a coward! It took a number of these meetings at varying levels of intens ity before I began to assess the \"wrong\" of it that held me back. There seemed to be a direct relatio nship betwee n what I interpreted as the sexual drive and this \"force\" that permitte d me to disass ociate from the physical body. Was it a redirection of this basic drive that I actual ly felt as \"vi brations?\" Or was it the other way aroun d? Was the sexua l drive a physical and emotional manifestation of the force? Perha ps there is a way to exami ne this under very strictly controll ed conditi ons—that is, if there is a society matur e enough to undertake the experime nts. Certainly ou rs is not. All that can be done here is to attempt to bring certain points under scrutiny. Recently, in scient ific studies of dreams and sleep , it was not ed that during REM"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"(Rapid Eye Move ment) sleep, male subjects evidenced a penile erection . This occurred irrespective of the dream content. A non-sexual dream still pro duced the effect. This is abo ut as far as science has experimented to date. It is men tioned here only bec ause the most consistent physical reaction noted when returning from the Second State is a penile erection. It is a clue, no more. Whether through redirection or purif ication, Second State sexuality is not the same as its physical echo, even once the habits and preco nceptions of the latter are discard ed. The barriers created and continually reinforced by social condi tioning are but half of it. The physical-me chanical elements themselves no longer seem to apply. For a long time , the mind will continue to translate the attraction-action- reactio n sequen ce as a similar function occurring non- physically. As perception and control sharpen, the differences become more noticeable. First and most obvious, there is no evidence of the male-female interpenetration. Attempts to express the need in such a functional manner become pathetic in retrospect. One discove rs in frustrati on that it just d oesn't happen that way in the Second State. Next, sensuality produc ed by the physical form of the sex count erpart is entirely abse nt. There is no distinct pattern of physical shape, either visually or by touch. How, then? What then? The analogy of the opposite mag netic poles still holds. There is an acute awareness of \"differ ence,\" which is like radiation (as it may well be) from the sun, or a fire as felt by one shivering with cold. It is dynami cally attracti ve and needed. This attractio n varies in intensity w ith the individua l. (Define what makes one person more sexually a ttractive tha n another; it is more than physical pro portions.) It can be like magn etic lines of flux. The \"act\" itself is not an act at all, but an immobile, rigid state of shock where the two truly intermingle, not just at a surface level and at one or two speci fic body parts, but in full dimension, atom for atom, throughout the entire Second Body. There is a short, sustained electro n (?) flow one to another. The moment reach es unbearable ecstasy, and then tranquillity, equalizatio n, and it is ove r. Why this takes place, why it is needed, I do not know, any more than the north pole of a magnet understands its \"ne ed\" for the south pole of another magn et. Unlike the magnet, however, we can perceive objectively and ask \"why.\" One fact is certain: as in the physical state, the act is equ ally needed in the Second. In some part of Locale II, it is as ordi nary as shaking hands. Here is an excerpt from the notes. 9/12/63 I arrived for no discernible reason in an outdoor area among some seven or eight people, all standing in a casua l group. They did not appear particul arly surprised to see me, and I was cautio us as usual. There was som e hesitati on on their part, as if they did not know h ow to treat or greet me, but no hostility. Finally, one stepped forward in a friendly manner as if to shake hands. I was about to thrust out my hand when the person moved very close to me, and suddenly, there was a quick, momentary flash of the sex. charge. I was surprised and a little shocke d. Then, one after the other, each stepped forward, greeted me in this fashion—as simply as a handshake—right down the line of people. Finally, t he last one stepped forward, the only on e I was truly able to per ceive a s a female. She seemed much older than the others and than I. She seem ed to express friendliness and good humor. \"Well, I haven't done it for a long time\" -she laugh ed as she said it-\"but I'm willing to"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"give it a try!\" With this, she moved in close, and we had a short and not feeble sex charge togeth er. She backed away, chuckled hu morously, and rejoined the others. After a few moments, and some attempts to find out where I was, I grew uncomfortable and felt that I shou ld get ba ck. I moved away straight up, stretched for the physical, and returne d without incident. Was the sex-charge greeting a typical custom there, or were they a ttempting to be pleasant to a stranger by temp orarily adopting a custom that seems to be commonplace in his homeland? This might be, if they look ed at the secret inner selves of most of us in \"physical\" bondage, Sexual dream fantasies cause d by som e early sex repr es sion? This might be the Freudian answe r, and also the \"easy\" way out, the mislabeling to avoid facing uncharted possibili ties. What evidence is there that it is anything else? There is no way to prove the above, because there is no means of determining the \"where\" of it. In the experience above , yes. In another? Again, from the notes : 3/4/61 Late night, in the study, ground floor. 1 was not overtired, and mentally alert. I deliberately induced the vibrations, by the cutdo wn method. It was a Saturday night, and this is being written Sunday afternoon, based upon notes during the night and later events. Some prelimin ary inf ormation: On Saturday afternoon (yesterda y), a friend of my wife, a woman (J.F.), phoned to ask if she could visit us overnight She arrived in time for dinner, and after a quiet and pleasant evening we retired, our guest going upsta irs to the small, square guest room in the front of the house—or so I assu med. I believe d also that our two childr en were asleep in their own room, which is long and rectan gular and directly over the study, I d ecided to slee p in the study rather than in the bed room with my wife, as I felt that I could induce the vibrations and didn't want possibly to disturb her sleep. After many preliminaries, the vibrations came in strong and accelerated to a frequency beyond perce ption as individ ual pulsati on. I lifted out of the physical easily, and with a strong sense of release and control, went on up, through the ceiling and floor above and into a rectangul ar room. The room was dark, and I was sure I was in the children 's bed room, but could see no one. 1 was about to try to go some where else when I became aware of a woman in the room not too far from me. I coul d not discern her features, but she gave me the impressio n that she was in her middle thirties, and that she was a woman of considerable sexual experie nce (that familiar \"radiation\" of characteristics?). This latter sense brought forth my sex drive, an d I was attracted to her. As I approached, she said (?) she would \"rather not\" because she was very tired. I moved back, respecting her wishes, and indicated that it was per fectly all right. She seemed grateful, and I was consi derate but disap pointed. Then 1 noticed a secon d woman just to the right in the background. This second woman was older than the first, in her forties, but was also a woman of wide sexual exper ience. The secon d woman moved forward and offered to \"be\" with me, as if she said \"I will\" (implying that if the first woman wouldn't, she would, eagerly). I needed no further invitation at that stage, and we moved together quickly. There was the giddy electrical- type shock, and then we separ ated. I thanked her, and she seemed calm and contented. Feeling this was enough for one night, I turned and dived through the floor and soon"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"was re-entering the physical. I sat up and turned on the light. Everything w as quiet in the house. I smoked a cigarette and then lay down and slept for the rest o f the night without incident. This morning (Sund ay), I w as up early as usual, and my wife came into the kitchen for coffee at about ten. She de bated about going upstairs and waking J.F. to go to church. Casually, she mentioned that she hoped J.F. slept comforta bly because she had been so tired. This did not strike a re sponsive note, but when she stated that J.F. had slept in the children's room instead of the guest room (in a supposedly more comfortable bed), and the childr en had slept in the guest room, it began to ring a bell. As stated, the children's room is rectangular and is directly over the study. Further, J.F. is i n her middl e thirties, a professional singer, an d cer tainly has had wide sexual exper ience (two husbands plus a number of love affairs). Add to this the fact that she was very tired. It took several minutes to get up enough courage to ask, but I had to know. My wife is fairly well indoctrinated by this time. I aske d my wife to go up and ask J.F. if she was sexua lly \"tired.\" She asked me what I mea nt, and I explai ned. Then, of course, she wanted to know w hy, and said that she could n't ask J.F. such a questio n, I said I was sure she could find out, that it was impo rtant. Finally, she agreed and went upstairs to awaken J.F. I w aited for a long time, and finally my wife came back downstairs alone. She looked at me in tently. \"How did you know?\" Thank goodness she didn't ask it susp iciously. She went on, \"That's the reason she called and asked to come out. All week, she has been having a violent love affair, with sex e very night. She told me she was just to o tired to take another night of it.\" A short time later, J.F. came down for break fast. My wife, of course, had not told her anything of my interest in her condition. She seemed her normal self for the rest o f the day, w ith one excep tion. Ordinarily, J.F. treats me very casu ally as simply the husband of an old friend. Today I caught her staring at me intently again and again, as if she were try ing to remem ber something about me but couldn't. 1 gave no indication that I noticed this sudden interest. This was fairly good identification. But who was the other, older woman? Aftermath: 3/7/61. It is now W ednesday night. During th e past few days, I had tried to figure out what the older woman might signify. I had just about decided that it was a non living person still deeply attracted to physical sex relat ion ships, who followed J.F. around just to enjoy vi cariously the Matter's sexual activities—i f this is possi ble. Then, yesterday, a friend dropped by the office. In the course of the conversa tion, he mentioned that a mutual friend, R.W., had stated that she had a dream about me the past Saturday night . At the mention of Saturday night , I was immediately alert. R.W. was a businesswo man in her forties. Although married, she definitely qualified as a woman of wide sexua l experie nce, accor ding to my own obs ervations (but not participation}. R.W. had not descr ibed to our mutual friend the nature of the dream, so I deci ded to find out. I was finally able to reach vague about the dream content. At my gentle insiste nce, she stated that in the dream, I gave her a detailed \"physical exami nation.\" Beyon d that, she would not elaborate. Either she truly didn't recall any more, or it was much too perso nal for her to relate to me. But the fact that she dreamed this on the same Saturday nigh t, that it sugg ested some kind of intimacy an d was im portant enough for her to mention it, that R.W. meets the charact eristics I had listed"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"previously—these are hard to label coinci dence. If there has been any und ercurre nt of sexual desire for J.F. and R.W. on my part, I was not aware of it. There is some comfort in knowing thes e two are still among the \"living.\" Many of the experiments in the notes are also \"too per sonal\" for me to relate. What has been prese nted thus far will, I tru st, give enough indica tion. Suffice it to say that there have been experiences of all types, as there are evi dently all types in the Second State both in Locale I and Locale II. The followers of the \"astral planes\" conce pt would say that the \"quality\" of those met would determine the \"level\" of the plane visited—\"quality\" meaning intensity and/ or degradation or elimination of the sexual experience. This would depend upon interpret ation. Those who have not be - gun to understand the conditions of the Second State (\"alive\" or \"dead\") might well still relate the pattern to that of the physical, only w ithout the inhibitions and limitati ons of the \"civilized\" physical society. W e continue to evaluate sexuality as good or bad strictly in terms of such inhibitions, restrictions, and social structure. The fallacy of this view point is shown in that in our own spa ce-time continuum, we cannot reconcile sexual practice with social rules, nor agree on this subject among the various social orders now in ex istence. The sexual drive in itself can be a catalyst to the vibrational condition which is the doorwa y to the Second State. However, it is a tricky matter; it is like an exuber ant child, constant ly testing the authority directing it, and threatening to take over and run in another directio n. But in no way is it evil in the Second State."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"16. PRELIMINARY EXERCISES Throughout this writing, I have made many references to one evident fact; the only possible way for an individual to appreciate the reality of this Se cond Body and existence within it is to exper ience it himself. Obviously, if this were an easy task, it w ould now be com monplace. I susp ect that only an innate curiosit y will enable people to overcome the obstacles in the path of this achieve ment. Although there are many cases of existence exper i enced apart from the physical body, they h ave for the most part—at least in the Western world— been of a spontaneous, onetime nature, occurring during moments of stress or physi cal disability. We are speaking of some thing entirely different, which can be objectively investiga ted. The experim enter will want to proceed in a manner that will produce consiste nt results, perha ps not every time, but often enough to validate the evidence to his own satisfaction. I believe that anyone can experience existenc e in a Second Body if the desire is great enough. Whether or not anyon e should is beyon d the scope of my judgme nt. Evidence has led me to believe that most, if not all, hu man beings leave their physical bodies in varying degrees during sleep. Subsequent reading has proved that this idea is tho usands of years old in man's history. If it is a valid prem ise, then the condition itself is not unnatural. On the other hand, conscious, willful practice of separation from the phys ical is contrary to the pattern, it would seem, in view of the limited data available. Harmful physical effects from such activity are undeter mined. I have not detected (nor have any physicians) any p hysiological changes, good or bad, that can be attribute d directly to the out-of-the-body experie nce. There have been many psy chological changes that I rec ognize, and probably many more that I have not been aware of. However, even my frien ds in the psychiatr ic profession have not claime d that these have been detrimental. My grad ual revision of basic concepts and beliefs is app arent in a number of ways through out this writing. If these psychologi cal and perso nality changes are truly harm ful, there is not much that can be done about it now. A note of caution is in order here for those who are in terested in experim enting, for once opened, the doorway to this experience cannot be closed. More exactl y, it is a case of \"you can't live with it an d you can't live without it.\" The activity and resulta nt awareness are quite incom patible with the science, religion, and mores of the society in which we live. History is strewn with mart yrs whose only c rime was non- conformity. If your interest and research become com monly known, you run the risk of being labeled a freak, phony, or worse, and of being ostracized. In spite of this, some thing extremely vital would be missing if you did not continue to explore and investigat e. In the unacc ountable \"low\" periods when you cannot produce this activity no mat ter how care fully you try, you realize this deeply. You have a strong sense of being left out of things, of the shutting out of a source of great meaning to living. Here, then, is the best written descri ption I can give of the technique of developing the non-physical experie nce. THE FEAR BARRIER There is one great obsta cle to the investigation of the Sec ond Body and the"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"environment in which it operates. Per haps it is the only major barrier. It see ms to be present in all people, without excepti on. It may be hidden by layers of inhibition and conditioning, but when these are stripped away, the obstacle remains. This is the barrier o f blind, un reasoning fear. Given only small impetus, it turns to panic, and then to terror. If you consci ously pass the fear barrier, you will have passe d a milesto ne in your investigation, I am reason ably sure that this barrier is passe d uncon sciously b y many of us each night. When that part of us be yond our consci ousness takes over, it is not inhibited by fear, although it seems to be influenced by the thought and action of the consci ous mind. It seems to be accusto med to oper at ing beyon d the fear barrier, and understands better the rules of existence in this other world. When the consci ous mind shuts down for the night, this Super Mind (soul?) takes over. The investiga tive process relative to the Second Body and its environment appears to be a melding or blending of the consci ous with this Super Mind. If this is accom plished, the fear barrier is ove rcome. The fear barrier is many-faceted. The most fearless of us think it does not exist, until, much to our own surprise, we encounter it within ourselves. First and foremost, there is the death fear. Because separation from the physical body is muc h like what is expecte d at death, early reactions to the exper ience are automatic. You think, \"Get back in the phys ical, quickl y! You are dying! Lif e is there, in the physical; get back in!\" These reactio ns appear in spite of any inte llectual or emo tional training. Only after repeating the process eighteen to twenty times did I finally gather enough courage (and curi osity) to stay out more than a few secon ds and observe ob jectively. The death fear was either sublimated or assua ged by familiarity. Others who have tried the techn ique have stopped after the first or second experience, unable to sup press this first asp ect of the barrier. The secon d aspect of the fear barrier is a lso linked with the death fear: will I be able to return to the physical or to get back \"in.\" With no guidelines or specific instructio ns, this remained a prime fear of mine for several years, until I found a simple answer tha t made it work every time. Mine was a matter of rationa lization. I had been \"out\" several hundred times, and the evidence showed that I was abl e to return safely one way or another. Therefore, the probability wa s that I would return safely the next time also. The third basic fear was fear of the unknown. The rules and dangers of our physical environment can be determined to a reaso nable degree. We have spent our lifetime building up reflexes to cope with them. Now, suddenly, here is an other, compl etely different set of rules, another world of en tirely different possibilities, populated by beings who seem to know all of them. You have no rule book, no road map, no book of etiquette, no applicable courses in physics and chem istry, no incontrovertible authority y ou can turn to for advice and answers. Man y a missio nary has been lulled in a remot e land under just such conditi ons! I must confess that this third fear still cr ops up, and with justification. The unknown is still to a great degree un known. Such penetration as I have made has brought forth pitifully few unalt erable and consistent rules, I can say only that, to date, I have survived these exped itions. There is so much that I do not compr ehend or understand, and more that is beyond my ability to do so. Another fear is the consequent effects on the physical body as well as on the"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"consci ous mind of particip ation and exper i mentation in this form of activity. This too is very real, as our histo ry, at least to my knowledge, does not seem to con tain accurat e reporting of this area. We have studies on paranoia, schizophrenia, phobias, epilepsy, alcoh olism, sleepi ng sickness, acne, virus dise ases, etc., but no assem bled body of objective data on the pathology of the Second Body. I do not know ho w to circumvent the fear barrier, except by cautious initial steps that create familiarity bit by bit as you proce ed. I hope this writing in its entirety will provide the psychological \"step\" over the barrier. It may help to rec ognize conditions and patterns that are familiar in that at least one perso n has had similar experie nces and survived. The following are the necessary proced ural developments. 1. REL AXATION The ability to relax is the first prerequisite, perhaps even the first step itself. It is deliberately generated, and is bot h physical and mental. Included with the condition of relaxa tion must be the relief from any sens e of time urgency. You cannot be in a hurry. No pending appointments or antici pated calls for your services or attention must clutter up your thoughts. Impatience of any sort can effectively stifle your prospects for success. There are many tech niques available for obtaining this kind of relaxatio n, and a number of good books cover the subje ct Simply select the method that works best for you. There are three general methods that seem to work, two of which are applicable in these exercises. Auto- or sel f-hypnosis. Most sel f-study books offer this method in different versions. Again, it is a matter of which is most effective for you individually. The most efficient and speediest way is to learn self-hypnosis through the training of an experienced hypnotist. He can set up posthypnotic suggestio n that will bring immediate results. However, select a tutor with care. Responsible practitioners are rare, and neophytes numerous. Forms of meditation can be conver ted to effective relaxation. Borderl and sleep state. This is per haps the easiest and most natural method and usually ensures relaxat ion of both body and mind simulta neously. The difficulty he re lies in the maintenance of that delicate \"edge\" between sleep and complete wakefulness. AH too often, you simply fall aslee p— and that ends the experime nt for the moment. By practice, conscio us awareness can be taken up to this borderland state, into it, and through it, to your desti nation. There is no way to achieve it that I know of other than prac tice. The technique is as follows: he down, preferably when you are tired and sleepy. As you beco me relaxed and start to drift off into sleep , hold your ment al attention on something, anything, with your eyes closed. Once you can hold the bor - derland state indefinitely without falling aslee p, you have passed the first stage. It is, however, a normal pattern to fall asleep many times in the process of this consci ousness deep ening. You will not be able to help yoursel f, but do not let this discourage you. It is not an overnight process. You will know y ou are success ful when you become bored and ex pect some thing more to happen I If attem pts to remain at the borderland state make you nervous, this too is a normal reactio n. The consci ous mind seems to resent sharing the authority it has during wakeful-ness. If this occur s, break the relaxation, get up and walk around, exercise, and lie down again. If this does not relieve the nervousness, go to sleep and try"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"another time. You are just not in the mood. When your \"fixative,\" the picture thoug ht you have been holding, slips away and you find yourself thinking of some thing else, you are close to com pletion of Condition A. Once you have achieved Cond ition A—th e ability to hold calmly in the borderland state indefinitely with your mind on an exclusi ve thought—you are ready f or the next step. Conditi on B is similar, but with the concentration elimi nated. Do not think of anything, but remain poised betwee n wakefulness and sleep. Simply look through your close d eyes at the blackness ahead of you. Do nothing more. After a number of these exercises, you may hallucinate \"mind pictures,\" or light patterns. These seem to have no great sig nificance, and may m erely be forms of neural discharge. I can remem ber, for examp le, attempting to achieve this sta te after watching a football game on TV for several hours. All I saw were mind pictur es of football players tackling, running, pass ing, etc. It took at least a half hour for the pattern to fade away. These mind pictures are apparently related to your visual concentration in the preceding eight or ten hours. The more intense the concentration, the longer it seems to take to elimi nate the impressions. You have accom plished Condition B when you are able to lie indefinitely after the impressi ons have faded away, with no nervo usness, and seeing nothing but blackness. Condition C is a systematic deepening of consci ousness while in the B state. This is approached by caref ully letting go of your rigid hold on the borderland sleep edge and drift ing deeper little by little during each exercise. You will learn to esta blish degrees, of this deepening of consci ousness by \"going down\" to a given level and returning at will. You will recognize th ese degrees by the shutting down of various sen sory mechanism inputs. The sense of touch apparently goes first. You seem to have no feeling in any part of your bo dy. Smell and taste soon follow. The auditory signals are next, an d the last to fade out is vision. (Sometimes the last two are reversed; I susp ect that the reason for vision being last is that the exercise calls for the use of the visual network, even in blackness.) Condition D is the achievement of C when one is fully rested and refres hed, rather than tired and sleepy, at the begin ning of the exercise. This is quite important, and not nearly as easy to achieve as it is to write abo ut. To enter the relaxation state full of energy and wakefulness is great insur ance for maintaining conscio us control. The best approach to take in the early attempts at the Condition D exercise is to start i t immediately after you wake up from a nap or a night's sleep. Start the exercise before you move around in bed physi cally, while your body is still relaxed from sleep and your mind is fully alert. Don't take too many liquids before sleep ing, and you won't have the imme diate need to empty your bladder upon awakening. Induction by drugs. None of the relaxatio n-producing drugs that are readily a vailable seem to help. Barbiturates force a loss of conscious control and only bring a confused state in deeper consciousness. The same is true, to a lesser degree, of tranquilizers . Relaxation is obtained, but at the cost of perception. Alcohol in any form brings similar effects. More exotic compounds such as the alkaloids and halluci - nogens may be more productive, I have not had enough experi ence or contact with these to offer an opinion or even an educated guess. It would seem that far-reaching research is indic ated for these . I have utilized all three methods, and rejected drug re laxatio n quite early as it resulte d in both too much loss of conscio us control and distorte d perception. In the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"first tech nique, hypnotic induction tapes were specially prep ared for the experim ents. They were quite useful and effective. The borderland sleep state techniques have been employed most often. In spite of the complicated-sounding procedure, it is the most natural method for me. 2. STATE OF VI BRATION The generation of this effect is the most critical of all. The subjective sensory impressi on it creates is describ ed else where. Once it is ach ieved, you will certainly not have to be told you've been success ful, and you will have passed another major hurdle. All that can be given are clues. At the present level of knowledg e, it is not known why these things work. It is m uch like turning a switch to obtain light without having any idea of what the switch does, where the electr icity comes from, or why and how it acts upon a bulb enclosing tungsten fila ments. At the least, all of the material contained herein has been established as empirically as possible. Aside from the princi pal human laboratory—this writer—several other individu als have tried the pattern. Suffice it to say that they have ob tained positive results. Aids to the vibrational state. Lie down, in whatever p o sition is most conducive to your state of relaxation, but with your body along a north-south axis, w ith your hea d to mag netic north. Loosen any clothe s you may be wearing. Keep covered so that you feel just slig htly wanner than is generally comf ortable for you. Remove any jewelry or metal objects close to or touching your skin. Be sure that your arms, legs, a nd neck will relax in a position that will not impede circula tion. Darken the room enough to ensure that no light can be seen through your eyelids. Do not use a comp letely blacked-out room, as you will then have no visual point of reference. Absolute requisites. Ensure without question that you will not be disturbed in any way, either by direct physical inter vention, a phone ringing , or other interrupting noises. Do not set a time limit or a deadline. The time you spend in the experim ent is not more valuably spe nt elsewhere and you should have nothing impending that might cut short this activity. Achieve the state of relaxati on. Do this by whatever m ethod you have found workable in your own individu al case. Work to Condition D or its equi valent , and hold at the deep est level of relaxation possible without weaken ing your con scious ness. When you have taken as much time as you need to be sure you have obtained this, mentally repeat, \"I will consci ously perceive and remember all that I encounter dur ing this relaxatio n period. I will recall in detail when I am completely awake only th ose matters that will be beneficial to my physical and mental being.\" Say this mentally five times. Then begin breathi ng through your hal f-opened mouth. Establish the vibration waves. As you continue breathing through your hal f-opened mouth, concentrate on the black ness in front of your closed eyes. Look first into the blackness at a spot a foot away from your forehead. Now move your poi nt of conce ntration to three feet away, and then six feet. Hold for a while until the point is firmly estab lished. From there, turn the point 90° upward, on a line parallel to the body axis an d reaching out above the head. Reach for the vibrations at that spot. When you find them, mentally pull them back into your head. This simple descripti on must pose many questio ns. Reach out with what? Pull -what back into your head? Let us try another method of explan ation. Begin a mental"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"conce ntra tion, as if two lines were exten ding from the outer sides of your closed eyes. Think of them as conver ging at a point a foot away from your forehead. Visual ize a resistan ce or pres sure when these two lines meet, as if two charged electric wires were joined , or pol es of a magnet forced together. Now exten d this juncture outward to about three feet, or the length of your arm outstretch ed. Due to the angular differ ence, the pressure pattern is altered. A comp ression of the space (forces?) between the converg ing lines must result, and the pressure must therefore increas e to maintain the conver gence. After the three-foot length has been establ ished and held, extend the intersection point out to six feet away from your head, or 30°. (So that you can properly v isualize the exact angle that represe nts 30°, it may hel p to mark off a 30° angle by protractor on paper and memorize bow it looks.) Once you have learned to establish and maintain the 30° angle outward (or roughl y six feet away), bend the point of intersection 90° (or in an \"L\") upward in the direction of your he ad but parallel to the axis of your body. You \"reach\" with this point of intersecti on. Stretch or reach with this point more and more, until you obtai n a reactio n. Again, you will know w hen you obtain it It is a s if a surging, hissing, rhythmically pu lsating wave of fiery sparks com es roaring i nto your head. From there it seems to sweep through out your body, making it rigid and immobile. Once you have learned the process, or the concept, it will not be necessary to go through the entire routin e. You need only to think of the vibrations while in a relaxed state, and they come into being. A conditioned reflex has been estab lished, or a neuron path that can be followed again and again, Again, it is not a techn ique that can be achieved the first time it is tried. The probability of success increas es with each suc cessive effort. The more often you attempt it, the more likely you are to have positive results. However, once you have suc ceeded, it is not always repeatable at will. There are still ma ny variables that interfere which have yet to be isolated and identified. But it does \"work\" often enough to be sub ject to continued study. 3. CONTROL OF VIBR ATIONS When you have obtained the vibrational state, there are definite guide lines to follow. The utiliza tion of this condition under consci ous control is the goal you are seeking. To ac complish this, there are careful proce dures to observe. They should, of course, be followed in sequenc e, in the order pre sented. There is no evidenc e to indicate that this vibrational state has a deleterious effect on either the mind or the physical body. Here, then, are some procedures that can be applied systematically. They are a distillate of literally hundreds of trial-and- error experim ents. Acclima tization and accomm odation. This is a way of say ing that you shou ld let yourself get accu stomed to the feel of this un usual condition. All fear and panic must be elimi nated when you feel waves like an electric shock without pain permeating your bod y. The best method seems to be to do nothing when they occur. Lie quietly and objectively ana lyze them until they fade away of their own accord. This usually takes place in about five minutes. After sever al such experie nces, you will realize you are not being electrocu ted. Try to avoid panicky struggling to break the paralytic con - dition. You can break it by sitting up with great force of will, but you will be disappointed with yoursel f for doing so. After all, this wa s what you were trying to"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"achieve. Manip ulation and modulation. Once you have eliminated the fear reactions , you are ready for control steps. First, me n tally \"direct\" the vibrations into a ring, or f orce them all into your he ad. Then mentally push them down along your body to your toe s, then back up to your head. Start them sweeping in a wave over your bo dy rhythmically, from head to toes and then back again. After you have given the wave momen tum, let it proce ed of its own accord until it fades away. It sho uld take about ten secon ds —five down, five back—f or the wave to make the compl ete circuit, from head to toes and back. Practice this until the vibration wave begins instantly upon mental command, and move s stead ily until fade-out. By this time, you will have notice d the \"roughness\" of the vibrations at times, as if your bod y is bei ng severely shak en right down to the molecular or atom ic level. This may be somewhat uncomfortable, and you will feel a desire to \"smooth\" them out. This is accom plished by \"pulsing\" them mentally to increase their frequency. Their original vibratory rate seem s to be on the order of some twenty-seven cycles per secon d (this is the rate of the vibration itself, not the head-to-toe freque ncy). The pattern responds to this pulsing com mand very subtly an d slowly at first. Your first indication of success is when the vibrations no longer seem rough and shaking. You are well on your way to control when they pro duce a steady, solid effect. It is esse ntial that you learn and apply this spee d-up proc ess. The faster vibration effect is the form that permits disass ociation from the physical. Once you have set the momentum of the speed-up, the accelera tion seem s to take place automatically. Eventually, you may sense the vibrations only as they begin. They will increase their frequency—like a motor starting up—u ntil the frequency is so high that you are unable to perceive it. At this phase, the sensory effect is one of body wa rmth, slightly tingling, but not excessively so. Consiste nt achievement of this stage is the sign that you are ready f or the first physical disass ociation experiments. Another word of warning is in order here. Beyond this point, I believe you cannot turn back. Ultimate ly, you will be com mitted to the reality of this other existence. How this will affect your perso nality, your daily lif e, your future, and your phil osophies rests entirely w ith you as an individu al. For onc e you have been \"opened\" to this other reality, you can not comp letely shut it out again, try as you might. The pres sure of material affairs may sublimate it for a time, but it will return. You cannot always stay on guard against its re opening. As you start to sleep or awaken, when you merely relax, the vibrational surge may come without call. You can shut it off, of course, but eventually you become too tired to bother—and you are off on another excursion. You sense that you are fighting against yourself. And who wants to fight one's self—at the price of a good night's sleep !"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"17. THE SEPARATION PROCE SS After you have achieved the state of vibration and some control of your stage of relaxatio n, one additional factor must be considered. It is probable that you have already obt ained it, since it is ordinarily a product of the previous exercises. However, it should be emphasized. This factor is tho ught control. In the state of vibration, you are apparently subject to every thought, both willful and involuntary, that crosses your mind. Thus you must be as close to \"no thought\" or \"single thought\" (concent ration) as possible. If one stray idea passes through your mind, you respo nd instantly, an d sometimes in an undesirable manner. I suspect that one is never completely free of such misdirec tion. At least I have not been, which may acco unt for the many inexplicable trips to places and people I do not know. T hey seem to be triggered by thoughts or ideas I didn 't real ize I had, below the consci ous level. The only approach is to do the best you can. With this in mind, the first practices of disasso ciating the Second from the physical body should be limited in time and action. What follows is designed basically as a familiari zation and orientation technique which should permit an approach to disass ociation without fear or conc ern. Release of extremities. This serves to acquaint you with the sensation of the Second Body without full commitment. After relaxatio n and creation of the vibration state, work with either your right or left hand and arm, one at a time. This is important, as it will be your first affirmation of the reality of the Second. With one hand, reach for any object— floor, wall, doo r, or whatever—that you remember as being beyon d the reach of your physical arm. Reach for that object. Make the reach ing process neither upward nor downward, but out in the direction your arm is pointing. Reach as if you were stretching your arm, not raising or l owering it. A variation is sim ply to reach out with the hand and arm in the same man ner with no special object in mind. Often this method is better, as you then have no preconceived idea of what you will \"feel.\" When you reach out in this fas hion and feel nothing, push your hand a little farther. Keep pushing gently, as if stretch ing your arm, until your hand encounters some material ob ject. If the vibration pattern is in effect, it will work, and your hand will eventually feel or touc h something. When it does, examin e with your sense of touch the physical details of the object. Feel for any c racks, grooves, or unusual details which you will later be able to identify. At this point, nothing will seem unusual. Your sensory mec hanisms will tell you that you are touching the object with your physical hand. Here, then, is your first test . After acquainting yoursel f with the object with your outstretch ed hand, straighten out your ha nd and push against the object with your fingertips. You will encounter resistance at first. Push a little harder, and gently overcome the resistan ce you feel. At this point, your ha nd will seem to go right through the object. Keep pushi ng until your han d is compl etely through the object and meets some other physical object. Identify the secon d object by touch. Then carefully withdraw y our hand, back through the first object, and slowly back to normal, so that it feels as if it is where it \"belongs.\" With this, decre ase the vibrations. The best way to do this is slowly to attempt to move the physical body. Think of the physical body, an d open your physical eyes. Bring back your physical senses, deliberately. Once the vibrations have faded away com pletely, lie still for a few minutes for full and"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"compl ete return. Then get up and make a notation of the object which you \"felt,\" locating it relative to the positio n of your ha nd and arm when you were lying down. Note the details of both the first and secon d objects which you felt. Having done this, compare your de scription with the actual first object Make special note of small details which you could not have seen from a distance. Physicall y feel the object to compare it with what you felt under the vibrations. Exami ne the second object in the same manner. You may not have been consci ously aware of its presenc e or position prior to the experim ent. This too is import ant Test the line of direction from the place where your physical hand lay, through the first object and up to the secon d. Is it a straight line? Check your results. Was the first object you touched physi cally locate d at a distanc e it would have been absolutely im possible to reach without physical move ment? Did the details of the object—es pecially the minute details—co incide with the notes you have made? Make the same comparison for the second object. If your answers are affirmative, you have had your first suc cess. If the facts do not check out, try again another day. Almost without qualification, if you have produced the vibra tional state, you can perform this exercise. You can also practice the following quite easily. After pro ducing the vibrational state, lying on your back, arms either at your sides or on your chest, gently lift your arms without looking at them and touch your fingers together. Do this quite casually, abstracte dly, and remember the sensory re sults. Once you have clasped your han ds above your chest, look at them first with your closed eyes. If you have moved easily enough, you will see both physical and non-physical arms. Your physical arms will be at rest at your sides or upon your chest. The sensory impressions will be with the non-physical arms and hands above your physical body. You should test this phenomenon as many times as you wish, however you desire. Prove to yoursel f that you are moving not your physical arms, but something else. Do it by what ever means are necess ary to give you f ull assurance of this reality. It is imp ortant always to return your non-physical arms to full conju nction with their physical counterparts before \"shutting off\" the vibration state. Although there may be no severe aftereffect if this is not done, I think it best not to find out in the early stages. Disassoci ation technique. The simplest method to use in separ ating from the physical is the \"lift-out\" procedure. The intent here is not to travel to far-off places , but to get ac quaint ed with the sensation in your own room, with familiar surroundings. The reason for this is that the first true expe rience will then be examin ed and explor ed with identifiable points of reference. In order to assist in this orient ation, it is bett er that these first complete disass ociation exercises be conducted during daylight. Test for yourself your needs in regard to the amount of light in the room. Avoid using an electric light if possible. To establish the condition, achieve the vibrational state, and maintain complete control of your thought proce sses. You are going to stay only in the confines of your familiar room. Think of getting lighter, of floating upward, of how n ice it would be to float upward. Be sure to think how nice it would be, as the subject ive associ ated thought is most important. You want to do this because it is somet hing you will respond to emotionally; you react even before the act, in anticipation. If you continue to hold only these thoug hts, you will disassociate and float gently upward from your physical. You may not achieve it the first time , or the secon d. But quite surely, if you"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"have accom plished the prece ding exer cises, you will achieve it. A second method is the \"rotation\" technique, which has been mentioned elsewhere. Under the same prescribed con ditions, slowly try to turn over, just as if you were turning over in bed to be more comfortable. Make no attempt to help yoursel f rotate with eith er arms or legs. Star t turning by twisting the top of your bo dy, your he ad and shoulders, first. By all means move slowly, exert ing gentle but firm pres sure. If you do not, you may beco me loose and actua lly spin like a log rolling in water before you can alter the pressure. Such action is disconcerting only b ecause you may lose all orientation and be forced to find your way back carefully in rotatio n juncture. The ease with which you begin to turn, with no friction or sense of weight, will inform you that you have begun to succee d in disassoci ating. As this happens, turn slowly until you feel that you have moved 180° (i.e., face to face with your physical body). It is unca nny how you will recogni ze this position. This 180° about face is merely t wo 90° turns, and without orientation, it is easy t o sense , Once you are in the 180° position, stop the rotation merely b y thinki ng of doing so. Without hesitat ion, think of floating upward, backing up away from the physical body. Again, if you have reach ed the vibrational state success fully, this met hod will surely bring results. Of the two separ ation techniqu es, the first should be tried before the secon d. Then, after both have been exami ned and tested, the one that seems easiest to you should be utilized. Local experim ents and familiarization. Once you have suc ceeded in the separation process, it is most important for your own object ive continuity that you remain in comp lete control. The only possi ble way to do this seems to be by staying close to the physical in the early stages. Whatever you may feel emotionally, keep in close proximit y to the physical. This admonition is ma de not because of any kno wn danger, but so that you will maintain a step-by-step familiarity and thus perceive for yoursel f exactl y what is taking place. Wild, uncontrolled trips at this stage may well produce uncom fortable situatio ns and conditi ons that will force you to re-learn much of what you have already achieve d. The process of mental acclimation will be different from any yo u have ever consci ously experienced The gradual adaptation will greatly enhance your peace of mind and confidence. At this point, the principal exercise is to return. Keep your sep aration distance no more than three feet away, hovering over the physical. Do not make any att empt at this time to move laterally or farth er \"up.\" How do you know how far away you are? Again, this is some thing you sense. Your vi sion now is z ero. You have conditioned yourself not to open your eyes, and let them remai n closed for the moment. Stay close to the physical. The mental concept of this will keep you in proper range."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"For the next three or four exercises, do nothing but prac tice getting \"out\" and returning to the physical. To return under these conditions, merely \"thi nk\" yourself back into the physical, and you will return. If you have used the first method of separation, the reintegration is relati vely simple. When you are back in exact alignme nt, you will be able to move any portio n of the physical body and reactivate any or all of your physical senses. Each time you return, open your physical eyes and physically sit up so that you know yo u are comp letely \"back together.\" This is to ensure orientation, to instill confidence that you can return at will, and most im - portant, to assure yourself of continued contact with the ma terial world in which you now belo ng. Whatever you believe, this reassuranc e is most necessary. If you have applied the rotatio n method, move slowly back toward the physical, again by thinking of it, and when you feel you have made complete conta ct, start y our rotatio n back 180° to conjunction with the physical. It see ms to make no difference whether you contin ue the circle of rotatio n or reverse and turn back in a motion opposite to that which helped you release. In both techniques, there seems to be a slight, clicklike jerk whe n you are again in conjunc tion with the physical. An exact descriptio n of this sensa tion is quite difficult, but you will recogni ze it. Always wait a few moments before sitting up after you have returne d, primarily to avoid any p ossible uneasiness. Give yoursel f some time to readjust to the physi cal environment. The physical act of sitting up provides evi dence of continuity in a demonstrable form; you will know that you can consci ously, w illfully act in a physical movement interspersed with experim ents in the non-physical environ ment and retain conscious awaren ess through out the process. You will have completed the cycle when you are able to separate, return to the physical, sit up and note the time, go back to the separ ation process, and return to the physical a secon d time, all without loss of conscio us contin uity. The notation of the clock reading will help in this. The next step in familiarization is to separ ate to a slightly farther distance, applying the same proce dures. Any dista nce up to ten feet will do. Always keep mental conce ntration on a single purpos e without stray thought patter ns, especially in these extend ed exercises. After you have become accus tomed to the feeling of being more \"apart,\" mentally tell yourself that you can see. Do not think of the act of opening your eyes, as this may we ll transm it you to the physical and diminish the vibrational state. Instead, think of seeing, that you can see—and you will see. There will be no sensati on of eye opening. The blackness will just disa ppear suddenly. At first, your seeing maybe dim, as if in half-light, indistinc t or myopic. It is no t known at prese nt why this is so, but with use, your vision will become more sharp. The first sight of your physical body lying below y ou should not be unnerving i f you have applied the previous exercises. After you are satisfied that it is \"you\" lying there, visually exam ine the room from the perspective of your po sition. Mentally move slightly in one directio n or ano ther, slowly and never v iolently. Move your arms and legs to reas sure yoursel f of your mob ility. Roll around and cavort in the new element if you wish, always stayi ng within the prescribed range of the physical. At this stage, you may be filled with strong desires which can be almost overwhelming. This is the greatest problem you may f ace at the moment. These desires, appearing un announced and unexpect edly, are subjective and emotional, and can easily sub merge the deductive reasoning positio n you have built up so carefully. T he most important clue is to understand that they must not be labeled evil"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"or wrong. They simply exist, an d you must learn to cope with them. The rule is do not deny the existence of these desires. Recog nize them as a deep, integral part of you that cannot be \"thought\" away. Until you do this, you will be unable to control them. These desires include freedom (to revel in the release from physical limitati ons and gravitational effects), sexual contact (first w ith a loved one, then at a strictly sensory level), reli gious ecstasy (varying, base d upon the intensity o f early life conditioning), and others that may originate in unusual en vironme ntal experiences of the individual. The belief held here is that everyone will have these subjective desires despite the most stringent discipline and self-analysis. What we speak of are those elements far below surf ace consci ousness that comprise your own fundamental charact er and personality. As has been explai ned earlier, these elements emerge because you are no longer just a consci ous, intellectual self. You are, perhaps for the first time, an entirety. E very part of you will be heard from and must be considered in any action you take. The trick is to keep the conscious, reason ing you (the one most cognizant of the physical world) in a dominant posi tion. It isn't easy. Therefore, you will run into problems if you attempt a denial of self. Instead, you must accep t these sometimes surprising drives for what they are—a part of you— and go on about your business. You cannot eliminate them, but you can set them aside for the moment. Offer the promise of future fulfillment, and you will have no resistanc e. These needs can understand diversion, as they have been subje cted to it for as long as you have lived! When you have reasonably dealt with these other parts of you, and have demonstrated this to your satisfaction five to seven times in a near-sep aration condition (in the same room at close vicinity), you are ready fo r more distant and specific voyages. All of the foregoing presum es that you have over come most of the fears you have encountered up to this stage. If you have not, repeat the exercises which produce fear until familiarity washes it away. Infallible return signal. As note d, the fear of being unable to re-enter the physical is a basic deterrent to leaving the body. In my early experimentation, I encountered this prob lem many times. Happily, a solution was found whenever this difficulty presented itself. After careful analysis o f hun dreds of tests, an infallible techn ique was evolved. The only g uarantee that can be given is that it has continued to work for me. First, if you have difficulty, do n't panic. Above all, keep your rationa l thought process es dominant. Terror only ag gravates the situation. Intern alize this simple formula, and call upon it: to return to the physical from wherever you are, think of your physical body. Mentally b egin to move some part of your physical body. Move a finger or a toe. Physicall y take a deep, deliberate breath of air. React ivate your five physical senses, or any on e of them. Move your jaw. Swallow, or m ove your tongue. Any act that must involve physical motion or use of physical energ y will work. If one doesn't immediately take effect, try another. Without question, some such thought action will bring y ou back into the physical. It is me rely a question of which one works best with you. When this technique is applied, return is virtually imme diate. It is an automatic directio n finder and rocket blast combined. Reintegration seems to be instantaneous when this is used . However, this immediate-return method elimi nates your power of choice or decision. Once it is pu t into effect, you cannot stop it. You will return to the physical without any opp ortunity to know what is happening, and how it is taking place. Thus it shou ld be thought of as an emergency reserve m easure rather than a"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"consiste nt step in your met hodology. Under ordinary conditions, you should think of or feel the direct ion and location of your physical body. Then, with no urgency and in a calm, willful manner, start to return. The mechanics of movement. Now that you have set up the proper controls, including the emergency return signal, you are ready for the most momentous step of all: to \"go\" to a distant point and return. It is def initely not advisabl e deliberately to attempt this exercise before you have com pleted all previous tests and are at ease with them. It is q uite possible that you may have inadvertently gone to a distant point during the early stages. If this is the case, you can rec ognize the importance of following a procedure. First, set your \"aiming point\" Remember the rule: you must \"go\" to a perso n, not to a place. It may be possible to achi eve the latter if you have a deep emotional attach - ment to the locale, but the experiments to date have shown little success along this line. This, of course, may be due to the personality of the writer. Select the perso n (living) whom you desire to visit. Choose someone you know quite well. Do not inform this perso n that you are making the test This is most important so as to rule out any sugg estion on his or her part Make this selec tion before you enter the vibrational state and before you start y our relaxation process. Establish relaxation and the vibrational state. Use your chos en method to separate. Move away to near distanc e, six or seven feet from the physical. With your vision still in \"black ness,\" cautiously \"think\" of the person whom you plan to visit. Think not only of the name, but of the perso nality and character of the person. Do not try to visualize a physical being, for it is the reflection of the inner person that will attract you, rather than the physical attributes. As you think in this patter n, turn yourself around slowly in a 360° rotation. Somewhere in the circuit, you will \"feel\" the right direction. It is an intuitive thing, a sureness that attracts you like a gentle magn et. Even so, you can check for verification. Go past this point in your turn, and come back to it. Again, you will sens e it very strongly. Stop , facing this directio n. Think that you have vision, and begin to see. To give yoursel f motion toward your desti nation, employ a total Second Body version of the \"stretch, \" which you prac ticed in your first exercise with hand and arm. The easiest method is to plac e your no n-physical arms over your head, thumbs latched togeth er like a diver about to plunge into water. With your arms in this positi on, think of the person you wish to visit and stretch your body in that direction . You may move fast or slowly, depending upon the effort of this stretching action. The harder you \"stretch,\" the faster you go. At your dest ination, you will automatically stop stretch ing without realizing it To return, apply a similar method. Think of your physical body, reach out and stretch, and you will return promptly. Usua lly no more is required than this. There is some specu lation regarding the necessity o f keeping your arms in the diver's positio n. Originally, it was assu med that this stance would break a path or wa rd off any encountered objects with the hands rather than the head. It does help create the stretching action better than keeping the arms at the sides. There you have it. The foregoing may seem ritualistic, but it is not intended to.

Was there some avenue or ap proach that made sense? The best answer seem ed to lie in data analysis. This preclu ded use of the undergrou nd, the only a rea that considered or acce pted my \"problem\" as some thing beyon d hallucination, since much of the undergroun d data dealt principa lly in vague generaliti es. I wan ted specifics. I reason ed that there must be some way to organize the conflicting data I was accum ulating. So I began to extrapolate sound possibilities and probabilities from what was known. The accep ted method is to keep one foot in the light and on solid rock as you step cautiously ont o dark, shifting grounds. The known data were sequenc e of events, symptoms, and results. The sum of my experie nce and experimentation fell easily into four chronological stages. PRELIMINARY STAGE This includes all events and activities prior to the symptom of solar plexus cramp describ ed earlier. Early life patterns dis closed two inst ances of unexplained paradoxes that seemed relevant to this research. The first incident occurred when I was eight years old. I reported to my parents a dream in which I sat in a room paneled in red-bro wn wood. In one corner was a cabinet from which came music and voices, which looked much like a vic-trola. In the front of the cabinet was a window, and there were movi ng pictures in the window. Th e voices from the cabinet matched what the people in the window seem ed to be saying. It w as like the moving pictur es shown at school except that the people's words were heard rather than spelled out on the screen. Also, the moving picture in the cabinet was color ed just as people and things really were. (Thirty years later I sat in a mahogany-paneled room and watched color television for the first time .) As best as can be recalled, I had never seen any color motio n pictures at the age when the dream took place . The secon d unusual event happened at the high school level at about age fifteen. On a given Friday night, I had been looking forward expect antly to a parry the next night I had estim ated that my cash requirem ents for the coming event were two dollars. The problem was to find a source for the two dollars before Saturday night. There had been no work available during the week to earn the money. For one reason or another, my parents had been exhausted as a resource. No prosp ect for work on Saturday was in sight. I went to bed Friday night worrying over this immediate proble m. Upon awakening Satur day morning, I had an immediate vivid conviction that two dollars were under an old plank lying outside on the ground beside the house. I knew of the existenc e of the plank, as it had been there for some time. However, I dismiss ed the idea as a wishful dream and went down to breakf ast. After eating, still preocc upied with the dire financial prob lem, I thought again of the board and the two dollars under it. Idly, in order to dismiss the idea, I went outsid e and around the house to where the plank lay on the ground. It looke d undisturbed, half-covered with dirt and leaves. It was impossible that someone could have inadvertently \"lost \" some money or place d it und er the board. Still, as long as I was there, it wouldn't hurt to look just to get rid of the compulsion. I pulle d at the plank and raised it upward. There were hundreds of ants and bugs on"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"the damp dirt un derneath, run ning frantically in all directions . Also on the wet earth, in the center of the area where the board had lain, were two folded, crisp, dry one- dollar bills. I did not stop to consider how the money happened to be under the board. I made no mention of the incident at the time, except to a friend. I was too concer ned that someone might claim the money. The problem for the night was solve d. The incide nt had been forgotten completely until recalle d under the personal history search. There was nothing more. No great traumas, just a basic Americ an upbringing in a scholastic family. In view of the fact that it was a \"mental\" problem, psychiatry seemed to be the answer. Still, no outward evidence of the strong repres sions, compulsions, anxieties, and/or phobias which normally show up in mental illness could be found. Close exam ination of the events leading up to the first out-of-the-body symptom (the severe cramps) brings to light several factors which deserve consideration. In the year im mediately preceding the first incide nt, there was only one relatively unus ual physiological change. During that year I ha d seven lower teeth capped in a rather lengthy den tal process. This was exam ined in detail in relation to the later symptom of \"tuning\" the Second State conditi on by movements of the jaw. It is p ossible that the bits of assorte d metal comprisi ng part of the tooth-capping fabri cation acted electrically or in some other fashion on the brain. This still remai ns an unexp lored possibility. Physicists, physiologists, and electr onics specialists have no theory relat ing to this. Proper research could prove or disprove the hypot hesis. There are hundreds of thousands of people walk ing around with bits of metal in their teeth, and other such incidents have been reported . A survey might prove inter esting . There were no other physiological changes significant enough to be recalled consci ously. The only ab ove-ordinary nu tritional factor was that of vitamin intake. Since my wife believed strongly in nutritio n, daily do sages of vitamins A, B complex, C, and E, plus mineral tablets, had been a norm for sever al years. Again, a cumul ative effect could have been the cause, but no reports or rese arch studies indicated any factors resembli ng the Second State. Other than this, a normal diet was the rule, with no major changes for five years at the least. At the psychological and physical activity levels, there is mu ch to be noted. It is q uite conce ivable that the causes of the phenomenon lie here. The first consideration might be termed the anesthesia episo de, which took place some six mon ths prior t o the first symptom. The beginni ng came when I noticed an unusual \"heady\" effect from the fumes of a gallon can of contac t cement. I was installi ng a cubbyh ole desk top in the wall of a bedroom at home when I beca me aware of the sensation. The can clearly state d on the lid that the cement should be used in well-ventilat ed areas. I correctly assu med that this was a fire-hazard warning from the manufacturers. The sensa tion reminded me of the strange effect I had ex perienced in the past just as I was \"going under\" from anes thesia. Curious, I experimented with the effect of the fumes a number of times in the following month, with very signifi cant results. Upon learning that the fuming agents were toluol (a com mon comm ercial hydrocar bon detergent) and acetone (once used as anesthetic), 1 made several experi ments with the subjective effects of light anesthesia, utiliz ing a less v olatile and relative ly safe inhalant, Trilene. In retrospec t, the results of these exper iments seem"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"to parall el closely the reports of those who have undertaken the LSD exper ience. Intensely vital and not at all unpleasant, the effects may well have triggered an inner desire or nee d for experiences beyon d those I had had to that date. Relucta ntly, I stopped the experiments, as there seem ed inherent dangers of physiological side effects if they were con tinued. Although I had set up rigid controls, there was no certainty that they would always work. However, I did find out some interesting facts about anesthesia to satisfy my curiosit y. In Ireland, it seem s, ether was sold by the spoonful by peddlers who ladled it out at streetside each morning. In the early days, medic al stude nts often had \"ether parties,\" much like the parties of the \"black market\" LSD users today. Doctors have reported that ether addiction has been quite common through the years. Cap tains of gasolin e tankers have problems with a seagoing version of the wino. When signed on as crew, these men appear compl etely nor mal, until they are found unconscious alongside a cargo vent. I understand they are labeled \"sniffers.\" Further, I learn ed the relationship between alcohol and other anesthetics. Any anesthetic produc es a trail from con scious ness to an unconscious state beyond which is dea th. The job of the anesthetist is to \"put down\" or place the pa tient in a deep unconscious state as quickl y as possible, avoid ing any \"violent\" intermediate condition (which is the area I evidently explor ed). The technique then is to hold the un consci ous patient just above death. The major advantage of ether when it was first introduced was that it had fewer pos sible side effects than alcohol and offered greater control of the degree of unconsciousness. The period of conscio usness following a dministration was quite short, and the uncon scious state was quite extend ed before the termin al point (death) was reached. The period of consci ousness following the administration of alcohol, on the other hand, is quite long. When deep un consci ousness is reached, the distance to the termin al point is muc h shorter. The margin is so narrow that continued ad ministrati on of alcohol to a patient after he has \"pass ed out\" can well cause death. Another fact I discovere d is that archa eological and geo logical studies of the sites of several ancient Greek and Egyptian temples of worship, where many visions and miracles took place, have indicated the probable escape of under ground gases, including nitrous oxide, at and around the particular spot sometime in the past Nitrous oxide is one of the presen t-day ane sthetics, odorless and tasteless. Some three months after this \"drug\" experie nce, which by then was alm ost forgotten, I develo ped an interest in the pos sibilities of data learning during sleep. I do not know what brought about this interest. Perhaps it was an outgrowth of an early academic environment coupled with my immediate observation of the teach ing methods applied in the primary grades to my own children. To explor e the potential of this interest, I made some stud ies of past and present conce pts of the waking-unconscious mind. There was sup porting evidenc e that the unconscious recorde d all sensory inpu t data while awake and asleep. The problem was to introd uce intelligent and organized data during sleep and to provide consci ous recall when desire d. The limited formal research material available showed contra dictory concl usions. Simple reading of data to a sleep ing subject produ ced only fragmentary and erratic results. No comparative studies between induction during de ep (delta) sleep and the dreaming state (now termed REM sleep) had been made. Nor had any att empt been made to create deliberately a receptive sleep state with a Pavlovian type of"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"conditioned reflex induced to bring recall at will. To carry out this resea rch in a conven ient pattern, I made autohypnotic sound recordings to test various approaches to a workable technique. This seemed to be the first logical step, as results had been obtained along similar lines utilizing h yp - notic sleep instea d of the natural sleep state. The reaso n for the use of tape recordings was to depersonalize the technique and to ensur e identical tests amo ng different subje cts. The tapes were designe d for use in a booth isolated from light and sound. The tapes used were deliberately simp le in conte nt. There was a period for induction to create hypnotic sleep. Follow ing this, a series of direction-suggestio n units were incorp orated into a continuing pattern. These varied according to the test and the results desire d. Data learni ng, for exam ple, was conf ined to multiplication tables (from twelve to twenty-four) and to Spanish and French vocabul ary and idiomatic phrases. These were always accom panied by suggestio n of full and complete memory and by post hypnotic suggestio n that recall could be obtained in the consci ous state by a mental-physical cue (such as thinking of the number 555 and tapping fingers on a table five times simultaneously). Each induction tape recording also includ ed a suggestion that the subject would improve both physicall y and mentally. This affirmation was somewhat more than a generality. No details were suggested as to how th is improvement would take place. Yet each functional area of the body—t he nervous, circulatory, gl andular, and digesti ve systems—were to be com pletely \"normal,\" according to the instructions given the subject Both the health and recall suggestions, then, were rein forced with each induction or use of the tape. In light of later incidents, this may have been important Each experi - mental tape was care fully annotated, with every spoken word identically following a prepared script and routine. The tapes closed with a pattern to bring the subject back to complete and normal wakefulness. Suggestio n here was extr emely simpl e and effective, with no elaborate words that might be misinterpreted by the subject. The tapes were playe d to about eleven subje cts, ranging in age from seven to fifty. The results implied a definite potential value, with some improvement in techniques. It must be stated here that I applied the tapes experi mentally first and most frequently to myself. This quite natu rally brought them into the greatest area of suspici on in relation to the out-of-the-body experim entation. All the tapes have been examin ed word by word, sound by sound, and at low background level for clues to a possible later \"effect\" No clues seem evident , yet the suspicion remai ns. Such experimentation termin ated with the appearance of the first symptom. BEGINNING STAGE (Septe mber 1958-July 1959) In the expectation of some correlation between effects, events, characteristics, theories, and conclusions, a sort ing process was instigate d. It soon became evident that three stages had taken place within this period. There may be addi tional stages beyon d the three, but these remain unknown. Both the \"beginning\" and the cutoff point of the Beginning Stage are fairly clear . Effects. The first unexplained effect was the cramp or con striction, as reported earlier. Several weeks later, this was fol lowed by the sensation of a \"ray\" fr om the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"north, with resulta nt catalepsy. Cauti ous experime ntation brought the discernment of the vibration sensa tion. This sensory impres sion was later discovered to be reporte d consiste ntly in the experie nces of spiritualists, occultists, and others in the late nineteenth centu ry. It still is re ferred to casually in much un derground talk. The vibrational sensory effect was the single consiste nt symptom througho ut the Beginning Stage, However, it ap peared to be evolutionary. The early vibrations seemed to be rough, some times accom panied by a visual image of a local ized ring of electr ical \"sparks.\" The freque ncy was on the order of ten cycles per secon d, accordi ng to visual clock-timing. At the conclusion of the Beginning Stage, the fre - quency had increased to approximately eightee n c.p.s., with much less discom fort to the physical body. This effect was induced willfully som e 59 per cent of the time in the latter portions of the period. The secon d effect was the awaren ess of a high-p itched \"hiss\" heard softly yet consta ntly in the aural centers. Once established, it con tinued uninterrupted througho ut the period. An ear specialist diagnos ed this as \"hearing of the blood through the veins.\" Otherw ise, hearing was normal. Separation from the physical body took place approxi mately three months into the period, inadvertently in the first instance. Most sub seque nt incidents were induced de liberately. All took place only when the vibration effect was present. It became easier to create this effect as the period progressed, No other pronounced or repetitive effects were observed. Any physiological results seemed to be restful rather than enervating or debilitating. At this stag e infrequent subse quent physical effects of excitement and stimulation were evident, but not to an extreme degree. These included ac celerated pulse rate, perspirati on, and sexual response. Emotional patterns. For fully hal f of the period, fears of mental and/or physical disability w ere domi nant. These fears were greatly assu aged by consu ltation with and exam ination by medic al and psychiatric authorities. The main subseq uent factor was curiosit y, tempered by strong undercurrents of anxieti es related to undirected and uncharted explorati on of the unknown, possible community and/or familial censure, and the fear of being unable to re turn to the physical body. Sequence of exper imentation. From the first out-of-the-body experi ence, the experim ents ranged from gradual famil iarity of \"local\" separation (ten feet or less) to objective examin ation through partial separation and finally visits into areas of Locale I (present space-time). Metho dology. Means of induci ng the vibrational state were explored, centering chiefly on tape recordings described earlier and methods of producing complete relaxatio n with full con sciousness, the prerequisite for the vibrational state. It was determined that achievement of the vibrational state was relati vely simple once the consci ousness-relaxed condition was esta blished. The evidence of oral breathing as a condition was con firmed. \"Tuning\" of the vibrational state by minu te move ments of the physical jaw proved to be an effective method. It became apparent that separation occurred only during the vibrational state. The techniq ue of separation evolved into a simple uncluttered thought of \"up\" or \"away.\" Suc cessive tests indicated that any n on-physical movem ent in the Second Body was instigate d by desire or thought alone. Problems of controlled movement to"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"predetermined location and unhampered immediate return to the physical body re - mained unsolve d. Conclusions. The following conclus ions were reach ed dur ing this period, (i) There does exist a Second Body inter sperse d or in conju nction with the physical body. (2) The Second Body can move and act independently of the physi cal body. (3) These movem ents and actions can be made partially under the control of the consci ous mind. (4) Some sensory inputs in the Second Body register as they do in the physical, others are beyond translation. (5) Some move ments in the Second Body occur in identical space-time to that of the physical counterpart. MIDDLE STAGE (August 1959-September 1962) Effects. This period is identified as beginni ng with a mild coron ary. There was no evidence of a relationship between experime ntation and the illness, though absence of evidence does not necessarily eliminate this possibility. The vibrational state evolved until it was man ifested only as a sense of warmth in latter portio ns of period. This change resulted from a gradual \"speeding up\" of frequency until single pulsations were not perce ptible. The auditory \"air hiss\" phenomenon continued unchanged throughout the period. Separation from the physical became less procedural and more natural, with only occasi onal re-entry problems. The vibrational state was deliberately induced during daylight hours, and occurred spont aneously late at night. Apparent physiological effects remained the same: no re sulting enervation or debilitation, some stimulation. These were observed most carefully in view of the coronary oc clusion, Emotional patterns. Early in the period, there was some anxiety abo ut possible physiological effects. The inability to control the experience totally at will contrib uted to these fears, which lessened considerably by the middle of the pe riod, due principal ly to the lack of supporting evidence and growing co nfidence. Still present were concerns relating to return-to-physical controls, and the possibility of serious errors through ignoranc e in unknown areas. Sequence of exper imentation. Exten ded visits to Locale I became less frequent, to be replaced by initially inadverten t trips into Locale II. In the latter portion of period, entry into Locale III was discove red and subsequently explored. The intertime state was discove red late in period. Metho dology, \"Cou ntdown\" techniques of relaxation were applied in daylight tests. Late at night, borderl and sleep states were conver ted to the now reco gnizable vibration-warmth condition. Oral breathing became an automatic function, with some further exper iments with \"jaw tuning.\" Separation from the physical body via the 180° (out-of-phase-back-away) meth od proved to be the most effective and reliabl e. Consistent technique of positive return to the physical (K recall) was tested and put into practice. Conclusions, (i) Existence of the Second Body was re affirmed. (2) Loc ale II, with specific characteristics different from those of Locale I, was discovered. (3) The existence of Locale III was hypothesized, with relate d characteristics to Locale I, but in different stages of scientific develo pment. (4) Human person ality survives th e transition of death and continues in Locale II. (5) Communication betwee n human beings can take place above the oral level, in the waking or slee ping state and/or the"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Second State. (6) Some (or most ?) human living physical entities separ ate from the physical body du ring slee p. The reaso n for this is not known. LATER STAGE (October 1962-October 1970) Experime ntation was limite d during this period, due prin cipally to lack of opportunity. Preoccu pation with material affairs took prece dence, with evaluation of previous work as a secondary ef fort Effects. The sense of vibration disappeared completely dur ing the period, evolving into warmth, then to an indefinable \"being.\" Separation from the physical was possib le only in this \"bei ng\" state, with minimal effort. The only physi cal effect noted was a slight feeling of disorientation, headiness, and minor discom fort for some nine hours after a particular ex periment. No specia l experim ent had been performed, and the causes for this are unknown, In the middle of the period, I suffered a thrombus hemor-rhoid believed attributable to an exper ience during an exper i ment some four days p rior to the appearance of the symptom. There was no previous medical history of this physical proble m. Sleep requirements lessened during the period . However, when sleep appeared necess ary, it bec ame imperative to com ply with the need. Non-compl iance brought physical and mental debilitation. As little as five minutes of sleep brought major regeneration. The only o ther significant effect recorded was the occur rence at two separate times of a complete awareness of \"near bi-location.\" This was full consciousness at a level where full sensory awareness of physical surroundings was acti ve, yet the self was \"one notch away.\" On both occasio ns, it required a deliberate decision to integrate compl etely into the physical environment. The effect of remai ning in the \"one notch away\" environment is unknown. The \"air hiss\" sound con tinued. Emotional patterns. The fears found in previous stages were completely dissipated in this period. The most impor tant reason for this was complete confidence in the methods of bringing a bout an imme diate return to the physical when desire d. Furthermor e, the evaluation of previous data brought acceptance of the condition in terms of an evolution rather than deterioration. At the same time, minor concer ns for continued existenc e in the physical body bega n to manifest themselves. Disre gard for physical dangers lessen ed considerably as a result The reaso n for this is not known. Sequence of exper imentation. No preplanned sequen ce was institut ed during the period, due to the exigencies of other matters. Thus experimentation was sporadic and took place only when it was opp ortune. Several strong evidential visits were made to both Locale I and Locale II. Most v isits we re to Local e II, with uns pecified results as related to the physical world (Loca le I). Experim entation on strictly sci - entific grounds began late in the period under controlle d laboratory cond itions. Metho dology, Little attention was given to this area, as two princip al problems remained unsolved. The first problem was the development of deep relaxatio n techniq ues, which were obtained with increasing difficulty. T he second was the chronic problem of controlling the destination point. Vari ous techniqu es were applied, all with indeterminate results. The heart of the difficulty lies in the conflicting desires be tween consci ous mind and superconscious when both are operating at full capac ity.

STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION The first step in making some kind of sense out of this mass of raw data was to set up stand ards for measurement and analysis. Aft er several attempts, it became apparent that only a few of the typical yardsticks coul d be applied. Therefore, assum ptions or premises were made to permit identification in the sorting process, and the conclusions brought forth are only as valid as the premis es on which they are based. The following are the primary assum ptions. 1. VERIDIC AL QUALI TIES OF THE EXPERIMENTER Implie d here is not the experim enter's status in our society , but rather the assessm ent of basic charact eristics of the in dividual involved. However sincere the experim enter may be , credibility must lie within the fundamental perso nality. In my experim ents, I am willing to undergo any addi tional psy chiatric, psychological, and physical examinations in the interests of the develop ment of additional related data. This alone may be sufficient to establish a satisfactory degree of intellectual accept ance. 2. SIMILARI TIES ARE ANALOGOU S Simply state d, this mea ns that the observed condition or action taken has reality by the same stand ards as those applied to its Here-Now physical counterpart. Regardless of any ap parent incompatibility with the present knowledg e and concepts of mankind, the reality of the experi ence is acceptable if it equals, approxima tes, or is sufficiently similar to the conditions of perception and interpret ation normal to the waking p hysical state. 3. PERCE PTION AND INTE RPRETATION The accuracy of these is assum ed to be correct within the limitati ons of the same error-producing factors as are found in the normal waking p hysical state. These factors are con tingent upon environmental training and experie nce, intel lectual quotie nt, and emotional make-up. It must be assum ed that sensory inputs in the Second State, although obviou sly of a different nature, are subject to the same reasoning and rationa l interpretive process. The objective analysis of struc ture and shape identification, of qualification, classi fication, and operation occur in equal relatio nship to the experience and training of the individu al, just as in the normal physical waking state. Further, in perceiving data beyond such exper i ence and training, the mind in the Second State acts under a strong command to identify. In acting on this un equivocal command, it will identify within the limits of experie nce rather than accept the existence or fact of an unknown. In other words, you must assum e that the exper imenter is reporting truthfully. You must assum e that what takes place while in the Second Body is r eal, if it meets the conditions of reality held in the physical, waking world. You must assum e that the mind works similarl y in the Second Body, using different means of seeing, hearing, and feeling, as well as a few new sens es. You must assum e that the mind refuses to accept an unknown element in the Second State, even to the point of incorrect identification. You must assume that the same qualities of human error in perception and interpreta tion are present."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION 243 Given these premises, the sorting an d classi fication of some 589 experim ents over a period of twelve years becomes some what easier. Here are some further conclusions. In dreams, the reaso ning, intellectual process is abse nt Consci ousness as the term is und erstood is not operative. Either participation in events is at the purely reactive or unc ontrollable level, or the re is compl ete non-participa tion as an immo bile observer un able to take deliberate action. Perce ption is limite d to one \"sense,\" or at the most, two. No immediate analytical ability is p resent or utili zed. Associ ative misidentification occurs with all percep tion, and is retained as such in conscio us memory. The Second State is the antithesis of dreaming, just as is the waking state. Recognitio n of \"I am\" conscio usness is presen t. The mind attempts to handle perception in precisely the same manner as it does during full physical consci ousness. Decisions are made and actions are taken based upon percep tion and reasoning. Verification of perce ption can be achieved by deliberate and systematic repeated action. Participation is as fundamental as it is in the waking physical state. Sensory input is not limited to one or two sources. Emotional pat terns are prese nt to a greater extent than in the physical consci ousness, but can be directe d and controll ed to the same degree. If any expe rimental experience did not contain a majorit y of the conditions listed in the Second State categor y, it was considered a dream . The remai ning experiences were again classif ied. Environment was analyzed next in the search for causes. If there was som ething that created the condition, it was very obscure, as illustrate d in the chart.

This does not imply that identical non- physical nerve system equivalents were used in perce ption. At the present stage, there is no evidence to prove or dispr ove a similar structure in the Second State. Nor is there any ap parent explan ation of the low position of the taste and smell senses on the scale, other than that both depend upon physi cal contact with matter itself or particles of matter. However, the sense of touch would seem to have the same limitati on, yet app ears as a prime input source. The answer may be that the latter is operating on some form of radiati on-perception level, or in the case of the individual is more developed than the taste and smell patterns. Movement is con sidered a classi fication because it connotes action rather than passivit y, and seems to be truly a sensory source above and beyond the tradition al five senses, much as the balancing mechanisms in the physical body transmi t signals to the brain independent of supporting or conf licting impulses from other senses. In the physical body, this mechanism may be based upon application of gravita tional and inertial forces, and this may hold true in the Sec ond State as well. Under the \"Other\" classification are types that have no physical counterpart The means of perce ption in the Second State are beyon d the scope of prese nt knowledge or theo ry. The most sound conjecture is that all perception in the Sec ond State is achieved by mea ns of some force in the electro- magnetic spectru m—by direct magn etic fields either receive d or ind uced, or through some force or field yet to be identified —rather than by count erparts of the physical mechanisms. Only by empiric al study in wide multiple source testing could this be determined.

Therefore, if no current scientific theory fits without an inordi nate amount of pushing, pulling, twisting, and squeez ing, it seems reasonable to propound a premise that does seem to work. After all, one can prove that man is noth ing more than a few gallons of tainted water. Only extreme pres sure is needed to fit the phenomenon to the theory. The following premise , unacceptable as it may be to our presen t state of enlighte nment, deserves consideration. No other offers more explan ations and leaves less unanswered.

The basis of the premise is certainly not original here, but its app lication is. Questio n: What happens to the laboratory animal once the experiment is com pleted? In a universe populated with sent ient beings of great vari ety, the planetary environment germinating life follows a typical pattern. The prime requireme nt is a diffusing and restraining shield that envelops the entire planet. When this shield has formed through the normal evolution of planet matter, the fundamental requirem ent for animate life is presen t. The shield is composed of gases and liquids of sufficient density to (1) deflect, filter, and/or conve rt radiation from the parent and nearby stars to a point of tolera nce needed for animate life; and (2) maintain internally generated planetary hea t at an average level within the limits require d for the biochemical process. Once developed, the shield permits only f iltered light and reduc ed radiati on to reach the surface of the planet. Visibility is limite d strictly to nearby objects on the surface, and verti cally to less than one tenth the diameter of the planetary body. No distant stars, mo ons, or other planets can be seen. At most, the indisti nct glow of the parent sun may b e seen occasi onally, moving from horizon to horizon as the planet rotates. In this environment, animate physical life generat es and evolves in a broad ening cycle. Where no such shield has de veloped and remained for a significant period, no animate physical life is present. Where the shield has decayed or drained off into space, life has deteriorated and died unless intellectual knowledge is sufficient to develop and install an artifici al environment. The accep ted premise, then, is that all planetary bo dies fall into two categories, shielded and unshi elded. On the translucently shielded planets, animate physical life may evo lve. The unshielded stay barren, devoid of anything but inorganic matter. Only in very rare instances are there any deviatio ns from this rule. Evolving sent ient life in these condi tions becomes aware of and utilizes first those natural forces directl y perceived. Such forces in the order of percep tion and"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"application are: (1) psionic (creative thought energ y), (2) bioch emical, (3) nuclear, and (4) gravitational. Electromagnetism is em ployed sparingly, and remains more as a by-product of other force applications, much like the smoke from a useful fire. The primary nee ds of these evolving lif e forms are met through develo pment of the psi force. The first of these needs, communication, is an automatic birthright Transmis sion and recepti on of information from individual to individ ual or from one group to another knows no time-spatiality. T hrough experience and education, proficiency is g ained in other applications of psi, such as movement and conversion of matter, direction and control of lesser species, and com munication and associ ation with those in the realms of non-physical matter. As the intelligent life forms develop into societi es and civilizations, the understanding and knowledge of the remai n ing ava ilable forces come quite naturally. Typically, they are the result of the individua l's (and the society's ) desire to be relieved of the tedium of consta nt and continuous use of the psi force. Thus mech anical means are created to produce body nouris hment, to master and control the planetary en vironment, to transport matter, to multiply motion, and even to mod ulate and amplify the psi force. Through the non-matter percep tiveness of psi, the remain ing forc es are quickly adapted and harnessed to these needs. It is probable that at this stage, the society achieves its first rational contact with other societi es beyond the confines of its na tive planet, and with the inhabitants of the non-physical worlds. With this final step to maturity, the social organizatio n is me rged into the infinitely larger whole of intergalactic society. It is no coinci dence that incontrovertible knowledge of the relations hip of the totality to the Creator is the major product of this union. Gone immediately are misdirected fantasies and conject ure. The standards under which intel ligent life may evolve and expan d are woven inextricably int o the rules and laws of energy, and applied with equa l rigor. In the distant past, many of these social organizatio ns had become aware of low- order psi-force emanations from the outer rim of an obscur e galaxy. At first, this phenomenon evoked only minor interest. Both qualitatively and quantit a tively, it seemed to be no more than subintelligent animal transmission. However, an idle technic ian happened to proc ess the raw, incom ing psi noise through a random sorter, out of mild curiosit y. To his surprise, infrequent flashes of ap plied psi appeared on the counter. Intrigued by the oddity, a psi probe was made of the area. As suspect ed, the birth of a new society wa s unfolding. Ex cited by the discover y of such an unusual event, the standard psi communication for new societies was transmitted. Strangely, no reply was recei ved. Successive transmissions brough t the same result. Here indeed was a rarity. An eco logical team was dispatched to investiga te physicall y this anomaly. The researchers discovered the source to be the third planet in a Class 10 star system. As they orbite d the planet itself, measurements and observation indicated that it did not follow the norm for propagation of intelligent life. The gaseous planetary envelop e did not possess the usual un broken, high-f iltration charact eristics. This evidently per mitted unusually large amounts of radiati on to reach the surface, even to the point where the sun was clear ly visible from the surface itself, as well as distan t planets and stars when viewed from the shadowed side. Further, due to high rotatio nal speed and other factors, a magnetic field of great"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"intens ity per vaded the entire planet Tin's, coupled with the unusual radiati on element, appeared to exert profound influences upon the infant societ y. At close range, the psi noise became virtually unbearable. Without equipm ent for shielding or sorting, it beca me impos sible for the group to surface on the planet itself. The psi impressi on was that of raw, unchanneled irrationality, un controlled and non- objective. Yet vi sual observation showed the beginnings of social clusters, matter artifacts, and con quest of environm ent. Luckily, on e member of the visiting g roup had worked ex tensively in the art of personal psi shieldi ng. It was he who of fered to establi sh physical conta ct on the planet itself. This was done while the others waited patiently in a shelter on the planet's barren and brittle satellite. The visit itself proved the inadequacy of his training under extreme conditions. The investiga tor returned a short time later in a state of mental exhau stion. He had, however, been able to make contact at sever al points around the surface. It was true. A new society wa s in the making, but under unimaginable restraints. There was no knowledge , under standing, or use of the psi force whatsoever. When psi com - munic ation was attem pted, the inhabitants either fled in panic or prostrated themselves and emanated strong psi re actions to the effect that they w ere in the presence of the Creator. Paradoxically, caref ul psi probes found occasio nal glimmerings of the universal laws in the minds of these in dividuals, which conclusively proved that the seed had truly been sown, that this was inten ded to develop into a social structure according to the plan, whatever the environment. With this knowledge, the research team returned to their own society to ponder the problem. In later periods, other, better-equipped investigators visited and observed this strug gling intelligent life from time to time. All visits were performed within the rules which applied to the infant soci ety, so that no direct support was given that would instigate dominance of one culture over an other. Infreque ntly, intel ligent applications of psi were found at the individua l level, and this was encouraged. Still, in spite of all precau tions, it was ascertai ned that actual visits only reinf orced the myths and legends that had sprung up as a result of previous con tacts. It was the exceptio n that objective response was ob tained from an individual via psi probe. None of these responses extended to comm on practice. In recent periods, the situation has altered significantly. Routi ne psi monitoring plus referential advice from non-matter intelligences show th at the society i n quest ion has surprisingl y entered the nuclear stage while still in the bio chemical. Applic ations of nuclear force inevitably lea d to gravities, which presumes historically the early prospect of interstell ar travel. W ithout comp lete understa nding of psi force fields, contac t with other social organizations by the new n on-psi society cou ld be disastro us. If interstell ar physi cal travel is achieved, such contacts are a certainty. With this prosp ect in view, research groups have increase d their efforts at contact without a serious effect upon the dynamics of the new society . It is d ifficult in that the same obstacles are present. The continuing interpre tation of divinity-orientation persists. Some who are contacted by psi probes still lose their ability to reason, and are isolated as sufferers of some disease. Any lasting psi comm unication pat tern is usually labeled as unreality or dr eam (a term used by the society to identify uncoordinated psi activity during re charging perio ds, similar to that found among infants in norma l social cultures).

High-level psi force radiatio n equipment is being employed in the hope of a breakt hrough to the society m embers during their waking, active state.

It is a fact, many times proved, that such subclassifica-tions are consisten tly lost when contact is ma de with more advanc ed societi es.

We may in fact be no more than interesting laboratory ani mals to \"them,\" useful in various experiments but not much more. If such communication and/or experim entation was and is now being attempted, it could accou nt for much that is left unanswer ed in our human history. Cer tainly, it would widely-cut across past and prese nt theological beliefs, as events ascribed to God and his assista nts in whatever f orm would assume a more prosaic status. The life sciences, espec ially those relating to the mind, personality, and neurological functions, would have to un dergo a major overhau ling. Both mental and physical diseases would perhaps be understood with exact knowledge, replac ing the vague assum ptions now pre valent. Most ada ptable would be the physical sciences . Here, ex perimentation and extrapolation would be a relatively simp le matter, with new in formation and theories built upon fairly solid foundations.

It had intelligence of a form beyond my comprehension, and it cam e directly (down the beam?) into my head, and seem ed to be searching every memory in my mind. 1 was truly frightened because I was powerless to do anything about this intrusio n, This intelligence force entered my head just ab ove the forehead, and offered no calming thoughts or words.

However, this time I recei ved the firm impres sion that I was inextricably bou nd by loyalty to this intel ligence force, always had been, and that I had a job to perform here on earth. The job was not necessarily to my liking, but 1 was assigned to it. The impression was that I was man ning a \"pumping statio n,\" that it was a dirty, ordi nary job but it was mine and I was stuck with it, an d nothing, absolutely nothing could alter the situation. I got the impression of huge pipes, so ancie nt they were covered with undergrowth and rust. Something like oil was passing through them, but it was much higher in energy than oil, and vitally needed and valuable elsewhere (assu mption: not on this material planet) . This has been going on for aeons of time, and there were other force groups here, taking out the same material on some highly comp etitive basis, and the materi al was convert ible at some distant point or civilization for somet hing very valuable to entities far above my ability to understand.

I seemed to understand that the entity wa s looki ng for some subst ance that might permit breathing in earth atmosphere, and a picture was shown (in my mind) of a pouch, possibly two by three inches, and one inch thick, hun g on a belt at the waist, with the statement \"This is how w e are breathing now.\" This gave me courage to try truly to communicate.

For thos e who are know ledgeable in the humanities, the ma terial conta ined herein may seem to be the contin uation of a line of thought that has persisted for thous ands of years. And so it is. W hy, then, does it become important now ? The first respo nse is that this ma terial has not come from readings and studies of the past. Rathe r, it has been and is taking place in the mid-twentiet h century. Comp arison came after the fact. If validity does exist here, it is possib le that modern technology, through serious, organized investigation and research into the Second Body post ulate, could provide mankind with a quantu m jump as great or greater than the Copernican revolutio n. It could be the crack that becomes a door that becomes a gateway that opens into a new era in man's history, PREMISE ; THE SCOP E OF EXISTING MAN. Partially beca use of our intensely materialistic society , we have become accustomed and condi tioned to the conce pt that the human entity ultim ately lies within the bounds of the physical body. Therefore: the periphe ry of the living hu man entity—t he rim of that area which it affects and is af fected by it—extends beyond the physical body and the con scious mind. The composition of this area is neither material nor motor, but of thought and emotion. The transmi ssion and reception of affecting data is contin uous, operating at both the consci ous and non-conscious levels during every living mo ment, awake or asleep. Data receive d by the human entity in this manner can be beneficial or destructive, ac cording to the interpre tation put upon it by the non-conscious mind. Reactions to this const ant data input may be found in the varying me ntal and physical states of the individu al. For exam ple, the periphery exte nds as far as a distan t friend. The friend thinks of you, objectivel y or emotionally. Unacco untably, at the very same moment, he comes to your min d without a related memory associ ation to suggest or trigger the response. This takes place so casually and so fre quently that we are unaware of its significance. Comp ound this with the almost infinite compl exities and variations in the present and past human relationships of an individua l. Only then can one begin to perceive the volume and diversity of data received. The Christian ethic seems to be an attempt to explai n this fact in a non-objective parable. The thoug hts of you im pressed upon you by neighb or, friend, and enemy significantly affect your men tal self, and through this channel are reflected in the physical body. It be comes clear, too, that the individ ual with wide, continuing experie nce in human relatio nships will receive a greater affecting input directly in proportion to such experience. For the leaders of the world, who are ex posed to input from millions, charged with emot ions either benign or malignant, the burden is incalculable. Consi der too that what you engender in others thus \"feeds back\" to you. Try to visualize an invisible nerve network extend ing from you to every perso n you have met. Signals (thoughts) con stantly travel along this network to and from you. From those who think of you frequently, consci ously or otherwise, there exten ds a strong, well-circuited channel of communica tion. At the other end of the frequency are those who may th ink of you perh aps once each year.

The quality of the signals evidently varies greatly, based princip ally upo n the degree of emotion present during trans mission. The more intens e the emotion, the greater the signal intensity. T he question of \"good\" or \"bad\" does not alter the qualit y of transmission. The conve rse works in precisely the same fashion. You transm it to those of whom you think, and they are affected by what you think. \"Think\" here refers to those mental actions almost wholly at a non-conscious level, chiefly emo tional and subjective in nature. When this kind of transmis sion and recepti on takes place consci ously and willfully, it is labe led telepathy. Much is still unk nown. Do recepti on and transmission in crease tenfold during sl eep? Does the effect cease when a human entity \"dies \"? Does it exte nd to animals? For every answer, a hundred quest ions are left unanswered. Yet this is the first step in an expanded conce pt of the physical life experie nce. PREMISE : THE REALITY OF SECOND STATE EXISTENCE. Many if not all living hum an beings have a Second Body. For reasons yet unknown, many if not all human beings temporarily sep arate from their physical bodies via this Sec ond Body during sleep. This is done without conscious memory, e xcept in rare instanc es. Far more rare are those instanc es when separation is obt ained with consci ous intent. However, the latter case poses some startling statistics and probabilities. It is inconceivable that one experim ental \"ability\" is unique. If one perso n can perform this disass ocia-tive act ion, there must be others now li ving who can do the same, probably more efficiently. But how m any others are there? Can one person in a thousand do it? In ten thousand? In a hundred thousand? In a million? Let us assum e that only on e person in a million can perform in the Second Body consiste ntly and consci ously. This means that as of this mo ment, there are more than thirty-five hundred humans now li ving who can operate in the Second Body, probably better than I can. Such a group, if organized, could control the destiny of manki nd. Which leads to the quest ion: Are any of them organized now, and do they now control our destiny? Before dismissi ng this as an absur dity, consi der that I was able to affect another living hum an being physicall y, in the \"pinching\" episode. If one can do this, so can others. Noth ing more than a pinch at the right time in the right place in the physical body of another human being could change the world. It takes little imagin ation to visualize a pinched cerebral artery in the brain as the cause of a stroke in a world leader. Or a lifesaving pinch in a hemorrhaging brain artery of another. All that is needed is the ability and the intent If there are restraints or deter rents to such possible action, they are not apparent. Further, a perso n operating in the Second Body can affect other human beings mentally. H ow much and in what man ner is still unc ertain. However, the experiments show that it can be done. Such effects may sho w in nothing more than sleep disturb ances. They could result in unacc ounted-for compulsions, fears, neuroses, or irrational actions. From the data, it would seem that no more is needed than perfected techniques to systema tically accom plish this at will. Perha ps this, too, has already been done. Willful use of the Second Body, the n, potentially yields power so great that other"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"means are helpless against it. Peo ple wielding this power might well be able to suppress or divert any ser ious expanded study into this area of knowledge. If histor y is any indica tion, something has already retarded growth in this directio n. First, it was a wall of ignorance. Next cam e a veil of superstition. Today, a double barrier exists: the suspici on of organized religion and the derision of recognized science . On the other hand, use of such power may be under the control and direction of animate, intellige nt, or impersonal regulator s, and may preclude non-constructive interference, There are some indications that this may be the case. We can only hope that it is. Let us assume, then, that sophistic ated man will under take serious research of the Second Body. One by one, others will learn the techn ique, and the reality will become generally acce pted. What then? First, man will be freed of all uncerta inty of his relatio n ship with God. His position relative to nature and the uni verse will be unequivoc al knowledge. He will know, rather than believe, whether death is a passing or a finality. W ith such knowledg e and expan ded experience, religious conflict will be impossible. Quite probably, Catho lics, Protestants, Jews, Hind us, Buddhists, et al. will still retain much of their individu ality, knowing that each has its place in Locale II. Ho wever, ea ch will at last understand how this is possible, and that there are infinite variations in the spectrum. Each will ration alize by saying, \"T hat's what we've bee n trying to tell you all along.\" Prayer tech niques may be rediscovered. Knowledg e, rather than belief, could alter the altar procedure vitally. Man would then proceed systematically with his preparation for life in Locale II on a sound basis, liberated from the mis interpretation of distor ted visions subjectively experie nced and/or observed by uninformed and relative ly uneducated fanatics many centu ries ago. In so doing, he may have to face facts both unpalatable and uncomfortable. Traditional concepts of good and bad, right and wrong wi ll undoubtedly be subject to radical redefinition. The truth may indeed hurt for a generation or so. The practice of medicine would be seriously affected. Recogniti on of a possible relatio nship betwee n physical health and the Second Body would greatly influence the purely me chanical method of diagn osis and treatment. The exact relatio nship of the Second Body to the physical is not now known, but there is much to suspect. The growing results of the practice of psychosomatic medicine provide an additional clue. It is challe nging to think of scientific precision in these fields. Psychology and psychiatry would soon be unrec ognizable under the impact of Second State data. This area of human knowledge would be even more greatly affected than reli gion. Definitions of neurosis, psychosis, unconscious, super ego, id may have to be revised or discarde d. Early indications are that actual cause s of mental illness may be uncover ed rather than conclus ively diagn osed on the basis of insufficient theory. It m ay well be that many of those labeled schizo phrenic suffer from some sort o f disease of the Second Body. From the viewpoint of the Second State, a physically con scious and awake human being who simultaneously receives impressions of Locale II through some imperfection or cause yet unknown might well be unable to absor b this input of double reality. The \"voices\" so many \"psychotics \" reporte dly hear may indeed be very real. Catato nia may be the simple effect of a disass ociation of the Second Body on some unusual basis, as one would leave a house with all of the automatic"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"equipment running and forget to return. The hal lucinations of persecuti on by the paranoiac might be very real interferences from boundary layer sub human species in Locale II, the result of some inadvertent break down in the barrier in a particular case. The workings of the mind itself, the automatic system operation, the actua l brain function, the relations hip of the superconscious, soul, or spirit, all may become common knowledge under the new con cept. Advanc ed states of con scious ness such as have been proclai med by mystics, phil osophers, and the trippers might become a daily achieve ment for those who so desire or can handle them. All of these possibilities are mild by com parison to the up heaval that would take place in the daily li ves of every human being if the Second Body concept became accept ed fact. First, the sleeping third of our twenty-four-hour living sched ule would no longer be unfathomable. Perhaps we would still term it sleep, but at least we would know w hat we are doing. On the limited evidence, sleep is first of all a recharging process. This may be performed by a disassoci a tion of the Second Body quite automatically in varying de grees of distan ces. In one case it may sepa rate only a fraction of an inch. In others, such distances may be limitless by our physical standards of measurement. How such separ ation can act as a regenerant is not yet known. Nor is it known why some take distant \"trips\" or visits while others remain close to the physical. There seem to be two explan ations of what we now call dreams. First, the common dream may be some computer-type action of the unconscious in sorting out recently per ceived data. Second, there are vividly recalled experienc es now called dreams which may actual ly be impressions re ceived by the Second Body w hile traveling in the released state. There may be many oth er varieties or subcl assifications yet to be learned. Only research in this direction will deter mine this. In any e vent, our luxu rious or frighte ning period called sleep will be understood for what it truly is. The result may be an adjustment of our sleep needs. Perhaps only two hours out of twenty-four will be needed with this new understand ing. Ne w studies may e ven show that five minutes of de liberat e sleep every hour is a far more efficient method of recha rging. T he eight-hour night cycle could be nothing more than the habitual result of environment. Second State studies should resolve such questio ns. PREMISE : THE EXIS TENCE OF A THIRD FORCE , This is the energy-means by which the Second Body operates and is quite probably fundamental in the thought process. It is not known whether this force is generat ed by living entities or is an ever prese nt field force, modulated in some manner by such beings. It does, however, have some notable characteristics. It be ars a distinct relatio nship to electricit y and magnetism. It might be conceived of as a third of a triad, which is cyclic. Electr icity is to magnetism as magne tism is to Force X as Force X is to electricit y. Hen ce the label \"third force\" which I did not originate. The Trinity of our theologies may have begun when this was com mon knowledge in ages past and subseq uently distor ted in the retelling. Given this interacti on with electr icity and magnetism, it see ms probable that the existence of one part of the triad creates secondary or tertiar y patterns among the other two. So it may be that when we think, we are utilizing this third force, which then is only slig htly represe nted in purely electri cal or ma gnetic form. It is presumed that this third force action can be detected and measured by instruments already"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"develop ed. To date, this has not been attem pted in a serious, consist ent study. On the other hand, there is no evidence that strong appli cation s of electricit y or magnetism, or any co mbinations of electromagnetic radiation, generate significant amounts of the third force. They do, however, appear to act upon the latter in much the same manner as light is affected. Experime nts with the only known transducer—th e human mind—s how consci ousness const antly trying to symbolize this third force in terms of electricit y and vibration. It \"sees\" and \"feels\" electr ic conductors, flashes, and often actual physical shock in attempting to translate this ener gy field into known exper ience. In one test, as noted, a disass ociation and move ment in the Second Body was attempted from within a charged Faraday cage, where the physical body was compl etely surrounded by a strong D,C. electr ical field. It was found that movement through the charged walls of the cage while in the Second Body was imp ossible. With the charge removed, there was no problem. In the early stages of experim entation, attempts to move any d istance in the Second Body were restricted by what seem ed to be an interlacing barrier of power cabl es and lines overhead, much like those found in so many streets in older cities and towns. One of the factors in extensi on of distance from the physical body lay in recogni zing the nature of this barrier and its relations hip to electr omagnetic radiation. The mind, perceiving such forces for the first time, interpreted them as \"wires.\" Once identified, passage through the bar rier became relatively simple. The correlation is also indicated by the reporte d exper ience of the Second Body positioned over the street—l ater con firmed by physical inspe ction—and moving along the mag netic field of higher- voltage primary p ower lines overhead. Whenever encountered during the Second State, third-force manifestation has been perceived and interpreted first as elec tricity. To date, there is no proven method of measurement or de tection of this third force, and there will not be until the possib ility of the existence of this third in the trinity is se riously considered. PREMISE : THE EXIST ENCE OF LOCALE 11. This reality is a concept of proporti ons inconceivable to the conscious human mind. Yet all experim ents inescapably point to this concl usion. It is not difficult to recognize Locale II as the subject of man's dreams and contemplations throughout history. Nor is it d ifficult to understand the varying patterns ascribed to it in the countless attempts to translate this great unknown in recogni zable terms. From the prese nt evidence, it can truly be both heaven and hell, just as our prese nt environment can be. The most important factor seems to be that the greater part of Locale II is reall y neither of the two. It is not known from the experiments to date whether everyone who dies automatically \"goes\" to Locale II. Also, there is no present evidential material to indicate that the presence of a human perso nality in Locale II is permanent. It may be that, like an eddy or vortex, we gradually lose en ergy and eventually dissip ate into the Local e II medium once we leave Locale I (Her e-Now). It is conce ivable that the result of this process would grant recognition of immort ality in that we survive the grave, but not forever. Perhaps the stronger the formation of perso nality, the longer the \"life\" in this different state of being. Thus it coul d be that survival is both reality and illusion."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The scope of Locale II seem s limitless. Unde r the condi tions encountered thus far, there seem to be no means to meas ure or calcul ate the breadth and depth of this strange familiar place. Movement from section to section is too in stantaneous to allow any estim ates or to observe relative spatial positions of one area to another. As far as can be as certain ed, there is no conjunctive relationship between places in Locale II and this physical universe. They may or may not coinci de, site to site. Certainly, this non-material realm does not have as its center the earth upon which we live. Rather, it would seem that one very small portion envelops our physi cal world and thus is our \"port of entry.\" At this stage, I believe it imp ossible for human conscious ness to comprehend fully the reality of Locale II. It would be like asking a computer to work on an analogue for which it has not been programmed. Consci ousness as we have de veloped it to date is not prepared for this kind of compre hension. That is not to say, however, that such consci ousness cannot or will not be forthcoming. By training in now obscu re or yet- to-be formulated techniques, consciousness might well be deepened or expanded to recogni ze and accept this reality. On the other hand, I am quite sure that the subco nscious, unconsci ous, superc onscious, super ego, soul— or whatever our non-material non-consciousness is called—is generally quite aware of and familiar with Locale II. Ho w much this aware - ness affects our consci ous thoug ht has been conte mplated by our most revered philosophers. Many suggest that it domi nates our waking actions. The records of the experim ents seem to bear this out. We are masters of ourselves, but not at the consci ous level. Our actions in Locale II may h ave force ful bearing on our daily activities, completely unrecognized by the conscious self. There are literall y hundreds of pages of experimental notes relating to Locale II visits, most of which are still beyond translation into Locale I thought patterns. Undoubtedly, most of them also deal with that portio n which attracts this personal self (like attracts like), w hich is but a fraction of the whole. PREMISE : THE EXIST ENCE OF A CONTRADICTION. We share with animals and all living things a common prime command, going back to the moment of conception. It supe rsedes any o ther instinct The command indelibly etched in our being is: SU RVIVE! It was this dynamic that created the fear barrier , which had to be overcome before willful separation could take place. For an out-of-the-body experie nce was very much like death, which might be called the ultimate failure to comply with the command. To satisfy the survival drive, we eat. We often eat com pulsivel y beca use it is one way to respo nd to the prime com mand when threatened with something other than starvation, We translate the command into the accumulation and de fense of material possess ions. The drive to reproduce an swers the command in another manner. Any danger to the ego calls forth the automatic mech anisms of defense or denial. The familiar fighter-flee is the physical reaction to the survival imprint. Survival as the prime command means avoidance of death by whatever met hod available. The contradiction is that the principal idealistic notions of man, the noble virtues, the great acts, all have as their base the denial and/or rejection of this prime comm and. The man who gives to another his bread , who provides for his family at the cost of early death, who gives of himself to com munity and country without direct benefit, who delib erately end angers and possibly sacrifices his life for others, has done the"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Right Tiling. Therefore, doing the Right Thing, the human act most respected, the most godlike by our standards, is in direct vio lation of God's prime command to all nature. Moreover, to compound the contrad iction, it is imp ossible to achieve the Second State without subjugati on and/or subordination of the survival drive in its most basic forms.

I perceive the Signal and turn my attention to him. \"Hi there, son,\" I greet him warmly, and my great great grandch ild smiles in recognitio n."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE : PERSONALITY FILE Robert Monroe presented himse lf to us at the Topeka Veter ans Ad ministrati on Hospit al Research Department so that we could learn more about the relatio nships betwee n his personality and his out-of-the-body experie nces. The primary goal of our investiga tion was an in-depth \"psycho logical evaluation.\" Monroe was highl y co- operative and open during the intensive interviewing an d batteries of different psychological tests which were aimed at exam ining the depths of his unconscious mind, his value structures, his fantasy life, and the hu manistic or sel f-actualizing aspects of his mind. We did conduct a brief psycho-physiological exper iment with him which I will report on later. In reviewing the immense amount of material we have on his life, I have attempted to extract threads or them es for summary. Certain points about his experie nces which make them somewhat different from others reporte d should be noted: Monroe, a sixty-year-old busi nessm an, had a relatively solid orthodox \"southern\" upbringing, al - though certain features of his life indicate that he was an unusual perso n from a very early age with unevenly develop ed intellectual and emotional abilities, and an unusually mature sense of person and in dependence. He reports that his First out- of-the-body experience oc curred during his adult years, anot her point of difference, since in our work we have found that many people associat e to out-of-the-body or similar experienc es during their childhood. First experiences are often associated with severe physical illness, childbirth, various drugs ( in cluding anesthetics), or extreme states perceived as a psychological or physical threat to the perso n. Robert Monroe appeared not to be suf fering from any se vere physical illnesses at the time he had his first out-of-the-body expe rience. He was, howe ver, at age forty-two, in the midst of mid-life adjustments and changes. It shoul d also be noted that as a child he had severe scarlet fever, an illness that is associ ated with a high temperature. From his own account he was quite ill, al though his mother, a physician, was able to look after him outsid e the hospital. In addition, later in his life Monroe has had some evidence of arteriosclerotic narrowing o f the blood vessels to his brain, which could create a state of low oxygenation known to precipit ate these sorts of experie nces. The way in which Monroe utilizes his experienc es is what is un usual. If we were to have such experiences most of us would be ex tremely frighten ed, and attempt to avoid them. It is significant that initially Monroe's repeated visits to physicians in an attempt to explain these unusual experie nces were motivated by the intellectual and medic al orientation of his parents. It is striking h ow the behavior of human beings reflects an attempt to understand by action and experim ent the dominant preoccupations of their unconscious minds. One of the most consisten t themes in Monroe's histor y is his interest in the air. The air is his medium. From an early age he built model planes, learne d to fly airplan es in high schoo l, and later became an accom plished glider pilot. This is som e thing I have notice d in people who have direct personal out-of-the-body experience as opposed to those who study or r esearch the phenomenon. I have noticed that not only do they generally have such childhood fantasy experi ences as playing wi th imaginar y frien ds and seeing fairies, but also they often remember fantasies of wanting to fly like a bird, and report an increased number of flying a nd falling dreams. Another significant theme in Monroe's life is his preoccu pation with movement. In reviewing h is family backgroun d he became very excited at his child hood recollections, especially of"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"riding on trains. Movement themes are common through out his life, as they we re in the psychological test materials. Monroe had many unevenly develop ed talents. From an early age he was extremely independent. His father, an academic, was quiet and authoritative, an excellent parental model with an even temper. His mo ther was a physician, and more in control of the family, though not in a dominant, aggressive way. Monroe appeared to be able to actua lize his individual talents in a manner somewhat unusual in traditional fam ilies. His pare nts allowed him a considerable degree of latitude, some - how recognising his unusual talents, particul arly his mech anical ability, wh ich appeared not to be represe nted in anyone else in his immediate family. He had two elder sisters, th e elder of whom was quite com petitive with him, and he had a very much younger brother. Some of his unevenly develop ed talents included his ability to read and write at the age of four years. In spite of this his school performance was quite average until he develo ped a relatio nship with a teacher at college whom he felt accep ted and guided him. He then became a straight-A student. He was a leader of his peers as a child, and highly creative, consta ntly searching for answers. He was self-generating, as so many people in this field are. He also demonstrated a comm on charact eristic of people exploring altered states of consciousness, and that was that he listened to and acted on his own subjective experience. In other words, he appeared to believe his own experienc e, and would quite in dependently and with a great deal of faith pursue what he felt. We have found in our work with people capable of having ou t-of-the-body experie nces that certain personality attributes are present, and Monroe does demonstrate these. These include a tendency to feel so cially isolated and different from others at quite an early age, often seeing the world itself as sotnewh at alien. This relative isolation is com bined with a tendency to be autonomous, and yet also to be a leader, quite aggressive and danger-see king. Monroe has been able to take some experiences, which most people would try to deny and avoid, and place them in a highly creative con-text, utili zing his leadership abilities and his other constitutional at-tributes. People such as Monroe are thus able to utilize their intern al mental experiences for guida nce in their lives. Monroe has no special training in Eastern, meditative, or other esoteric disciplin es, but some how uses these intuitions. Monroe, as others, is a visualizer, a person who visually memorizes and thinks in Gestalts. His dreams are also visual, highly colore d and intens e. Perha ps one of the commonest themes in Monroe's life is his se curity in not having to continuously define the external world. This attitude has given him the ability t o journey through realities normally not accessible to people whose lives necessit ate, for one reaso n or an other, a contin ual definition of the physical external world. Monroe's early life also demonstrates not only independence, but stubbornness and a tendency to rebel against traditional values, although there is no evidenc e whatsoever that this rebellion, mainly inte rnal, created major probl ems in his life. He does not demonstrate any major trauma during his childhood, nor any of the sorts of childhood difficulties that a psychiatrist might look for. I think this results from an excelle nt re lationship with his parents, who did not have a normal middle-class attitude to life, and were themselves quite independent. His m other, a dynamic woman, tended to step over the ugly things in life, an at-tribute that emerges in the analysis o f Monroe's personality. It ap pears that both Monroe and his mother use"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"what could be called in traditional psychiatric terms denial or avoidance, excep t that it is don e consciously, and does not appear to have created difficulties for either his mother or himsel f. He has a tendency to bring out the best in peo ple by an oblique form of communication in which he focuses his at tention on that which will synthesize rather than that which will destroy. He had no major childhood traumas, although one experie nce he reports as highly traumatic was that of moving fro m a small to a large city. He went to college at the age of fifteen, entering pre-medical school. He eventually quali fied himself as an engineer with very good grades, although his courses were quite unorthodox. Monroe's pre-ad ult and early adult life was one of entrepreneur. He started a theater, produced and directed many progr ams for radio and television, started and lost a number of businesses, each time being able to collect aroun d himself people who would help him. This independent, a religious, non-psychic, non-esoteric typical \"American Dream\" development appears to have set Monroe up well for the sorts of direct and simple observations that are so well demonstrated in his book and in his later work. In his relations hip with himsel f, his own closely knit and dedic ated family, and other colleagues and friends, there is an emphasis on the importance of personal relatio nships rather than material possess ions, and an over-all tendency to see human beings as good. How can Monroe accept these highly esoteric journeys describ ed in his book, and at the same time be the almos t traditional successf ul businessman and father who is not a freak, does not wear unus ual clothes, and does not constant ly put himself on- stage for exam ination of his special abilities ? He pursu es relentlessly his own research, makes his own contacts, and takes responsibility for his own life. One psycho logical test shows him to have the profile of a self-actualizing individual with a particul ar emphasis on his ability to see apparent opposites of life as meaningfully related, an unusually high test score. Monroe also demonstrated elements that we have noticed in people who lead de velopments in the field of altered states of consci ousness, and that is a tendency to keep some intensive emotions in the unconscious split and seale d off. Part of seeing opposites as meaningful also involves keeping them discreet, and utilizing the energy of the tension between the split opposites for creative endeavors. Often such people demon strate intensive thoughts and feelings, with a sensitivit y to criticism. Test exam inations of his attitudes to death indicated that, comp ared with a normal population, Monroe's anxiety and fear of death is very low. Some writings and studies of people with out- of-the-body experi ences have laid considerable emphasis on the denial of death. On one level this appears logical, espec ially in the reporte d studies of people whose first experiences have often occurred in life-threatening situ - ations, situations that many of us never face in the course of our lives. Perha ps the experie nce becomes deeply imprint ed in the mind, and may make the unconscious mind continually afraid that the event may ha ppen again. Deep er analysis of Monroe's psychological test findings demonstrate no evidenc e of fear of imminent death, or an attempt to deny dea th, but mainly to contain and control and utilize intens ively split emotions within his unconscious mind. As part of a break from the intensive psychological investigatio n we conducted a brief exper iment in the psycho-physiological laboratory of the hospital, with a psychologist, Dr. Fowler Jones of the Kansas Uni versity Medical Center, as co- observer. W e simply aske d Monroe to put himsel f into the state of mind he defined"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"as out-of-the-body. We had him hooked up to a polygraph and took some brain wave tracings and measurements of his anxiety level and level of alertn ess (GSR ). We observed him through a one-way mirror ove r a thirty-minute time period. Most st riking was his slow rate of breathing and his intens ive depth of relaxati on. His br eathing was sha llow an d he had periods in which he would not breath e at all, and then would take a few gulping breaths . At about the same time as a techn ician entered the room to tell us that the brain wave tracing s were changing , Dr. Jones and I simultaneously had the impressio n of a heat-wave-like distortion of Monroe's upper body while the lower pa rt of his body was clearly in focus to us. This distor tion lasted until approximately two minutes before the termination of the experiment. Monroe had stated that he would be able to get out of his body very quickly, but he could not signal, although he could signal within five seconds of return, which he did. This signal correlated with a change again in his brain waves. Sinc e there were probl ems in hookup, the technician entered the room during the experiment to check the attachment of leads. It was inter esting to note that as the technician was attempting to adjust the leads there was no record whatsoever that this affected Monroe's arousal level on the GSR. From a techn ical point of view, while out of the body, Monroe's GSR level showed an arousal of approximately 150 microvolts and was marke d by 3 total absence of either specific or non specific respons es once the experim ent began, even when the techni cian actually touched his body to adjust the electro de place ments. This is mo st unusual, as the GSR is high ly sensitive to such interferences. The technician also noted that Monroe's skin was very dry and hot. After re-entering his body Monroe was slightly disorie nted with blur ring of his speec h, and could not recap ture or describ e his experienc es immediately, although later he did describe that he had left the ex perimental room and entered the room where the polygraph and tech nicians were locat ed. It is also noteworthy in comparing Monroe with reports of other people who are adept at out-of-the-body experie nces that prior to the beginning of this brief informal psycho-physiolog ical experime nt, Monroe had demonstrated his ability to move the needles of sensitive voltmet ers by waving his hand over them. These sorts o f energy mani pulations might also explai n some of the technic al prob lems created in the highly sensitive apparatus which often goes wrong in such experiments. It is a lmost as if energy is ram pant and not under the full control of either the exper imenter or the subje ct A comp uter analysis of Monroe's brain waves demonstrated that most of his brain energy was in the four to five (Theta) frequency range, with nothing at all above ten cycles per secon d. He focused brain energy in a very narrow frequency band. We have also found a similar phenomenon in experiments with Monroe's sound strobe tape system. Monroe was doing this experiment without his tapes, but ap parently could focus his consci ousness so that his brain power w as in a very narrow frequency band. At the time the technician noticed the change in the EEG there appeared to be a shift in energy from the left to the right side of his brain. His ordinary EEG was quite normal with no evidence of epilepsy and no evidence of unusual respo nses to overbreathing or light stimulation. A later statistical analysis of his EEG tracings (analysis of variance) showed that in terms of the fre quency of brain waves there was no particular difference between the right and left side of his brain, but that during the time he was out of the body the frequency of his brain waves was consi derably slower. During th e out-of-the-body period the variations in frequency of his brain waves w ere considerably smaller, the variation being much"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"less on the right side of his brain than on the left side. The differences here were highly statistically significant (P< .001). What does this mea n? Essentially, this brief experim ent showed that Monroe was able during a state he defined as out-of-the-body to focus his brain energy into a narrow frequency band and to produce visible distortions of his body, observed by two people independently under low-illumination conditi ons. He was able to achieve an unusually deep state of physical relaxatio n, which is wha t he claims to do in his focus ten tape condi tion. It is a lmost as if his body were coma tose rather than asleep. In other experiments we have found different types of brain wave resp onses to what is defined as out-of-the-body, but they all seem to have one thing in common: there is a slowing in the brain waves, an d a shifting of energ y focus. In summ ary, it can be said of Monroe that his energetic life with a high sense of purpose, and his need for and relentless desire for understanding, is a good demonstration of what W. R. Inge once said, \"One test is infallible. Whatever view of reality deepens our sense of the tremendous issues of life in the world wherein we move is for us nearer the truth than any view which diminishes that sense .\" Stuart W.
