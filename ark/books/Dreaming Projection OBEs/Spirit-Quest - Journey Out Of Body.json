I I I N N N T T T R R R O O O D D D U U U C C C T T T I I I O O O N N N It is believed that each and every night when we go to sleep, our spirit embarks upon a quest of wonder, far beyond the reaches of our physical world. We leave our physical bodies behind, and travel in spirit form, questing the wonders of our physical world, or even wandering about on the other side of reality and witnessing the underlying workings of our universe. We do not tend to remember these journeys because during them, our conscious mind is fast asleep. Instead we are functioning through our subconscious mind, and since the conscious mind can not correctly interpret these subconscious images, we remember only vague details or nothing at all. It is quite possible that a good portion of the dreams we remember, may have been excursions while out- of-body. A small percentage of the population sometimes finds themselves in the midst of a very real experience, while fully conscious of the events they perceive. They may see their physical bodies from a different vantage point. They may travel to other physical places. When they wake, they have an instinctive knowledge that the experience was real, but most are afraid to even talk about it for fear of what others might think. These people have had spontaneous out- of-body experiences, and I am fortunate to be one of them!"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 10 of 105 Imagine waking up, floating above your body, and being able to move simply by thought. You can go anywhere! You are truly free! To have these experiences given to you, is a great gift. There are many people who have had such experiences, in fact more than you might realize. For those who have not had spontaneous out-of-body experiences, it is possible to learn to induce this state by will, and anyone who has patience and the dedication to learn will eventually be able to achieve it! Imagine being able to travel by thought, leaving your physical body safely behind, and return at will! The knowledge is nothing new. For centuries, Tibetan monks have spent years of their lives in practice and meditation in order to attain altered states of consciousness with ease. The shamans of the Native American tribes have embarked upon their vision quests for ages. The knowledge has also been passed down in hidden texts shared with initiates of many Occult ‘secret societies’. Now it is hidden no longer. You too can learn this faculty with perseverance! Remember, you will eventually succeed! After all, this ability has been known and practiced for a very long time, by many different cultures. It is within all of us. I have noticed that over the last decade or so, there seems to have been a large shift in thought and belief about psychic and paranormal phenomenon on a global scale. It seems that more and more people"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 11 of 105 are realizing their potential goes well beyond their physical limits. Out-Of-Body Experiences fall within these categories, along with other psychic abilities such as telepathy. Either more people have been experiencing these phenomena then before, or more are simply willing to talk about their experiences. Either way, now is a good time to start learning how you too can develop your ability, with many books and tools available to you. There is no easy way to achieve this goal however. There are many aids out there to help you with your quest, but none of them will ultimately make the experience happen. Only you can! You must have the patience to learn, and the dedication to keep at it, even in the eyes of failure and this book is but one tool to help you along that path. It is the goal of this guide to teach the basic theory and practice required to induce the out-of-body experience by will, and while fully conscious of the event. Within these pages you will find the theory behind out-of-body experiences, a section on the practical exercises and techniques to help you induce them on your own, a brief history of my own experiences including journal entries, and some of my personal observations on the subject.

I am just a normal person; fortunate enough to have had some extraordinary things happen throughout the journey of my life. This book is based largely on my own experiences, along with information I have gathered along the way by reading books and talking to others who have had similar experiences. Ever since I was a young child, I have had strange experiences that could not easily be explained. In my childhood years I did not understand what was happening, though I always kept the knowledge that they occurred tucked in the back of my mind. I was afraid to mention the experiences to my parents, for fear of their reaction. My father was a very religious man, having spent three of his younger years in the seminary, studying to be a Catholic priest before he decided he wanted a family instead. Any mention of the ‘Occult’ immediately put up red flags in the eyes of my Dad, as he would label everything mysterious as a product of Devil worship. He had even gone so far as to call the local priest to our home one afternoon when a friend of mine had brought a book about Wicca over to show me. I was fortunate to have kept a dream journal though, and at about the age of 14, I had a very vivid experience that would change my life:"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 14 of 105 “Journal Entry - 03/10/1985 - A Journey Out-Of-Body Last night, I woke up unable to move. I tried to shout out, but even my voice was muffed. I felt like I was in panic but I could not do anything about it. At first, I tried to fight the paralysis, but my attempts were futile, so instead I succumbed to it and let myself go. The next thing I remember is standing in my room beside my bed, and the images looked distorted. Everything was kind of slow motion, and I found it hard to move around my room. I thought something was wrong with me. I think I was thirsty, because I remember trying to walk out my room to go get myself a drink. I was standing by my bedroom door, and I tried to leave the room, but my feet froze in position and I could not move any further forward. In fact, the only part of my body that I could move was my head. I turned my head and looked back towards my bed, and what I saw has forever changed me: there was a still figure laying there in my bed, and that figure was me! My next recollection is of strange rushing and static-like sounds, and then the feeling of being slammed into my bed. When I woke up, my heart was pounding and I did not know what happened! Could this have been real?”"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 15 of 105 For the longest time, I kept that experience to myself. Several years went by, where I had a few similar experiences, and I kept writing them down in my journal. I also started to gain an insatiable appetite for the unknown. I became interested in the paranormal, psychic abilities and the occult. I had this inner thirst for knowledge about reality as we know it. I remember a game I used to play with a close friend of mine, where we would use a deck or cards and pull out the four aces. One of us would hold up a card, and the other would guess which card it was. We quickly got tired of only four possible answers, and moved on to picking a number between one and fifty, and to our amazement, we were accurate a surprising percentage of time. During my late teens, there were many shows on television that dealt with unexplained phenomenon, and I remember watching one show where they interviewed a woman who had out-of-body experiences. Her description was eerily similar to the experiences I had been having. I do not remember the name of the program, though I remember vague images of a woman standing in the living room as if her body was standing through the coffee table, and she was looking at her physical body on the floor. I gained some solace in knowing that there were others out there who were experiencing the same things. I still wasn’t completely sold on the idea of actually leaving my physical body. The thought somehow scared me, even though each time it happened, I had always returned safely."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 16 of 105 When I was 21, I moved away from home temporarily for about a year. During this time, I had bought a book by authors Denning and Phillips called Astral Projection: The Out-Of-Body Experience . I know you are not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but the artwork depicting a woman floating over her body and about to leave through a window is what caught my attention. That book opened the doorway, and I realized that I was on the pathway of a journey that had started for me long ago. There was no doubt, I was having out- of-body experiences. I must explain that this realization goes much deeper than the experience itself! I began thinking that if you can travel outside your physical body, then the human spirit must exist, and that means life after death is real. And I started to ask myself, “...then how many other unexplained phenomena are real?” I had become aware of a universe for more vast than the physical world we live in day to day! It was like a veil had been lifted from my eyes and I was now seeing deeper into reality, a view that most people seem not to be privy to. From that first book, I tried a method to induce an out-of-body experience by will and I was highly successful. I did not expect anything to happen but I was amazed when something did! It was the first time I was able to reproduce the experience with intent, and to some degree control. I was better able to analyze what was happening to me while in this state."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 17 of 105 Though I called this OBE #1 in my journal, it’s actually about the 5th or 6th out-of-body experience that I can clearly recall, however the previous experiences were all spontaneous and this one was planned. “Journal Entry - 15/05/1997 - OBE #1 I Did It! I began practicing a technique that I read in Denning and Phillips’ book that instructs you to use a form of relaxation, starting from your feet and working your way to your head, until your whole body is numb. I achieved this state fairly easily. The next part was a bit more difficult, as it instructed that I focus to keep my mind awake at the exact point that sleep takes over. I was able to do this, and then before I fell asleep, I was to simply tell myself with intent, that I would have an OBE. I really did not have any expectations about this, however I was very surprised to find that it worked! I remember floating above my physical body, facing upward. The perspective was about several feet higher than where I would have been laying in the bed. I looked toward the wall on the other side of the room, and lifted my hand to look at it. I noticed my body was translucent. I don’t know why I did that, except as a form of personal proof. However, seeing myself like that had startled me slightly, and I told myself that I wanted to go back right then."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 18 of 105 I had the same loud static noises as before, and the feelings of being slammed in to the bed. I then awoke, thinking to myself how awesome this is!” Following that experience, I was able to successfully utilize that same technique several more times over the next year or so. The experiences were kind of vague and I remember passing through doorways and hallways and then losing lucidity of the events. I so much wanted to gain more control, and stay conscious throughout the experience, but something seemed to be pulling me back as soon as I realized I was out. The short duration of the OBEs do not have any less impact on the amount of awe you feel from the experience! It only takes a fleeting moment of realization to cause such intense feelings of elation! “Journal Entry - 24/08/1997 - An Interrupted Excursion... I tried to induce an out-of-body experience again tonight. I used the same method I have been using, putting a suggestion in my head just before sleep. This time I was only aware of a small portion of the experience, before I lost my perception of it. I remember floating toward the door in my room, and starting down the hallway. I only made it about halfway down the hallway and then I don’t remember anything past that point."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 19 of 105 When I awoke, I realized that my room mate had arrived home late and was making noise in the room.” It was at this point I started to think that physical sounds or stimuli near the physical body while you are out might call you back at the slightest distraction. It was a disappointment that I was pulled back so soon, but at the same time I was glad to know that at the first signs of trouble, I would be able to get back easily. Since then, I have accumulated a plethora of books on the topics of Out-Of-Body Experiences and Astral Projection. I likely have enough books to open a library on the subject! I have studied the theory of the universe on multiple levels, and the spiritual side to life. I have tried to look at this from all sides: the scientific, the philosophical, and the spiritual. This is when I first became drawn to the Rosicrucians. Their knowledge passed down through the ages, teaches of the multidimensional nature of the universe, and ties science, religion and philosophy together. Their teachings just made so much sense to me. The Rosicrucians, once considered a very secretive society, now allow membership to just about anyone who has the interest to join. I still did not know why I was given the gift of spontaneous OBEs, though they kept occurring and I have been lucky in that I have had several opportunities to validate them on a personal level. One such opportunity came when a close friend of mine participated in an experiment with me. He is empathic (he has the ability to sense"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 20 of 105 what people are feeling) and as I attempted to induce an OBE in his presence, he was able to sense a duality in me while I was out-of- body. Though most of my OBEs occurred at night, I have had several out- of-body experiences happen in the day time when it was light in my room. I had one such experience that was able to validate the actual separation from my physical body in great detail! “Journal Entry – 14/09/1998 - An Afternoon Excursion I went for a nap this afternoon because I had been on duty the night before and I was tired. I laid down and went to sleep around 13:00. I awoke about an hour later in sleep paralysis, and since it was light in my room and I could see everything clearly, I was not frightened by it at all. I did not fight it, but I instead closed my eyes and just let go, and tried to retain my consciousness. What happened was amazing! I literally, visually, passed through my eyelids! I could see myself leaving, and moving through the skin. It was like in the movie Ghost when he passes through the woman. That’s the only way I can describe it! I was then beside my bed and looking to the other side of my room. In my mind, I told myself to move to the other side of the room, toward the chair at my computer desk. With that thought, I moved on command. Then I looked toward the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 21 of 105 window, and told myself to leave through it. That’s the last point I remember. I lost awareness after that.” That experience left no doubt in my mind that something was actually leaving my physical body. I knew then, that it was not just a function of my brain. I think I lost awareness after this point because as I had looked toward the window, I was also given a vantage point where I was able to see my physical body in my peripheral vision. It seems that any thought of the physical will instantly pull you back. Not all of my experiences were completely successful. I actually had many times where I was pulled back to the physical immediately upon realizing that I was out-of-body. I believe this is partly due to the excitement felt upon realizing that I was out, and partly due to thinking about the physical and of my physical body. “Journal Entry – 04/05/1999 - A Fleeting Glimpse I had another OBE tonight, but it lasted only moments. I gained consciousness of the experience as I found myself floating upward toward the ceiling. I got just near the corner where the wall meets the ceiling, and then felt myself being pulled backward. I did a full back-flip in the air, slammed back into my physical body, and then I woke up.” In 2001, my father passed away unexpectedly from illness, and I had two very significant OBEs that followed:"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 22 of 105 “Journal Entry - 17/10/2001 - A Final Farewell My father passed away last night with my Mother and me at his side. The two of us left the hospital and stayed up most of the night talking, and around 5 am, I finally decided to try and get a few hours sleep. When I did fall asleep, I had an out-of-body experience - one that will forever be in my memory. I remember walking beside my father. The scenery around was like a convergence between two places. There was a kind of tower, like an outpost. It was round and had a lookout position at the top. We went inside. There were what looked to be consoles around the inside of the lookout, and windows all around the outside. My father spoke to me and said ‘This is as far as you can go. Don’t worry, it will be ok’ I realize that my description of the scenery is probably just how my mind interpreted it, but I know I was really with him. His words were my last memory before waking.” “Journal Entry - 14/05/2002 - Reunited! (We were in Norfolk, Virginia. We had to bring the ship to be depermed. This is where we wrap large cables around the ship to erase potentially dangerous magnetic signatures built up in the hull. We wrap the large cables around the hull and pass"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 23 of 105 electricity through them, effectively turning the ship into a large electromagnet - which we sleep inside! I knew that electromagnetic energy had to have something to do with OBEs, so I decided to try to have an OBE. I lay down in my bunk and focused on leaving my body.) “I was dreaming that I was upstairs, in my mother's house; was unaware that I was dreaming, as the usual unconscious mind perceives. The house was the same, but somehow different: colors were emanating from everything, as if it all had an aura, even the inanimate objects. I heard my recently deceased father call my name, from downstairs; I knew in the dream that he was not alive, so with excitement I called out to him. As I kept calling out to my father, I proceeded down the stairs (floating, as with all my OBEs, but at this point I did not realize it was an OBE). I saw my father sitting on the end of the coffee table. I went to him and hugged him very frantically. Looking into his eyes, I realized that it was him, but was younger, in his thirties— my father had little hair since his younger years, but here he had a full head of hair. He was much younger and healthier looking. His eyes are what got to me: imagine seeing flecks of pure energy dancing in someone's eyes. He looked more alive than a person ever could in life. He asked me, while looking directly into my eyes, how I was since his death, that year. I replied, \"I really miss you, Dad."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 24 of 105 There is something I want to ask you: can I reach you through astral projection?\" Up until that moment, I was still unconscious of what was happening. As soon I as I said the words \"astral projection\", I suddenly realized that I was out of my body, already! The worst part was that as soon as I realized that I was out-of-body, I immediately returned to my physical state. I never got my answer from him. Before I re-entered and heard the buzzing sounds just before I opened my physical eyes, I shouted, \"No, I don't want to go back, yet!\" What I find interesting is that my Father was the one who I was able to contact through an OBE, when he was always the one who warned me about the supposed dangers of psychic abilities and the paranormal (due to his religious training and beliefs). That out-of-body experience was to this day, the most vivid. I truly believe that the electromagnetic field I was sleeping within was a catalyst in that case. In 2002, I was invited to be a guest on a radio show in the United Kingdom. The show dealt with the topics of many unexplained phenomenon, and I was invited to talk about my out-of-body experiences, and the website Astral Society (A website devoted to OBEs and other related subject matter, where I had been a staff"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 25 of 105 member for some time). It gave me a chance to really open up about the subject, as I was asked to describe my experiences in great detail. I felt like it was time to be open with my family about it as well. To my amazement, I learned that some of my other family members have also had similar experiences. They are not that uncommon! In fact other psychic abilities are common as well. I have also had a few experiences with a phenomenon known as Spontaneous Remote Viewing , and recently found out that my Mother has had these visions occur as well. In these visions, you see through closed eyelids, detailed scenery and movement in real time, just as if you were watching through a pair of binoculars. Unlike with out-of-body experiences, you are completely aware that you are still in your physical body. I have since learned how to induce my out-of-body experiences more easily, and even differentiate between the different types of experiences. I have gained some degree of control over them while I am out. I also have had the opportunity to perform some experiments of my own, utilizing electromagnetic fields, and brainwave technology. I must stress though that for every success there are a few failures. I don’t propose to be an expert on this subject, but more or less someone who was given a gift and wishes to share it with others. There have been times when I tried to induce an out-of-body experience, and got close, but failed. In fact, I can get to the completely relaxed state right before separation quite easily, but"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 26 of 105 sometimes I just can’t seem to leave the physical. Still, I strive to persevere! “Journal Entry - 16/09/2003 – A Failed Attempt For some reason my sleep was very odd last night. I woke up kind of in sleep paralysis, but I was in and out of it. I could feel the pull of a spontaneous OBE and thought I would try to get out. I phased in and out of this state several times, but no matter how hard I tried, I could not get myself to separate. I think I was too over-tired and I eventually gave up and went to back to sleep.” My knowledge has increased dramatically over the years, and my spirituality has blossomed. What as a child I did not understand, I now regard as a precious gift. I wish that everyone could experience the things that I have! It affects my artwork, and my music, and my being. I find myself appreciating everything that life has to offer, and I do not fear death because I feel that I have been given proof that I will survive beyond this life. I wish to share this same knowledge, this same gift with others who also wish to journey toward enlightenment. It is my hope that others will be able to experience the awe and learn to journey out-of-body."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 27 of 105 3 3 3 . . . T T T H H H E E E O O O R R R Y Y Y S S S E E E C C C T T T I I I O O O N N N What Is An Out-Of-Body Experience? Simply put, an Out-Of-Body Experience (or OBE for short), is when the consciousness separates from the physical body and can travel and function independently thereof. It is commonly called Projection because the consciousness is in essence, projected to another realm not normally accessible from the physical reality. More difficultly put, it is an experience that can change a person forever! For some people, it is proof of life after death. For others, it opens the door to a vast uncharted territory, and suddenly they feel humbled and much smaller than they once did, recognizing and marveling in the extent and beauty of the Universe. Still, for others it remains a fearful mystery; one that they can not seem to put into perspective. There are many different theories as to what an OBE actually is, whether simply a function of the human brain, or something actually leaving the physical body. We will look at the theories in more depth later in the book, but for now I want to point out that the exact cause of the OBE does not seem to have an affect on how deeply a person is changed by it. Out-Of-Body Experiences actually happen more often than you might realize."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 28 of 105 There is a good chance that if you have never had one yourself, then you might know someone who has. A survey conducted by the sociology students of Duke University in 1954, concluded that about 27% of students had recalled having OBEs. It is not discussed widely, and most people who have not experienced it, shrug it off as a vivid dream. But for those who have experienced it, it feels much more real than any dream could. Actually, dreams and their mechanisms seem to be closely related to OBEs and I will discuss this as well in a section about dreams and lucid dreaming. For now, I will just mention that it is a common belief that we all experience the out-of-body state every night, only we do not remember. The reason could be that the experience seems to only be governed by our subconscious and not our conscious mind. Since the conscious mind can not correctly interpret the images from the subconscious, we may only remember vague images that don’t seem to make any sense. Your dreams may actually be snippets of information that your subconscious gathered while out-of-body! An out-of-body experience can happen spontaneously, for no specific reason as it does for many people worldwide, including I. It can also be learned through techniques in meditation, relaxation and will. Anyone can learn how to do it with the right skills and knowledge."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 29 of 105 The OBE Throughout History There have been many reports throughout history, from ancient cultures to modern day including in literary works by prominent authors, which describe the out-of-body experience. Ancient Egyptians knew about OBEs and also the Astral Body, which they referred to as the ‘ba’. The ancient Chinese also described the ability to travel out-of-body at will. Aboriginal tribes throughout the world practiced their vision quests. The Tibetan Book Of The Dead describes a duplicate of the physical body called the ‘bardo body’ which can lift out of the physical body. Socrates, Plato, and Plotonius all wrote about out-of-body experiences. Plato’s book The Republic describes the OBE of Er. More recent in history the author Earnest Hemmingway and the poets Alfred Lord Tennyson and Edgar Allan Poe all claimed to have had out-of-body experiences. Theories On The Out-Of-Body Experience Common OBE theories can be divided into two groups... those that believe something leaves the physical body during an OBE, and those that believe nothing leaves the physical body and that the OBE is purely physiological in nature. Here are some of the more common theories: The Consciousness Separates And Leaves The Physical Body -"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 30 of 105 To believe in this theory, we need to look at consciousness as separate from the physical brain. Consciousness controls the brain but is not a product of it. We all know that fields can exist around a physical object like a magnet, even though we can not easily see them. Consciousness can be thought of a field that extends far past the physical brain, and uses the physical brain to interact with the physical world. Quantum physics theories actually allow for this possible explanation. If consciousness exists separate from the brain, then it must be able to leave the physical brain for periods of time. Quantum mechanics allows for multiple dimensions, accounting where consciousness might travel during an OBE. We do not know all that there is to know with our current scientific knowledge, and I believe that quantum physics is only beginning to open the door to understanding phenomena like out-of-body experiences. I believe that ultimately, it will be able to be proven by science. We have just not gotten there yet. Most major religions believe in a multidimensional universe, or that this physical life is only one step our existence as spiritual beings. Therefore, most people on the planet already believe in a life after death of some sort. And if the belief of a world beyond the physical exists in so many minds, then it should not be much of a step further to believe that we can access the realms beyond this one while still in this life, through meditation and prayer."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 31 of 105 Nothing Leaves The Physical Body; Physiological Theories For OBEs: I have a friend who is currently studying for his specialty in neurology (a self proclaimed skeptic), and he was able to explain to me some of the medical theories behind OBEs. The OBE Is A Result Of Dissociation / Dislocation - Dissociative phenomena are experienced as a disruption of the normally integrated functions of memory, identity perception and consciousness. This results in a feeling of separateness and in some cases people reported seeing their physical body from a different perspective. Dissociation and/or dislocation usually happen as a result of a traumatic event, stress, or sleep deprivation. It is also linked to Multiple Personality Disorder. Dissociation may account for some OBE-like phenomena that happen from an awake state, but do not explain those instances where an OBE happened to patients during general anesthesia, or NDEs (Near Death Experiences) where the person is clinically dead, for all intents and purposes unconscious and unable to consciously experience the dissociative phenomena. Some neurologists would argue that the act of the brain dying, can stimulate certain parts of the brain, and this may account for the imagery."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 32 of 105 The OBE Is Just A Dream - The majority of OBEs happen spontaneously from within a sleep state. This suggests that OBEs could really be vivid dreams or dreams where one has become aware, called Lucid Dreaming , which will be covered later in this book. Evidence from experiments by Charles Tart in the 1960’s, have shown that OBEs do not occur within a discrete measurable state, and instead can happen in a variety of different states. Subjects that successfully projected out-of-body while hooked up to an EEG (electroencephalogram, where electrodes placed on the head can measure brainwave activity) in Tart’s laboratory were shown to have had their experience during periods of deep relaxation, heightened awareness, but not exclusively during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, which is when most dreams occur. Also of note, are the OBEs that people have reported while being under general anesthesia, and seeing the surgeon working on them as they floated above the operating table. General anesthesia is known to suppress REM sleep. Dreams are commonly believed to be Astral Projections, where we are not aware that we are projecting. Tart’s experiments only conclude that an OBE can occur in many states. That does not mean that REM can not be one of those states. It does however suggest that not all OBEs occur during a state where we are dreaming."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 33 of 105 The OBE Is A Hypnapompic/Hypnagogic Hallucination - Some people with a sleep disorder such as narcolepsy, sometimes experience vivid imagery just as they are falling asleep or upon waking. Another symptom of narcolepsy is sleep paralysis, where the person wakes up unable to move for a brief period. These symptoms are caused by elements of REM sleep intruding on the waking state. However, people who do not have narcolepsy can also experience both sleep paralysis and hypnagogic or hypnapompic hallucinations. It has been suggested that OBEs could just be vivid imagery from these hallucinations. This theory could explain some of the OBE experiences, but since Tart found that REM sleep does not necessarily have anything to do with OBEs, and the fact that OBEs have occurred while people have been under general anesthesia when they are most definitely not waking up and experiencing hallucinations, it can not account for all of the OBE type phenomena. Also of note, is that with hypnapomic and hypnagogic hallucinations, the imagery can be very different from person to person and very dream-like in quality. Common images are vague shapes and shadows that may already be in the room but are changed in the mind of person having the hallucination to resemble something else. I find it hard to believe that an OBE could be a hallucination because for everyone who experiences it, the circumstances are exactly the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 34 of 105 same, except for the location where they are projecting. The sounds and feelings experienced in an OBE do not seem to change much between individuals. And Instead of having dreamlike imagery, an OBE seems to fall on the opposite side of the spectrum, almost being too real to be a fantasy created by the mind. Sleep paralysis does play a role however, and is related to OBEs. Many people report that they were in sleep paralysis immediately prior to an OBE. It is from the paralysis state that the required vibrations seem to develop. All though not all people report having sleep paralysis episodes before their OBEs, it may just be that they were unaware of the paralysis. Deep relaxation is definitely necessary to induce an OBE, so maybe the complete body paralysis (which is relaxation at its utmost) allows an OBE to happen more easily. I have had numerous OBEs occur in conjunction with sleep paralysis episodes, where I would wake up unable to move anything but my eyes, and then immediately feel strong vibrations and hear rushing sounds in my ears. I think that when someone is in sleep paralysis, they may already be half way out-of-body. The Angular Gyrus, and Epilepsy – As described by CNN news on 19 September 2002, Neurology researchers in Switzerland reported that during a procedure for epilepsy, a patient told them she had floated above her own body and was watching herself. This happened when a particular part of the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 35 of 105 brain called the angular gyrus, in the right cortex, was stimulated by an electrode... and it happened every time the angular gyrus was stimulated. The explanation is that OBEs could be caused by a misfiring of certain parts of the brain while under stress. The angular gyrus is thought to have a role in how the brain analyzes sensory information. Of course, certain parts of the brain may indeed play a role in OBEs. I have no doubts that something physiological needs to happen to induce the consciousness to separate, and that maybe the angular gyrus is part of the equation. Where our consciousness goes when it separates, the scientists can not account for! In all the years of neuroscience, they have yet to be able to pinpoint the exact point of consciousness in our brains! I do hope they continue their quest though, as any information they can give us will help us to better understand how to induce the out- of-body state by will! The Invention Of The EEG; The Result Of A Psychic Event! Did you know that the invention of the EEG, used by doctors worldwide to diagnose many of conditions that skeptics attribute to OBEs, was actually created as a result of a psychic event!? It’s true! Hans Berger, a German physicist born in 1873, created the EEG after a personally transforming event happened to him while serving in the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 36 of 105 cavalry. One afternoon during a training exercise, his horse reared, throwing him on the road, directly in the path of a horse-drawn cannon. Just as he realized he was about to be crushed by the tremendously heavy equipment, the driver of the artillery battery was able to stop the horses just in time. Miles away at home, his sister had feelings of intense worry about the well being of her brother, at the exact moment of Hans’s accident. She sent a telegram immediately to Hans explaining her feelings. When Hans realized that somehow his fear of dying reached his sister who was far away from him physically, he became interested in trying to prove such psychic phenomena by mapping brainwaves. In the process he created the EEG that all the skeptical neurologists use today to map the function of the brain through brainwaves! It is through EEG that we also are able to understand the different brainwave states, including REM sleep. Hans had experienced telepathy, or the sending of thoughts over distances, to a recipient. If thoughts can travel outside of the physical body, then consciousness itself must be able to follow the same path!

The most commonly reported events occurring before, during, and after OBEs: Before Separation From The Physical Body – Complete relaxation, detached awareness from physical body, sleep paralysis, feeling of vibrations (these can be mild to very strong), feelings of falling or spinning, and Rapid Eye Movements (REM) while consciously awake. When I try to induce an OBE, I can bring myself into this state very easily. I relax every muscle in my body, and the vibrations and falling feelings seem to happen on their own. For the spontaneously occurring OBEs, I do not usually remember this stage. At Separation From Physical Body – Feeling as though being lifted up, loud static-like and intermittent sounds - This is when OBE is usually imminent, though it can be easily reversed at this point, usually by fear of what is about to happen, or excitement, resulting in a loss of relaxation. After Separation From Physical Body –"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 38 of 105 Blurred visions of physical surroundings at first, ability to move by thought and with fluid motion, seeing a silver shimmering cord attached to your body, witnessing the physical body from a different perspective, seeing other people go about their business and apparently having no idea that you are there. My vision during an OBE sometimes looks as if I am under water. I turn my head to look around, and things kind of look slow motion. Upon Return To The Physical Body – Feeling of being ‘slammed’ into bed and hearing a loud static-like, intermittent sounds I have had the feeling of being slammed back into my bed many times! It reminds me of two very strong magnets snapping together. Upon Full Waking – Recollection of images that seem too vivid to be a dream, memories of physical places that you’ve never been to and strong feelings of being somewhere, or interacting with a person that you know you had no physical interaction with. You may also remember some or all of the signposts above. Some of those dreams where you commented on how real they seemed to be may have been out-of- body experiences!"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 39 of 105 The Multidimensional Universe The term ‘Out-Of-Body Experience’ is used as a more broad description which includes all of the different types of conscious experiences that fall under it. It simply describes the perspective of being consciously outside of the physical body. There is however different types of OBEs that can occur, but to explain them we need to understand the concept of our existence on multiple levels. The Universe is not solely the physical realm that we can see, hear, touch, taste and smell. It is made up of different levels of reality. To different religions and belief systems, these levels go by different names. In the Buddhist religion, there are 31 distinct realms or planes of existence. To those of the Jewish Mysticism faith, there are the ten Sefirot of the Kabalistic Tree Of Life . To the Christians, there are the realms of Earth, Purgatory, Heaven, and Hell. To the student of Occult and New Age teachings, there are the seven planes of existence. No matter by what names you call them, they seem to surface in all the major religions. It seems to be a common belief; that of a multidimensional existence. In this book, we will be looking predominantly at the most common Occult or New Age teaching regarding the planes of existence, which has roots in the Tantric Buddhism tradition. Remember though that it does not matter that there are differences in names and categorizing of the planes between different religions and beliefs, only that they do exist and are attainable through out-of-body experiences!"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 40 of 105 As with the universe, the body is also much more than the physical being, and it is the other parts which enable us to interact with the higher dimensions, or planes of existence during life and to continue to survive there after physical death. These levels are connected to each other and to the planes of existence through energy fields or conduits, most commonly called Chakras . The chakras can be understood as doorways to ascending states of consciousness. It is known through science that vibration plays an integral role to our universe. String theory, which suggests that at the tiniest level, everything is made up of vibrating strings of energy, states that quite possibly the only difference between dimensional levels is the base vibration or frequency. Just as the planes or dimensions vibrate at different frequencies, so do the chakra energy centers and they can be seen or sensed as different color emanations. The seven chakra centers when in balance are thought to provide a free flow of the life energy in us all. They influence health, well being, emotions, and help form a connection to the nonphysical world as well. That is why chakra balancing exercises are often performed before attempting to induce an Out-Of-Body Experience. The projection of the consciousness to different planes of existence and interacting using the body’s corresponding nonphysical parts called Subtle Bodies, is what makes up the different types of Out- Of- Body Experiences. Some of the planes are accessible through an OBE, while others are very much above our limit of reach. There is"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 41 of 105 said to be seven steps back to the God Source or creation, and so there are seven (major) planes of existence above the physical, and also seven chakra energy centers.

And just as the planes exist at different vibrational frequencies, so do your subtle bodies; only subtle because you do not notice them during your everyday physical existence. When we project we shift consciousness to the vehicle that corresponds to the level or plane that we are visiting. It is believed that you have a subtle body to correspond to the planes above the physical. You have an etheric body, which you use to interact in the etheric plane, and an astral body which you use to interact with the astral plane. These subtle bodies have recognizable form and shape, and are the vehicles that your consciousness inhabits when you are out-of- body. The mental plane is split into lower and higher sub-planes and so there are lower and higher mental bodies to correspond to them. This is the limit of the subtle bodies, as the higher mental plane is also the limit of the awareness of the personal self. Above this, we exist as a single point of consciousness. Nonphysical Form; Physical Energy Since the etheric level is close to the physical and is actually a part of the physical plane, the etheric body has actually been recorded in the physical by means of experiments utilizing pk meters. These"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 44 of 105 instruments measure energy, and were placed in front of placards displaying symbols, in such a way that it would be impossible to see that placard without being directly in front of the pk meter. The subjects would project and attempt to correctly identify the symbol. On the occasions where the symbols were correctly identified, there was a marked increase in the energy reading taken by the pk meter. I do not recall where I once read this, so I can not comment on the validity of these experiments, however if they are true, they could prove that the etheric body can be recorded in the physical plane as a form of energy. There is also a slight but measurable weight decrease of the physical body during exteriorization. Dutch scientists successfully measured the weight of the physical body before, during and after a projection, and found that during the OBE, there was a measurable decrease in the weight of the physical body by about 2.25 grams. There was a case in the United States where a test subject by the name of Alex Tanous (who was able to OBE at will) projected to a different location where a psychic medium named Christine Whiting was waiting to see if she could perceive his presence. In this highly successful experiment, Alex was able to project to the location, and Christine was able to identify the exact location where he was standing, and even more surprisingly, she was able to describe exactly what he was wearing! This means that the physical energy of a nonphysical form can be perceived by people who have some degree of psychic ability."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 45 of 105 OBE vs. Astral Projection Many authors on the subject of Out-Of-Body Experiences, seem to incorrectly lump all OBEs into the definition of Astral Projection. This leads beginners astray, as the experiences are very unique compared to each other and deserve to be treated as such. Most Out-Of-Body Experiences, especially those that are spontaneous, occur on the etheric plane. These experiences are also sometimes called Etheric Projection or Real-Time projections because the etheric plane resides so close to the physical plane that physical surroundings are perceived in real time. These experiences would be the typical descriptions of floating over and seeing the physical body. Self induced OBEs can also take place on the etheric plane. The astral plane resides just above the etheric plane, and OBEs that occur on this plane may be more mistaken for dreams due to their obscure and mystical nature. It is believed that these OBEs called Astral Projection , can help us access multitudes of information about our existence and the underlying workings of our own physical world. Thought can also induce imagery here, adding to the mystical qualities of astral projections. Dreams are believed to be astral projections. The third plane above the physical is the mental plane, and not much is known about it. This type of projection would be referred to as mental projection. I have only ever read a few accounts of OBEs traveling to this plane, and it is unsure whether the subjects were"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 46 of 105 really there, or just on a higher sublevel of the astral plane. It is uncertain just where the limit is reached during an OBE, though the majority of experiences take place as either etheric or astral projections. Mental projection would encompass any projection above the realm of the astral plane. The Planes Of Existence & Projection The Physical & Etheric Planes The Physical Plane is the lowest plane of the seven, and is where we all consciously exist. It encompasses the world we see with our physical eyes and interact with. It also includes the other planets, the stars, and the galaxies. It is the physical universe as we know it. It corresponds to a chakra energy point known as the ‘base, or root center’ and is found to be located near the base of the spine. The energy vibration for this chakra and level is represented by the color emanation of red. Included within the Physical Plane and lying just above it, is the Etheric Plane which is like an overlay on top of the Physical Plane. Though it is so closely connected to the physical, it is not visible using physical senses. It is what connects everything in the Physical Plane and also everything which is beyond our normal physical senses. The Etheric Plane can actually be explained and understood through modern science, even though we can not see it with the physical senses."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 47 of 105 The Theory Of The Ether We know that physical matter which appears to be solid is actually the opposite. If you look at any physical object up close you will see that it is made up of an immense number of electrons which are in vibration and revolve round a central point which is known as a neutron. Matter consists of atoms and these atoms are composed of electrons and protons which are held together by electromagnetic forces. Matter is built up of tiny electric charges, both positive and negative which are not moving at random, but are connected together in an orderly fashion by the invisible universal elements called the Ether. There are many varied vibrations of the Ether. One form of this ethereal wave motion can be seen in the physical world as light. There are other forms which give us heat, color, electricity, ectoplasm, etc. This unseen Ether gives us the ability to live and to think and to interact. The Ether is never at rest. It is a cosmic link which is always in motion. It cannot be sensed using physical senses, yet if it did not exist we would all be blind, deaf and cold as there would be no medium to carry the sound and light and heat waves. Matter itself is essentially etheric. Electrons in the atoms are particles of negative electricity and the protons are considered by scientists as being electric in nature. Both are etheric which means that physical matter is simply Ether in a state of constant and varying vibration."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 48 of 105 This Ether is our connection between the physical senses and the higher cosmic forces, or the nonphysical world. Our physical senses only respond to a very limited range of these vibrations however. Beyond this, the universe is teaming full of life and energies which respond to higher ranges of vibrations, beyond what we can normally hear or see or feel. Our ordinary senses (sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing) are greatly limited. We only experience a small amount of what exists in the universe out there. For example, we see only a limited range of light but we know through the advances of science and an instrument known as a spectroscope that beyond that limited range also exists ultraviolet light and infrared light. The ethereal forces influence and control the Physical Plane in many ways. They create form and hold together. They have the ability to give matter life, vitality, and power. The Ether is the conduit of essential life forces in the universe. The Etheric Body Living organisms (both animal and plant) are surrounded by and influenced by the Ether just as inanimate objects like rocks and metals are. The ethereal forces are gathered and concentrated in living organisms and form what is called the Etheric Body, which exists within and beyond the Physical Body and is an exact duplicate of it, even down to the tiniest cell. The Etheric Body which is also known as the vital body, extends beyond the dense Physical Body just as the ethereal region of earth extends beyond the dense physical part of the planet. The distance of"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 49 of 105 this extension is about an inch and a half past the Physical Body and is visible to some people as an energy emanation which is called the Aura. It corresponds to the chakra point known as the ‘root center’. It is found at the base of the spine, and the energy vibration found in the Etheric Plane and the root center chakra emanates as a subtle red. The Physical and Etheric bodies are both made up of physical energy, and are both left behind when physical death occurs. The essentially function together as one, but the Etheric Body can also function independently. Etheric Projection The Etheric Body plays a very important role in physical life as well as developing nonphysical and psychic abilities. Nearly all those who find themselves in a spontaneous out-of-body experience will be in Etheric Projection (projection to the Etheric Plane and consciously working through the Etheric Body) which is why they can identify physical objects, people and places. Most of my own excursions out- of-body were ethereal in nature. Most descriptions of Out-Of- Body Experiences are actually describing Etheric Projections. During an Etheric Projection, you may encounter others who are also out-of-body and communicate with them. I have also read that earth-bound entities reside on the Etheric Plane unable to ascend to the Astral, and you may also encounter them. (I must add though that in all of my own experiences I have never encountered one.)"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 50 of 105 People who have experienced Etheric Projection and looked into a mirror have reported that they could see through themselves, as if they were a ghost. This is likely due to the ethereal nature of the Etheric Body which is normally beyond the physical senses. Since these people have become conscious in their Etheric Body, they are able to see beyond the limits of the physical senses and they describe it as looking transparent and ‘not-quite’ physical. I remember during one of my own Etheric Projections I had raised my arm to look at it. I had thought to myself that if I was in fact outside my physical body, I should be able to see some sort of difference in the appearance of my arm, or have no visible arm at all. My arm which I assure you was still there, looked pale and translucent, and I could see an object on the other side of the room through it. It was the major validating point in that experience, which was also the first one I had ever successfully induced on my own. Since the Etheric Plane resides so near the physical and basically the Physical Plane is part of it, the Etheric Body tends to retain some of the properties of the physical. It is made up of ethereal substance (the Ether) which is somewhat dense in nature as compared to the energy of the higher planes. During Etheric Projection, at first the Etheric Body may also seem heavy and it may be difficult to move about. Vision may be somewhat hindered and sounds may be distorted. From my own personal experiences, I found that each time you are out-of-body it becomes easier to move around freely and fully"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 51 of 105 observe your surroundings. I believe this is because the more you project, the more you are willing to let go of your stronghold to the physical as you begin to lose your fears associated with being in this state. The Astral Level The Astral Plane The third plane, the Astral Plane exists above the physical and Etheric Planes and thus has a higher vibrational frequency. It is not made up of matter in a physical sense and time and space are distorted as compared to the physical. As a result, time can pass differently than in the physical. Thought also plays an integral part to function in the Astral Plane, and simply imagining something while there can cause it to form. Since this is where all of our hopes, desires, and dreams can essentially become reality, it is also known as the emotional plane. Residing here are many beings including people who are out-of-body both consciously and sub-consciously, people who are dreaming, the deceased, and even beings who never existed on the Physical Plane at all. Communication with all of the above is possible while Astrally Projecting. The Astral Plane is made up of many sub planes, or levels. The higher the level, the more light and beauty, while the lower levels tend to be darker and more dense. Negative type entities can be"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 52 of 105 encountered on the lower astral sub-planes, though they can do no real harm to someone projecting there. People who have successfully consciously projected to the Astral Plane have described vivid colors and sounds, breathtaking landscapes and scenery, and even some things beyond our comprehension. It is said that the Akashic Records , a chronicle of all existence, resides in the astral. In my own few excursions to the Astral Plane, I saw exquisite beauty. Everything including inanimate objects, had obvious auras of energy emanating from them in vivid and bright colors. This is something I had never witnessed on the Physical Plane or even during Etheric Projection. The Astral Body In our physical world our mind works with our Physical Body, using the physical senses. Therefore, our Physical Body is a vehicle that we use to interact with the physical world. The same principle applies for when we are experiencing Astral Projection. When we are out- of-body, we project our consciousness into a duplicate of ourselves that exists outside of the physical world. The Astral Body (also known as the emotional body or astrosome ) is the vehicle we use to interact with the non-physical world called the Astral Plane. Its’ chakra correlation is found just below the navel, and is called the ‘sacral’ center or ‘spleen’ center. The color of the energy vibrations from this chakra center emanates as a subtle orange."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 53 of 105 People who have experienced Astral Projection have reported being able to see their Astral Body just as they would see their Physical Body. So it seems that the Astral Body is made up of a substance that can interact with the Astral Plane just as the Physical Body interacts with the Physical Plane. The reason for this is that the frequency of the astral body is higher than that of the etheric or physical bodies and is in vibratory sync with the Astral Plane. This substance which is lighter than the ether, is sometimes referred to simply as astral substance . The appearance of the Astral Body can be changed by will, however most of the time it appears to be the same as the Physical Body. Astral Projection An Out-Of-Body Experience in which the traveler finds their way to The Astral Plane, is referred to as Astral Projection. Astral projections are often confused as dreams due to their mystical qualities. Actually, I believe that dreams ARE astral projections, but we are just not conscious of the fact. The Mental Level The Mental Plane The next plane above the Astral Plane, is called the Mental Plane. It is a plane full of rainbows of vivid colors. It would be an impossible task to try and rationalize this place. This plane can be described from its"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 54 of 105 name and is full of thoughts, dreams, and ideas, which are manifested as real objects. Those who find themselves here could be traveling through and witnessing their own thoughts, or the thoughts of others. It is a place of peace and utter bliss. The Mental plane is divided into two parts, the Lower Mental Plane and the Higher Mental Plane. Since the Lower Mental Plane overlaps the Astral Plane, they can often be confused for one another. The boundary between the Lower and Upper Mental planes is also the boundary of what is referred to as the Lower Self and the Higher Self . Time here is distorted even more than it is in the Astral Plane and it is possible to see future or past events. The Lower Mental Body & Mental Bodies There are two subtle bodies that correspond to the Lower and Higher Mental Planes. They are known as the Lower Mental Body and the Higher Mental Body, and these are the vehicles one would use to interact with these sub-planes. The upper limit of the Higher Mental Plane is also the limit of the awareness of the Personal Self and individuality as we know it, and so is also the limit of the subtle bodies. The corresponding chakra point for the limit of the Lower Mental Plane is known as the ‘solar plexus’ and is represented as the color yellow. It is located at the base of the sternum. For the Upper Mental Plane, it is the ‘heart’ center and is represented by the color green."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 55 of 105 Mental Projection The Mental Plane is harder to reach than the previous two, but nonetheless it is achievable during an Out-Of-Body Experience. Traveling to and above the Mental Plane, is referred to as Mental Projection, but this type of OBE is very rare. The Higher Levels The Buddhic Plane The Buddhic plane which is also known as the intuitive plane, resides just above the Upper Mental Plane. It is the last attainable plane to humans while still living in a physical sense. There is no subtle body as such that corresponds with this plane and the reason for this is that it is above the highest limit of individuality, and exists as part of the Higher Self. It is a place where everything exists in unity. It is a place of universality and oneness; love and peace. If you were to reach this place, you would likely not wish to return. It is a place where you would feel like you were one with everything; an understanding of your true nature with the universe and individuality would have no meaning to you anymore. You would still retain the awareness of the ‘Self‘, though you would feel as if you were one with your own creation and being. There are two chakra points which intersect the Buddhic Plane. The one which corresponds to the middle of the Buddhic Plane can be"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 56 of 105 found in the mid throat and is known as the ‘throat center’ It is represented by the color emanation of blue. The upper boundary of the Buddhic Plane is represented by the chakra point in the middle of the forehead called the ‘brow or third-eye center’ and is emanated as the color purple. The At(o)mic Plane Above the Buddhic Plane lies the At(o)mic Plane, which is the highest limit of Material Being and where there exists no individuality. This is a very spiritual place, which is filled with radiant silver light that would be impossible for us to look at physically without being blinded. In reaching this plane however, it would seem very bright yet soft and filled with love. Some people have claimed to have had visions of this plane but I have found no reference to any live person reaching this place through conscious projection. It is believed that only when we are finished with our life cycles on the Physical Plane and ready to ascend spiritually, can we actually reach this plane of existence. The At(o)mic Limit & Great Planes The upper boundary of the At(o)mic Plane is also known as the At(o)mic Limit and the planes above this limit are referred to as the Great Planes. The upper limit of the At(o)mic Plane corresponds to the chakra center known as the ‘crown center’ which is located just above the head and represented by a brilliant white color."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 57 of 105 The Anupadaka Plane The Anupadaka plane is part of the Great Planes, and the first plane of Non-Material Being. Therefore, if one could experience this realm, they would be only a point of consciousness in a place where everything is a part of everything else. It is said that this place is where all paradoxes are tied together and would be beyond our current limited comprehension. It is the upper boundary of Essential Form. There are no chakra points that correspond to this realm. It is also said that millions of beings inhabit this place, but to try and understand their nature would be futile. It could be compared to a bacterium trying to understand the nature of a human; an impossible task. The Adi Plane & ‘God’ Source The Adi Plane is the highest plane of the seven planes of existence and encompasses the sub-planes of Essential Light and Sound, and Universal Intelligence. It is a place (like the Anupadaka Plane) which we could never comprehend at our current level. It is the plane of Non-Essential Form, and Completion. This plane is above the limit of “Self” or “I AM” and is infinite, timeless, formless, changeless, and indescribable."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 58 of 105 This is the last of the seven planes of existence, and is also the last step back to the ‘God’ source or the source of all creation. The OBE Roadmap Being able to consciously induce OBEs can be a very exciting and awe inspiring experience. In etheric projection you can travel to any physical place and witness events there. There is no limit to where you can go. People have even went into outer space during an out- of-body experience! In astral travel, you can witness things indescribable in the physical world, and gain knowledge about the underlying function of life in the physical. You can even effect positive change on the physical from within the astral! This often brings up one of the most frequently asked questions about OBEs: “Can I get lost?” The answer is that no, you can not get lost. You always seem to know where to go and how to get there. There is no easy explanation of how we have this uncanny ability for directions...it just exists, although some spiritualists believe there is an invisible energy grid that encompasses the earth, and that we may be using this grid to navigate, at least in etheric or ‘real time’ projections where we see the physical world. These grid lines are called Lay Lines . You also have the ability to find your way back to the physical body, no matter what."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 59 of 105 The Silver Cord You are always to remain connected to your physical body by an infinitely stretchable cord of energy. It has been referred to as the silver cord, because it appears to shimmer and looks silver in color. It connects you to your physical body so that autonomic responses like breathing can be sustained. This cord can not be broken until physical death occurs, and nothing that you can do while you are in an out-of-body experience can sever it. This cord will allow you to find your way back, no matter where you travel to in an OBE. Though not everyone actually sees it, the silver cord is always there. The silvery shimmering description could very well be just how we can express it in words that people can understand. Myself, I believe that the silver cord is really just a conduit of pure energy.....the energy of our life source. The Silver Cord has reference in the Christian Holy Bible: Ecclesiastes 12:6-7 Remember him-before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, or the wheel broken at the well, and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 60 of 105 Entities And Interactions While in an out-of-body experience, you have the ability to interact with a number of different beings. These are as follows: 1. Other people who are consciously out-of-body as you are; 2. People who are unconsciously projecting or dreaming; 3. People who are deceased; 4. Beings who inhabit the higher planes and who were never human. You can interact with another person who is consciously in an OBE. Some groups of people set up a physical place and time and attempt to meet there in an etheric projection OBE. While in astral projection, you can interact with people who are dreaming, though they will only tend to incorporate you into their dream imagery and not remember the contact took place. Many people have reported seeing deceased relatives or friends during astral projection OBEs. They were able to communicate with them, and gain assurance that their loved ones are okay and not really very far away. I have had one such experience where I was able to communicate briefly with my Father who had passed away. I also believe that in etheric projections you can possibly encounter earth bound spirits of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 61 of 105 the deceased who have not yet shed their etheric body and moved on to the astral plane. Beings that inhabit the higher planes that were never human, were also interacted with by people who were projecting. These beings have been referred to as angels, or elementals. Negative Entities I believe that no entities are truly evil, and those who are unkind are actually tormented and in pain. In all of my personal experiences, I have never encountered any negative beings, though others have reported running into a malicious entity while in an OBE. We know that entities of all types exist on the Astral Plane, which is made up of many sub-levels. Negative entities usually reside on the lower Astral, and feed off of fear. I have read accounts of people who have engaged in psychic battle with these beings while out-of- body and no real harm has come to them. The most that these tormented entities can do to you is rob you of energy, which in all likelihood will just send you immediately back to the physical. You may wake up feeling more tired than usual. Remember though, your ‘soul’ is eternal and can not be harmed."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 62 of 105 About Astral Sex Astral Sex is a very misunderstood subject, because it’s less like physical sex and more like an intermingling of energy and emotion. Imagine your innermost and deepest feelings and then sharing them with someone so that simultaneously you both feel whatever the other person is feeling. These feelings are pure emotion, not physical in nature, nor do they compare to any physical feeling at all. It’s like feeling love on a whole new level. In the physical world we are so consumed by the physical feeling of pleasure that often times we lose the emotional aspect of relationships. That’s why so many relationships fail these days. We have become less able to communicate with others, especially those close to us. If two people who love each other can project at the same time, they can interact with each other, even if they are far apart from each other on the physical plane. And when they interact they can share in something much deeper than they have ever experienced on the physical. Truly, two bodies become one. This is achieved simply by both people desiring to connect in this special way. Since it is believed that we all experience Astral Projection every night as we sleep, it is entirely possible that many dreams are really projections. Many people have described that when their partner was away on business for example, they had a vivid dream of being with their partner. In some cases, both people remember having a similar dream. These dreams could have really been Astral Projections."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 63 of 105 Out-Of-Body Experience Myth vs. Truth Just as there are many theories surrounding the phenomenon of the Out-Of-Body Experience, there too exist many myths and untruths about it. The real truth is, that we don’t know as much as we would like to about the experience. All of the information that we read came about by others sharing their deeply personal experiences, which are subject to their own interpretations. For those who have not experienced an OBE, these sometimes highly descriptive accounts can be hard for someone to understand. These people either dismiss the experience as a dream or a fake, or in some instances, they associate it with evil. Throughout the ages, all types of psychic phenomenon and abilities have been labeled by the Church as being deception delivered by evil. Even the experiences had by highly religious monks while in deep meditations, were thought to be only attainable by those who were in such a high religious position. For the regular population, they were never able to receive such gifts from above. So they kept their secret gifts highly guarded for fears of being labeled a witch or allying with the Devil. As a race we have certainly come a long way since the religious reign of the Middle Ages, but the thought that such phenomenon is evil still exists to a degree. Trying to dispel this myth are the many normal, everyday people who have experienced an OBE, either by will or in"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 64 of 105 most cases spontaneously. In the past ten years or so, I have noticed a good number of people coming forward to tell their stories. The experiences described by those who have been in the OBE state, including myself, though not always easy to understand or interpret, almost never speak of evil, or deception. In fact, the opposite is true. The descriptions are of beauty... such sounds and colors and feelings that can not be expressed in words. It’s no wonder that people can not understand when we try to explain!"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 65 of 105 4 4 4 . . . R R R E E E L L L A A A T T T E E E D D D E E E X X X P P P E E E R R R I I I E E E N N N C C C E E E S S S Dreams & Lucid Dreaming Every night when we sleep, we go through several different cycles or states, where the brain will operate at different brainwave frequencies. When we are dreaming we are in REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. During this time, the mind is active and viewing imagery. We are usually unaware that we are in a dream. We act in our dream as if it were reality. The imagery we see in a dream can be vague and mystical, not unlike an astral projection. It is a common belief that dreams are really astral projections, but we are not conscious of that fact. Since our subconscious mind is in control of the experience, the imagery we remember may not make sense. We are essentially wandering around the astral plane without our conscious faculties intact. Sometimes, you may find yourself in a dream, and aware that you are dreaming. This phenomenon is referred to as lucid dreaming. This can be achieved by will or it can sometimes happen spontaneously. This is where it can start to get confusing. If a dream is really an astral projection without conscious awareness, and a lucid dream is where someone becomes consciously aware of that they are dreaming, is that not then an astral projection? I believe that lucid dreaming is a state kind of in between a conscious astral"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 66 of 105 projection and dreaming; A state where you are aware that you are creating imagery by thought, but not quite conscious to the fact that you are out-of-body. All it takes to induce a fully conscious astral projection from within a lucid dream, is to simply step out of the fantasy imagery world your mind has created. Simply will yourself to. It has been shown through experiments by Charles Tart in the 1960s that not all OBEs happen during REM sleep, which is when dreams usually occur. In fact, he could find no discrete OBE state when comparing EEG readings between different subjects and their OBEs. So a dream could possibly be an OBE, but OBEs are not all dreams. Sleep Paralysis Overview Sleep paralysis usually happens to people who have a sleep disorder such as narcolepsy, but can also happen to those who do not have narcolepsy (isolated sleep paralysis). In either case, it can be a frightening incident where one wakes unable to move to a brief period of time. Every time we dream our brain sends out signals to paralyze the extremities so that we do not physically act out our dreams. It is completely normal and a necessary function of sleep or else everyone would be thrashing around in their beds. This paralysis usually wears off before we wake up. During a sleep paralysis episode, the paralysis effect has not entirely worn off before the person starts to become conscious. Sleep"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 67 of 105 paralysis is an element of REM sleep that encroaches on the waking state. Essentially, the person is partially awake and partially asleep, and other elements of REM sleep can also ensue, such as experiencing vivid dream imagery (called hypnagogic hallucinations if falling asleep, and hypnapompic hallucinations if waking up). If you ever find yourself in sleep paralysis and want to get out of it, simply concentrate on your pinky finger and try to move just that finger, then your hand, and by then you are usually out of it. Sleep Paralysis only lasts moments but can feel like a lifetime. There is no danger at all to the person who is experiencing sleep paralysis. The Link Between Sleep Paralysis & OBEs: There has long been thought that Sleep Paralysis is related to OBEs. It has been my experience that this belief is true. I have had many episodes of sleep paralysis where spontaneous OBEs often immediately followed. I have also found that if I awaken in sleep paralysis, the feeling of being dissociated from my physical body makes it very easy to induce an OBE simply by will alone. All of my sleep paralysis related OBEs have been etheric in nature."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 68 of 105 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) Essentially, a Near Death Experience is an out-of-body experience, but with a few differences. Near Death Experiences (or NDE for short) are very similar to an etheric projection, in that the physical surroundings can be seen and the visual point is usually floating over the physical body to start with. People who have had NDEs, have reported that they could hear and see their loved ones around them in their hospital room, or maybe the surgeon working on them if they were in surgery. Some have said that they could see their silver cord shimmering behind them. They are at this point in an etheric projection, but what differentiates this from a regular OBE is that it is the threshold between physical life and death. The physical body has died, and the consciousness is now within the etheric body. Those who have experienced NDEs were on the brink between this world and the next. They have been clinically dead, their hearts stopped beating for a time. One difference between an NDE and an OBE is that during an NDE a common sight is the tunnel and the light at the end. This is not present with regular OBEs. It is my belief that this vantage point is looking through the silver cord and into the next plane, like a conduit or a wormhole of sorts."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 69 of 105 In etheric projection where we stay close to the physical, the silver cord just remains as an attachment between our physical body and our etheric body. In astral projection, we travel along the silver cord on the outside, leaving it attached to the physical while our consciousness enters the astral plane. In death, we pass through it like a tunnel or a wormhole, and pull it with us collapsing it from the inside, effectively cutting it off from the physical body as we travel toward the light of the astral plane. Unlike astral projection, this journey is one way, as we are taking the seed with us. Once the silver cord is severed, it is impossible to revive the physical body, or at least its consciousness. The physical body can be kept on life support, but the consciousness can never return. These are my own thoughts about the tunnel and the light. Another feature of an NDE seems to be what as known as self judgment. An entire life’s worth of flashbacks, all of the good and the bad are replayed in their entirety, but this flashback may only take a very short time to happen. It is the soul’s time to reflect on what it has learned in this life and ultimately, it is the soul’s own judgment that directs what happens next. Some people have returned from the brink with stories of a hellish place full of torment, and others have reported pure beauty. The astral plane is divided into sub planes, the lowest of which are places of sadness and despair. The highest sub planes are filled with beauty."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 70 of 105 All sub planes however retain the features of the astral plane, that being thought creates, and qualities are mystical. So then, the inhabitants of the lowest sub planes are creating their own hell, while those in the higher sub planes are creating their paradise. During a NDE, one can catch a glimpse of what is to come. Those who have found themselves on the lower levels during a NDE have looked at it as a chance to change their ways during this life. Remote Viewing In recent years I have had some experiences that seemed related to OBEs but were happening while I was aware that I was still inside my physical body. I would wake up after being asleep for awhile, and with my eyes still closed, I could see through my eyelids. The scenery was not of my immediate surroundings. One seemed to include a valley with chalet style houses and mountains in the background. I could make out wisps of smoke coming up from a chimney. I do not know where this place was, but the imagery was vivid. It was like I was watching from a higher point, looking down into the valley, as if I was really there. I still get these visions once in awhile. The imagery is not always clear at first. It is kind dark and shadowy, lacking color and hard to focus. Only after I concentrate on bringing it into focus, do I start to see the colors and details more clearly."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 71 of 105 I was not asleep for these occurrences. I know I was completely awake. And these were not OBEs, as I knew I was still in my physical body. But what were they? Remote viewing is a phenomenon where someone can receive images, sounds, and even smells from a remote place by concentrating on that place, or as in my case spontaneously. Sometimes the imagery is vague and consists of basic impressions of shapes. Other times it can be so vivid it is like you are actually there as an observer. Remote Viewing is a separate phenomenon from the out-of-body experience. It is a form of clairvoyance; a psychic ability."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 72 of 105"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 73 of 105 5 5 5 . . . P P P E E E R R R S S S O O O N N N A A A L L L O O O B B B S S S E E E R R R V V V A A A T T T I I I O O O N N N S S S Having had some fairly vivid and intense experiences, and through some personal experiments with OBEs, I have been able to make some observations concerning the phenomenon: Observation 1 We Are Beings Of Energy And Light On the evening of October 16th, 2001, I experienced the most devastating night of my life. I watched my Father pass away right in front of me. It was sudden, and due to an illness and it was unexpected. My Mother and I stood by his side in the hospital as he slipped away. I was distraught and every last bit of my soul wanted some sort of proof that death was not the end. I had started to doubt my experiences with OBEs, and starting imagining that death ends with everything going black. I was scared at that thought of our imminent destiny. In my quiet time alone, the day after he died, I asked him for some proof that he was ok. I needed it. The full days after my Father passed away, we received a 2.5 minute long message on our answering machine. It was garbled, and sounded like static. The voice that could be barely made out under all the distortion, sounded almost electronic. The machine I should mention was a digital machine, and had no tape. Since I am somewhat good"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 74 of 105 with audio, I managed to clean up the message and to my awe, there were things said in it that answered questions I had asked when I was completely alone, the day after my Father died! There was no way it could be a fake! I can’t prove this to anyone of course, without being accused of forging the message myself, but at least I know. I have proof for myself. He heard me. He answered me. Getting back to the topic of OBEs, something he had said in that message prompted me to think. He distinctly said “Remember the light”. That flooded me with memories of the exact point of separation during an OBE. In the section about signposts, you might recall reading about static-like sounds. Those sounds always reminded me of energy, and it’s the only way I can describe them. They were always there when I was either separating from my physical body or returning. It was like when I was leaving the physical, I was changing into a form that was pure energy. I don’t believe that we currently know all there is to know about energy, and how it behaves and interacts with the universe. I believe that we are somehow a part of it, like a drop in an infinite pool. In that moment between physical and nonphysical I felt connected to everything and at the same time a part of everything.... I believe I got a small glimpse into our true nature. You might be familiar with the words “As above; So Below” This phrase comes from the Emerald Tablet , a revered magickal document in the western occultism. It suggests that this world, the microcosm, is created in"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 75 of 105 the exact image of the world above, the macrocosm. The universe is God, and God is the universe. God is the light, and we are all a part of that light. We are separate but we are one. Our ultimate journey is back toward the light, toward God and our true identity. I think this is what my father meant in his message. Observation 2 The Electromagnetic Connection I have always believed that there was some sort of connection between OBEs and electromagnetic energy. This is due to several reasons. The static-like rushing sounds that occur at separation seem to sound exactly like electricity, and electromagnetic energy has been proven to interact with the universe at an intrinsic level. I have actually had the chance to test my theory! I have to tell you a little bit about my career in order to explain how. I am in the Navy, and serve on board a ship. Ship’s have a metal hull which over time accumulates a magnetic signature from all the stored up energy that the metal picks up. If left as is, this electromagnetic signature would allow enemy nations to easily detect and classify a warship. And even worse, the signature could set off a magnetic mine if the ship sailed over one. In order to rectify this problem we need to periodically erase the magnetic traces in the hull. It’s a long drawn out process where the ship is wrapped in large electric cables fore to aft, and then electricity is passed through the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 76 of 105 cables in timed bursts. At first the bursts are stronger and last longer, and at the end the bursts are weaker and sorter in duration. Essentially this turns the entire ship into a large electromagnet. (They even tell us to not have credit cards etc within a few feet of the outside of the hull) We stay inside all the time this happens, over a period of a few days. While off watch the first night, I decided to try an experiment. I tried to have an OBE. Specifically I tried to Astral Project. I was not only successful with minimal effort on my part, but it was also the most vivid OBE I have had to this day! As you recall, astral projection can sometimes be confused with a dream, because of dreamlike qualities. To put this in perspective, try imagining that you can see sound and hear color. That’s really the only way I can describe it. Everything emanated with a colorful glow. Inanimate objects had bright auras. The colors affected you inside, and you could see vibrations all around, like music was in the air. I also was able to contact my Father who passed away. I still remember vividly how he looked. He took on the appearance of a much younger man, about 30 years old (He was 53 when he passed away), and in his eyes could see energy sparkling about. I was able to get out one sentence before I realized that I was really there and pulled back. I remember yelling “No! I don’t want to go back yet!” and then I awoke in my bunk on the ship."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 77 of 105 That experience has led me to conclude that electromagnetic energy acts as a catalyst for inducing Astral Projection (quite possibly etheric projection as well), and help to maintain conscious clarity during the experience. Even though I have projected many times since then, I have not been able to have as vivid an experience as that one. With regards to electromagnetic fields and etheric or real-time projection, I know of a friend who during his OBE, decided to put his etheric hand through his computer while he was out. When he later checked his computer, he found his hard drive had been badly damaged with many files missing, to the tune of about 10 gigabytes of data. It was as if a magnet had been passed over it. It seems that our etheric body gives off a rather strong electromagnetic field itself! Observation 3 Duality During An OBE : An Experiment With An Empath I remember an experiment I once did with a close friend of mine who confided in me that he has empathic abilities. Basically he can sense the emotions of anyone he comes in contact with. One afternoon, I lay down on the living room floor in his apartment, and tried to induce an out-of-body experience. During this time, he tried to focus on anything he was receiving empathically from me."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 78 of 105 The OBE was successful, and after I returned, he explained to me that he had felt a distinct separation of me, like there were actually two of me in the room. He described it as a shockwave in the room that was me, and he could sense me in two distinct locations at one time. Here is what he had to say about the experience: “It's like this enormous wave of everything I had come to associate with you emotionally exploded out of you and filled the room. Then you were in two places at once for a moment. Then it was gone. Like a rocket blasted off right next to me... From the moment that I sensed a duality, it was like there were two centers that were you; two distinct centers of emotions that were you. One was a concentrated cloud, the other much larger, but more vaporous.” - M. Campbell For me, this experiment was proof that the etheric body can in fact be sensed by a person with some degree of psychic ability. But beyond that, it gave me in words, an explanation of the duality that exists when you are out-of-body. We already know that during an OBE, we are still connected to the physical body through the silver cord. But even more than that, I believe that we actually exist in both places at once. This is a bit contradictory to the traditional thought that our consciousness leaves the physical and is only connected with enough energy to"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 79 of 105 maintain autonomic functions and to respond if the physical body is disturbed. I find myself understanding the idea that we actually exist as a single point of consciousness, existing in multiple places at once. After all, our subtle bodies are always there even though we can not always perceive them. We only seem able to maintain an awareness of one vantage point at a time however. So when we talk about separation from the physical, it’s purely within that sense of shifting awareness but we are still fully in the physical as well. Scientific theory can shed some light on this. It comes from an experiment I read about in quantum physics, where a particle was proven to exist in two places at once. The particle did not split into two separate particles that were similar; in fact it was shown that the same particle actually existed in two different places at once."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 80 of 105"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 81 of 105 6 6 6 . . . P P P R R R A A A C C C T T T I I I C C C A A A L L L S S S E E E C C C T T T I I I O O O N N N Out-Of-Body Experience Preliminaries If you read this far, and are serious about wanting to experience the Out-Of-Body state, then a few things need to be stressed at this point. Learning how to have an OBE takes dedication and patience, and lots of practice! If you have experienced OBEs spontaneously at some point in your life, you will already have an advantage. However, please note that anyone can learn to project! It’s an inherent, albeit dormant ability that we humans possess. There are three key elements that are difficult to overcome: Belief, Relaxation, and Fear. Belief Though relaxation and fear play a big role in successful separation, belief is the key factor. If you set upon this journey with any doubt that OBEs are real, you will undoubtedly fail. You need to have belief in the experience, and belief in yourself and your abilities. This is often difficult to overcome, since you can tell yourself you believe that something is real, but until you experience it for yourself, you still hold an inherent doubt. This is a product of the physical being, and of society’s teachings. We are brought up to doubt that which we can not understand. And the only way to understand is to experience."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 82 of 105 One might think this an impossible obstacle to overcome, but daily affirmations will help to reverse the cycle. They can be as simple as reciting “I believe” several times at different points throughout the day, or just before retiring for the night. Relaxation Relaxation is of utmost importance. Whatever helps you to relax is beneficial. Relaxing may sound easier than it really is! You have to completely let go of all that you know. If you are the least bit excited about wanting to experience something, you will not be relaxed enough to let go. Some people use candles, relaxing music, dim lights, etc. There is a need for no distraction. Also, you can use Focused Relaxation (discussed under methods) as a preliminary to other methods, as well as using it alone as a primary method. Overcoming Fear The third element is fear. Humans have a built-in fear of the unknown. It’s an inescapable part of our psyche. It is also very difficult to overcome. How can you learn to not fear something that you do not understand? You are going to be treading into an entirely new territory; a journey that you must complete alone. The best way to conquer fear is to realize that the only thing to fear is fear itself. Listen to, or read the stories of the many people who have been there. They will all tell you that the experience is not only"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 83 of 105 safe, but the most rewarding inner spiritual journey that many of them have had the chance to experience! Again, affirmations can also help with this element. Body Position It is generally recommended that you position yourself on your back, with your arms at your sides, but many people (including myself) have induced OBEs while laying on their side. A small number of people have had brief experiences from a sitting position. I recommend just finding a position that you find most comfortable and able to relax, and go with that. I have found that I have more success if I am lying on my back and my body is positioned so that I am lying North to South, with my head pointing to the North. This lends more credence to the electromagnetic theory. Focused Relaxation In order to achieve a fully conscious OBE, one must first attain the body asleep / mind awake state. This requires deep relaxation. You should make sure there are no outside influences that will disturb you while you are attempting to relax. Unplug the telephone, shut the door to keep the dog out, and send the kids to the neighbors place. Remove any jewelry and wear loose fitting comfortable clothing."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 84 of 105 You can either be under the blankets or on top, but make sure the blankets are not too heavy or constricting. Lay on your back, hands by your sides, and being to breathe rhythmically: In 2-3-4, Out 2-3-4, In 2-3-4, Out 2-3-4 and so on. Start from the feet, and working upward, flex and relax the muscle groups along the way. Flex, hold for 10 seconds, then release. Work your way to your head, paying particular attention to the neck muscles and the forehead where a lot of tension is usually stored. Make sure to really feel the muscle groups relaxing as you let go. By the time you have completely relaxed, your body may feel almost numb. This is normal. This is what you want to happen. You will start to lose perception of the physical. You can use this as a preliminary to other methods, or as a method by itself. Many people have achieved OBEs simply by this method alone, and then just ‘letting go’. Dissociate From The Physical Not to be confused with the pathology of dissociation / dislocation described earlier in this book. In this context I simply mean separating yourself from the physical by blocking out the physical sensations."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 85 of 105 Once you are in the body asleep / mind awake state as achieved by focuses relaxation, you will automatically start to lose sensation of your physical body. You may even lose sensation of your bed below you. This is normal, and is important as you want to separate as much as possible from the physical. What is happening is that you are phasing your consciousness out of the physical and into a different realm, so the physical will start fade from your (physical) senses. Vibrational State Once you achieve dissociation from the physical, you will start to feel subtle vibrations in your body. This is energy coursing through you. It is always there, but you do not normally feel it. Ancient Chinese knew known about the paths of energy coursing through the body and used that knowledge for acupuncture, which is still used today! In the steps just before an OBE occurs you have just become aware of this energy. Once you feel the vibrations, try to move them up and down through your body, and increase the frequency by will. It is from this state that you will be able to induce separation for an out-of-body experience."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 86 of 105 Chakra Balancing Since the chakras are essentially energy doorways to higher consciousness and higher planes, it makes sense that meditation on these energy centers can increase the chances of successful projection. Chakras can be imagined as orbs of energy, of the colors of the rainbow. In fact, the colors are as an octave, as too is music, and the layered universe. We can truly see how vibrations are the basis of our existence. Chakra Meditation Performing this meditation will balance your chakra centers. This can help you to induce OBEs because you will be more in tune to the higher realms. Begin by performing the Focused Relaxation method above, and utilize rhythmic breathing. Visualize the Root Chakra, and imagine an orb of red energy at the base of the spine. Feel its energy pulsing at the base of your spine. Move to the spleen center, just below the navel, and imagine it as an orb of orange energy light, and feel its warmth in the center of your stomach. Next is the solar plexus, at the base of the sternum. Imagine it as an orb of yellow and feel its warmth and energy."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 87 of 105 Next move to the heart center, and imagine an orb of green light and feel it coursing through your heart. Next move to the throat center, and imagine an orb of blue light and feel its energy pulsing in your throat. Next move to the third eye center, and imagine an orb of indigo light in the center of your forehead. Feel its energy and become aware of this center just above and between your eyes. Pause here a moment, and try to become aware of your third-eye. It is believed that the pineal gland located just behind the center of your forehead, is somehow connected to our sixth sense, and psychic experiences. Lastly, move to the crown center. It is located at the top of your head in the center. Imagine an orb of violet swirling energy. Feel its influence flowing down through all of the other centers like a fountain. This can be used prior to other OBE methods or as a meditation by itself. Willpower Once you can fully get yourself into the vibrational state as previously covered, you will be in the state that is the stepping stone to a fully conscious OBE. This is also the point when your subconscious mind is most open to listening to what you want it to do."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 88 of 105 The human mind is an amazing thing! Many accomplishments have been attributed to will alone. Remember the saying ‘Where there is a will, there is a way!’? So if you really want to do something, you will not let anything get in the way of achieving your goal. The same practice applies to projection. You have to really want it. You have to have the willpower to achieve it. From the vibrational state, you simply tell yourself that you WILL have an OBE. Don’t just make a meek attempt at telling yourself this; you really need to have the full intent that you will indeed have an experience! Do not worry if you fall asleep during this process, or shortly after. And do not worry if you wake up and do not remember having a conscious OBE. The message will eventually get through to the subconscious. It may come faster to some than others, and it just depends on the person. Affirmations An affirmation is simply a promise you make to yourself and reinforce it by repeating it several times, regularly. Write it down on a piece of paper, and recite it 3 times before you go to sleep each night. It can be as simple as “Tonight when I go to sleep, I will have an OBE and I will remember it when I wake up.” Visualization Methods Visualization requires a bit of patience and a good imagination. You need to be able to close your eyes and accurately see a picture in your mind’s eye that is totally of your own creation. Many people say"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 89 of 105 that certain visualization techniques help them to have a fully conscious OBE. All of these methods should be attempted from within a fully relaxed, body asleep / mind awake state to be the most successful. You can use any visualization that you feel comfortable with, and even make up your own. The Mirror Method In this technique, you visualize that you are laying in a black room, and there is a full length mirror above your head. In this mirror you can clearly see your mirror image as if it were hovering above you and looking down at you. Now, begin to really concentrate on this mirror image. Imagine what it would be like to be the mirror image and looking down at your body on the bed. Now, feel the pressure of your body pushing into the bed below you. Gravity is pulling you downward. Then switch thought to what it would feel like being in the position of the mirror image, feeling the gravity from that perspective. Keep switching from your perspective in the bed, to that of the mirror image’s perspective. Then will yourself to actually be in that perspective. The Doorway Method This technique requires visualizing a doorway. You are standing on one side of the door looking through to a vast expanse. Behind you is blackness, and before you, on the other side of the doorway lays a world of wonder and mystique. Colors in purples, blues, pinks and white, and clouds can be seen as far as the horizon. In the clouds you"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 90 of 105 see pulsing electricity. This is pure energy. You feel the energy as the hair on your arms stands. It has an almost magnetic pull to it, pulling you. Concentrate on the expanse, and on the feelings pulling you through the doorway. Realize that you must let go of everything, your will must be strong enough. You must trust that you will be safe. When you are ready... proceed through the doorway. The Roll-Out Method Once you are in the body asleep / mind awake state, your body will feel distant and you may enter the state known as sleep paralysis. You may feel unable to move your physical body, and may also feel vibrations at this point. This state, though sometimes frightening, can be easily used to induce an OBE, and one way to do this is to use the roll-out method. For this method, you simply roll out of your physical body, as if you were going to roll over in your bed. This is actually part willpower and part visualization. You need to will yourself to roll out of the physical, but also be able to visualize it actually happening, and feel it happening. Tactile Methods Tactile methods rely on using some sort of physical feeling to help induce OBEs. Since it’s believed that the pineal gland (also referred to as the third-eye) is at least partially responsible in projection,"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 91 of 105 some people find that by placing an object such as a coin, on the forehead will help to concentrate on that area. Others report that they have had OBEs by submersing themselves in a sensory deprivation tank. The ambient temperature of the water, and the air are matched exactly to the body temperature, and no sound, or light can penetrate. The water is of such a high salt content that the body floats freely, and with the air temperate matching the water temperature, the person lying still can not feel anything. In this case, it is the absence of tactile stimuli that aids inducing an OBE. The Power Of Suggestion It has long been known that the human mind is very open to suggestion when in a very relaxed state. Hypnotism has been used for entertainment, past life regression, and in the medical community. It can also be used to help induce OBEs, and you don’t need a hypnotist to do it! Sleep-Onset Suggestion Method Once you get used to putting yourself into the body asleep / mind awake state, you will be able to plant suggestions in your mind. The trick is to start to recognize the exact point where sleep is taking over. This is known as the hypnagogic state, and is where you are losing conscious awareness and falling asleep."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 92 of 105 Maintain an image in your mind as you lay there. The image can be anything but keep it simple. As soon as you start to see the image change, you know that sleep is starting to take over. Play with this state for awhile, by keeping yourself from falling asleep, and stay in the hypnagogic state. Once you are well able to discern the exact point where sleep takes over, you are ready to plant your suggestion. At this point, in your mind tell yourself “I WILL have an OBE. I WILL remember.” The suggestion has to be short an easy to recite. This will be the very last conscious thought before sleep takes over and it will remain with your subconscious mind. This is the method I have used most often with success. Dream Programming Everyone dreams each and every night as we cycle through several REM (Rapid Eye Movement) stages of sleep. Most people do not remember very much of their dreams on a nightly basis, but this can be easily learned by keeping a dream journal. Keep your journal beside your bed, and when you awaken, write down anything you remember no matter how unimportant it seems. Your best recollection of a dream is when you first wake up and then you tend to lose it, unless it’s a particularly vivid one. After awhile, you will automatically start to remember your dreams more. This is important for the next step. Once you have mastered remembering your dreams, you need to start learning how to lucid dream. This is when you become aware"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 93 of 105 during a dream. You are fully conscious that everything you are experiencing is a dream. To do this, you need to give yourself a cue before you go to sleep. And it has to be the same cue all the time. This is ‘programming’ part. Tell yourself every night before you go to sleep that if you see this cue (it can be anything special to you... a red rubber ball for instance, or the moon), if you see this cue, you will know you are in a dream. It may not happen right away, but with practice it will happen in time, and when it does, you will have full control over the dream experience. Once you become aware in a dream, all you have to do is simply tell yourself to project. Since it’s believed that dreams really are a form of projection on the astral plane, all we are doing is simply becoming aware of it. Once we become aware of it, the images that don’t make sense as in a dream state, will start to become perceivable and understandable. The conscious mind will take over from the subconscious mind and you will be able to remember when you wake up. Crystals To Help Induce OBEs People have long known the benefits of natural crystals. Certain crystals possess energy vibrations that may help with dream recall and out-of-body experiences. You can wear them around your neck or place them under your pillow. Crystals specifically used to help with OBEs are: amethyst, angelite, selenite, agate/blue lace, fluorite, moldavite, and smithsonite. Also, a clear quartz crystal will amplify the energy of other crystals used together."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 94 of 105 Herbs To Help Induce OBEs Certain herbs have been mentioned in magickal texts throughout the ages that are helpful with inducing OBEs. Usually these herbs are mixed, and placed in a sachet and placed under the pillow. Some herbs used are poisonous and should not be ingested. Some of the herbs mentioned with regards to OBEs are: Mugwort, Dittany of Crete, Marigold, Stillengia, Wormwood, and Yucca. Brainwave Entrainment There are many cd’s out there that claim to induce OBEs easily by using embedded brainwave technology. They use frequencies that would normally occur in the brain as we enter deeper states of consciousness, in order to bring the brain into sync with these frequencies. Some people find them helpful, and at the very least they help you relax. I have experimented with this myself, and even created some original music tracks that I offer for free, which contain embedded brainwave technology. In my experience, I find that the music can be both relaxing and distracting. It has been suggested that the best frequencies to use for this purpose are those that start in the beta waking state, and then slowly cycle down to about 7 Hz. You can use a program called Brainwave Generator that will allow you create your own brainwave entrainment programs, though"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 95 of 105 unless you have the full paid version, you will only be able to use the preloaded samples. Keeping A Journal As mentioned in the dream programming section, it’s a good idea to keep a dream/OBE journal on your bedside table. It will allow you to jot down anything you remember immediately upon waking. It will serve as two purposes. The first is that you will preserve your memories to be read at a later date. This will allow you to objectively analyze what you remembered. You may have already been traveling out of body and did not realize it, and reading over your journal may give clues to this fact. The second is that if you do project, you will not forget the experience. All too often people wake up from a vivid experience and know that something happened, but then forget it as time goes by and start doubting themselves about the experience ever being real. Write down every detail that you recall, along with dates, and anything that you feel may have contributed to your success. What method did you use? What signposts do you remember? Were you able to control the experience when you were out? Write down everything! Remember this is your journal and can be as personal as you want. Nobody else ever has to read it. You can revisit earlier successes and"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 96 of 105 failures as you go, and it will help you to realize what works and what doesn’t. It will also give you the bigger picture that many people do not see in their own lives. Controlling The Experience As you become able to induce astral or etheric projections, the next step is to learn to control them to gain their full benefit. At first, you may be so overwhelmed at being successful that you forget what it was that you wanted to accomplish while out-of-body. This is normal, as control comes naturally with time and practice. For the time being, enjoy the ride and go where the experience takes you! As you become more experienced, you will be able to better control where you go and what you do while out-of-body. You can start by essentially willing yourself to go places. Usually if you concentrate on a place, you will go there. Traversing The Planes All that differentiates etheric projection from astral projection is the vibrational frequency. If you find yourself in etheric projection and you want to experience astral projection, simply concentrate on the vibrations and increase them. If you are in astral projection and want to experience real-time or etheric projection, do the opposite. This can used to travel between the sub planes as well."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 97 of 105 Another way this has been expressed is in terms of substance. In etheric form, you are more dense, so you concentrate on expelling some etheric substance, and you will become less dense and rise. If you want to cross to etheric from the astral, do the opposite and draw in astral substance to make your form more dense. To do this, visualize energy leaving or entering through your solar plexus, the area in the center of your chest at the base of your ribcage. Potential Setbacks Just as with learning anything new, you may encounter some potential setbacks as you learn to induce willed and fully conscious OBEs. Do not be discouraged, as these are usually temporary, and everyone experiences them. Even those most seasoned people encounter problems projecting at times. Don’t give up! Learning projection, and discovering the true nature of the universe can be a lifelong journey! Inability To Get Out Sometimes you will be able to get close to projection, but just can not make yourself separate. You may feel the vibrations and even get as far as hearing the static sounds, but just can not get past this point. Sometimes, you may be able to go in and out of the vibrational state many times, and still not get out. Usually fears or inability to relax are the culprits in these cases."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 98 of 105 Etheric Blindness The first time you experience etheric projection, you may not have full vision at first. In fact, it’s a pretty good chance you won’t be able to see for the first few moments on your first successful etheric projection. It may take a bit of time for your vision to align properly. You may not be able to see at all, or your vision may look as if you are underwater or cloudy. Know that this will improve the longer you are out, and the more you project. Sticking To The Physical Body Sometimes you may be successful in separating from the physical body but still remain in the immediate vicinity of it (in the case of etheric projection), or feel constantly pulled toward it and back to the physical (in the case of astral projection). The trick is to try and NOT think about the physical body at all. If you even merely think about your physical body, it can draw you back and out of your experience. I have had this happen many times, and it is a difficult thing to overcome. Inability To Move You may find at first that you can move around quite easily, and it may seem as if you are floating above the ground rather than walking,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 99 of 105 however shortly after you may find yourself glued to the spot. You can not move in any direction, except for maybe your eyes, and occasionally your head. This usually happens in etheric projection and is right before you are about to be pulled back to the physical to awaken. The reasons can be many but I have found that the usual culprit is that something has aroused your mind back in the physical realm, usually a sound."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 100 of 105"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 101 of 105 7 7 7 . . . C C C O O O N N N C C C L L L U U U S S S I I I O O O N N N All through history, we have been traveling out-of-body, and returning safely at the end of our journeys, yet there are many disbelievers and fears have prevented us from exploring with freedom. It has only been since the inception of our scientific based society, that we started to doubt in this ability, only because we can not prove it with our current knowledge of science. And those who can not understand something tend to label it as fake, the result of a disease process, or as something dangerous that should not be toyed with. Others know of the ability but wish to conceal it from the general population, making it a privilege available only to high ranking religious mystics. The Out-Of-Body Experience is a completely natural ability that has been available to mankind throughout the ages. It has been recorded many times by many different cultures, some of whom never had any contact with each other. There are ancient texts describing the ability and what an out-of-body experience is like. Prominent names in history have openly shared their out-of-body experiences. The truth is, that anyone can learn to travel out-of-body. It is a completely safe practice that you can learn to induce by will. Just think of the awe of knowing that you are more than your physical shell. It gives completely new meaning to life! For those who practice and learn to induce OBEs, the sky is no longer the limit!"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 102 of 105"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Spirit-Quest: Journey Out-Of-Body Page 103 of 105 8 8 8 . . .
