A successful seeker in dream-work must be stab le enough in presence to avoid being swept away by the winds of karmic em otions and lost in the dream. As the mind steadies, dreams become longer, less fragmented, and more easi ly remembered, and lucidity is developed.. Waking life is equally enhanced as we find th at we are increasingly protected from being carried away by the habitual emotional reac tions that draw us into distraction and unhappiness. Dream -work can instead develop th e positive traits that lead to happiness and support the seeker in the spiritual journey. All yogic and spiritual disciplines include some form of practice that develops concentration and quiets the mind. In the Tibetan tradition this practice is called calm abiding (zhine). We recognize three stages in the development of stability: f orceful zhine , natural zhine , and ultimate zhine . Zhine begins with mental fixation on an object and, when concentration is strong enough, moves on to fixa tion without an object. (Same principle as working with the Perfect Model presented to you on this website). Begin the practice by sitting comfortably on a chair or in the five-pointed meditation posture: the legs crossed, the hands folded in the lap in meditation position with palms up and placed one on top of the ot her, the spine straight but not rigid, the head tilted down sli g htly to strai g hten the neck, and the eyes open. The ey es should be relaxed, not too wide open and not too closed. The obje ct of concentration should be placed so that the eyes can"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"look straight ahead, neither up nor down. Duri ng the practice try not to move, not even to swallow or blink, while keeping the mind one pointedly on the object . Even if tears should stream down your face, do not mo ve. Let the breathing be natural. Generally, for practice with an object, Zh ine practitioners use the Tibetan letter A as the object of concentration. This letter has many sy mbolic meanings but here is used simply as a support for the development of focus. Ot her objects may also be used — the letter A of the English alphabet, an image of your Perf ect Model, or any othe r sacred Image , the sound of a mantra, the breath — almost anythi ng. However, it is good to use something connected to the sacred, as it serves to inspir e you. Also, try to use the same object each time you practice, rather than switching betwee n objects, because the continuity acts as a support of the practice. It is also somewhat preferable to focus on a physical object that is outside the body , as the purpose is to develop stability during the perception of external objects and, eventua lly, of the objects in dream. . Concentration on the Tibetan letter \"A\" If you wish to use the Tibetan \" A\" you can write it on a piece of paper about an inch square. Traditionally, the letter is white and is enclosed in five concentric colored circles: the center circle that is the direct background for the \" A\" is indigo; around it is a blue circle, then green, red, yellow, and white ones. Tape the paper to a stick that is just long enough to support the paper at eye level when you sit for practice, and make a base that holds it upright. Plac e it so that the \" A\" is about a foot and a half in front of your eyes."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" The Tibetan Letter \"A\" Many signs of progress can arise during the pr actice. As concentration strengthens and the periods of practice are extended, strange sens ations arise in the body and many strange visual phenomena appear. You may find your mi nd doing strange things, too! That is all right. These experiences are a natural part of the development of concentration; they arise as the mind settles, so be neither disturbed by nor excited about them. FORCEFUL ZHINE The first stage of practice is called \"forceful\" because it requires effort. The mind is easily and quickly distracted, and it may seem impo ssible to remain focused on the object for even a minute. In the beginning, it is help ful to practice in num erous short sessions alternating with breaks. Do not let the mind wa nder during the break, but instead recite a mantra, or work with visualization, or work with another practice you may know, such as the development of compassion. After the break, return to the fixation practice. If you are ready to practice but do not have the particular object you have been using, visualize a ball of light on your forehead and center yourself there. The prac tice should be done once or twice a day, and can be done more freque ntly if you have the time. Developing concentration is like strengthening the muscl es of the body: exercise must be done regularly and frequently. To become stro nger keep pushing against your limits. Keep the mind on the object. Do not follow the thoughts of the past or the future. Do not allow the attention to be carried away by fant asy, sound, physical se nsation, or any other distraction. Just remain in the sensuality of the present moment, and with your whole strength and clarity focus th e mind through the eye, on the object. Do not lose the awareness of the object even for a second. Br eathe gently, and then more gently, until the sense of breathing is lost. Slow ly allow yourself to enter more deeply into quiet and calm. Make certain that the body is kept relaxed; do not tense up in concentration. Neither should you allow yourself to fall into a stupor, a dullness, or a trance."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Do not think about the object, just let it be in awareness. This is an important distinction to make. Thinking about the object is not the ki nd of concentration we are developing. The point is just to keep the mind placed on the object, on the sense perception of the object, to undistractedly remain aware of the presen ce of the object. When the mind does get distracted and it often will in the beginning, ge ntly bring it back to the object and leave it there. NATURAL ZHINE As stability is developed, the second stage of pr actice is entered: natural zhine. In the first stage, concentration is developed by continua lly directing the attention to the object and developing control over the unruly mind. In th e second stage, the mi nd is absorbed in contemplation of the object and there is no lo nger the need for force to hold it still. A relaxed and pleasant tranquility is establishe d, in which the mind is quiet and thoughts arise without distracting the mind from the object. The elements of the body become harmonized and the prana moves evenly and gently throughout the body. This is an appropriate time to move to fixation without an object. Abandoning the physical object, simply fix the focus on space. It is helpful to gaze into expansive space, like the sky, but the practice can be done even in a small room by fixing on the space between your body and the wall. Remain steady and calm. Leave the body"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"relaxed. Rather than focusing on an imagined point in space, allow the mind, while remaining in strong presence, to be diffuse. We call this \"d issolving the mind\" in space, or \"merging the mind with space.\" It will lead to stable tran quility and the third stage of zhine practice. ULTIMATE ZHINE Whereas in the second stage there is still some heaviness involved in the absorption in the object, the third stage is characterized by a mind that is tranquil but light, relaxed, and pliable. Thoughts arise and dissolve sponta neously and without effort. The mind is integrated fully with its own movement. In the Dzogchen tradition, this is traditiona lly when the master intr oduces the student to the natural state of mind. Because the studen t has developed zhine, the master can point to what the student has already experienced ra ther than describing a new state that must be attained. The explanation, which is known as the \"pointing out\" instruction, is meant to lead the student to recognize what is already there, to discriminate the moving mind in thought and concept from the nature of mind, which is pure, non-dual awareness. This is the ultimate stage of zhine practice, abiding in non-dual presence, rigpa (awareness) itself. OBSTACLES In developing the zhine practice, there ar e three obstacles that must be overcome: agitation, drowsiness, and laxity."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Agitation Agitation causes the mind to jump restle ssly from one thought to another and makes concentration difficult. To prevent this, calm yourself before the practice session by avoiding too much physical or mental activity . Slow stretches may help to relax the body and quiet the mind. Once you are sitting, take a few deep, slow breaths. Make it a practice to focus the mind immediately when you start th e practice to avoid developing the habit of mentally wandering while sitt ing in meditation posture. Drowsiness The second obstacle is drowsiness or sleepine ss, which moves into the mind like a fog, a heaviness and torpor that blunts awareness. When it does this, try to strengthen the mind's focus on the object in order to penetrate the drowsiness. You may find that drowsiness is actually a kind of movement of the mind that you can stop with stron g concentration. If this does not work, take a break, stretch, and perhaps do some practice while standing. Laxity The third obstacle is laxity. When encountering th is obstacle you may feel that your mind is calm, but in a passive, weak mental state in wh ich the concentration has no strength. It is important to recognize this state for what it is . It can be a pleasant and relaxed experience and, if mistaken for correct meditation, may cause the practitioner to spend years mistakenly cultivating it, with no discernable ch ange in the quality of consciousness. If your focus loses strength and your practice become s lax, straighten your posture and wake up your mind. Reinforce the attent ion and guard the stability of pr esence. Regard the practice as something precious, which it is, and as some thing that will lead to the attainment of the highest realization, which it will. Streng then the intention and automatically the wakefulness of the mind is strengthened. Zhine practice should be done every day until th e mind is quiet and stable. It is not only a preliminary practice, but is helpful at any point in the practitioner's life; even very advanced yogis practice zhine. The stabilit y of mind developed through zhine is the foundation of dream yoga and all other medita tion practices. Once we have achieved a strong and reliable steadiness in calm presence, we can develop this steadiness in all aspects of life. When stable, this presence ca n always be found, and we will not be carried away by thoughts and emotions. Then, even though karmic traces continue to produce dream images after falling asleep, we remain in awareness. This op ens the door to the further practices of both dream and sleep yogas.

They are as real and unreal as life itself. Dreams are extremely personal - and transpersonal, too. Our dreams are a reflection of ourselves: in dreams, no matter how many characters appear, we meet ourselves. Dreams are mirrors to our soul. They can help us to better understand ourselves, our world, and the nature of reality. Dreams introduce us to other dimensions of experience. Here, time and space are much more liquid and plastic; they can be shaped an d reshaped almost at will. Dreams hint of other worlds, other lives. They are a glimpse of our afterlife.

How Dreams Can Help Us Great healers have long recognized the power of dreams to inform and support us. Hippocrates said, Dreams are one of the most important ways to diagnose a patients illness.\" Sigmund Freud's turn-of-the-century work. The Interpretation of Dreams, marked the beginning of the era of modern psychology and psyc hoanalysis. Certain dreams can convey subconscious, valuable information to the dreamer. A week before the event, Abraham Lincoln dreamed that he would be as sassinated. The emperor Constantine dreamed of radiant Greek letters s pelling the name of Christ and was converted, leading to the dramatic conversion of the entire Byzantine Empire. I, myself, have received messages, te achings, and blessings through my dreams from the spiritual masters I have known and loved in this lifetime. Some contemporary psychologists consider lucid dreaming a valuable practice for personal growth. This model is, ho wever, different from Tibetan dream yoga. The spiritual practice goes de eper, helping us work with the great passages of life and death. Tibetan dream yoga teaches us how to navigate the groundlessness of moment-to-moment ex istence, which typically makes no intellectual sense. It is at this level th at we cut through the illusory nature of mind and truly experience our marvelous human existence. Cultivating our innate ability to wake up within the dream can: • Increase clarity and lucidity, both waking and sleeping • Help us realize the transparent, dream-like nature of experience • Free the mind • Release energy blockages and accumulated tension and stress • Loosen habits and make us more open, attuned, and flexible • Unleash and mobilize creativity • Bring repressions and denials into consciousness • Clarify and dispel confusion • Solve problems • Reveal the process of death and rebirth • Heal and relax us • Expose fantasies • Unlock aspirations and potentials • Facilitate direct encounters with our shadow nature • Provide spiritual blessings, visions, and guidance • Help open our innate psychic capacities • Remove hindrances and obstacles • Help prepare (rehearse) us for death and the afterlife"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Awakening within the dream The seminal Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu dreamed he was a butterfly. Upon awakening, he wondered whether he was a man who had dreamed he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was a man. Chuang Tzu's musings underscore a fundamental truth: life is like a dream. Spiritual life is about awakening from the dream of unreality. The word Buddha itself is from the word bodhi, \"awakeful.\" Buddhist wisdom and practice help us to awaken to who and what we truly are, and to recognize the difference between the real and the unreal in our daily life. All of our spiritual practices are designed to awaken us from the daydream of illusion and confusion, where we are like sleepwalkers, semiconsciously muddling our way through life. Self-knowledge through spiritual awakening helps us become masters of circumstances and conditions, rather than victims. This is why the Armenian spiritual master George Gurdjieff said: \"Contemporary man is born asleep, lives asleep, and dies asleep. And what knowledge could a sleeping man have? If you think about it and at the same time remember that sleep is the chief feature of our being, you will soon un derstand that if man wishes to obtain knowledge, he should first of all think about how to awaken himself, that is about how to change his being.\" South American shamans call this awakening from the dream of life \"shapeshifting\": entering into a sp iritual journey with the explicit purpose of transformation. Shapeshi fting and other forms of conscious dream-work can, through regular practice, help us experience other realms of existence, visit our de ar departed, and achieve spiritual mastery. Australian aborigines say we all live in the dreamtime: we are like dream characters, living out our lives beyond th e illusion of being born and dying. Tibetan masters call this dreamtime the bardo, or intermediate stage. Bardos exist between the ending of one state and the beginning of another, such as birth and death - or death and rebirth. Dreaming, too, is a bardo, marking the seemingly unstructured zone between waking and sleeping. Tibetan Buddhism is unique among Buddhist schools in teaching us how to awaken within the dream and how to prac tice spiritually while sleeping. This is the essence of Tibetan dream yoga, and the focus of all the practices associated with it. The Yoga of the Dream State, an ancient Tibetan manual on the practice of dream yoga and lucid dreaming teaches that we can learn five"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"spiritually significant wisdom lessons through assiduously practicing this path of awakening: • Dreams can be altered th rough will and attention • Dreams are unstable, impermanent, and unreal — much like fantasies, magical illusions, mirages, and hallucinations • Daily perceptions in the everyday waking state are also unreal • All life is here today and gone tomorrow, like a dream; there is nothing to hold on to • Conscious dreamwork can lead us to the realization of wholeness, perfect balance, and unity. For centuries, Tibetan masters have taught their students how to use dreamtime and dream space to further spiritual progress by increasing awareness during the dream state. Tibetan Dream Yoga brings you these same techniques for realizing the five wisd om lessons and reaping the benefits of awakening within the dream. The Six Yogas of Tibet Tibetan dream yoga is one of the renowned Six Yogas of Tibet, an ancient Buddhist teaching that originates with the enlightened yogic adepts (siddhas) - of ancient India. These yogas (or practices) , utilized for a millennium by all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism, help us to utilize the body/mind/spirit as a vehicle for awakening and enlightenment — by day, by night, and in the afterlife (bardo). The Six Yogas are: • Inner heat (mystic incandescence) yoga • Illusory body yoga • Dream yoga • Clear light yoga • Bardo yoga • Conscious transformation yoga The Six Yogas tradition was first brough t to Tibet thirteen hundred years ago by the Indian tantric master Padmasambhava, founder of the Ancient School (Nyingmapa) of Tibetan Buddhism. Padmasambhava himself received the teachings he codified as The Yoga of the Dream State from a mysterious yogi named Lawapa. In ensuing centuries, as Buddhism grew and flourished in Tibet, Marpa the Translator and other Tibetan sages made the grueling journey on foot to India to study from yogic masters, then brought the teaching back with them. Through practicing the Six Yogas, we come to realize the infinite emptiness/openness, ungraspable quality, and luminosity that is the true"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"nature of reality. Dream interpretation, the use of dreams for predictions and healing, and the development of psychic powers and healing abilities can arise naturally from the continuous practice of dream yoga and the related yogas (especially clear light, inner heat, and illusory body). The Spiritual Benefits of Tibetan Dream Yoga His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama has this to say about awakening our dream body and using it for sp iritual progress and development: \"There is said to be a relationship between dreaming, on the one hand, and the gross and subdue levels of the body on the other. But it is also said that there is a 'special dream st ate.' In that state, the special dream body is created from the mind and from vital energy (prana) within the body. This special dream body is ab le to dissociate entirely form the gross physical body and travel elsewhere.\" One way of developing this special drea m body is first of all to recognize a dream as a dream when it occurs. Then you find that the dream is malleable, and you make efforts to ga in control over it. Gradually you become very skilled in this, increasi ng your ability to control the contents of the dream so that it acco rds to your own desires. Eventually it is possible to dissociate your dr eam body from your gross physical body. In contrast, in the normal drea m state, dreaming occurs within the body. But as a result of specific training, the dream body can go elsewhere. This first technique is ac complished entirely by the power of desire or aspiration. There is another technique that arri ves at the same end by means of prana yoga. These are meditative prac tices that utilize the subtle, vital energies in the body. For these tec hniques it is also necessary to recognize the sleep state as it occurs. According to sleep researchers, we ty pically experience f our stages of sleep. • Hypnagogic sleep - the state of drowsiness we experience as we begin falling asleep • Ordinary sleep - here, we enter a true sleeping state, but can still be easily awakened . Deeper sleep - vital functions slow down , and we are more likely to"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"sleep through disturbances • Deep sleep - muscles are totally relaxed, and it would be difficult to wake us up (we only spend about fift een percent of our sleeping hours at this stage) It takes about an hour to cycle throug h all four stages; then we go back in reverse order to stage 1. Before beginning the cycle again, however, we experience rapid eye movement s (REM) under our closed lids. Research shows that this is when we dream. We spend twenty to twenty-five percent of our sleep time in this state. In order to practice dream yoga, we must introduce awar eness during the periods of REM sleep (which last from a few minutes to half an hour). If we can identify that stage while asleep -perhaps wi th the help of an assistant or a dream-light device - we can further incubate, develop, and enhance the awareness practice of becoming co nscious and lucid within the dream state. Dreaming Tibetan dream yoga texts teach us that, in general, there are three types of dreams: Ordinary, karmic dr eams, arising mostly from the day's activities, and from previous life ac tivities, thoughts, experiences, and contacts. • \"Clear light\" dreams: spiritual vision s, blessings, and energy openings • Lucid dreams, which are characterized by awareness that one is dreaming Under these three broad divisions, drea ms can be divided into a further six categories: • Dreams of events that occurred while we were still awake • Dreams about other people, alive or dead • Forgotten elements emerging from the subconscious • Archetypal content, evocative symbols, and so on • Extrasensory perceptions, profound dreams, and omens • Radiant, luminous, spiritual dreams Recurrent dreams, nightmares, dreams of death, and other kinds of commonly reported dreams all fall within the first four dream categories. In the interests of developing deeper awareness of your dreams, you may find it helpful to identify the category that applies whenever you recall a particular dream. The Practices of Tibetan Dream Yoga It is important to create a spiritual context for the practice of Tibetan dream yoga. Lucid dreaming can easily be mi sused to perpetuate the problems we"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"experience in our waking lives. For ex ample, one might direct one's dream toward a gratifying encounter or a veng eful fantasy. You will find that the techniques on Tibetan Dream Yoga somehow don't work as well when used for such purposes. Tibetan dream yoga practice comprises three parts: • Daytime practice, designed to help us recognize the dreamlike nature of all existence and thereby prepare us to experi ence our dreams as vividly as we do our waking activities • Morning wake-up practices that help us recall our dreams, and confirm our determination to recall more of them . Night time practice, which prepares the ground for lucid dreaming and spiritual Daytime Practice : During the day, practice these four points : • Contemplating the body as illusory and unreal • Contemplating the mind and mental acti vities as similarly insubstantial • Regarding the world and all phenomena and experience as dreamlike, insubstantial, impermanent, and unreal • Recognizing the relativity and ungraspable quality such as time, space, knowledge, and awareness Reminding ourselves of these four truths throughout our waking hours helps to dissolve the barrier between the dream of life and the sleeping dream. As we become more adept at these practices, we begin to regard our nighttime dreams as continuations of our waki ng dream and we learn how to bring habitual awareness to both. Mirror Practice The following mirror practice is an effective way of perceiving the dreamlike nature of “reality”, and especially of “s elf”. From time to time during the day, take a few minutes to do it. 1 Stand in front of a mirror and look into your own eyes. 2. Hold up a hand mirror behind your righ t or left ear and look at its reflection in the larger mirror. Keep angling the hand mirror so as to fragment and multiply your image as much as possible. Let your mind fragment along with the image."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"3. After a few minutes, angle the hand mirror back until you return to the original, single image in the mirror in front of you. The analogy of a mirror image is, like dr eams, traditionally us ed to describe the insubstantial nature of our everyday experience. The mirror practice helps bring that teaching to life. The fragmented image is the kind we might see in a dream; yet we are seeing it while we're fully awake — or are we? Allowing your mind to \"fall apart\" also helps ventilate the solidity we typically attribute to our world, and especially to our \"self.\" Partner Exercise Here is a traditional dream yoga practice you can do with a partner. This is an immensely useful technique, not only for challenging the distinction between sleeping dreams and the dream of being awake, but also for applying your training to practical, everyday situations. 1 - Insult, blame, and criticize your pa rtner. Your partner should listen to all of this as echoes; empty sounds. 2 – Trade places. Now have your partner disparage you, while you practice just hearing the sounds an d not taking the words to heart 3 – Try doing this same exercise using praise and flattery instead of blame. In either case, the listening partner should practice not reacting in any way, recognizing what is being said as a dream. At first, you may find it difficult to maintain equanimi ty while you do this practice. Stay with it – you will find that doing so yields rich rewards over time. Wake-up Practice The moments immediately after waking are the most fertile for recalling dreams. The following practices are designed to support and strengthen your recall. They will also facilitate a mind ful transition between the sleeping and waking dream states. Upon waking in the morning, practice:"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"• The lion's out-breath - breathing out with the sound \" ah \" • The lion-like posture for awakening and purifying - sitting up in bed with raised head and gazing and emphasizing the exhalation, repeating the \"ah\" out breath three times • Raising the energy - standing up, reaching the fingertips to the sky, and repeating the lion's out-breath • Entering into mindful reflection on the transition between the states of sleeping, dreaming, and waking reality - coming into the present moment, recording dreams. Thus, you will enter the day recognizing that all things are like a dream, illusion, fantasy, mirage, and so forth. Nighttime Practice After going to bed, practice these four po ints in order to create the conditions for mindful, lucid dreaming. • Chant the following prayer three times to remind you of and strengthen your resolve to awaken within the dream, fo r the benefit of the ultimate awakening of all beings: “May I awaken within this dream and grasp the fact that I am dreaming, so that all dreamlike beings may likewise awaken from the nightmare of illusory suffering and confusion”. • Lie on one side with your legs together and knees slightly bent. Let your bent arm take the weight of your torso by resting your head on your open hand. This is the posture of the sleepi ng Buddha, as he has been traditionally depicted at the moment of passing into nirvana (death). • Bringing your attention to your throat chakra, visualize your energy rising up out of your body. Feel it rise up from your heart chakra with your breath and pass into your \"third eye\" or brow chakra: the point between your eyebrows. Visualize it as a full, luminous moon behind your eyes. Go into the light."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"• Visualize the letter \" A \" (symbolizing infinite space) on the surface of the moon. • Notice whatever images begin to appear on the sphere of light behind your eyes. Deepening Your Practice To progress still further in Tibetan dream yoga, • Pay careful attentio n to your dreams • Record your dreams in a dream journal upon waking each morning • Recognize recurrent images, themes, associations, and patterns • Contemplate the archetypal, symbolic content and meanings of your dreams • Reflect on the similarities and differences between night dreams, daydreams, fantasies, visions, ideas, projections, and so on • Wake yourself up during the night to reaffirm your resolve to awaken within the dream and grasp the fact that you are dreaming • Sit up in meditation posture while sle eping to maintain continuous awareness while inducing and incubating lucid dreaming • Have a dream assistant at hand to guide you while asleep, helping you learn to retain conscious presence during dreams • Meditate alone in darkness to develop the inner clarity of the Clear Light Mind - the mind unaffected by illusion • During the day, maintain awareness th at everything you experience is like a dream • Chant the dream yoga prayer by day and by night to help reinforce your intention to awaken within the dream.

In the Buddhist tradition, however, discipline alone is not enough to bring your practice fully alive. Motivation — the reason you practi ce in the first place - is considered as crucial as technique and commitment. You will have noticed that the Tibetan dream yoga chant includes an aspiration to help free all beings of their suffering. This intention lies at the root of all Buddhist practice. The underlying teachi ng is that all living beings are interconnected: none of us can be completely free so long as any of us is still asleep. As you practice Tibetan dream yoga, reco gnize that the suffering you seek to alleviate through spiritual practice is, in fact, universal. Recognize, too, that the more awake you are, the more helpful you can be to those you care about in fact, to, to everyone you come into contact with. Practice with the intention of working with your own individual part of the whole, in order to bring all of human awareness to a new level. In this way, you will derive the greatest possible benefits from your dream yoga practice.

By working with them, we use both hemispheres of the brain and tap the subconscious mind more fully, which in turn opens the doors to our intuitive self A dream symbol could literally represent itself as well as its possible interpretations. The images and symb ols may also represent aspects of your personality. When you begin to reflect on the symbols, always start"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"by registering your first impression s but don’t stop with the obvious. Dreams are symbolic representation s, not reproductions. The dream images always represent more than themselves, and so the more you work with them, the more you will understand them. Dreams do not come to tell you wh at you already know. Look at the dream images and symbols as piec es of a puzzle that you can put together only by finding out what they mean to you. How do you relate to the dream? 1 Start by looking at how the dream co uld be reflecting something going on in your daily life. 2 Then move on to the more subt le, free association with the dream images. 3 What’s the first thing you would norm ally think about in connection to that symbol or image, activity or person appearing in your dream scenario? 4 doing more than representing them selves. They may also represent qualities or characteristics that you have \"projected\" on them. For example, you may dream of your gr andfather, a man who was very kind to you. The quality of kindness is therefore associated with your grandfather, so dreaming of him could symbolize kindness. (You will know the difference between a symbolic representation of a quality or characteristic and a real \"psychic\" contact with a loved one.) 5 Examine the emotions within th e dream scenario. What is the predominant emotion associated with the dream? Remember that it may be the emotion aroused that is th e key and the scenario is simply a vehicle to deliver the message. 6 When you wake up, does a particular feeling remain? For example, are you frightened, frustrated, happy, excited? Dreams often exaggerate emotions, qualities and situations to get a particular message across to you. This does not mean that you have that quality or will experience that situat ion to the intensity you experienced within the dream. When this occurs , you are often bein g given a strong thump on the head to pay attention! This is what nightmares do. They are dynamic calls for your attention. They show you your greatest fears, fears that must be confronted. Dreams often come in a series. Variou s dreams in a single or successive nights may be different ways of sayi ng the same thing.

With practice, you will be able to discern if a dream is precognitive (reflecting future events) or not. Dreams use symbols to make you deve lop and understand your personal symbolic language. This language co mes directly from your soul and uses symbols and images from impers onal archetypes and from personal experience to make a strong or su btle impact on your psyche. This symbolic language is unique, given just to you, in the hope that it will make you conscious of your real n eeds and problems. This language of the soul also helps you to unfold your creativity and activates the spiritual dimension within your psyche. Painting by John Vega A framework for dream work might be : 1 Choose a dream. 2 Determine the dream type, issue, crisis, a block, a resolution already included in the dream. 3 Make a list of the symbols in the dream. 4 Find out the relationships between symbols. 5 Find out the relationships between the dream ego and the symbols."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"6 Find out the similarities and contrasts in the dream. 7 List what the dream ego is and is not doing in the dream 8 Find out about the ego’s relationship s with other items in the dream. 9 Make a summary, and list what you have discovered. This is a basic method of working with dreams that helps you develop self-analysis, observation, and a \"conscious\" and \"lucid\" state of consciousness. You can follow it up with different methods. Dream work helps those who want to know themselves, since like a mirror, it not only projects who we ar e but also displays what we need to do. In other words, dreams are the be st guides to reveal what you have on your conscience, what needs to be worked out in your life, and how to become a better and happier person. Finally, keep a dream journal that re presents the \"mirror of your soul\" and helps you understand yourself be tter. Write your dream down as soon as possible, even just a few wo rds, to remind you of your dream, for the more importance you give to your dream work, the more inner messages and intelligent gu idance you will receive It is during my Psychosynthesis trai ning, in London in 1984, that I was given this Guideline to Dream Interpretation.

Only after there is awakening in the form of enlightenment is it realized that the waking world itself is indeed nothing but a long dream resulting from mental di sposition - a movement in Consciousness in which what seems a solid body and its sufferings are really an illusion. Ramesh Balsekar Painting by Marica S. La uck & Deborah Koff-Chapin This chapter is dedicated to readers who have proven to themselves that dreams are more than just dreams, that they are indeed \"tools\" teaching us to look at ourselves in an impartia l and impersonal way. Dreams are tools Dreams are tools of transf ormation. Moreover, at a ce rtain level of inner work, dreams stop being dreams and instead beco me spiritual levels of consciousness. But, in the meantime, dreams open invisi ble doors to subtler levels of spiritual growth, awakening in seeker s of truth and wisdom, our permanent witness or soul within our conscious selves. Let us first introduce the symbol of the trident, the lo go of the sea-god Poseidon/Neptune. What conne ction does that have with the process of dreaming? Poseidon, the god of seas and oceans, hold s the trident as a ma rk of his command"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"of the waters. In the context of dream work, he represents the king of the subconscious levels of the psyche. In fact, with his trident, Poseidon also commands the monsters of the deep, which reminds us of the deep waters of the subconscious and its own monsters and shadowy figures. Th e subconscious can therefore be compared to the abysmal depths of the ocean; the bottomless deep waters symbolize the subconscious and unconscious parts of our psyche where emotions and instincts mingle and mix without purpose or direction. The three menacin g elon g ated pron g s of the trident look li ke weapons and are used for penetrating, scratching and wounding, so in the symbolic context of dream work, the trident is a penetratin g device, effectively \"woundin g \" and scrapin g what is useless and needs to be separated and removed from the virg inal aspect of the psyche. But this wounding op ens three deep holes that allows the penetration by the spiritual li g ht of the soul that nourishes and illuminates the unconscious part in us. Throu g h this purification, our unconscious be comes conscious of itself. Thus the trident symbolically opens these three \"gat es\" to higher levels of enlightenment. Let us examine these three \"w ounds\" and three \"gates.\" The three wounds have the power of tran smuting our self-consciousness from its dualistic awareness to it s source, Cosmic Consciou sness. In piercing and perforating our \"self-conscious\" aspect, the prongs transmut e the egotistic and lower psychic character traits into their sp iritual perfect ideals. Thus the trident is an awakening device a powerful symbol for our purification and spiritual advancement through dream work. From a religious aspect, the trident and th e net represent two sy mbols of Christ as \"Fisher of Man.\" Furthermore, the trid ent’s prongs are of an equal length, symbolizing the Trinity. Hence, the trident is an effective instrument of purification and purgation for awakening th e inferior parts of the psyche and sensitizing them to higher spiritual impulses coming from the psyche that are influenced by the permanent witness. Moreover, the trident, as a symbol of Trin ity, impregnates and penetrates with its triune spiritual energies th e lower and higher aspects of our self-consciousness. In Christian tradition, the trident is placed in Satan’s hands as an instrument of punishment. However, esoteric tradition an d spiritual psychology tell us that we need to g o deep within ourselves to discover the blocked ener g ies, and then, \"fish\" them out, as it were, so as to bring them into the light of consciousness. Turning our attention within subtly develops the in tuitive faculty of our sixth sense to help us understand who we are and what we n eed to do to reintegrate our perfect model."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" Tiratna In Buddhism, the trident is taken as a sy mbol of the Tiratna, or triple jewel (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, meaning the Awakened One, the Truth expounded by Him, and the followers living in accordan ce with this Truth). It may also be regarded as the triple current of energy in man. And in our ow n spiritual context, the trident represents the instrument mo ving these same en ergies within our psyche. Top Dreams and the Psyche Dreams help us look deeper within our own psyche, to discover the Mystery of Man. But unless we devote ourselves and allocate time to work with the energies and meaning of dreams, they will always re main unsolicited and strange phenomena. That is why our psyche needs to dream, since dreams are a source of knowledge helping us in the process of releasin g unwanted g arba g e. Dreams are g iven to us to rescue us from lethargy and unconsciousness. Previous chapters have compared the ps yche to a mirror reflecting whatever preoccupies it. What is reflected in drea ms are the thoughts and emotions of our good and bad intentions and ex periences. It is in the mirr or of our psyche that real purification and understandin g take place, since we must become conscious of what appears on the surface of our psyche. Th e conscious impressions coming from a dream have an important role to play in the awakening proce ss as a whole, and each dream, each symbol en riches this process, since spiritual dream work takes into account the subtle purification pr ocess of the whole man. Dreams about purification are given to those of us who want to awaken our permanent and spiritual witnesses. To do th at, we must unite them in ou r \"ordinary\" level of self- consciousness. Therefore, we must become aware of our unconscious traits that need transformation. Withou t this, our ego cannot cont inue on this journey. This kind of spiritual work in itself exposes the psyche to the influences and intuitions pouring in from the permanent witness (see About the Mystery of Man, parts 1 – 4). This is the first import ant means of access, the \"key\" openin g the door of Poseidon’s mysterious palace in whic h are gathered all the past and present experiences, all the fears and stresses im prisoned since time immemorial. Those unconscious doubts and worries linger ho pelessly in the depth of darkness awaitin g the ri g ht moment for the thunderbolt of consciousness to penetrate them and brin g"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"them to the light of understanding. As a consequence of these delicate operations, the retrieved or \"fished ou t\" blocked energies float on the surface of dreams captured by our self-conscious e g o. To help us understand their meanin g , they take, in dreams, the shape of potent personal and universal symbols and archetypes. The ego must process these with subtlety, in tuition and sensitivity, so that their meaning becomes clea r and illuminating. At first, these types of dreams are usua lly experienced as nightmares since our consciousness has to reorganize and focus its attention on the inner dynamics of dream work. With phantasmagoric, incomp rehensible, and senseless dreams, we must try to focus our attent ion and use our intuition to grasp the irrati onal within ourselves. So, we should not ignore drea m sequences that might have nothing in common with each other or appear nonsensi cal. It really doesn’t matter if the beginning of a dream doesn’t match what fo llows it. Analogous to a jigsaw puzzle, we should use our intuition to retrieve th e \"seed idea\" and meaning of each part of our dreams. The expansion of the \"seed ideas\" and \"meaning\" is important, and it doesn’t matter if our intuitio n reveals different symbols or meanings to the dream. What counts is the effort exerted by our psyche to unravel a new dimension. Our ego must turn its attention to within itself , in the silent space within Being, where the impelling magnetic presence of th e intelligence of the heart reigns. Thus, if dreams first appear confusing, it is because these types of dreams release the pressure and stressed en ergies blocked in our psyc he. To release stress in dreams, the symbols are magnif ied so as to make an impact and emphasize certain aspects of a problem. Another reason for di sturbing dreams is to help us become conscious of the nature of our stress or anxiety. We should use our intuition to look at the incongruous symbols in our dreams , trying to \"respect\" their meaning. Intuition assists us in \"reading\" what goes on in our psyche, sinc e like a mirror, it reflects what goes on with in us. This is ho w, from our perman ent witness, we receive some practical solutions and inte rpretations. However, the exchange of intuitive ideas and feelings between our ps yche and ego occurs only if our ego is open to change. If we are w illing to work with the symbol s, then a special flow of energy streams from our permanent witne ss, allowing us to understand what we must do to remove the problem, an d transform what needs to change. Top The Inner Process of Dreams Spiritual psycholo g y looks at the esoteric and intuit ive aspect of dream work, and is based on inner guidance. However, psycholo gy is based on the interpretation and analysis of psychologists or facilitators. These two approaches may sound and even look the same, but they are no t. The first is solely based on inner revelation and the second on feedback and outside g uidance. The first is us ed by mystics, those g uided by their soul, who seek a cl oser relationship with th eir permanent witness. The second is used by those wh o are only interested in fi nding solutions to problems, new directions and meaning in times of crisis."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Both are useful and important dream work tools to purify and transform the psyche. If we want to know who we are, then we should start with the psychological approach, either alone, in a group, or with a therapist. We should also seek the guidance of the inner mast er, or presence within. Wh ichever way we choose, our first step should always be with the ps ychological approach before starting any other kind of spiritual work, since, this approach takes us to the depth of our psyche and is part of an alchemical proce ss. This is our descent into the world of Poseidon where our unconscious self wait s. The quest to awaken our spiritual awareness can be g in only after a certain amount of purification and transformation of the psyche. Our consciousness, havi ng taken the downward journey, is eventually drawn towards an ascendin g path. Then, what we receive becomes more subtle and enlightening since it comes wi thout distortion directly from the soul. If we are serious in our work with the spiritual level of dreams, we must also realize that dreams are like seeds cont aining potential whole trees. Dreams, therefore, contain the seed ideas comi ng from the perman ent witness. Their purpose is to transform our ordinary leve ls of consciousness to higher spiritual ones, since some dreams are in themselves examples of spiritual planes co-existin g in our psyche that are the seeds waiting in our subconscious to be recognized and awakened by our e g o. In other words, they are our spiritual levels of consciousness that permeate into our everyday consciousness. This is the g roundin g aspect of the whole process of dreams since, if we n eed to fathom the Mystery of Being and experience our own harmony and unity with it, then the natu re of our dreams changes. Moreover, the essence and meanin g of our dreams take a more abstract and irrational quality that cannot be shared with anyone , since they come directly from our permanent witness as a language of our soul, a language that can only be understood only intuitively. . The spiritual dimension of dreams could be described, at best, as delicate and subtle experiences given directly by our permanent witness to our consciousness in order to foster a healing an d purifying, leading to a ne w level of consciousness in us, which we must allow to u nfold in our ordinary lives. What really matters here is our wish for inner tr ansformation, since stron g desire to unfold a higher level of cons ciousness is an illuminatin g catalyst that ener g izes our psyche. This is an important element in dream work. The powe r of concentration and a stron g desire to work with dreams as t ools for our own tran sformation opens naturally and directly the inner path to the permanent witness. Top Dreams can become mystical Teachings Dream work is comparable to learning a new language. First we must learn the alphabet. Dreams are a new symbolic worl d opening up in our self-consciousness. Why do we say \"self-consciousness\"? Because, unless our self-consciousness awakens whilst dreaming, our dreams w ill have no impact and we will not remember anything of great importance. Thus we must gradually stimulate and"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"awaken our self-consciousness during dreams so that th ey can be something more than mere stress release. Later, when our ego or self-conscious ness \"awakens\" to its true nature—the impersonal Cosmic Consciou sness—then dreams and the inner process take a new direction, and we see, under stand and experience them in a totally different way since, from then on, our ego or self-consciousness realizes that it is just a vehicle for Cosmic Consciousness. We then perc eive all kinds of dreams and astral pro j ections differently, si nce the veil separatin g them from Cosmic Consciousness is no more. Our ego knows that it is just a reflection of the blazing light of the presence of God or Pure Being. When the veil is to rn, and ego and soul meet and merge, the true identity of the Creator and initiator of our inner process becomes even clearer. The impersonal Cosmic Consci ousness within us is the sole creator of dreams, and its limited self-conscious counter part, our ego, it is seen at the other end of the process as the receiver of dreams. The mission of Cosmic Cons ciousness within man is to enlighten man’s ego. In other words, Cosmic Consciousness active ly guides the process of awakening the ego to its true nature, hence it direct s the inner world of dreams and astral pro j ections durin g sleep. Cosmic Consciousness take s over and creates whatever is necessary for our self-consciousness to understand and experience our e g o.
