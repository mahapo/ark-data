[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Six Studies of Out-of-the-Body Experiences Charles T. Tart [This article is in press with the Journal of Near Death Studies, as of March 30, 1997.] Abstract Because of a pernicious confusion between science a nd scient ism , many people react negatively to the idea of scien tific investigation of NDEs, but genuine science can cont ribute a great deal to understanding NDEs and helpi ng experiencers integrate their experiences with every day life. After noting how genuine scientific inves tigation of certain parapsychological phenomena has established a wider world view that must take NDEs seriously, six stud ies of the authors’ of a basic component of the NDE, the out-o f-body experience (OBE) are reviewed. Three of thes e studies found distinctive physiological correlates of OBEs in the two talented persons investigated, and one f ound strong evidence for veridical, paranormal perception of th e OBE location. The studies using hypnosis to try t o produce OBEs demonstrated the complexity of a simple model that a person’s mind is actually at an OBE location vers us merely hallucinating being out, and require us to look at how even our perception of being in our bodies is a ctually a complex simulation, a biopsychological virtual reality. Article Many people who hear about near death experiences ( NDEs) think something like “Wow! I wish I could hav e that experience and that knowledge!” Without wanting to have the hard part of coming close to death, of cou rse! As Atwater (Atwater, 1988) and others have documented, however, it’s often not a simple matter that you s tart out “ordinary,” have an extraordinary experience, and t hen “live happily ever after.” Years of confusion, conflict and struggle may be necessary as you try to make sense of the NDE and its aftermaths, and to integrate thi s new understanding into your life. Part of that struggle and integration takes place on transpersonal [3] levels that are very difficult to put into words, part on a more ordinar y level of questioning, changing, and expanding you r world view. I’m not especially qualified to talk from a higher spir itual perspective, but I have gathered some useful information in my career about the nature of the world that may help with that part of the integration, and that’s my pr imary emphasis. I have worked primarily as a scientist for the last 35 years, so I’ll start by discriminating between genuine science and scientism, and that describe six studies of out-of- the-body experiences (OBEs) I’ve carried out and so me of the conclusions I’ve come to that may be helpful in fur thering understanding and integration. Science and Scientism in the Modern World: We live in a world that has been miraculously trans formed by science and technology. This is very good in some ways, not in others. The negative aspect of particular co ncern for us today is that this material progress h as been accompanied by a shift in our belief systems that is unhealthy in many ways, viz. a partial crushing of the human spirit by scientism . Note carefully that I said scient ism , not science. I am a scientist, which I consider a noble calling that demands the best from me, and I’m very much in favor of using genuine science to help our understanding in all areas of life, including the spiritual. Scientism, on the other hand, is a p erversion of genuine science. Scientism in our time consists of a dogmatic commitment to a materialist philosophy tha t “explains away” the spiritual rather than actuall y examining it carefully and trying to understand it (Wellmuth, 19 44). Those of you who have a negative feeling when I first mentioned science have probably gotten it from enco unters with scientism. Since scientism never recogn izes itself as a belief system, but always thinks of itself as true science, the confusion is pernicious."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The information I want to share here was obtained i n my attempts to practice genuine science in areas of mutual interest to us. Genuine science is a four part, con tinuing process that is always subject to questioning, expansion and revision. It is a process that begins with a commit ment to observe things as carefully and honestly as you can. Then you think about what your observations mean, i.e. you d evise theories and explanations, trying to be as lo gical as possible in the process. The next, third step is very import ant though. Our minds are wonderfully clever, so cl ever that they can “make sense” out of almost anything with hindsight, i.e. come up with some sort of plausible interpret ation of why things happened the way we observed them to. But ju st because our theories and explanations seem brill iant and logical, that doesn’t mean that we really understan d the world we observed, we could have a wonderful post hoc rationalization. So the third part of the genuine s cientific process is a requirement that you keep lo gically working with, refining and expanding your theories, your explanat ions, and then make predictions about new areas of reality that you haven’t observed yet. You’ve observed the results o f conditions A, B and C, e.g., and come up with a s atisfying explanation as to why they happened. Now develop yo ur theory to predict what will happen under conditi ons D, E and F, and then go out and set up those conditions and see what actually happens. If you’ve successfully p redicted the outcomes, good, keep developing your theories. But if your predictions don’t come true, your theories may need substantial revision or need to be thrown out altog ether. It doesn’t matter how logical or brilliant or elega nt or emotionally satisfying your theories are, the y are always subject to this empirical test with new observations. Indee d, if a theory doesn’t have any empirical, testable consequences, it may be philosophy or religion or personal belief, b ut it’s not a scientific theory. Thus science has a built in rule to help us overcome our normal human tendency to get emotio nally committed to our beliefs. This is where scien tism corrupts the genuine scientific process. Because people caug ht in scientism have an emotional attachment to a t otally materialistic view of the world, they won’t really look at data like NDEs that imply a spiritual, non- material side to reality. They don’t recognize that their belief that everything can be explained in purely material terms should be treated like any scientific theory, i.e. it should be subject to continual test and modified or reject ed when found wanting. This requirement of continual testing, refinement a nd expansion is part of the fourth process of genui ne science, namely open, full and honest communication about al l the other three aspects. You share your observati ons, theories and predictions so that colleagues can test and ext end them. Thus you as an individual may have blind spots and prejudices, but as it’s unlikely all your colleagues have the same ones, a gradual proce ss of refinement, correction and expansion takes place and scientific knowledge prog resses. While I have described this process as genuine scie nce, need I say that it is also a quite sensible wa y of proceeding in most areas of life? Inadequacy of Scientism in Dealing with NDEs: Now let’s apply these thoughts about science and sc ientism to NDEs. Scientism, a dogmatic materialism masquerading as science, dismisses the NDE a priori as something that cannot be what it seems to be, vi z. a mind or soul traveling outside the physical body, either in the physical w orld or in some nonphysical world. So the NDE is au tomatically dismissed as a hallucination or, more likely, as so me kind of psychopathology. But what if we practice actual science and look, with an objective as possible view, at ex periences like the NDE without prejudging them as i mpossible? First, there is the data from a hundred years of sc ientific parapsychological research that, using the best kind of scientific methodology, shows us that we can’t simp ly dismiss the NDE as a priori impossible. A world view that countenances such dismissal is ignorant, prejudiced , or both. It is presumptuous to summarize a centur y of research in one paragraph, but as I want to focus on the out-of -body aspect of NDEs, I will make an attempt. Basically, hundreds of experiments have shown that sometimes the human mind can do things that are paraconceptual to our understanding of physical reality, i.e. they make no sense given our current understanding of p hysics and reasonable extensions of it, but they happen anyway . They are empirical realities. The four major psyc hic phenomena, collectively referred to as psi phenomena, that are well established are telepathy , clairvoyance, precognition, and psychokinesis (PK). Sometimes a person can detect w hat’s happening in another’s mind (telepathy), dete ct what’s happening at a distance in the physical world when it’s not currently known to another mind (clairvoya nce), predict the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"future when in principle it’s not predictable (prec ognition), or affect physical processes just by wil ling them to be changed (PK). The reality of these psi phenomena, t he Big Four as I often call them (Tart, 1977a), req uires us to expand our world view from a world that is only material to one that also has mind as some kind of independent reality in itself, capable of sometimes doing things that t ranscend ordinary physical limits. So if in an NDE a person feels outside her or his body, or claims to have acquired information about distant events, for example, it may be an illusion in a particular case, but you can’t scientifically say it must be illusion. You have to actually examine the exper ience, the data, not ignore it or prejudicially “explain it aw ay” without really paying attention or being logica l. Thus the Big Four of psi phenomena give us a wider view of reality th at calls for a careful look at NDEs, rather than a priori dismissal. Out-of-the-Body Experiences: Since the beginning of my career, I’ve been fascina ted by what used to be a very little known phenomen on, the out-of- the-body experience (OBE). While the term OBE is so metimes used rather sloppily, here’s how I defined it over two decades ago: First, let’s talk about a subtype which I’m tempted to call the classical out-of-the-body experience, or dOBE— the “discrete out-of-the-body experience.” This is the experience where the subject perceives himself as e xperientially located at some other location than where he knows his physical body to be. In addition, he generally feels that he’s in his ordinary state of consciousness, so that the co ncepts space, time, and location make sense to him. Further, there is a feeling of no contact with the physical body, a fee ling of temporary semi-total disconnection from it. (Tart, 1974), p. 117) An NDE, on the other hand, usually has, speaking in an oversimplified way, two major aspects. First is the locational component, the OBE component: you find yourself loc ated somewhere outside your physical body. Second i s the noetic and altered state of consciousness (ASC) component: you know things not knowable in o rdinary ways and your state of consciousness functions in quite a differe nt way as part of this knowing. I separate these co mponents as they don’t always go together. You can have an OBE while feeling that your consciousness remains in its ord inary mode or state of functioning. If right this minute, e.g., y our perceptions showed you that you were someplace else than where you know your body is but your consciousness was fu nctioning basically like it is right now, that’s wh at a classic OBE feels like. The OBE also seems as real or “realer” than ordinary experience. Reality is more complex t han this, but this distinction between “pure” OBEs and typical NDEs wi ll be useful for our discussion. Out-of-the-Body Experiences: First Study I did my first parapsychological experiment in 1957 while I was still a sophomore at MIT, studying ele ctrical engineering. It was an attempt to produce OBEs with the aid of hypnosis, inspired by several old artic les, especially one by a sociologist turned parapsychologist, Hornell H art (Hart, 1953). Basically, I trained several fellow students to be moderately good hypnotic subjects and then guided t hem in individual hypnotic sessions, where I suggested that the parti cipant’s mind would leave his body and go to the ba sement of a house several miles away, a place in a suburb of Bo ston they had never physically been to, and then de scribe what they saw in that basement. The target house was the home of two parapsychologi sts, J. Fraser Nicol and Betty Humphrey, who had de liberately arranged a very unusual collection of objects in a corner of the basement. I reasoned that if any one of the subjects gave a good description of these unusual objects, I woul d know his mind had been there while out of body. N ote the implicit model I had of OBEs, viz. that it was pretty much e quivalent to moving your sense organs, especially y our eyes, to a distant physical location. We’ll question this simp le model later. I had also placed an electronic dev ice called a capacitance relay beside the target location to det ect and record any disturbance in the electrical pr operties of the space right around the targets, hoping that my hypnotized OBE participants might physically perturb the prop erties of space while they traveled to the targets, providing furth er evidence that the mind could actually leave the body. I installed the capacitance relay before Nicol and Humphrey placed any target materials on the table: I didn’t want to know what the targets were, that way I couldn’t inadvertently giv e away any cues about them."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Alas, while I would not call the experiment a failu re (I learned a lot from it), things did not work o ut clearly. The capacitance relay device had to be abandoned, as it went on and off every time the house furnace did. My participants’ descriptions of the target had occasional resemblan ces to the target materials, but the comparison was much too subjective for me to put any reliance on. A “side t rip” by one of the participants who was asked to de scribe my home in New Jersey, that he had never been to, was similarl y suggestive, but not sufficiently so to convince m e his mind had indeed left his body and traveled south. I had not yet learned how essential objective ways of evaluat ing results in parapsychology were. Out-of-the-Body Experiences: Second Study My next study of OBEs in the mid60s happened throug h coincidence, although, given some synchronicities that occurred years later (Tart, 1981), I sometimes susp ect that it was Coincidence. While chatting about v arious things with a young woman who baby sat for us, I found out that , ever since early childhood, it was an ordinary pa rt of her sleep experience to occasionally feel she had awakened fr om sleep mentally, but was floating near the ceilin g, looking down on her physical body. This experience was clearly d ifferent from her dreams and usually only lasted a few seconds. As a child, not knowing better, she thought this was a normal part of sleeping. After mentioning it once or twice as a teenager she found it wasn’t normal and she didn’t talk about it anymore! She had never read anything about OBEs, as this was long before Moody’s Life After Life (Moody, 1975), so she didn’t have any idea what to make of it. I was quite interested as she said she still had the experience occasionally. I told her there were two theories about OBEs, one that they were what they seemed to be, viz. the min d temporarily leaving the physical body, and the other that OBEs were just some sort of hallucination. How, she wond ered, could she tell the difference? I suggested she could write th e numbers one to ten on slips of paper, put them in a box on a bedside table, randomly select one to turn up without looki ng at it before going to sleep and then, if she had an OBE during the night, look at and memorize the number and then che ck the accuracy of her memory in the morning. I saw her a few weeks later and she reported that s he had tried the experiment seven times. She was al ways right about the number, so it seemed to her that she was really “out” during these experiences. Was there anything else interesting we could do? Miss Z, as I’ve called her in my primary report on our work (Tart, 1968), had interrupted her college work to earn needed funds and was moving from the area in a few weeks, but before she left I was able to have her s pend four nights in my sleep research laboratory. I knew about NDEs so I wondered what physiological changes would take place in her body when she had an OBE: was she physiologically c oming close to death? And I wanted to test her appa rent ESP ability to see numbers from outside her body. Each night I recorded brain waves (EEG) in a typical fas hion used in dream research [4] that allowed me to distinguish waking, drowsiness, and the various stages of sleep. I measured eye movements, which are important in dreaming, with a tiny, flexible strain gauge taped over one eye and I also measured the electrical resistance of her skin, which indica tes activity in the autonomic nervous system, using electrodes taped to her right palm and forearm. On two of the four nigh ts I was also able to measure heart rate and relati ve blood pressure with a little device called an optical plethysmogra ph that shines a beam of light through a finger. As for ascertaining whether she was, in some sense, really “out” of her body during her OBEs: Each laboratory night, after the subject was lying in bed, the physiological recordings were running s atisfactorily, and she was ready to go to sleep, I went into my office down the hall, opened a table of random numbers at random, threw a coin onto the table as a means of random entry into the page, and copied off the first five digits imm ediately above where the coin landed. These were copied with a bla ck marking pen, in figures approximately two inches high, onto a small piece of paper. Thus they were quite discrete visually. This five-digit random number constitute d the parapsychological target for the evening. I then sl ipped it into an opaque folder, entered the subject ’s room, and slipped the piece of paper onto the shelf without at any ti me exposing it to the subject. This now provided a target which would be clearly visible to anyone whose eyes were locate d approximately six and a half feet off the floor o r higher, but was otherwise not visible to the subject."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The subject was instructed to sleep well, to try an d have an OOBE experience, and if she did so, to tr y to wake up immediately afterwards and tell me about it, so I c ould note on the polygraph records when it had occu rred. She was also told that if she floated high enough to read t he five-digit number she should memorize it and wak e up immediately afterwards to tell me what it was. ((Tart, 1968), p . 8) Over her four laboratory nights, Miss Z reported th ree clear cut incidents of “floating” experiences, where she felt that she might have partly gotten out of her body but th e experience didn’t fully develop, and two full OBE s. My general impression of the physiological patterns accompanyi ng her floating and full OBE experiences is first, she was in no way “near death.” There were no major heart rate or blood pressure changes and no particular activity in the autonomic nervous system. A physician would not call for the crash cart. Second, floating and full OBEs occurred in an EEG s tage of what I would call poorly developed stage 1 EEG, mixed with transitory periods of brief wakefulness. Stage 1 EEG normally accompanies the descent into sleep, the hypnagogic period, and later dreaming during the night, but th ese were not like those ordinary stage 1 periods be cause they were often dominated by alphoid activity, a distinctly slower version of the ordina ry waking alpha rhythm, and there were no rapid eye movements (REMs) accompanying these stage 1 periods, as almost always happens in normal drea ming. I had studied many records of sleep EEG records by th en and can say the above with confidence. As to wha t this poorly developed stage 1 with dominant alphoid and no REMs means.....that is something of a mystery. I showed t he recordings to one of the world’s leading authoritie s on sleep research, William Dement, and he agreed with me that it was a distinctive pattern, but we had no idea what it meant. But it has left an idea with me that I’ve never been able to follow up, but which might prove fruitful. If you c ould teach someone to produce a drowsy state and sl owed alpha rhythms, say through biofeedback training, would th e proper psychological procedures then make it easi er to have an OBE? Indeed I found a report of a sensory deprivati on study that reported alphoid rhythms occurring an d also reported some subjects feeling like they had left their bodi es (Heron, 1957). I wrote to the researcher asking if these two things were associated, but never received a reply. Too “f ar out” a question, I guess. On the first three laboratory nights Miss Z reporte d that in spite of occasionally being “out,” she ha d not been able to control her experiences enough to be in position to see the target number (which was different each ni ght). On the fourth night, at 5:57am, there was a seven minute p eriod of somewhat ambiguous EEG activity, sometimes looking like stage 1, sometimes like brief wakings. Then Miss Z awakened and called out over the intercom that the target number was 25132, which I wrote on the EEG recording. Afte r she slept a few more minutes I woke her so she co uld go to work and she reported on the previous awakening tha t: I woke up; it was stifling in the room. Awake for a bout five minutes. I kept waking up and drifting of f, having floating feelings over and over. I needed to go higher becau se the number was lying down. Between 5:50 and 6:00 A.M. that did it. . . I wanted to go read the number in the n ext room, but I couldn’t leave the room, open the d oor, or float through the door. . .. I couldn’t turn on the air condition er! The number 25132 was indeed the correct target numb er. I had learned something about designing experim ents since my first OBE experiment and precise evaluation was possible here. The odds against guessing a 5digit n umber by chance alone are 100,000 to 1, so this is a remarka ble event! Note also that Miss Z had apparently exp ected me to have propped the target number up against the wall behin d the shelf, but she correctly reported that it was lying flat. Whenever striking parapsychological results occur b oth skeptics and other parapsychologists worry that they might have been fraudulently produced, or happened throug h some normal sensory channel, for such things have happened historically. A colleague and I, Professor Arthur H astings, who is a skilled amateur magician as well as a parapsychologist, carefully inspected the laborator y later to see if there was any chance of this. We let our eyes dark adapt to see if there was any chance the number mig ht be reflected in the plastic casing of the clock on the wall above the number, but nothing could be seen unless we sho ne a bright flashlight directly on the numbers. Unl ess Miss Z, unknown to us, had employed concealed apparatus to illuminate and/or inspect the target number, which we had no reason to suspect, there was no normal way for anyo ne lying in bed, and having only very limited movem ent due to the attached electrodes, could see it."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I was cautious in my original write-up of these res ults, however, saying “...Miss Z’s reading of the tar get number cannot be considered as providing conclusive eviden ce for a parapsychological effect.” I thought I was just making a standard statement of caution, as no one experiment is ever absolutely conclusive about anything, but over zealous critics have pounced on this statement as saying th at I didn’t think there were any parapsychological effects in this study. I have always thought it is highly likely th at some form of ESP, perhaps because Miss Z was rea lly “out” in some real sense, is far and away the best explanati on of the results. The most interesting criticism I have repeatedly go tten when describing this study comes from believer s, rather than skeptics. Someone usually asks me whether I knew wh at the target number was. When I reply that I did, the criticism is that perhaps Miss Z wasn’t really out of her body, she was merely using telepathy to read the number f rom my mind! I admit, with pleasure, that this first study of this type was indeed too crude to rule out the counter explanation of “mere telepathy.” As you can imagine, I was quite pleased with the ou tcome of this study. An unusual experience, the OBE , was accompanied by an unusual EEG pattern and there was strong evidence that Miss Z was able to correctly perceive the world from her out of body location. I was also gre atly pleased at demonstrating that an exotic phenom enon like the OBE could be studied in the laboratory and have lig ht cast on it, and the publication of this study st imulated other parapsychologists to think about doing research alo ng these lines. My only regret was that Miss Z move d away and I was never able to track her down and do further wor k while I had laboratory facilities available. Peop le who can have an OBE almost on demand are, to put it mildly, very , very rare. Out-of-the-Body Experiences: Third Study Some of the most interesting studies I have been ab le to do on OBEs have been with my dear friend the late Robert A. Monroe, whose classic book, Journey Out of the Body ((Monroe, 1971a)) , is probably well known to many of you, as well as his subsequent books Far Journeys ((Monroe, 1985) and Ultimate Journey ( Monroe, 1994)). Monroe was an archetypally “normal” American business man who was “drafted” quite involuntarily into the world of OB Es and psychic things as a result of a series of strange “ attacks” of “vibrations” in the late 1950s, culmina ting in a classic OBE. Stockton’s biography ((Stockton, 1989)) provides fu ll background material on Monroe’s life. I quote hi s account of his first OBE: Spring, 1958: If I thought I faced incongruities at this point, it was because I did not know what was yet to come. Some four weeks later, when the vibrations came again, I was duly cautious about attempting to move an arm or leg. It was late at night, and I was lying in bed before sleep. My wife had fallen asleep beside me. There was a s urge that seemed to be in my head, and quickly the condition spread through my body. It all seemed the same. As I lay t here trying to decide how to analyze the thing in another way, I j ust happened to think how nice it would be to take a glider up and fly the next afternoon (my hobby at that time) Without considering any consequences—not knowing there woul d be any— I thought of the pleasure it would bring. After a moment, I became aware of something pressin g against my shoulder. Half-curious, I reached back and up to feel what it was. My hand encountered a smooth wall . I moved my hand along the wall the length of my a rm and it continued smooth and unbroken. My senses fully alert, I tried to see in the dim li ght. It was a wall, and I was lying against it with my shoulder. I immediately reasoned that I had gone to sleep and f allen out of bed. (I had never done so before, but all sorts of strange things were happening, and falling out of bed was q uite possible.) Then I looked again. Something was wrong. This wall had no windows, no furniture against it, no doors. It was not a wall in my bedroom. Yet somehow it was familiar. Id entification came instantly. It wasn’t a wall, it w as the ceiling. I was floating against the ceiling, bouncing gently w ith any movement I made. I rolled in the air, start led, and looked down. There, in the dim light below me, was the bed . There were two figures lying in the bed. To the r ight was my wife. Beside her was someone else. Both seemed asle ep."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"This was a strange dream, I thought. I was curious. Whom would I dream to be in bed with my wife? I lo oked more closely, and the shock was intense. I was the someo ne on the bed! My reaction was almost instantaneous. Here I was, t here was my body. I was dying, this was death, and I wasn’t ready to die. Somehow, the vibrations were killing me. De sperately, like a diver, I swooped down to my body and dove in. I then felt the bed and the covers, and when I opened my eyes, I was looking at the room from the perspe ctive of my bed. What had happened? Had I truly almost died? My hear t was beating rapidly, but not unusually so. I move d my arms and legs. Everything seemed normal. The vibrations had faded away. I got up and walked around the room , looked out the window, and smoked a cigarette. ((Monroe, 1971b ) pp. 2728) Monroe went to his doctor, of course, to see what w as wrong with him (does this sound familiar to you NDErs?), but his health was fine. Fortunately he eventually spok e to a psychologist friend who told him that yogis had experiences like this and he should explore them, rather than w orry. He didn’t find this advice particularly reass uring, but he had no choice in the matter as the vibrations and subseque nt OBEs continued to occur. I met Monroe in the fall of 1965 when I took a rese arch position at the University of Virginia Medical School in Charlottesville. He was having OBEs regularly by th en, although he hadn’t developed the HemiSync© tech niques he later used to train others. Monroe was as curious a bout the nature of OBEs as I was and also able and eager to question his own experiences, rather than be dogmatically sw ept up in them. He was fascinated by what I had fou nd out in working with Miss Z. Did his own body show deathlik e changes or similar brain wave changes? Could we t est whether he was “really” at the OBE location, rather than ju st hallucinating it? While he had had some experien ces of being at a distant location where he was able to confirm the e vents later, there were too many others where such confirmation was only partial or even negative, even thought the exp eriences felt perfectly real. Too, if there were di stinctive physiological changes during an OBE, then if we cou ld learn to produce these same changes by other mea ns in people we might have a way of helping them to have OBEs. M onroe was as curious about the answers to these que stions as I was. I was able to have Monroe come in for eight late ni ght sessions (his OBEs usually began from sleep) fr om December 1965 to August 1966 at the hospital’s EEG laborator y while he tried to get out of his body. This labor atory was not really equipped for sleep work, so much of the time Monroe was not completely comfortable on the cot w e brought in and was unable to have an OBE. On his eighth night, however, things got interesting. Here are Monroe’s notes, written the next morning. \"After some time spent in attempting to ease ear el ectrode-discomfort, concentrated on ear to ‘numb’ i t, with partial success. Then went into fractional relaxation techn ique again. Halfway through the second time around in the pattern the sense of warmth appeared, with full consciousne ss (or so it seemed) remaining. I decided to try th e ‘rollout’ method (i.e., start to turn over gently, just as if you we re turning over in bed using the physical body). I started to feel as if I were turning, and at first thought I truly was movi ng the physical body. I felt myself roll off the ed ge of the cot, and braced for the fall to the floor. When I didn’t hit immediately, I knew that I had disassociated. I mo ved away from the physical and through a darkened area, then came upo n two men and a woman. The ‘seeing’ wasn’t too good , but better as I came closer. The woman, tall, dark-haired, in her forties (?) was sitting on a loveseat or couch. Seated to the right of her was one man. In front of her, and to her lef t slightly was the second man. They all were strang ers to me, and were in conversation which I could not hear. I trie d to get their attention, but could not. Finally, I reached over, and pinched (very gently!) the woman on her left side j ust below the rib carriage. It seemed to get a reac tion, but still no communication. I decided to return to the physical for orientation and start again. Back into the physical was achieved simply, by thou ght of return. Opened physical eyes, all was fine, swallowed to wet my dry throat, closed my eyes, let the warmth surge up, then used the same rollout technique. This tim e, I let myself float to the floor beside the cot. I fell slowly, a nd could feel myself passing through the various EE G wires on the way down. I touched the floor lightly, then could ‘see’ the light coming through the open doorway to the o uter EEG rooms. Careful to keep ‘local,’ I went under the cot, keep ing in slight touch with the floor, and floating in a horizontal position, fingertips touching the floor to keep in position. I went slowly through the doorway. I was looking fo r the technician. but could not find her. She was not in the room to the right (control console room), and I went out in to the brightly"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"lighted outer room. I looked in all directions, and suddenly, there she was. However, she was not alon e. A man was with her, standing to her left as she faced me. I t ried to attract her attention, and was almost immed iately rewarded with a burst of warm joy and happiness that I had finall y achieved the thing we had been working for. She w as truly excited, and happily and excitedly embraced me. I responded, and only slight sexual overtones were present whic h I was about 90% able to disregard. After a moment, I pulled bac k, and gently put my hands on her face, one on each cheek, and thanked her for her help. However, there was no dir ect intelligent objective communication with her ot her than the above. None was tried, as I was too excited at fina lly achieving the disassociation and staying ‘local .’ I then turned to the man, who was about her height, curly haired, some of which dropped over the side of his forehead. I tried to attract his attention, but was unable to do so. Again, reluctantly. I decided to pinch him gently, which I did. It did not evoke any response that I noticed. Feeling something calling for a return to the physical, I s wung around and went through the door, and slipped easily back into the physical. Reason for discomfort: dry throat an d throbbing ear. After checking to see that the integration was comp lete, that I ‘felt’ normal in all parts of the body , I opened my eyes, sat up, and called to the technician. She came in, and I told her that I had made it finally, and that I had seen her, however, with a man. She replied that it was her hu sband. I asked if he was outside, and she replied t hat he was, that he came to stay with her during these late hours. I as ked why I hadn’t seen him before, and she replied t hat it was ‘policy’ for no outsiders to see subjects or patients. I exp ressed the desire to meet him, to which she acceded . The technician removed the electrodes, and I went o utside with her and met her husband. He was about h er height, curly haired, and after several conversational amen ities, I left. I did not query the technician or he r husband as to anything they saw, noticed, or felt. However, my im pression was that he definitely was the man I had o bserved with her during the nonphysical activity. My second impressi on was that she was not in the control console room when I visited them, but was in another room, standing up, with hi m. This may be hard to determine, if there is a fir st rule that the technician is supposed to always stay at the consol e. If she can be convinced that the truth is more i mportant in this case, perhaps this second aspect can be validated. The only supporting evidence other than what might have appeared on the EEG lies in the presence of the husband, of which I was unaware prior to the experiment. This l atter fact can be verified by the technician, I am sure.” ((Tart, 196 7), pp. 254255) As with Miss Z, Monroe’s physiological changes were interesting but not medically exciting. He was not at all near death, just showing the relaxed body characteristic s of sleep and relaxation. This fits the general pa ttern that emerged from many later studies that says that while being physiologically close to death may facilitate the o ccurrence of an NDE, it’s not necessary for either NDEs or OBEs. As to exactly what is Monroe’s state during OBEs, the re is some general similarity to Miss Z’s in that both involve a stage 1 EEG pattern that is somewhat like, but n ot identical to, ordinary dreaming, but the two patterns, in the lim ited sampling of these two studies, are not identic al. Monroe had some alphoid activity, but not the large amount Mis s Z showed. He also showed REMs in his second OBE w here he reported seeing a stranger with the technician. Too , in the all night study we also did with Monroe to get a baseline of normal sleep, when he wasn’t trying for OBEs, he sh owed a normal pattern, and did not call the stage 1 REM periods that occurred there OBEs. He sharply distinguishes the states of consciousness of his dreams and his O BEs. We must remember too that while there is a strong correlation between EEG stage 1REM pattern and the psychological experience of dreaming, correlation is not causalit y or identity with the physiological state of stage 1. We can think of stage 1REM as a physiological state that has evolve d during the sleep of mammals. In humans the psycho logical activity of dreaming can use this physiological pat tern to readily manifest itself, although psycholog ical states very like dreaming may sometimes occur in other physiological conditions. Too, the lucid dream , a dream state in which consciousness “wakes up” and feels like it’s pretty much in full possession of its waking faculties al so occurs in the physiological state of stage 1REM (see, e.g., (LaBe rge, 1991)). Perhaps an OBE is also facilitated in this same physiological state. Was Monroe really “out” when he saw the technician away from her machine and speaking with a strange m an? In her notes, my technician reports: .....In the second sleep the patient saw me (the tech ) and he said I had a visitor, which I did. However , it is possible that Mr. Monroe may have heard the visitor cough during his (cigarette) break between sleeps. Mr. Monroe st ates that he"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"patted the visitor on the cheeks and tried to take his hand but that the visitor avoided. Mr. X recall s that he left the cot, went under it and out the door into the recording r oom and then into the hallway ..... The patient did n ot see the number.” Thus we have only weak evidence that Monroe was act ually “out” on this occasion, a result he found as unsatisfactory as I did. I left the University of Virginia post after a year there to take up a new position at the University of California at Davis, so our work (and I do say our, for I try (but don’t always succeed) to always work with collaborators/ colleagues, not “subjects” — see (Tart, 1977b)) ended for the time being on a note both encouraging and frustrating. T he scientific world had doubled it’s knowledge about EEG patterns during OBEs, since there were now two studies inst ead of none (although, as you can imagine, orthodox science has paid almost no attention to this knowledge), but a common pattern had not emerged, and the parapsychological aspects of Monroe’s OBEs had not been confirmed in this stu dy. Out-of-the-Body Experiences: Fourth Study Several months later, after moving to California, I wanted to have more data about whether Monroe was really “out” in his OBEs, so I decided to try an experiment in whic h my wife Judy and I would, for a short period, try to create a sort of “psychic beacon” by concentrating on him, to try to help Monroe have an OBE and travel to our home. If he could accurately describe our home, this would be good ev idence for a psi component in his OBEs because he h ad no idea what our new home was like. As in my first study us ing hypnosis to try to produce OBEs, I was hoping f or a big effect that would be obvious evidence of ESP. I telephoned Monroe and told him that we would try to guide him across the country to our home at some unspecified time during the night of the experiment. That was a ll I told him. That evening I randomly selected a t ime to begin concentrating; the only restriction I put on my cho ice was that it would be some time after I thought Monroe had been asleep for a while. The time turned out to be 11:00 PM. California time, 2:00 AM where Monroe lived in Virginia. At 11:00, my wife and I began our concentration; but a t 11:05, the telephone rang. We never get calls lat e at night, so this was rather surprising and disturbing, but we did no t answer the phone, nor did we have an answering ma chine so we didn’t know who had called. We tried to continue co ncentrating and did so until 11:30PM. The following day, I telephoned Monroe and noncommi ttally told him that the results had been encouragi ng but that I was not going to say anything more about it until h e had mailed me his written account of what he had experienced. His account was as follows: The evening passed uneventfully, and 1 finally got into bed about 1:40 am, still very much wide awake. The cat was lying in bed with me. After a long period of calmin g mind, a sense of warmth swept over body, no break in consciousness, no pre-sleep. Almost immediately fel t something (or someone) rocking my body from side to side, then tugging at my feet! (Heard cat let out complaining yowl.) I recognized immediately that this had somet hing to do with Charley’s experiment, and with full trust, did not feel my usual caution with strangers (!) The tuggin g at my legs continued, and I finally managed to separate one se cond body arm and hold it up, feeling around in the dark. After a moment, the tugging stopped and a hand took my wris t, first gently, then very, very firmly and pulled me out of the physical (body) easily. Still trusting, and a littl e excited, I expressed feeling to go to Charley, if that was where he (it) wanted to lead me. The answer came back affirmative ly (although there was no sense of personality, ver y businesslike). With the hand around my wrist very firmly, I could feel a part of the arm belonging to the hand (sligh tly hairy, muscular male). But could not “see” who belonged to the arm. Also heard my name called. Then we starte d to move, with the familiar feeling of something like air rus hing around my body. After a short trip (seemed aro und 5 seconds in duration) , we stopped, and the hand released my wr ist. There was complete silence and darkness. When I drifted down into what seemed to be a room.... (Tart, 1977a), pp. 190191. When Monroe finished his brief OBE he got out of be d to telephone me: it was 11:05 PM, our time. Thus he experienced a tug pulling him from his body within one or two minutes of the time we started concentra ting. The portion of his account that I have omitted, on the other hand, his description of our home and what my wife and I were doing, was quite inaccurate. He perceived too many people in the room, perceived my wife and me perfor ming actions"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"that we did not do, etc. Looking at the description , I would conclude that nothing psychic had happene d. Thinking about the precise timing, though, I can’t help but wonder. Can one have an OBE in which one is really “out” in some sense, yet have grossly mistaken (extrasensory) per ceptions of the location one has gone to? I don’t k now if that was the case in this experiment, but after years of res earching how much perception is a semi-arbitrary co nstruction, often badly distorted, even in our normal state (Tart, 19 86), (Tart, 1994), I have no doubt that this is pos sible for OBEs. We’ll return to this question later. Out-of-the-Body Experiences: Fifth Study In 1968 I was able to do one further study with Bob Monroe when he briefly visited California. I had a functioning sleep laboratory at UC Davis, more comfortable than the University of Virginia EEG lab, and he spent a n afternoon with me and my assistants (Tart, 1969). In the course of a two-hour session, Monroe had two brief OBEs, and reported awakening within a few se conds after each, allowing correlation of physiological recordi ngs with the OBEs. EEG, eye movements, and peripher al blood flow (plethysmograph) were again recorded, and he was mo nitored via closed circuit TV for the first OBE. [5] Monroe was asked to try to produce an OBE, then to travel into the equipment room where I and my assis tants were, and to read a five-digit target number in that equi pment room. In his first OBE, he reported finding h imself in the hall connecting the rooms for a period of eight to ten s econds at most, but then being forced to return to his body because of breathing difficulties. In his second OBE, he repor ted trying to follow the EEG cable through the wall to the equipment room but, to his amazement, found himself outside t he building and facing the wall of another building , still following a cable. He later recognized a courtyard on the ins ide of the building, which had a three story wall a nd was 180 degrees opposite the equipment room, as the place he had ex perienced himself at. Although he had no memory of ever having seen this courtyard, it is possible that he could h ave gotten a look at it while in my office earlier in the afternoon. There was no cable in the courtyard, at least not on the surface although there may have been buried electri cal cables under the surface connecting the wings of the building, a nd there were some cables from the laboratory room to my office, going most of the way toward the courtyard. Again we have that frustrating pattern of my resear ch with Monroe of no ESP results clear enough to be conclusive, but not results so clearly inaccurate that I would feel comfortable saying nothing at all happened. The EE G prior to the Monroe’s reported OBE may be roughly classified as a borderline or hypnagogic state, a stage 1 pattern containing instances of alphoid activity rhythm (indicative of drowsiness) and theta activity (a normal sleeping pattern, part of stage 1). This pattern persisted through the first OBE, but was accompanied by a sudden fall of systol ic blood pressure lasting seven seconds, this being roughly equivalen t to Monroe’s estimated length of his OBE. There wa s REM activity of an ambiguous nature during this period. The seco nd OBE was reported after a period of EEG shifting between stage 1 and stage 2 sleep. This second OBE’s exact durati on is unknown, but appears to have been accompanied by a similar stage 1 pattern, and only two instances of isolated REM activity near the end. No clear-cut cardiac ch anges were seen on the plethysmographic recording. Monroe reported having used a different technique for producing the OBE this second time. In general, then, Monroe’s OBEs seem to occur in co njunction with a prolonged, deliberately produced h ypnagogic state (stage 1 EEG). Such prolonged states are not normally seen in the laboratory. The preponderance of theta rhythms and the occasional slowed alpha show an intriguing parallel with EEG states reported for advanced Zen masters during meditation (Kasamatsu, 1966). Modern EEG feedback t echniques have shown that subjects can learn to pro duce increased alpha rhythm, and to slow the frequency o f their alpha rhythm. If I were still actively rese arching this area, I would try training people to produce theta and slow ed alpha rhythms, controlled drowsiness, as it were , and see if this helped them have OBEs. This is the sort of thing th at Monroe worked on developing with his HemiSync© p rocedures at the Monroe Institute, which Monroe often concept ualized as putting the body to sleep while keeping the mind awake. While I have been very intrigued and impressed with some of these results I have not followed them clo sely enough to give a professional analysis of them, but the inter ested reader should see (Atwater & Owens, 1995). Out-of-the-Body Experiences: Sixth Study"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The final OBE study I carried out in 1970 was like the first one in 1957, an attempt to use hypnosis t o produce OBEs, but on a much more sophisticated level. I had done hypnosis research for a more than a decade by this time, especially investigating the use of posthypnotic suggestion to influence the content and process of nocturnal, st age 1REM dreaming. I had a small group of highly selected an d trained participants at UC Davis (see (Tart & Dic k, 1970)for details on selection and training), we might justly call them hypnotic virtuosos, all in the upper 10% of hypnotic susceptibility. Besides being adept at having their nocturnal dreams influenced post-hypnotically, the y had explored deep hypnotic states and were quite comfortable in the lab. I no longer have the records available, having had to throw out a lot of old data on retirement from U C Davis for lack of storage space, so I can only give you the genera l results of the study. Basically, about seven of t he participants had individual hypnotic sessions where they reached ver y deep hypnotic states, confirmed by their self-rep orts of hypnotic depth ((Tart, 1970), (Tart, 1972a), (Tart, 1979)) a nd then received a suggestion that, while the hypno tist remained quiet for 10 minutes so as to not disturb them or keep th em connected to his or her body, their consciousnes s would leave their physical body and cross the hall into a secon d, locked laboratory room where some special target materials were on a table. They were to observe these materials ca refully, then they could wander about out of body a t will for a while, then return and report on their OBE to the experime nter, one of my graduate student assistants. All the participants reported vivid OBEs that seeme d like real experiences to them. They included jour neys to places they knew, like downtown Davis, that were vividly e xperienced, as well as vivid experiences of journey ing to the target room. None of their reports of what they saw on the targe t table bore any clear resemblance to the targets. A formal analysis was not worth the trouble. So an OBE is..... So what is an OBE? Does the mind or soul really lea ve the body and go somewhere else, “out,” or is the OBE just a special ASC that is basically hallucinatory in natu re, i.e. that the feeling and conviction that you a re elsewhere than your physical body’s location is an illusion? After decades of reflection on the results of my ow n and others’ research particularly in the light of my studies on the nature of consciousness and ASCs, I have a more com plex view of OBEs that includes both of these possi bilities at different times and more. I believe that in some OB Es, the mind may, at least partially, really be loc ated elsewhere than the physical body—this may have been the case with Miss Z. At the opposite extreme, as with my virtuos o hypnotic subjects whose experience was vivid and perfectly r eal to them but whose perception of the target room was only illusory, I believe an OBE can be a simulation of being out of the body, and mind is as much “in” the physical body as it ever is. In between these two extremes, I believ e we can have OBEs which are basically a simulation of being out, but which are informed by information gathered by E SP such that the simulation of the OBE location is accurate and veridical. This is a messy situation in some ways, especially because all three of these types of OBEs may seem e xperientially identical to the person having them, at least at ro ugh levels of description. While I would prefer rea lity to fall into simple, clear cut categories, I’ve learned in life that reality doesn’t care about our wishes for simp licity, though, and things are often complex. Simulation of Reality: I want to elaborate on the simulation model of cons ciousness here, as it’s important. We all have a mo del, a theory, about the nature of consciousness and of the world, although it’s usually implicit, we don’t conscious ly know we hold a theory. The theory is that space and time are real and pretty much what they seem to be and things hav e a definite location in time and space, that consciousness is “ in” the head, and that from that spatial position w e directly perceive the outside world through our physical senses. As a working model, this theory works quite well most o f the time: if someone throws a rock toward you, e.g., an automate d part of this model, what’s been called the ecological self (Neisser, 1988), instantly calculates the trajector y of the rock, compares it to its calculated positi on of where you are"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"and makes you duck if the trajectory intersects you r position. In terms of biological survival, it is usually quite useful to psychologically identify with this ecological self and give very high priority to protecting your phys ical body. Indeed it’s very difficult not to automatically identify w ith this ecological self process! Looking at this in more detail, we now know, throug h decades of psychological and neurophysiological r esearch, that this naïve view of perception, that consciousness j ust perceives the external world in a straightforwa rd way, is quite inadequate. Almost all perception is really a kind of rapid, implicit and automated thinking, a set of judgments and analyses about what is happening and its relevance to you. When something moves in the periphery of yo ur visual field, e.g., you will generally actually see a threatening person ducking behind a tree, rather than experience an ambiguous movement in the unfocused part of your vi sual field, leading to a thought of “What might it be?”, leading to searches of memory for possible candidates that sho w some fit to the ambiguous perceptual data availab le, leading to a conclusion that a threatening person ducking behind a tree has a 45% chance of fitting the perceptual data while, e.g., a branch blowing in the wind has only a 30% chance of fitting, etc., so that it would probably be best t o get ready for action. If it really was a threatening figure, the person who sees it that way instantly has a better chance of survival by reacting faster than the one who goes through a lon g sequential analysis process. It’s as if there’s a distinct evolutionary advantage for the organism that has instant readine ss to fight or flee even at the price of some false alarms, compared to the organism that takes too long to get ready to fl ee or fight. To jump to the end point of my and others’ research es, it is useful to see our ordinary consciousness as a process that creates an ongoing, dynamic simulation of reality, a world model, an inner theater of the mind, a biopsychological virtual reality (BPVR)((Tart, 1991), (Tart, 1993)), “in” which con sciousness dwells. The most obvious example of this process is the nocturnal dream. There we live in a complete world, set in dimensions of space and time , with actors, plots and an environment. Indeed, most of the brain mechanisms which construct that dream world are pr obably by and large the same mechanisms that construct our waking world with the very important difference that in the waking state this world simulation process must constantly deal with sensory input in a way that protects us and fu rthers our ends. Thus I’ve defined the reality we ordinarily live in as consensus reality (Tart, 1973), to remind us that even though we implicitly think we simply perceive reality as it i s, it is actually a complex construction, strongly determined by the social consensus of our particular society about wh at’s important and our own psychodynamics and condi tioning. Applying this perspective back to the study of OBEs and NDEs, we should first realize that the ordinar y feeling that we are “in” our bodies (usually our heads), is a const ruction, a world simulation, that happens to be the optimal way to ensure survival most of the time, but that it is no t necessarily true in any ultimate sense. I don’t k now what ultimate reality is, but it is helpful to remember that, jus t as a person using a high quality computer-generat ed virtual reality simulator forgets where their physical body actuall y is and becomes experientially located “in” the co mputer-generated world, it might be that our “souls” are actually lo cated on Mars, but we are so immersed in the BPVR o ur brains generate [7] that we think we are here in our bodies. This is a crazy idea, but helps to remind us that the experi ence of where we are is not a simple matter of just perceiv ing reality as it is. A Scientific Model of Mind that Opens to Noetic Kno wledge: Those of you have had OBEs and NDEs know, on some v ery deep level, that mind or soul is something more than your physical body. The automatic psychological identifi cation of who you are with the physical body, with the simulation constructed by the ecological self, is a very usefu l working tool, but not the final answer. As we dis cussed at the beginning, though, integrating this experiential kn owledge with your everyday self in the everyday wor ld is not always easy, especially when the so dominant climate of sc ientism constantly tells you that your deeper knowl edge is wrong and that you are crazy to take it seriously. My small contribution toward integration is the mes sage that, using the best of scientific method rath er than scientism, looking factually at all of the data rather than just what fits into a phil osophy of physicalism, the facts of reality require a model or theory of who we are and what reality is that takes OBEs and NDEs and noetic knowledge seri ously. You are not deluded or crazy to try to integrate your N DE knowledge with the rest of your life. You are en gaged in a real and important process!"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"I can schematize my best scientific and personal un derstanding of our nature at this point with a diagram I’ve used in an other paper (Tart, 1993). Being a product of my culture, at the top of the fi gure I’ve put the transpersonal or spiritual realm, and I’ve shown it as unbounded in extent. Those of you who’ve had OBEs, NDEs or other transpe rsonal experiences know of what realm of experience I speak here, even if ordinary words can’t grasp it too well. A part of that transperson al realm, designated as mind in Figure 1, is in intimate relation with our particular body, brain and nervous system. As I mentioned briefly above, a lthough this mind is of a different nature from ordinary matter, psi phe nomena like clairvoyance and PK are the means which link the tr anspersonal and the physical, i.e., our mind has an intimate and ongoin g relationship with our body, brain and nervous system through what I’ve te rmed autoclairvoyance, where mind reads the physical state of the brain, and autoPK , where mind uses psychokinesis to affect the opera tion of the physical brain. The result of this interaction is the creation of a BPVR, what I’ve labeled ME! in the figure, to stand for Mind Embodied, with th e boldness of the type and the exclamation point added to remind us t hat our identification with and attachment to ME! is intense! This ME! is a simulation of our ultimate, transpersonal nat ure, our physical nature, and the external physical world around us. We ordinarily live inside this simulation and t ake it for the direct perception of reality and our selves, but those of you who’ve been “out” know, as we’ve discussed abov e, that our ordinary self is indeed just a limited point of view, not the whole of reality. There is an immense amount of research needed to fi ll in the details of this general outline, but I th ink this conveys a useful general picture. Summing Up: Here are some of the key points of this wider, high er fidelity model. (1) There is no doubt that the physics and chemistr y of body, brain and nervous system are important i n affecting our experience. Further research on these areas is vita lly important, especially if it is done without the traditional scientistic arrogance that physical findings in, e.g., neurolog y, automatically “explain away” psychological and e xperiential data. (2) The findings of scientific parapsychology force us to pragmatically accept that mind can do things — information gathering processes like telepathy, clairvoyance an d precognition and directly affecting the physical world with PK — that cannot be reduced to physical explanations wit h current scientific knowledge or reasonable extens ions of it. So it is vitally important to investigate what mind can do in terms of mind, not wait for them to be explained (away) someday in terms of brain functioning — a form of faith tha t philosophers have aptly called promissory materialism , since it cannot be scientifically refuted. You can never pro ve that someday everything will not be explained in terms of a greatly advanced physics — or a greatly advanced kn owledge of angels or dowsing or stock market moveme nts or whatever. Recall that if there is no way of dis proving an idea or theory, you may like it or disli ke it, believe it or disbelieve it, but it’s not a scientific theory. (3) The kind of research on the nature of mind call ed for above is vitally important because most forms of scientism have a psychopathological effect on people by denyi ng and invalidating transpersonal experiences that they have. This produces not just unnecessary individual suffering but also attitudes of isolation and cynicism that w orsen the state of the world. See my Western Creed exercise for an ela boration of this point (Tart, 1989). (4) Two of the most important kinds of transpersona l experiences people can have are OBEs and NDEs. Th ey have major effects on experiencers’ attitudes toward lif e. Both seem to constitute a revelation of a more u ltimate or higher"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"understanding of who we really are. While this is i mportant, it is also important to extensively inves tigate these phenomena as they themselves may be, at least parti ally, simulations of even higher order truths. The genuine scientific approach to them, then, is to take them seriously i ndeed but, with humility and dedication: (a) try to get clearer data on their exact nature; (b) develop theories and unders tandings of them (both in our ordinary state and in appropriate ASCs, along the lines of state-specific sciences that I h ave proposed elsewhere ((Tart, 1972b))); (c ) predi ct and test consequences of these theories; and (d) honestly an d fully communicate all parts of this process of in vestigation, theorizing and prediction. Genuine and open scientific inquiry has a lot to co ntribute to our understanding of our nature. Charles T.
