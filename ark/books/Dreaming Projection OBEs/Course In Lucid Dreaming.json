The purpose of the course is to train you in the skills required for having frequent lucid dreams. It is appropriate for people who have not yet had lucid dreams, and for those who want to have them more often. The exercises are based on the results of the research efforts of Dr. Stephen LaBerge's group at Stanford University and Paul Tholey of Germany, with supplementary materials drawn from Eastern traditions such as Tibetan Dream Yoga. The textbook is Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen LaBerge and Howard Rheingold. Each unit will assign sections to read from the book, but you are welcome to read ahead if you like. Many of the exercises in the course are also presented in the book; however, you should follow the instructions given in the course materials, as they will be somewhat different. Please note that the page numbers given are for the paperback version, if you have a hardback the pages follow in brackets: [ ]. Each unit will include a reading assignment, exercises to prepare you for practicing lucid dream induction techniques, or practices for within lucid dreams, and a self-corrected quiz to ensure that you get the main points in the reading. Many of the exercises and techniques will be accompanied by a table or form for recording your progress. This will help you focus on the exercise and give you feedback on the results of your efforts. Feedback is essential for the development of any skill. Good records of your progress will tell you when you are working effectively and when you need to change your approach, and will give you encouragement to persevere.

It will engage you in empowered interaction with your dream life, opening up new vistas of adventure and discovery. Dedication and perseverance will be the keys to achieving your goals in the world of dreams. The five units of the course follow a sequence that develops your skills progressively. For that reason, you will achieve the best results by completing the exercises in the order they are presented. If you are using a DreamLight or NovaDreamer... Although a student of lucid dreaming can complete A Course in Lucid Dreaming in its entirety without employing a DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® Lucid Dream Induction Device, the course includes instruction in using both of these devices to learn lucid dreaming. We developed these tools to provide valuable assistance for developing lucid dreaming ability. They are especially effective when used in conjunction with a structured program for preparing the skills required for having lucid dreams. This course is designed to provide the structure and focused study necessary for achieving success with lucid dreaming. Throughout the course, special reading assignments and exercises integrate the DreamLight or NovaDreamer into your lucid dreaming study. These sections are denoted by special symbols: ## for the DreamLight® device; ••\"•> for the NovaDreamer® device; and #\"•• for either device. Watch for the symbols and note that many of these instructions add specific steps to the exercises given, allowing you to use your device to get more out of the exercises. In turn, the exercises will help you to get greater effectiveness from your device. If you are not using a DreamLight or NovaDreamer... The symbols **, *•\"•-, and *••- denote exercises or additions to exercises for people who are using a DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® Lucid Dream Induction Device with the course. It is not essential to use one of these devices with the course, but they can be valuable assistants for developing lucid dreaming ability. If you are not using a device, skip the parts marked with the special symbols. If you are interested in acquiring a DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® device, contact the Lucidity Institute. Time to course completion The first four units each take a minimum of three weeks to complete. The length of time required to finish Unit 5 will depend on the frequency of your lucid dreams. Therefore, four months is the shortest amount of time in which it is possible to complete this course. Please feel free to take as long as you need to get the most out of each exercise. Even if it takes you a year to finish, your accomplishments in lucid dreaming are likely to be greater for the extra time you have given to it. About the Quizzes The quizzes are self-tests to help you evaluate your comprehension of the points covered in the reading. To benefit most from this course, it is important for you to have a good basic understanding of the concepts behind the exercises and techniques. When taking a quiz, first, answer as many questions on the quiz as you can without referring to the book. Second, refer to the book to answer the remaining questions. The correct answers and page number references in the reading are given in Appendix A. Study each question, especially the ones that you have some difficulty answering, until you are satisfied that you understand the correct answers.

The more dreams you recall, the more fruit your lucid dreaming efforts will bear. Awareness of the nature of your dreams is also essential for lucid dreaming, because it gives you the ability to distinguish waking from dreaming reality. The last set of exercises in Unit 1 prepares you for performing mental concentration tasks in later units by giving you practice in attaining a relaxed and focused state of mind. Unit 2 begins your lucid dreaming skill development. First you will set goals for dream recall and lucid dreaming frequency and begin a chart to provide you with visual feedback on your progress. You will learn the basic Reflection-Intention technique of lucid dream induction, which can be used in conjunction with many other methods of stimulating lucidity. Preparatory exercises will get you ready for the highly effective MILD technique presented in Unit 3. Unit 3 focuses on training in the technique of Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD), which, if practiced with sufficient concentration, can make lucid dreaming accessible at will. Included is \"I Remember,\" a challenging game to play with your friends that not only illustrates how difficult it is for us humans to remember our intentions, but also teaches us the amount of attention we need to give to our remembering our tasks to succeed. Following this intensive memory training is the Autosuggestion Technique, a low-key, pressure-free method to use when you are feeling low on powers of mental concentration. The unit ends with concentration and visualization exercises to prepare you for the wake-induction of lucid dreaming techniques in Unit 4. Unit 4 teaches how to bring your waking consciousness with you into the dream world. It does this in the context of nap-taking, which is in itself a very powerful method of increasing the ease of lucid dreaming. Wake-initiation methods can produce fascinating and intense experiences on the border between waking and dreaming. Some names commonly given to these experiences are \"out- of-body experiences,\" \"incubus attacks,\" and \"sleep paralysis.\" All are harmless gate-keepers of the world of lucid dreaming. Unit 5 is a \"Traveler's Guide to the Dream World.\" Units 1 through 4 develop your ability to enter the realm of lucid dreaming. Once there, specific techniques can help you get the most out of your visit. For example, you learn how to prolong your stay, keep your lucidity, and wake at will. Furthermore, a section of \"Things to Do and See\" provides guidance in choosing activities for your early lucid dreams to show you the delights and freedoms of the state. In conclusion, the course provides practice in changing the direction of your dreams, which will help you develop your ability to profit from the vast potential lying dormant in your dream life.

See Step 1 of the Instructions below. Introduction Dream recall is essential for lucid dreaming. As you have read in your book, the first step to learning lucid dreaming is to inaease your dream recall. Before you proceed with Unit 2, which will introduce lucid dream induction techniques, you must be able to recall at least one dream per night. Your long-term goal, to achieve the optimal results with lucid dreaming training, is to recall two or more dreams per night. Pages 35-40 [30-33] of Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming describe various methods for improving dream recall. This exercise presents those methods in a structured format to help you organize your efforts and discover which methods are most helpful to you. The two parts of this exercise are to be completed at the same time. Instructions Part 1: Keeping a Dream Journal Your dream journal will be your most helpful tool for improving your dream recall. It will give you clear feedback on your progress, ensure that you don't forget the dreams you have remembered, and will be required in later exercises. Below is a list of steps for starting a dream journal. If you already keep one, check this list to make sure you are following all the steps. You may wish to start a fresh journal for the purpose of this course, to mark for yourself your determination to succeed at lucid dreaming. 1. Acquire a blank book or notebook that you find appealing (The Lucidity Institute's Oneironautical Log is ideal), and that you can keep ready at hand by your bedside. Use this book only for recording your dreams. 2. Set up a bedside station for your dream journal. This should include the journal, a good pen, a light, and a clock (preferably digital, for later purposes). If you don't want to disturb your bed-partner in the night by turning on a lamp, you can use a flashlight, or an illuminated pen, or a personal reading lamp that clamps onto books. You should be able to reach your journal and writing equipment easily without getting out of bed. 3. Each night before sleep write in your journal the date and the time you lie down to go to sleep. This will help set your mind for recording your dreams. 4. Whenever you awaken and recall a dream (or fragment), write down the time and take notes on the dream in your journal. You don't need to disrupt your sleep by writing out the full details in the middle of the night, but be sure to note key events and feelings, and any verbatim speech or text from the dream. No matter how little you remember, write it down. 5. In the morning, when you are done sleeping, use your night's notes to write out the dreams in full detail. Title each dream with a short name that expresses the essence of it (examples: Guardian of the Spring, The Wolfman). Record everything you can remember about each dream, including your reactions to events. When pictures would help you recall or convey the dream images, illustrate them in your journal. 6. Continue your dream journal throughout the Course. Once you have recorded at least 10 dreams, you can begin Exercise 2 of this unit. The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 1-2"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"A COURSE IN LUCID DREAMING UNIT! Part 2: Dream Recall Aids & Dream Recall Progress Logs Below is a menu of activities that will help you to increase your dream recall. Try them all; do each one at least twice. Then you can decide which ones are the most useful for you, and narrow your efforts to those. Use the Dream Recall Progress Logs to record your results every night while you are working on your dream recall. The Logs ask you to check the boxes for the Dream Recall Aids you use each night, and to record the number of dreams and, if you have any, lucid dreams you remember from the night. For this purpose, even a tiny fragment of a dream recalled counts as one dream. Continue to work on your dream recall and to record your progress on Logs until you have collected at least one dream a night for seven nights in a row. If you need more Logs, make photocopies of the form. Make it your goal eventually to recall at least two per night. Dream Recall Aids 1. Extra sleep: Sleeping an extra hour or two in the morning can help you remember your dreams in two ways. First, when you are more rested you will be better able to focus your mind on remembering your dreams. Second, we have more REM sleep in the last third of our sleeping periods. It is more effective for increasing dream recall to sleep later in the morning than to go to bed earlier at night. This is a highly effective method, and you should try it even if you can only practice it on weekends. 2. Setting intention: In all kinds of learning, the intention to learn and improve is an important ingredient. If you have poor dream recall, you are probably in the habit of going to sleep just to sleep and to forget everything else. It will take a deliberate decision to overcome that habit. Before bed, write this phrase in your dream journal: \"I will remember my dreams.\" Tell yourself, \"I will have interesting and meaningful dreams.\" 3. Reminder: Place something by your bed in plain view to help you remember your intention to recall your dreams. It can be anything from a sign saying, \"Remember Dreams!\" to a symbolic object as long as it is a clear cue to you to think about dreams. 4. Asking the question: The moment you awaken at any time in the night or morning, ask yourself, \"What was I dreaming?\" Don't move and don't think about anything else. Focus on answering this question for several minutes, until you come up with something. If at first you don't succeed, ask yourself, \"What was I just thinking or feeling?\" Take any fragment you recall and think about what happened before that. This process should lead you back through the dream. If you still have no luck, guess what you might have been dreaming about, such as current concerns or topics of interest, and see if any of these thoughts triggers any recall. Whatever you come up with, write it down in your journal. 5. Alarm clock: If you sleep very deeply and have difficulty awakening in the night to recall dreams, try setting an alarm to awaken you at times when you are likely to be dreaming. REM periods occur about every 90 minutes throughout the night, and are longer towards the morning, so, good times to set an alarm for are 4.5, 6 and 7.5 hours after you go to sleep. ** The DreamLight DreamAlarm™ The DreamLight's DreamAlarm™ feature (see pp. 19 & 80 of the DreamLight® Operation Manual) can awaken you while you are likely to be in the middle of a dream. The DreamLight waits until three minutes after it has decided you are dreaming (the time when it would give a lucid dream inducing cue if the cues were turned on), and then emits a series of tones through the speaker in the mask. The tones may be set to \"soft\" or \"loud.\" The loud setting generally seems to be the most effective one, perhaps because people who remember few dreams tend to be relatively deep sleepers. However, your bed partner may insist that you use the soft setting! The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 1-3"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"A COURSE IN LUCID DREAMING UNIT1 ** Using the DreamAlarm as a Dream Recall Aid 1. Set the DreamLight as follows: Flash Type Mode: FLASHES OFF; Sound Mode: SOUND VOLUME 0; DreamAlarm Mode: DREAM ALARM LOUD. (Try loud first. If you find it too disruptive after sleeping with it, then try soft.) 2 Follow all the instructions given for Parts 1 & 2 of Exercise 1: Dream Recall. On your Progress Log, use the \"DreamAlarm\" box to indicate when you use this feature of the DreamLight. 0-0- The NovaDreamerDreamAlarm™ The NovaDreamer's DreamAlarm feature, when turned on (see the NovaDreamer® Operation Manual, p. 7, p. 9, #12, and p. 17), awakens you after at least five minutes of dreaming sleep. 4-4- Using the DreamAlarm as a Dream Recall Aid You might wish to use the NovaDreamer as a DreamAlarm alone, to develop your dream recall before you work to recognize cues and become lucid in your dreams. Do so as follows: 1. Set the NovaDreamer Cue Type to Type 0: No flashes or beeps. 2. When you enter a Sleep Mode to go to sleep, press the button and hold it down for four seconds until the sample DreamAlarm is triggered. The DreamAlarm is now activated, and will turn on five minutes after each cue the NovaDreamer gives. To interrupt the alarm after it awakens you, press the button briefly (like a Reality Test). To deactivate the DreamAlarm, hold the button down for one or two seconds. 3. Follow all the instructions given for Parts 1 & 2 of Exercise 1: Dream Recall. On your Progress Log, note that you have used the DreamAlarm in the column labeled \"Dream recall aids used.\" Dream Recall Progress Log Directions: While working on Exercise 1: Dream Recall, fill in one line of this Log every night. Enter the date (of the day before your sleep). Just before you turn out the light to start sleep, write in the bedtime. Then, set your intention to notice each time you awaken during the night. When you find yourself awake, ask yourself if you remember any dreams. Then, make a mark on the timeline for the night indicating the amount of time (to the nearest 20 min) that has passed since bedtime. Use an \"X\" to mark an awakening with no dream recall, and a \"D\" to mark one when you remember just dreaming. At the end of the night, be sure to mark an \"X\" or \"D\" on the timeline to indicate the end of your sleep time. Add up the number of \"D\"s for each night and enter the total in the column labeled \"DT.\" Also record which dream recall aids you used before or during the night (extra sleep, setting intention, a reminder by the bed, asking the question, alarm clock, or DreamAlarm). Continue the log until you recall at least one dream per night for seven nights in a row. When you really need to sleep undisturbed, it is fine to skip a night. It is far better that you give this exercise proper attention when you do it, than to do it haphazardly because you are too worn out to do it right.

After finishing it, you will find it easier to recognize a dream when you see one. Dreamsigns are objects or events that are impossible or improbable in waking reality. In a NightLight experiment studying the role of dreamsigns in the initiation of lucidity, we found that people were more likely to reach lucidity in a dream if they showed a high awareness of the strangeness of dreamsigns. Therefore, the goal of this exercise is to increase your awareness of odd events in dreams. On pages 40-47 [33-39], Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming explains how dreamsigns can be helpful for attaining lucidity, and presents the Dreamsign Inventory. Read all the instructions before beginning. Instructions 1. Get out your dream journal, which now includes at least 10 dreams. 2. Read your last 10 dreams, and mark each dreamsign (underline or circle the phrase so you can easily spot it on the page). Remember, a dreamsign is any anomalous event, object, circumstance, feeling or thought. See Figure 1 for an example of a marked dream report. 3. On the chart labeled Dreamsign List, list all of the dreamsigns you have marked, with the date of the dream. 4. Classify each dreamsign on your list, using the four categories Inner Awareness, Action, Form, and Context. Refer to the Dreamsign Inventory on pages 43-46 [36-38] of Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming for descriptions and examples of each category. Figure 1 on the next page also shows a sample of a list of dreamsigns with their assigned dreamsign categories. Check the appropriate category for each dreamsign on your Dreamsign List. 5. Now you will begin to work on developing your awareness of specific types of oddities in dreams. Select two of the subcategories of dreamsigns displayed in the table on the next page to be your target dreamsigns. Research has shown that these subcategories are frequently associated with lucidity. See the Dreamsign Inventory for examples of each of these. Indicate your targets by checking their boxes on the Target Dreamsigns chart. 6. Now look for your target dreamsigns in each night's dreams. For one week, or the length of time it takes you to record 10 more dreams (whichever is longer), collect all the examples of your two selected target dreamsigns that occur in your dreams. List them, with the date they occur, on the Target Dreamsigns form. Then rate your awareness of the strangeness of each dreamsign using the Dreamsign Awareness Scale provided on the chart. Do this right after you record your dreams each day, so that your memory of the dreams is as fresh as possible. As you work on this step, also continue with Step 7. 7. You spend more time awake than you do dreaming, so the best way to practice looking for dreamsigns is to also do it while you are awake. Carry a notebook or paper with you during your waking hours and write down any oddities you notice that fit the criteria for one of your target dreamsigns. For instance, some \"waking life dreamsigns\" you might come across could be your boss wearing a funny new hat, your doctor's office having been redecorated, your computer behaving strangely, or you going to a dance club with a friend if your usual style is dinner and a movie. List these anomalies on the form titled Waking Life Dreamsigns, along with their dates of occurrence. The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 1-6"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"A COURSE IN LUCID DREAMING UNIT1 This can be a challenging exercise! We are not generally used to critically analyzing our environments, and we are not much better at it when we are awake than we are when we are dreaming. Remember, though, that you have to begin testing your reality in the waking world if you want to establish a practice of doing so in your dreams. Continue with this step until you have completed Step 6 (one week or until you've recorded 10 dreams and analyzed them for dreamsigns, whichever is longer). *^ Lights: Waking Life Dreamsigns to Prepare You for DreamLight and NovaDreamer Cues In addition to the Waking Life Dreamsigns you collect in Step 7 of this exercise, you can prepare to recognize the light cues from the DreamLight or NovaDreamer in dreams by looking for lights as dreamsigns while you are awake. 1. Begin by doing Step 1 of the \"Looking for Lights\" exercise on pages 13-14 of the DreamLight® Operation Manual, or page 15 of the NovaDreamer Operation Manual. The exercise has you list sources of lights in your current environment. 2. While keeping your regular Waking Life Dreamsigns List, as in Step 7 of Exercise 2: Dreamsign Awareness, also collect sources of light. For you records, check the box labeled \"Lights\" at the top of the Waking Life Dreamsigns form on page 1-12 (in addition to your other two chosen dreamsign categories). #\"•• Mechanical Malfunctions: Dream Devices Don't Work! Notoriously, yet fortunately for hopeful lucid dreamers, mechanical things tend to behave very badly in dreams. For DreamLight and NovaDreamer users, this often manifests as a malfunctioning or mutated lucid dream induction device. This characteristic of dreams is specifically exploited by the Reality Test button on both the DreamLight and NovaDreamer. When the button doesn't work, you know you are probably dreaming. To prepare for noticing dream machine behavior, start by attending to the behavior of the machines in your waking life. For the Waking Life Dreamsigns List, in addition to your two chosen dreamsign targets and lights, also record any instances of mechanical malfunction. Some examples could be: broken devices, anything that doesn't do what you expect when you operate it (as computers so often do), things with dead batteries, or even traffic lights that take \"too long\" to change. DREAMSIGN TARGETS Awareness — You, the dreamer, have an odd thought, a strong emotion, feel an unusual sensation, or have altered perceptions. The thought can be one that is peculiar, that could only occur in a dream, or that \"magically\" affects the dream world. The emotion can be inappropriate or oddly overwhelming. Sensations can include the feeling of paralysis, or of leaving your body, as well as unusual physical feelings, and sexual arousal. Perceptions may be unusually clear or fuzzy, or something impossible to perceive in ordinary life. Action — You, a dream character, or a dream thing (including inanimate objects and animals) does something unusual or impossible in waking life. Malfunctioning devices are common examples of this category. Form — Your shape, the shape of a dream character, or of a dream object is oddly formed, deformed, or transforms in an unlikely or impossible manner. Also the place you are in the dream (the setting) may have different features than it would in waking life. Context — The place or situation you are in in the dream is strange. You may be somewhere that you are unlikely to be in waking life, or involved in a strange social situation. Also, you or another dream character could be playing a role different from in waking life. Objects or characters may be out of place, or the dream could occur at some other time—in the past or future.

If you want to learn lucid dreaming, does this mean that you want to be able to have a ludd dream every night, anytime you want, or is just one enough? You need to know what you are aiming for to properly direct your efforts. Having goals also helps you to evaluate your progress. If you are not reaching your goals, you know you need to change your approach, work harder, or set more realistic goals. On the other hand, if you are meeting them, you feel the satisfaction of accomplishment. Goals should be flexible, and subject to periodic revaluation. If, for example, you set yourself a goal of recalling 20 dreams in a month, and you have recalled 50 in the first month you try, you should set yourself a new, more challenging goal, say, 75 dreams per month. If you fall far short of your goal and you have been working hard to achieve it, you probably should lower the goal. The Lucid Dreaming Progress Chart will help you to set your goals for dream recall and ludd dreaming frequency and to evaluate your progress. It is the same kind of visual aid that Dr. LaBerge used to chart his ludd dreaming development as he learned to have ludd dreams at will. The chart spans one year, in one-month intervals. Each day you record the number of dreams and lucid dreams you recalled during the night. Every month you strive to remember more dreams and have more ludd dreams than you did in the previous month. That is your short-term goal. You will also establish a long-term goal: how frequently you would like to be able to recall dreams and have lucid dreams. The instructions below will guide you in the use of the chart. Instructions 1. Establish your long-term goals for dream recall and lucid dream frequency. Ask yourself how often you would like to be able to recall dreams and have lucid dreams. Phrase your goal in terms of dreams and ludd dreams per month. For instance, the answer may be \"every night,\" or \"once a week.\" Write your long-term goals in the spaces on the Lucid Dreaming Progress Chart. Use a pendl, so that you can change the goal if you later decide it is too low or too high. 2. Record your progress. Every month, mark the chart with an open drcle (O) for the number of dreams you had in the previous month and a closed drcle (•) for the number of lucid dreams. Ludd dreams count as dreams, too, so include them in the total when you mark the number of dreams. See the example on the next page. 3. Evaluate each month. After marking your results for the previous month, note your short term goal for the next month: to remember more dreams and have more lucid dreams than you did last month. Look at the chart frequently to motivate you. 4. Keep working towards your long-term goals. It can be helpful to note what you were doing differently in months you do exceptionally well or poorly. For example, your lucid dream frequency may leap up when you are on vacation, or when you use the DreamLight®. Or, it may fall during a busy period, or if you get sick. If after a month or more your long-term goals seem too low (you've already exceeded them), or too high (you can't imagine achieving them) change them. The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 2-2"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"A COURSE IN LUCID DREAMING UNIT 2 5. After you reach your goals, move on. When you achieve your long-term goals for dream recall or lucid dream frequency, move on to set yourself other goals. For example, if you have a goal of recalling 100 dreams per month, and you achieve this after 8 months of charting your progress, you can stop recording dream recall and use your energy towards another goal, perhaps to remember more details of your dreams, or to be a more active participant in them. Devise your own visual aids for recording your progress towards your new goals.

Introduction This exercise will focus on the Reflection-Intention Technique, which Dr. LaBerge has adapted from an exercise originally developed by German researcher Paul Tholey. The technique helps you to establish a habit while you are in the waking state of questioning your state of consciousness (awake or dreaming?) and strengthening your resolve to notice when you are dreaming. Once you have created the habit, it carries over into the dream state, so that you habitually ask yourself if you are dreaming at predetermined times or when strange events occur. To help you apply your best effort to the technique, we are providing you with a Reality Probe (the enclosed business card saying, \"Is this a dream?\", which you should take with you wherever you go), and the steps below, which guide you through the technique. Instructions 1. Examine the Reality Probe. Get out the card saying, \"Is this a dream?\" Scrutinize it, checking to see that it has all the right letters in all the right places. Notice the style of the letters, how big they are, how much space they take up, and so on. Now turn it over and look at the blank side. Turn it back again and once more scrutinize the printing. Does it look just the way you remembered it? Chances are it does, because you are not dreaming right now. However, if you were dreaming, chances are the card would transform. The changes would probably be glaringly obvious (Creamed Spinach?), but the more familiar you are with the Reality Probe, the better prepared you will be to notice when it is not quite right. 2. Pick times for practicing. Choose 8 separate occasions to perform the Reflection-Intention exercise during the day tomorrow. These should be events that you know will occur and that are spaced fairly evenly throughout the day. Write your choices on the enclosed form, titled Reflection-Intention Record. See the sample day from the Record Sheet on page 2-8 of these instructions. There are 10 lines for entering events. Leave the last 2 blank for writing in unexpected events (see Step 4). Some possible times are: • While you are dressing in the morning • When you first enter your workplace in the morning • At the breakfast table (or lunch table or dinner table) • Before starting your car • When you arrive home in the evening • While you are at the shopping center or grocery store • When you step outside in the morning (or after work in the evening) • As you get ready for bed The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 2-5"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"A COURSE IN LUCID DREAMING UNIT 2 *• DreamLight and NovaDreamer users: for three of the eight occasions you choose for performing the Reflection-Intention exercise, include some kind of light. For example: • When you turn on the light in the (kitchen, kid's bedroom, office, and so on...) • When you see a red stoplight • When you walk out into the sunshine • When you turn on your computer monitor • When you see a car with its headlights on 3. In the morning, consult your list. The next morning, reread your list to remind yourself of when to do the exercise. Carry the sheet with you throughout the day, so you can record your efforts. 4. Practice the Reflection-Intention Technique. When each of your chosen occasions arrives, do the following steps. Also do the technique when unusual and unexpected events happen in your day. In the latter case, enter the event on your Record Sheet, using the lines you left blank in Step 2. If you need more spaces, use an extra piece of paper. #• DreamLight and NovaDreamer users: Note that you can use unusual or unexpected sources of light as cues to spontaneously practice the Reflection-Intention Technique. A. Test your state. Get out the Reality Probe. Closely examine the printed side, then turn it over to the blank side and back. Make sure that it makes sense and is consistent. If you are unable to get to your Reality Probe, look for another way to test your state. Written materials are best — look at them twice to ascertain that they are sensible and stable. Inspect your environment and ask yourself if everything around you is normal and realistic. Is anything out of place? Do you remember how you got here? If the Reality Probe (or other text) changes, or your environment doesn't make sense and you don't know how you got there, chances are very high that YOU ARE DREAMING. Now you may take a step into the air... B. Imagine yourself dreaming. If you are certain that you're awake, tell yourself, \"OK, I'm not dreaming, now. But, if I were, what would it be like?\" Imagine as vividly as possible that you are dreaming. Intently imagine that what you are perceiving (hearing, feeling, smelling or seeing) around you is a dream: the people, trees, sunshine, sky and earth, and you, yourself — all a dream. Observe your environment carefully for your target dreamsigns from Unit 1. Imagine what it would be like if a dreamsign from your target category were present. As soon as you are able to vividly experience yourself as if in a dream, tell yourself, \"The next time I'm dreaming, I will remember to recognize that I'm dreaming.\" C. Imagine doing what you intend to do in your lucid dream. Decide in advance what you would like to do in your next lucid dream. You may wish to fly, or talk to dream characters or try one of the applications suggested in Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming. Now, continue the fantasy begun in Step B, and imagine that after having become lucid in your present environment, you now fulfill your wish, and experience what it would be like to do what you have chosen. Firmly resolve that you will remember to recognize that you are dreaming and to do what you intend in your next lucid dream.

When you have finished Step 4, write down on your Reflection- Intention Record the time at which you finish doing the exercise at the appointed occasion. See the sample. 6. When day is done, count your exercises. When day is done, add up the number of Reflection- Intention exercises you did and enter this number in the appropriate blank on the Record Sheet. Refer to the sample. 7. Make up exercise times for tomorrow. If you haven't finished 6 days on this exercise, come up with 8 occasions at which to practice Reflection-Intention tomorrow, as in Step 2. You can make up new ones or keep the old, based on your judgment of which ones were most interesting or possible to complete. 8. In the morning, record your number of dreams and lucid dreams. The morning after each day of the exercise, enter on the Record Sheet how many dreams and lucid dreams you recall from the night before. Refer to the sample. ** Reality Tests with the Dream Light's Mask Button As you have read by now in the Manual, the DreamLight is equipped with a built-in Reality Testing Aid — the mask button. The procedure for using it is very simple. Whenever you are wearing the DreamLight and believe you are awake (or suspect that you may be dreaming), press the button under the star on the front of the mask (the same button that starts the Delay). If you are awake (and the DreamLight is functioning correctly), pressing the button will cause the mask lights to flash once, and the speaker to give a small chirp. As a general rule, mechanical devices in dreams do not work according to our expectations. Thus, if you are dreaming, chances are that when in the dream you press the dream version of the mask button, nothing will happen (no flash, no chirp) or you will not get both a flash and a chirp. If this failure of function occurs, remove the mask and do the complete Reality Test as in Step A of the Reflection-Intention exercise. The mask button gives you a way of easily initiating a reality test without removing the DreamLight mask. Use it often! (Remember that each press of the mask button adds 10 minutes to the delay—see pp. 22-23 of the DreamLight® Operation Manual.) •• Reality Tests with the NovaDreamer's Mask Button The Reality Test button on the NovaDreamer is a very important key to the world of lucid dreaming. Every time you wake up, or think you are awake, and are wearing the NovaDreamer, press the button briefly (less than 1 second). If you really are awake, the lights will flash once, and you will hear a beep from the speaker. If you are dreaming, it is likely that nothing will happen — no flash, no beep. Anything could happen instead. If you see no flash and/or hear no beep, or something else happens when you press the button, remove the NovaDreamer and do a complete Reality Test as in Step A of the Reflection-Intention technique on page 2-6 of the Course. Remember to do this every time you think you have awakened. (Note: Each button press delays cueing for 10 minutes. If you press the button several times and set a longer delay than you want, then press the button and hold it down for one second to reset the delay to zero. See the NovaDreamer® Operation Manual for more about the delay.)

However, as you have read, to succeed with MILD you need to be adept at remembering to do things you have planned (prospective memory). This memory development exercise will prepare you for practicing MILD in Unit 3. Most of the time we have little difficulty remembering to do things. Either the task is a well- ingrained habit (when was the last time you forgot to dress in the morning?) or the future event requires enough planning and preparation that it becomes the primary focus of your attention (you don't forget to attend your wedding). Prospective memory becomes difficult when the planned action is new to us, and we are not stimulated to remember it by frequent, salient cues. Thus, unless you do it every day, it is hard to remember to stop by the store for some milk on the way home. This is where the written memo comes in handy. Unfortunately, we can't take written memos into dreams. That is why it is so challenging to remember to carry out our intention to recognize when we are dreaming. Even if we make a fuss and bother about preparations for lucid dreaming while we are awake—dream journals, special icons to remind us of our purpose, and so on—in the dream we are in another world, out of contact with all our cue objects. One way around this difficulty is to make a habit of questioning our state. This is the purpose of the Reflection-Intention Technique. Another method is to develop our facility with prospective memory so that we don't need to rely on external cues to remember to notice when we are dreaming. A third method is using the DreamLight or NovaDreamer—a means for bringing that \"memo,\" in the form of a flashing light cue, into the dream. Even so, prospective memory enhancement can help you to improve your ability to remember to notice the DreamLight or NovaDreamer cue and to perform Reality Tests when cued. The MILD technique depends on prospective memory. Memory in general seems to be somewhat less functional in the dream state than in waking. Therefore, we should develop our waking memories as much as possible before we attempt MILD. The following exercise will help you improve your ability to remember to do things by mental effort alone. Instructions 1. Memorize targets. The table on the next page titled Prospective Memory Targets shows 7 days of targets. When you get up in the morning, before doing anything else, read the targets for the day. Memorize them, and put the sheet where you won't see it during the day. #• Each day's target list includes one aimed at preparing you for DreamLight or NovaDreamer cues. Seek this target as well as the other four. 2. Watch for targets and do state tests. Throughout the entire day, watch for your targets. Your goal is to notice the soonest occurrence of each event. When you notice one, perform a state test, as in Step 4 of the Reflection-Intention exercise. You are aiming to observe each target one time — the first time it occurs. 3. Record hits and misses. Keep track of your success on the enclosed Prospective Memory Record. At the end of the day, or after you have found all your targets, record the ones you got (hits) and the ones you didn't get (misses), by checking the \"Hit\" or \"Miss\" box on the sheet corresponding to the number of the target on the Day 1 target sheet. You have hit a The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 2-11"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"A COURSE IN LUCID DREAMING UNIT 2 target if you noticed it the first time it happened. If you miss a first occurrence and realize it later, that is a miss, even if you remember it the second time it happens. If you are certain that a target did not occur during the day, check the box for \"Never Happened.\" 4. Count your hits. Add up the number of targets you hit during the day and enter this number in the \"Number of Targets Hit\" column. Try to hit more targets each day, until you can easily hit all four. 5. Continue for 7 days. The next day, repeat Steps 1-4 with the targets for Day 2. Continue through Day 7, then go to Exercise 4.

Introduction To learn lucid dreaming, you must develop proficiency at accomplishing results through mental effort. This usually requires discipline, which is generally characterized as the ability to persist with an activity although no reward is immediately forthcoming. Thus, if you want to lose weight, you eat fewer high calorie foods (even though they taste best) and exercise more (even though it is hard work). But many people do not do well at tasks that require discipline, or will- power, because they have not developed their capacity to work without immediate reward or threat of punishment. Lucid dreaming is a good example of a skill that may require substantial effort to learn. You need to do the exercises diligently to achieve results. And, if you don't succeed the first time you try the Reflection-Intention or MILD technique, or any other lucid dreaming aid, you must not give up. You need to persist, with confidence that in time you will achieve your goals. The following will-strengthening exercises will help you to enhance your ability to finish tasks that do not provide any immediately obvious benefit. Instructions 1. Read the descriptions of the \"useless exercise\" tasks (A-E) on the next page. 2. Refer to the chart on the next page titled Will Development Exercise Schedule, which provides a daily schedule for performing the \"useless exercises/' Follow the schedule exactly — this in itself is an exercise in discipline. 3. As dictated by the schedule, perform each exercise exactly as it is described on the next page. It would be best for you to practice them when you are alone (except for Exercise E), so that you don't make a joke out of it, or feel uncomfortably self-conscious (that's a whole different kind of exercise). 4. Each day on the schedule includes from one to three exercises to be performed in the course of one day. Before proceeding to Day 2, you must correctly complete the exercise for Day 1, and so on. When days require more than one exercise, you must correctly complete all of the exercises listed before going on. If on a day you fail to fully complete any of the exercises, you must repeat all the exercises for that day on the following day. Do not do more than one day's set of exercises per day. (For example, don't do Day 1 and Day 2 on the same day). When you complete a day's worth of exercises — that is, you give them all the full length of time or number of repetitions, write in the date of that day on the Will Development Exercise Schedule. Tomorrow you may proceed with the next day on the schedule.

This exercise will also improve your ability to carry out your intentions in pre-specified situations, as you will need to do to remember to realize you are dreaming when working with the MILD technique. The \"I remember\" game is played with two or more people. The two aims of the game are: a) to remember to say, \"I remember,\" whenever another player hands you something, and b) to try to catch other players forgetting to say \"I remember\" when you hand them something. Now, here's a tip right off — this is not an easy game! While playing, you will soon discover how much of the time you are operating unconsciously — on \"automatic.\" You will probably find that before you finally succeed in establishing a habit of remembering, you will have to make a serious commitment to yourself that you really will do it! In the process, you will learn what it takes to make such a commitment. This discovery will show you what you need to do to establish and carry through on the intention to remember to recognize when you are dreaming, and this is the core of the MILD technique. The process of learning to succeed at \"I remember,\" often occurs in stages. After you first start to get it, observe yourself to see what you are thinking or feeling when you slip up and forget, or what is happening with your friends when you catch them forgetting. Even the most competent rememberers will forget in some situations. These tend to be times when the player is engaged in another task or thought, or emotionally involved. These are also the types of occasions when you are most likely to overlook cues that you are dreaming, whether they are dreamsigns or DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® cues. Instructions: How to Play \"I Remember\" Find a friend or group of friends to play with whom you will see several times a day. They should be good friends, people you feel relaxed with, and whom you will not mind ribbing, or being ribbed by. Make sure you have at least one person to play with who will make a real effort. Photocopy one I Remember Scorecard (next page) for each player (including yourself), and read the rules below together. Rules of the game 1. For the next five days, anytime one of your group hands something to another of you, the recipient must say, \"I remember.\" The transaction must be hand to hand. It is not necessary to \"remember\" if the object is placed or taken from before you on a surface, in your lap, or in a container you are holding, or if it is thrown or dropped into your hand. If the situation makes it socially awkward to say \"I remember,\" the recipient may make a distinct wink instead, if it is clear that the giver sees you do it. 2. If the recipient does not say, \"I remember,\" the giver must remind the recipient of the oversight, and then mark one box on the forgetful recipient's scorecard with the giver's initials. The giver should also write the date in the box initialed. (See the first box on the scorecard for an example.) 3. Your goal is to get as few initials on your scorecard as you can. 4. Once you have had your scorecard marked by another player you may earn the right to remove an initial by remembering another time. So, if you are caught forgetting to say, \"I The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 3-2"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 3 remember/' and you remember to say \"I remember\" on a future occasion, have the player who just gave you the opportunity to remember expunge one initial from your card (by simply crossing it out). 5. After five days, the winner of the game is the one with the least number of uncrossed-out initials on his or her card. Before beginning the game, agree on a prize for the winner, to be supplied by the rest of the group (or the other player, if there are only two), such as a dinner or a massage. \"I Remember\" Scorecard B 1 9 17 25 33 2 10 18 26 34 3 11 19 27 35 4 12 20 28 36 5 13 21 29 37 6 14 22 30 38 7 15 23 31 39 8 16 24 32 40 Keeping score: If a player catches you forgetting, that player initials one square above.

Introduction To succeed with the MILD technique, you need to be able to concentrate. Our minds naturally tend to wander. Our thoughts drift hither and thither, from one thought to another and from feeling to feeling, pulled this way and that by the constant changes in the world around us, and by the many concerns we have in our lives. Even when we are sitting quietly or lying in bed, as long as we are awake our thoughts flit around from preoccupation to fantasy to worry, as all our recent experiences echo in our minds. And, again, when we dream, it is the same — the events of the dream grab our attention, and our thoughts and feelings of the moment also work to create the dream. The strong tendency for our attention to be drawn to each new event or association makes it difficult for us to concentrate on a single thought for more than a few minutes. This is especially true when we are in bed, and our thoughts and senses are not anchored in some work effort that has tangible results in the physical world. For example, it is fairly easy to sit for two hours, working on writing up a report for your business, thinking about the details needed in the report, and mostly ignoring other events around you, such as children playing on the street or the conversations of office mates. However, most of us would find it quite difficult to sit for two hours doing nothing but thinking about our intention to have lucid dreams. If we could concentrate for hours on our intentions, we would surely succeed in achieving them. Fortunately, we do not need such prodigious powers of mental focus; a good solid twenty minutes at the right time is likely to be enough to make the MILD technique effective. In the previous exercises, you have learned what it takes to set an intention to remember. Now you will gain some practice in focusing, so that you can be sure that when you practice MILD, your intention to remember to notice when you are dreaming will be the predominant thought in your mind as you fall asleep. This exercise trains you in a simple form of concentration meditation. It will help you learn how to restrain your mind from wandering. Practice it daily for one week. Try to make your focus last longer each practice period. Work up to at least 20 minutes. After a week, you can practice it whenever you would like to relax, calm yourself, and clear your mind. Instructions 1. Relax. Lie down or sit comfortably. If you are sleepy, sit rather than lie down. Use a relaxation exercise, such as the progressive or 61-point relaxation techniques you learned in Unit 1, to release all of your physical tension. 2. Breathe. Do the \"'Pot-shaped' Breathing\" exercise on pages 101-102 [85] of Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming. Continue with it for a few minutes, until your \"pot-shaped\" breathing is smooth, regular and automatic. 3. Count your breaths. Now begin to count your breaths, as follows: • As you inhale, think, \"One,\" and build up a picture in your mind of the numeral \"1\" floating before you. Make it as solid an image as you can. • As you exhale, behold the numeral \"1\" you have imagined and think of nothing else. The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 3-4"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 3 • On you next inhalation, release the \"1,\" let it disappear; think, \"Two,\" and build up an image of the numeral \"2.\" • As you exhale, behold the \"2\" in your mind, and think only of it. • Continue, up through \"9,\" and then start again with \"1.\" 4. Reject distractions. Thoughts are likely to pop into your mind, asking for your attention. Don't give it to them. Ignore the thoughts. Do this passively; that is, don't get upset about them or try to forcefully eject them from your mind. Just acknowledge, \"that's a thought,\" then ignore it and return to your counting. 5. Continue. Keep up the concentration as long as it feels comfortable, or until you need or want to stop. Each day you should try to extend the time you spend in concentration a little more, until you can easily do 20 minutes. The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 3-5"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 3 Exercise 3: The MILD Technique Introduction The acronym MILD stands for Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams. A mnemonic is a memory- aid, and MILD is a lucid dream induction technique based on memory. As you have read, the MILD technique is based on the practice of remembering that you want to recognize when you are dreaming. With various exercises over the last few weeks, you have been preparing yourself to succeed in MILD by improving your ability to carry out your intentions to do things in the future with mental effort alone (no written notes!), and by increasing your powers of concentration. It pays to work hard at MILD. Research has shown that it may be the most effective tool for inducing lucid dreams next to the DreamLight or NovaDreamer, and that it can greatly enhance the results people obtain from using the devices. Because MILD is practiced during the night, it is very useful for producing multiple lucid dreams in one night. Each time you do MILD, your aim is to become lucid in your very next dream. So, if you practice MILD before each REM period you could become lucid in four or five different dreams. Thus, this is the technique of choice if your goal is to learn to have lucid dreams at will; that is, anytime you like. Be aware, however, that MILD does require concentration and periods of wakefulness during the night, so it is best used when you have extra time available for sleep. The following steps guide you through MILD. The exercise has you first practice while you are alert in the daytime, then at bedtime, and finally after awakening from a dream in the night. This allows you to build up your skill at MILD when your mind is in the best shape — wide awake — so that you know what you are doing when it comes to practicing it when you are groggy in the middle of the night. Instructions Note: Do the Daytime Practice and the Bedtime Practice each one time, on different days. Then, go on to the Mid-Sleep Practice and do it on at least five different nights. Daytime Practice 1. Memorize a dream. Right after awakening in the morning and recording your dreams of the night, choose one in which you would have really liked to have become lucid. Memorize it in detail so that you can visualize yourself living through it again. *• Use the DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® device set to give cues the night before starting this exercise, with the goal of remembering a dream with a cue in it. When selecting your dream to memorize for Step 1, it is best to pick a dream in which a cue appeared. If you don't recall any good dreams with cues from the night, use any dream you like from the night. You can visualize a cue appearing during the appropriate part of the exercise. 2. Pick a time to practice. Set aside 20 minutes in the day to practice the MILD technique. It should be a time when you can be alone in a quiet place, in a comfortable chair. Pick a time when you will be alert, not sleepy. 3. Sit down and relax. At your chosen time, sit down and get comfortable. Do a relaxation exercise (progressive or 61-point relaxation from pages 53-55 [44-45] of Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming). When you have released all tension from your body, proceed to Step 4. The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 3-6"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 3 *• Wear your DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® device during this Daytime Practice. Do not turn it on. This will incorporate the sensation of wearing your DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® into your mnemonic induction. 4. Practice MILD. A. Recall your dream. With your eyes closed, recall to mind the dream you memorized this morning. Visualize yourself back in it. Feel what it was like to be in the dream, thinking the thoughts of the dream, seeing its sights, hearing its sounds, etc. B. Focus your intent. With the sights, sounds, and feelings of the dream in your mind, concentrate on the thought, \"The next time I am dreaming, I will remember to recognize that I'm dreaming.\" Recall how it felt when you successfully set your intention to remember in the Prospective Memory exercise of Unit 2, and when playing, \"I Remember,\" and use that skill now. C. See yourself becoming lucid. Visualize becoming lucid in the dream you have just been picturing yourself in. Pick one of the dreamsigns from the dream, and imagine that when you encounter it you recognize its strangeness and realize that you are dreaming. (#<* For your dreamsign in the dream visualization, use the DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® cue — either the one you actually saw in the dream, or one that you imagine appearing. Imagine it entering the dream just after a dreamsign that really occurred in the dream.) Feel the excitement of becoming lucid. Continue now to imagine doing what you would like to do in the dream now that you are lucid. D. Maintain your focus. Cycle through Steps A, B, and C, visualizing the dream, asserting your intention, and then seeing yourself becoming lucid in the dream. Keep your mind focused on these tasks and don't allow it to wander off following other thoughts, just as you did in Exercise 2: A Simple Concentration-Meditation Exercise. Continue until your 20-minute period is up. 5. Record your efforts. In the row for \"Daytime\" on the chart titled MILD Technique Record, enter the date of your daytime practice, the time you started, and the length of time (in minutes) that you spent in the practice. The next morning, enter how many dreams and lucid dreams you recalled from the night. (See the sample form at the end of these instructions.) Bedtime Practice 1. Memorize a dream. Just as for the daytime practice, in the morning commit to memory one dream from the night in which you would have liked to become lucid. #••• As for the Daytime Practice, use your DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® device the night before doing this part of the exercise, with the goal of recalling a dream with a cue in it to memorize for the practice. Again, if you remember no dreams with cues, you can imagine a cue happening in the dream you pick. 2. Prepare for sleep. When you are ready to go to bed for the night, get ready as usual. Follow your usual bedtime routine. If you want, give yourself some time to mull over the day's events, so you can let them go to do the exercise. When you are really ready to go to sleep, go on to Step 3. #• Prepare to use your DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® device with cues. Wear the device, but with the power off while relaxing in Step 3.

Use the relaxation exercise that works best for you to release physical tension and achieve a quiet state of mind. But don't let yourself fall asleep yet. 4. Practice MILD. Follow the instructions for MILD in Step 4 of the daytime practice above, but continue the exercise (cycling through recalling the dream, focusing your intent, and seeing yourself becoming lucid) until you fall asleep. Sometimes you might find that the concentration involved in MILD prevents you from falling asleep. If you end up concentrating for more than 20 minutes without falling asleep, you may let go of your focus and relax deeply. Just keep your mind clear of thoughts and concerns. If a thought possesses your mind, gently push it aside and reassert your intention, \"The next time I dream I will remember to recognize that I'm dreaming.\" Your goal is to have this intention be your last thought before you fall asleep. #* Put your DreamLight® device in Lucid Dreaming Mode before starting MILD (do not start the delay yet — i.e. do not press the mask button). Put it on, and while doing MILD, press the two center keys on the DreamLight® control box to make the DreamLight give a cue. (The DreamLight® mask will give the cue at the end of the current 30 second data collection \"window.\" Therefore, it probably will give a cue several seconds after you press the keys.) When the cue occurs, concentrate on the thought, \"The next time I notice the DreamLight cue in a dream, I will remember to recognize that I'm dreaming.\" •<•> Turn on your NovaDreamer® device and put it on before starting MILD. While doing MILD, press the button and hold it down for one second until it gives the cue. When the cue occurs, concentrate on the thought, \"The next time I see the NovaDreamer cue in a dream, I will remember to recognize I'm dreaming.\" 5. Record your efforts. The next morning, in the row labeled \"Bedtime\" on the MILD Technique Record, enter the date and time of your practice, the approximate length of time you did MILD before falling asleep (in minutes), and the number of dreams and lucid dreams you recall from the night. (See the sample form at the end of these instructions.) Mid-Sleep Practice 1. Set your intention to awaken from dreams. As you fall asleep for the night, assert to yourself that you will awaken after dreams during the night. Remind yourself that you want to recall your dreams clearly and do MILD. #••• Wear your DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® mask set to give cues on nights you do this form of MILD. 2. Awaken from a dream and recall it. When you awaken from a dream in the night, first recall it in as much detail as you can, and then write out enough of it to describe the basic events and scenes. 3. Increase your wakefulness. Get out of bed. Go to the bathroom, and wash your face with cool water. Carefully test reality to make sure that you are actually awake! Do some stretches to increase your circulation and alertness. 4. Return to bed. Get back in bed, and read your dream report, noting the dreamsigns in it. Tell yourself that when you next see the dreamsigns you will recognize them as cues that you are dreaming. 5. Turn out the light and relax.

MILD. A. Recall your dream. Visualize yourself back in the dream you just awakened from, like you did in the daytime and bedtime practice. #• Wear your DreamLight® (on, in Lucid Dreaming Mode) or the NovaDreamer® (on) mask as you do MILD. B. Focus your intent. Concentrate on the thought, \"The next time I'm dreaming, I will remember to recognize that I'm dreaming.\" C. See yourself becoming lucid. Visualize becoming lucid in the dream you just had. Pick one of the dreamsigns and imagine that it cues you to realize you are dreaming. Feel the excitement of becoming lucid, and picture yourself doing what you would like to do once lucid. #• While visualizing the dream you just awakened from, press the two center keys on the DreamLight® control box or hold down the button on the NovaDreamer® mask for one second to make it give cues.

However, there will come times when you would like to have lucid dreams, but you either don't care that you have one tonight for sure, or when you don't want to give it the time and energy required for MILD. At such times, the easy, laid-back, autosuggestion approach may be the most appropriate. The autosuggestion technique removes all pressure to succeed. It involves no willfulness, commitments, or deadlines. The key to effective autosuggestion is feeling confidence in yourself. So, relax, smile, think good thoughts about yourself and follow the steps below. Because this is a \"no pressure\" technique, we are not asking you to record your results with it. We recommend that you try this technique a few times while completing this unit, and then use it whenever you want to have lucid dreams, but feel you cannot give it any extra effort. Instructions 1. Establish a feeling of self-confidence. Think of something you are really good at. It could be anything, significant or trivial—writing best-selling novels, designing buildings, cooking gourmet meals, growing flowers, selecting stunning outfits, playing baseball or Nintendo, fixing things, or making your friends happy. Now, remember how you feel when you are doing this thing that you are really good at. What is it like to feel completely confident in your ability? When you've got the feeling, you are ready to go on to the next steps, which may be done either at bedtime or during an awakening in the night. *• Wear the DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® mask (with power off) during Step 1. 2. Relax and create a feeling of confidence in yourself When you are in bed, release your tension by doing a relaxation exercise. Then, bring to mind the feeling of being fully confident in your ability that you discovered in Step 1. Immerse yourself in feeling good about your own competence. Hold that feeling and go on to Step 3. *••• Put the DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® mask on before starting Step 2. Wait to put the DreamLight in Lucid Dreaming Mode or to turn the NovaDreamer on until Step 3. 3. Suggest to yourself that you will have lucid dreams. While maintaining the feeling of calm confidence you called up in the last step, tell yourself, \"I can have lucid dreams, and I look forward to my next one.\" Don't assert that it must happen tonight or at any specific time. Be happily expectant of having a lucid dream and picture yourself in one engaged in an enjoyable and inspiring activity. Try to create a feeling of certainty that you will have lucid dreams in the future, but be willing to let it happen in its own good time. #• Before Step 3, put the DreamLight® device in Lucid Dreaming Mode or turn the NovaDreamer® mask on. After making the general assertion that you can have lucid dreams, assert to yourself, \"I can have lucid dreams with the DreamLight (or NovaDreamer), and I look forward to my next one.\" Then, press the two center keys on the DreamLight® control box or hold down the NovaDreamer® mask button for one second to trigger a cue. When it happens, assert, \"I can recognize in a dream that this cue means I am dreaming.\" The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 3-11"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 3 Exercise 5: Concentration and Visualization Extra Materials Needed • A candle • A small, unmoving object to look at and visualize Introduction Some people have a natural talent for vivid imagination, but for most of us, our images are weak and insubstantial — we would, for example, never mistake an imaginary apple for a real one. However, while dreaming, we all create mental images that are as real to us as anything in waking life. A dream apple is likely to look, feel, smell and taste as real as can be. Improving our ability to visualize while awake can enhance our dream work in various ways. Vivid imagery makes it is easier to do the MILD and Reflection-Intention techniques, and makes it possible to do visualization techniques like the Dream Lotus technique in Chapter 4 of Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming. These latter techniques, which will be presented in the next unit, assist you in crossing the border between wakefulness and sleep while maintaining your conscious awareness. This is done by creating a vivid mental image and holding it in your mental focus until you are in REM sleep. For this to work, the mental image (of, say, a five- petaled lotus) must be clear enough in your mind's eye for you to concentrate on. You can develop your ability to concentrate and to visualize vividly by practicing certain exercises, like those in the Appendix of Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming. These have been selected and modified to specifically train the skills you need for techniques of \"falling asleep consciously.\" The instructions below guide you through a five-day training program in concentration and visualization. Do these exercises alone, in a quiet place. Instructions Day 1 Candle Concentration 1. Sit facing a burning candle, so that it is 3 or 4 feet in front of you. 2. Look steadily at the flame. Keep your body and mind relaxed. Continue until your eyes become tired. 3. When you begin to feel eye strain, close your eyes and picture the flame before you. Rest this way until your eyes feel refreshed. 4. Repeat Steps 1, 2 & 3 two more times. Day 2 (Do both exercises in the same session.) 1. Practice the Candle Concentration exercise, as you did on Day 1. 2. Seeing a Mental Image A. Choose an object to gaze at, such as an apple, a rock, a plant, or a coffee cup. Pick something small, simple, and stationary. Put it a few feet away from you and sit comfortably. The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 3-12"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 3 B. With your eyes open, try to encompass the entire object with your vision. Try to soak in an overall visual impression, rather than concentrating on any specific feature of the object. Do this for at least 3 minutes. C. Now close your eyes and watch the afterimage of the object until it fades. Don't strain to create the image. Let the clarity emerge as if of its own will. D. Repeat Steps A, B, and C two more times. The afterimage should become more clear, vivid, and crisp each time. If you are not seeing an afterimage, increase the amount of time you gaze at the object before closing your eyes. Day 3 (Do both exercises in the same session.) 1. Practice the Seeing a Mental Image exercise as you did on Day 2. 2. Creating a Mental Image in Space Look again at the object before you for several minutes. Now, keep your eyes open and turn your gaze away from the object (move your whole body, not just your head, so that you are comfortable). Picture the object floating in front of you at eye level. As before, don't strain to create the image, but let it emerge on its own. If the image doesn't come readily, try concentrating on your feelings about the object. Then, focus on the idea that the object occupies the space at which you are looking, that it exists there because of your desire to see it. Day 4 (Do both exercises in the same session.) 1. Practice Creating a Mental Image in Space, as you did on Day 3. 2. Manipulating a Mental Image A. Look again at the object for a few minutes. Then, turn away, close your eyes, and see the object inside your body. You can try visualizing it in different parts of your body, but as the techniques in the next unit call specifically for visualizing objects in the throat area, be sure to try this spot. B. When the image is clear inside your body, move it out to the space in front of you. When it is clear outside, move it back in. Practice this movement several times, so that it becomes easy. Day 5 Pick a new object to visualize, and practice the same exercises as on Day 4. Continuing Practice Continue to practice these exercises on your own initiative, until you are satisfied with your ability to create and manipulate vivid mental images.

The type of lucid dream that you are aiming for when you use these techniques is what we call a DILD — a dream initiated lucid dream. In DILDs, people realize they are dreaming while within the dream, often because they notice the presence of a dreamsign, which either provokes them to do a reality test, or immediately cues them that they are dreaming. This unit, Unit 4, will add to your repertoire methods of achieving WILDs — wake initiated lucid dreams. A WILD occurs when a person enters the dream state directly from the waking state, without passing through other stages of sleep and with unbroken awareness. Preliminary research indicates that WILDs are most common in the late morning hours and during morning or afternoon naps. This makes sense, because these are the times when the drive to enter REM is strongest, and the time required to pass from waking into REM sleep is shortest. Naps are excellent for all types of lucid dreaming, not just for WILDs. The Winter 1991 issue of NightLight (Vol. 3., No. 1), presents the results of an experiment demonstrating that a nap taken an hour and a half after getting up an hour and a half early is twice as likely to include a lucid dream than the equivalent amount of sleep taken at its normal time at the end of the night. Thus, nap-taking may be one of the best methods for inducing lucid dreaming, as well as being ideal for entering WILDs. A procedure for taking naps to have lucid dreams is an integral part of this unit. The Weirdness of WILDs As this unit is designed to help you learn how to enter the dream state consciously, you should be prepared for what that experience may be like. The set of physiological conditions that makes WILDs possible is also conducive to some strange mental experiences. The physiological state is characterized by the brain being awake and active as the body is paralyzed in the REM state. Some of the sensations this combination has been known to trigger are: being unable to move, heavy weights on the chest (sometimes in the form of monsters or incubi), \"electricity\" running around in the head or body, vibrations, loud buzzing, rushing or roaring sounds, body parts melting, and the feeling of leaving the body. Research has shown that direct entry into the dream state from waking may be responsible for a large proportion of \"out-of-body\" experiences. It is surely the cause of \"sleep paralysis\" episodes, in which people awaken to find that they cannot move or ay out, and are subject to attacks by monsters and strange forces. Sleep paralysis can be quite terrifying, but it is harmless. Not everyone experiences these events during WILDs. However, when they do happen, it is essential to remember that all of these strange and awesome experiences are happening within your mind, so you can avoid unnecessary anxiety and not miss out on good lucid dreaming opportunities. As with nightmares, if you reframe a distressing situation as a dream, created by you, which cannot hurt you, the experience can become strange and wonderful. There sometimes is an extraordinary feeling of excitement and energy about WILDs. If the dreamer is non-lucid or doesn't understand what is happening, the excitement can turn to fear. However, if you retain your reason and balance and remember that the sensations mark the onset of a dream, the excitement can become exhilaration and delight. Even if things get extra bizarre, keep in mind that it is a dream, and in a few minutes you will awaken, whether you are ready to or not! You now should be ready to take off on some fabulous adventures. We begin with a simple procedure for using naps to induce lucid dreams — go now to Exercise I: Taking Naps. The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 4-2"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 4 Exercise 1: Taking Naps Extra Materials Needed Between two and seven days on which you can modify your sleep schedule (for example, weekends if you work regular hours on weekdays). Introduction There are two important elements involved in using napping to stimulate lucid dreams. One is to take the nap at the right time of day, and the other is to have the right interval of waking between your night's sleep and the nap. The final word on what these values are is not yet out — this is an important topic for lucid dream induction research. Nonetheless, from studies done so far, we have a good idea of what the best sleep schedule for lucid dreaming is likely to be. First of all, would-be lucid nappers should get up early on the day of the nap, cutting the night's sleep short by about the length of time of one sleep cycle: 90 minutes. Then, they should return to bed to complete their sleep after the time they would normally get up for the day — probably between and hour and two hours after their early rise. The nap should be at least an hour and a half long, to ensure the occurrence of a full REM period. People frequently have more than one dream in a 90-minute nap taken this way, and it is common to awaken from one dream and return rapidly to another, possibly several times, during the nap. This is why naps are so likely to produce WILDs. Instructions 1. Arrange to awaken early. At bedtime, set your alarm for 90 minutes earlier than usual. On the Taking Naps Record, enter the time you turn out the light to go to sleep. 2. Sleep. Sleep until your alarm awakens you (90 minutes earlier than usual). Recall your dreams from last night, and pick one that is vivid and interesting to use in Step 5. (If your dream recall is poor from the night, you can use another night's dream). On the Taking Naps Record , enter the time you awakened, and the number of dreams and lucid dreams you recall from the night. If you have any lucid dreams, indicate if they were WILDs or DILDs. 3. Get up and be active for 90 minutes. Right after you awaken, get out of bed (don't linger in bed). Go about your regular morning activities, such as eating breakfast or reading the paper. However, don't drink a lot of caffeine, so that it does not keep you awake during the nap. 4. Return to bed. After 90 minutes of being awake, go back to bed. Set an alarm if you like, or arrange to have someone awaken you after 90 minutes or two hours, just to make sure you don't oversleep. On the Taking Naps Record enter the time you return to bed. 5. Prepare your mind to become lucid. Practice the \"Modified MILD Exercise\" below until you fall asleep. Be patient if you don't fall asleep right away; a longer period doing the MILD exercise may contribute to your chances of becoming lucid. 6. Awaken and record your results. When you wake up after your nap, record the time and the number of dreams and lucid dreams you recall from the nap on the Taking Naps Record. If you have any lucid dreams, indicate if they were WILDs or DILDs. Modified MILD Exercise A. Focus your intent. While returning to sleep, concentrate on your intention to remember to recognize when you are dreaming. Tell yourself sincerely, \"The next time I'm dreaming, I The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 4-3"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 4 will remember to notice I'm dreaming.\" Keep your thoughts on this idea. As in the concentration exercise of Unit 3, if your mind wanders, let go of the irrelevant thoughts and gently guide your focus back to your intention to become lucid. As you repeat your intention, also practice Step B. B. See yourself becoming lucid. While maintaining your thoughts on the intention to remember to notice when you're dreaming, imagine that you are back in a recent dream (one from last night is best), and that you realize you are dreaming in it. Look for a dreamsign in your memory of the dream. When you see one, say to yourself, \"I'm dreaming!\" and continue your fantasy. Picture yourself carrying out your plans for your next lucid dream. For example, if you want to fly in your next lucid dream, see yourself taking off and soaring when you come to the point in your fantasy where you become lucid. C. Repeat. Repeat the above until your intention is clearly set, and you feel a sense of confidence that you can become lucid in your next dream. If your mind wanders as you drift off to sleep, repeat the exercise, so that the last thing in your mind before you fall asleep is your intention to remember to recognize the next time you are dreaming. *<> Using your Dream Light® or NovaDreamer® Device in Naps Follow the same basic instructions as above with these additions: • Use a higher sensitivity setting than you usually do for nights. • Darken your bedroom as much a possible and/or cover your face (and the DreamLight® or NovaDreamer® mask) with a dark cloth to block out sunlight. • During the Modified MILD Exercise, while imagining you are in a dream, trigger a cue. When the cue occurs, say to yourself, \"When I see this in a dream, I will know that I am dreaming.\" • Set a sufficiently long delay to allow you to be well asleep before the cue occurs, but not so long that the DreamLight or NovaDreamer is inactivated for the whole nap (say, 30 min.). • Be alert for false awakenings! Use the button for Reality Tests. Taking Naps Record Use the chart below to record your efforts and results in the nap-taking exercise described in Exercise 1: Taking Naps. The \"Nap #\" column simply labels the sequence of naps you take. The \"Date\" column is for the date you take the nap.

Introduction This is a very simple method of entering the dream state consciously. Its purpose is to maintain the focus of your attention on a single mental task as you fall asleep. It is ideal for use at the onset of naps, when the interval between sleep onset and REM sleep is likely to be brief. This counting exercise can also help you increase your awareness of your hypnagogic imagery. Hypnagogic images are little dreamlets that flit through your mind as you fall asleep. They differ from REM dreams in that they generally are only a few seconds in length, and are often static, like slides, rather than being fully dimensional dramas. However, some individuals have extraordinarily vivid hypnagogic dreams with nearly as much clarity and action as typical REM dreams, and these people may find they can have lucid dreams in the hypnagogic state using techniques like the counting exercise given below. You can further develop your skill at being vigilant as you fall asleep by working with a partner. Your friend's role is to watch you as you drift off, and to wake you up just after you fall asleep. This will give you feedback on how well you are maintaining your attention on the counting task, and increase your awareness of your mental state as you enter sleep. The directions below guide you through practicing the \"Counting Yourself to Sleep\" Technique in naps. An optional partner practice appears after the general instructions. Instructions 1. Prepare for a nap. Get up 90 minutes earlier than usual, and return to bed 90 minutes later, for a nap. Arrange to awaken after 90 minutes to 2 hours. On the \"Count Yourself to Sleep\" Record, indicate the time you go to bed at night, the time you awaken in the morning, and the time you return to bed for your nap. 2. Relax. Practice progressive relaxation to release tension. Dismiss worries and concerns from your mind, and close your eyes. 3. Count. Begin counting in your head, \"One, I'm dreaming;\" \"Two, I'm dreaming;\" \"Three, ...\" at a comfortable pace. Keep part of your attention focused on the words \"I'm dreaming.\" 4. Observe. Passively observe the thoughts and images that drift through your awareness while continuing your counting. If you lost the count, forgetting where you were, start over at \"One, I'm dreaming.\" After a while, if you preserve your focus long enough, you will hear yourself think, \"I'm dreaming, \" and notice that you are indeed dreaming! 5. Awaken and record your results. After the nap is over, enter on the \"Count Yourself to Sleep\" Record the time you ended your nap, and the number of dreams and lucid dreams you recalled from it. If you had any lucid dreams, indicate whether they were WILDs or DILDs. Also record the highest number you remember reaching in your count.

Enlist a friend to watch you as you begin your nap. Tell him or her to watch your eyes, breathing, and facial muscles as you drift off. Tell-tale signs of sleep onset are: slow movements of the eyes from side to side (this is visible under the closed eyelids), little twitches in the face and fingers, and irregular breathing. Your partner is to gently awaken you at various intervals after you start showing these signs of sleep, to help you discover both how long you can focus and what goes on in your mind as you enter sleep. 2. Count. Follow the directions in Steps 2 to 4 above for relaxing, counting, and passively observing the contents of your consciousness as you fall asleep. 3. Awaken and evaluate your success at focusing. When you fall asleep, your partner is to awaken you and ask where you were in your count, and what was happening in your mind. Take note if you lost count, and resolve to maintain it longer next time. If you were seeing imagery, reflect on what it was like and resolve to recognize it next time as dreaming. 4. Count again. Close your eyes and begin to count again. If you lost count last time, your partner should awaken you sooner after sleep onset this time, to help you find where you lose your focus. If you did not lose count last time, you partner should wait a little longer after sleep onset before awakening you, so that you can get deeper into sleep. 5. Continue. Practice counting and having your partner awaken you until you have made progress in maintaining your focus as you fall asleep. Then, let your partner go, and count yourself to sleep one last time.

Introduction The Tibetan inspired Dream Lotus technique for entering lucid dreams shares with the ''Counting Yourself to Sleep\" Technique the practice of maintaining a constant focus of your awareness as you fall asleep. The Dream Lotus, however, involves a very different kind of mental task. Instead of the verbal, \"I'm dreaming\" recitation, it calls for visualization of a complex symbolic image located in the throat. From what is known of the patterns of brain activity associated with such mental processes, it seems that the visualization activity may well encourage a different brain state from that evoked by the counting, and that it may more effectively stimulate a state conducive to lucid dreaming, at least for some people. This is at present raw speculation; however, the act of picturing a lotus in the throat may have some effect on subsequent mental events, given that many mystical traditions utilize mental concentration on specific areas of the body to promote certain states of mind. From practicing concentration and visualization exercises, you should now be ready to make good use of this technique. Even so, you will probably find it helpful to practice the technique while you are wide awake at first, before trying it on the verge of sleep. The exercise below guides you through practicing the technique and using it in a morning nap. Instructions (Practice the first two steps at least once before using the technique during a nap.) 1. Create a mental image of a lotus with a flame in the center. A lotus looks like the lily pad flowers you have probably seen. Use the \"Seeing a Mental Image\" part of Unit 3's Exercise 5: Concentration and Visualization to build a vivid mental image. You may wish to alter the image to suit your individual style. 2. Practice placing the lotus image in your throat. Use \"Creating a Mental Image in Space\" and \"Manipulating a Mental Image\" from Unit 3's Concentration and Visualization Exercises to develop your skill at locating the lotus image within your throat. 3. Prepare for a nap. As in Exercise 1: Taking Naps, awaken 90 minutes early in the morning, get out of bed, and return to bed 90 minutes later for a nap. On the Dream Lotus & Flame Record, indicate the time you go to bed at night, the time you awaken in the morning, and the time you return to bed for your nap. 4. Relax. Use progressive or 61-point relaxation to release all tension. Let go of worries and concerns. 5. Visualize the lotus and flame. Create the image of a lotus and flame in your throat. Focus on the top of the flame. Once you have given the image life, let it continue to exist in your throat — don't force trying to keep it there, but passively admire and enjoy it. 6. Observe your imagery. Watch how the image of the flame in the lotus interacts with other images that arise in your mind. Don't get caught up with any of these images or thoughts, just observe them go by. Continually maintain the lotus image.

As you contemplate the flame in the lotus, gradually your awareness should begin to merge with the image. Allow the distinction between you, the observer, and the lotus you are observing to disappear. Your consciousness will now persist as long as the image of the lotus does, remaining present until you are in a dream, and lucid. Complete your 90-minute nap. 8. Awaken and record your results. After the nap is over, enter on the Dream Lotus & Flame Record the time you ended your nap, and the number of dreams and lucid dreams you recalled from it.

You can use it anytime you wake up and realize you were just dreaming, or when you awaken from a lucid dream sooner than you would have liked. Dream re-entry will work best when you awaken before your body is done with the REM period. Thus, if at the time you awaken you were in the middle of a dream, then it could be very easy to return, this time with lucidity. However, even if you've had a long dream and awakened at what felt like the end, it is still worth trying to return. REM periods can last an hour or more, especially in the last half of the night, and one REM period may contain two or three full dreams. To return to REM sleep, you need to preserve as much as possible your state at the moment of your awakening. This requires that you move as little as possible, and refrain from thinking about concerns that will distract you and keep you awake. In addition, there are mental tricks you can use to help you sink back into REM. ** The DreamLight and Dream Re-entry As you read in Chapter 5 of the DreamLight® Operation Manual, awakenings caused by the DreamLight may be ideal opportunities for entering the dream state directly from waking with full lucidity. If, with your current DreamLight settings, the DreamLight rarely awakens you, then for the purpose of the exercises in this Unit, you might like to try setting a longer, brighter, or louder cue, to awaken you more often from REM. Alternatively, you could use the Dream Alarm to provoke awakenings in REM. <>• The NovaDreamer and Dream Re-entry Awakenings caused by the NovaDreamer can be ideal opportunities for entering the dream state directly from waking with full lucidity. If with your current Sleep Mode settings, the NovaDreamer rarely awakens you, then for the exercises in this Unit, you might like to try a longer, brighter, or louder cue to awaken you more often from REM sleep. Or, you could use the Dream Alarm to provoke awakenings from REM. Instructions 1. Before sleep: Set your intention. At bedtime, remind yourself to be alert for times when you wake up out of dreams. 2. After a dream: Hold your position. Upon awakening from a dream, keep still. Remain in the position in which you awakened. If you are uncomfortable, shift your body only enough to remove the discomfort. 3. Focus your thinking. Reassert your intention to return consciously to the dream state. Think to yourself, \"I have just awakened from a dream. I will now hold still, relax, and return to dreaming, remembering to be aware that I'm dreaming.\" 4. Relax deeply. Do the 61-point relaxation exercise (pages 54-56 [45-47] of Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming). As you turn your attention to each successive point of your body, be alert for strange sensations or distortions of your body image. These are signs of the onset of REM sleep. Continue to cycle around the 61 points. As you go deeper into REM, you may feel yourself become completely paralyzed, and then odd events may begin to occur, such as the feeling of floating out of your body, or people or creatures walking into your room and The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 4-9"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 4 disturbing you. Alternatively, you may suddenly find yourself somewhere other than your bedroom without any transition. In any case, if unlikely or peculiar things happen, remember that you are now dreaming. • If you are still awake after going through the 61 points several times, with no feelings of paralysis or body distortion, try Step 5. • If you become paralyzed but no dream imagery comes, try Step 6. 5. Imagine spinning. Hold your position, and stay deeply relaxed. Now imagine that you are spinning around in space, like a top, or like in a twisted swing. Keep this up until you are in a dream or feel completely paralyzed. If you become paralyzed, with no dream imagery, go to 6. 6. Leave your body. You now feel yourself paralyzed but in bed in your bedroom. (Note that if you're not in the bedroom in which you went to sleep, you're dreaming!) You are free to create an image of your body doing anything, since your real body cannot move. Try rolling out of bed, or sitting up. If you are really paralyzed, your physical body won't move, but \"you\" will, in a dream body. If you feel restricted by the paralysis, start by imagining getting up. As that image becomes vivid, let yourself merge with it, and you will be walking around in the dream world. Once you have \"left\" your body, you are completely in the dream. If the room around you looks so real that you can't believe it is a dream, or if anything makes you doubt that you are dreaming, do a reality check. Ask yourself if there is anything odd about the room, different from usual. Read something twice (remember a digital clock is an excellent reality checking tool).

Introduction The first four units of this course aimed to give you means to travel to the fabulous land of lucid dreaming adventure. Now that you have your tickets, we would like to provide you with hints and guidance about getting the most enjoyment and value from your travels. Through our research and communication with lucid dreamers, we have accumulated a compendium of techniques and strategies for continuing dreams, avoiding awakening too soon, changing dream scenes, influencing the course of dreams, and of particularly interesting avenues for exploration. This guide is, of course, far from complete, because we have just begun to chart the frontiers of this land, which may, after all, be a universe of unlimited possibilities! All explorers of lucid dreaming will have something to contribute to our collective knowledge of this wondrous world within the mind. With this unit you will learn several skills that will help you overcome obstacles and challenges in lucid dreams. To begin, the exercise below directs you in collecting a list of difficulties you have encountered so far in lucid dreams. In the rest of the unit, you will be able to develop solutions to these problems, and prepare yourself for future lucid dreams. Instructions 1. Read list of potential problems. On the next page is a list of challenges encountered in lucid dreams. Read through it so that you have in mind some of the possible obstacles you may come across. The list is not exhaustive; it represents the most common challenges to lucid dreamers. 2. List your challenges. With the Lucid Dreaming Challenges Chart next to you, read through your written accounts of past lucid dreams. When you come across a difficulty (e.g., woke up immediately after becoming lucid), briefly describe it in the Challenges column of the sheet. Do this for each new challenge you find. When you find additional examples of challenges you have already listed, make a tally mark in the middle column of the Challenges Chart. Continue until you have a comprehensive list. 3. Select the most frequent challenges. From your list with tally marks, find the three difficulties you have had most frequently (you may not have had this many, in which case, select all that you have had). On the Solutions Table, in the left-hand column, write in your three selected challenges. 4. Find solutions. During the remainder of this unit, and in your future experience with lucid dreaming, use the Solutions Table to take note of methods for overcoming the three listed challenges. You will find ideas for solutions in the material in this unit, and in Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming. Additionally, you may find out about methods employed by other lucid dreamers in NightLight, or through other sources.

Fortunately, this problem is easily solved, and thus it is primarily a hurdle for beginning lucid dreamers to overcome. The problem of avoiding premature awakening from lucid dreams breaks downs into two phases. The first step for many will be to learn how to get beyond the initial flash, \"Wow! This is a lucid dream!\" without jolting awake. The next stage is to achieve proficiency in methods of prolonging lucid dreams long enough to achieve goals. The general strategy for preventing immediate awakening is to suppress the expression of excitement and to engage with the dream. As a model of how to contain the thrill of becoming lucid, imagine what it's like to be dealt a winning hand in poker. If you let it be known what you are holding by showing your delight, you won't win much. Instead, you want to be \"cool,\" and save your ebullience for after you have won — or after the lucid dream has reached a suitable end. Involving yourself in the lucid dream is as essential as keeping your cool. Becoming lucid can distance you from the events of the dream, because it is generally not a part of the ongoing \"story line\" of the dream. In fact, withdrawing from the dream plot is a useful method of ending a dream (see Exercise 4). Thus, to ensure the continuance of the dream you should fully engage yourself in the dream scene you are in when you become lucid. If your senses are completely involved in the impressions of the dream, they are less likely to make the switch to perceiving waking reality. This strategy of perceptual engagement is also the keystone of methods for prolonging lucid dreams, such as the spinning technique described below. Finally, if you awaken from a lucid dream sooner than you would have liked, you can attempt to re-enter the dream, using the Dream Re-entry Technique you learned in Unit 4. The two exercises in this section will help you get started using methods of preventing premature awakening. Part 1. Avoiding Immediate Awakening Instructions 1. Memorize things to do at the start of a lucid dream. Below is a table of actions to take when you first enter a lucid dream to help you avoid awakening. Read and memorize them so that they are ready in mind when next you become lucid. What to do Keep cool, calm and collected. Engage in the dream. Move around. #••• Look away from the lights. How to do it Restrain the impulse to jump and shout for joy. It's fine to be excited, but don't express your excitement outwardly. Immediately after realizing you are dreaming, turn your attention to what's happening in the dream. Look at, listen to, and feel the events and things around you in the dream world. Get your body's senses of movement involved in the dream also, by moving through the dream scene. Run, fly, or dance — while continuing to observe and interact with the dream. Turn your eyes (not your head) to the left or right. The mask bulbs are right in front of the center of your eyes, so moving your eyes effectively diminishes the brightness of the cue, thereby making it less likely to awaken you.

Keep your Staying in the Lucid Dream Record by your bed, awaiting your next lucid dream. Record how long you manage to stay in the lucid dream when you use and when you do not use the above methods of staying asleep. Space is provided for recording your results from six lucid dreams. Also continue with Part 2 below. Part 2. Prolonging Lucid Dreams with Spinning This technique is useful for continuing a dream when the lucid dream you are in begins to fade, as dreams frequently do just prior to an awakening. The idea is simple: when you notice your dream beginning to lose visual clarity, you spin around (it is your dream body that spins, of course) until a new dream scene emerges. The exercise has you practice spinning while awake so you are prepared when the opportunity arises in a lucid dream. As noted in Part 1, the Staying in the Lucid Dream Record has space for recording the results of your first six attempts to prolong lucid dreams. Spinning is one of the techniques listed on the Record. #• The Spinning Technique can contribute much to your success with the DreamLight and NovaDreamer. The cues often border on the threshold between stimulating you to become lucid and waking you up. It is a good practice to start spinning as soon as you see a cue in a dream. Also, if you get cues while you are still in a lucid dream, spinning as soon as the cue starts may help avert awakening before the lucid dream has reached a satisfying conclusion. Instructions 1. Practice spinning while awake. In case you have any inhibitions that might make you feel silly spinning around, try it now. Put down these instructions, go into an open space and spin around a few times. Do it now. 2. Relive a dream and practice spinning. Pick a recent lucid dream from your journal, or, if you have not had any lucid dreams yet, pick any dream. Read it to remind yourself of what happened and especially focus on the events that occurred just before you awakened. Stand in an open space, and, with your eyes closed, imagine living through the last part of the dream again. When you reach the end, picture yourself, instead of waking up, catching the moment when it is just starting to fade. Open your eyes, and spin around a few times as you did in Step 1, repeating to yourself, \"the next scene will be a dream.\" Then, imagine that you are dreaming still — in a new scene which is the room around you — and do something, or imagine doing something you would enjoy doing in a lucid dream. 3. Spin in a lucid dream. The next time you have a lucid dream, be alert for the first signs that it is about to end. Usually, the visual aspects change first, by fading, losing color saturation, or becoming cartoon-like. As soon as this starts to happen, while you still feel your dream body (not your body in bed), spin around rapidly, telling yourself repeatedly, \"The next scene will be a dream.\" When you stop spinning, your surroundings may be unmistakably a dream. However, if you believe you have awakened, do a Reality Test! When you wake up from your lucid dream, write out what you need to remember it, then on your Staying in the Lucid Dream Record note that you tried Spinning, and how long you were able to remain in the lucid dream. Note: Some people find the sensation evoked by full body spinning unpleasant. Although feelings of dizziness seem to be less common in dreams than in waking, if you dislike spinning there is an alternative that may be as effective. This is to rotate just your arms in large circles originating from your shoulders. The essential aspect of both types of \"spinning\" appears to be the sensation of velocity produced by circular motions.

You may have discovered from employing this strategy in your lucid dreams that there is another edge to this sword. If you allow yourself to get too involved in the dream, you may lose your perspective, that is, forget that you are dreaming. The process is akin to getting pulled into a good novel or movie — you forget that you are sitting in a chair, you forget who your companions are, you forget your waking concerns, and are for a time, completely wrapped up in the fictional concerns of the characters in the story. Sometimes, however, something happens in a book or movie that we don't like, and don't want to be engaged in. Then, we may say to ourselves, \"This is a story,\" or \"This is a movie.\" In a dream, we want to have this kind of objectivity whenever we want to change the course of the dream or to change the way we respond to the dream events. Unfortunately, the tendency is frequently in the opposite direction — the more emotionally intense the dream, the less well we do at maintaining our lucidity. One of the points of the \"I Remember\" exercise in Unit 3 is to show how we are at the greatest risk of forgetting ourselves when we are most excited. Another reason why it is easy to lose lucidity is that dreams are so realistic. When all the things, people, places around you look, sound, smell, feel, taste as substantial as they would in the waking world, it is natural to forget that they are all imaginary. There are levels of lucidity loss. You can know that you are dreaming, but have the impression that one person or one thing in the dream is not in your mind, but really \"there.\" You can know you are dreaming, but still be worried about getting to work (dream work!) on time. Or, you can forget altogether that you are dreaming. One very common phenomenon in lucid dreams is to think that someone else in your dream is \"another lucid dreamer\" sharing your experience who will be able to talk to you about the dream in the morning. Although we cannot say such a thing is impossible, we are sure that it does not happen as often as people think while they are in the dream state! The goal of this section is to give you some tools to help you maintain your objectivity in lucid dreams so that you do not lose your lucidity. You will work with lucid dreams you have had in the past, figuring out what caused you to lose lucidity, and practice some specific methods of preserving your awareness that you are dreaming. Part 1. Reviewing Lucidity Loss in Past Lucid Dreams This exercise will help you identify danger zones in dreams — occasions when you are likely to lose your objectivity. Like in the \"I Remember\" exercise, you will look for the kinds of events in your dreams that are associated with forgetting. Instructions 1. List instances of lucidity lost. In your dream journal, find five lucid dreams (or if you have less than five, as many as you can) in which you lost lucidity before waking up. In the spaces provided on the Lost Lucidity Record, describe the events of the dream that preceded or accompanied your loss of lucidity. For example, \"In the lucid dream, I was exploring my childhood home, amazed at the accuracy of my dream reconstruction. Then, my brother The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 5-8"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 5 who died ten years ago walked in, and in the excitement of being reunited with him, I forgot I was dreaming.\" 2. Rewrite the dreams. Get out a blank sheet of paper, or use your dream journal. For each of the five dreams you selected in Step 1, rewrite the ending of the dream, starting at the place where you forgot you were dreaming. Replace the loss of lucidity with, \"I continued to be aware that I was dreaming,\" and make up a satisfactory way to complete the dream with uninterrupted lucidity. Continuing the example in Step 1, \"Then, my brother who died ten years ago walked fn. I continued to be aware that I was dreaming, and told him that I was delighted to have him in my dream. I said I missed him in the waking world, and would enjoy having the experience of sharing his company frequently in the dream world. He agreed. I then awakened. I look forward to dreaming of meeting my brother again.\" Lost Lucidity Record This form is for recording instances in your lucid dreams in which you lost lucidity while the dream continued.

Tools for Staying Lucid Here are some methods to employ when you are in a lucid dream to ensure that you continually remember that you are dreaming. Instructions 1. Verbal reminders. This technique uses your left brain to keep your right brain on track. Starting when you become lucid, you repeat to yourself, \"This is a dream.\" If something happening in the dream starts to pull you in emotionally, you will hear yourself saying, \"This is a dream,\" and be reminded to maintain your lucidity. At least the first few times you try giving yourself verbal reminders, speak aloud to yourself in the dream. If you find this method successful, experiment with repeating, \"This is a dream,\" under your breath, and then in your head. 2. Impossible actions. You can continue to convince yourself that you are dreaming by doing things in dreams that you could not or would not in waking life. You will be unlikely to think that you are awake when engaged in activities that are only possible in dreams. You can defy physical laws, or social rules. For example, float in your dream, and fly when you wish to travel. Treat strangers as friends, with no shyness or fear of losing face (it's a dream, after all). This behavior will convert your abstract knowledge that you are dreaming to practical knowledge. You will be using your awareness that you are dreaming to directly affect your behavior in the lucid dream.

One good reason is to ensure that you awaken with clear recall of useful or interesting events, thoughts, or inspirations occurring in a lucid dream. Belaying your awakening might result in forgetting something important. Memories of dreams have a way of easily slipping the mind. If you are using your lucid dreams to solve problems, or for creative work, a technique for waking at will could be very important to your success. Another way people might choose to use methods of waking at will is as a \"safety valve\" in case they are confronted with situations they are unprepared to cope with in dreams. In general, however, we advise that you face unpleasant dream experiences in a straightforward, open manner. Remember, no harm can come to you in a dream. For advice on using lucid dreaming for facing and overcoming fears, see the chapter on nightmares in Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming. In some cases it might give you extra courage while facing frightening images if you know that you can awaken yourself if you choose. Generally, the dream actions that end dreams are the opposite of those that prolong dreams. In the latter case, engaging your perceptual and motor systems in the dream scene makes waking less likely. For ending a dream, conversely, you need to disengage your attention from the dream. While waking yourself from dreams, be very alert for false awakenings. If your REM drive is still strong, the dream scene you are trying to leave may be replaced with another one, possibly of the expected scene of waking in bed. Carefully test your state to make sure you are awake when you think you are. If you are still dreaming, repeat the dream withdrawal procedure, or try another of the methods below. Do not allow yourself to become angry or frustrated, because these emotions are likely to cause you to lose lucidity, and may even perpetuate the REM state, making it harder to awaken. Methods of Awakening from Dreams Stop moving. Close your eyes. Think. Stand, sit, or lie still in the dream. This will prevent you from creating mental images of your body in motion, and make it easier for you to feel your physical body in bed. This will disengage you from the visual images of the dream. Alternatively, you can hold your focus on a single (uninteresting) point in the dream scene. This will disengage you from the visual images of the dream. When you think, your attention turns inward, so you stop modeling the world around you as vividly as when you are interacting with it Ignore the world in the dream and think about something, perhaps what you are going to do when you wake up.

They are derived from what lucid dreamers have reported enjoying. Consider these as hints about approaches and possibilities. Be open to new experiences. Whatever you choose to do in your lucid dreams, whether it be from the list below, or something you have always wanted to try, pick your activity before bed. If you wait to decide what you want to do until you are in a lucid dream, you will squander your time in the dream wondering about what you should do next. It is important also when you are just beginning to have lucid dreams, or when you are training to have them more frequently, to select dream activities that are simple and pleasurable. By doing so, you will give yourself positive feedback for succeeding at becoming lucid, encouraging yourself to want to succeed again. More challenging applications can wait until you have become proficient at techniques of initiating lucid dreams and maneuvering within them. Listed below are four suggested types of activities to explore in your lucid dreams. Pick ones that appeal to you, and be sure to invent your own as well. Flying Flying is universally hailed as one of the foremost delights of the lucid dreamer. It may be the ultimate expression of the complete freedom possible in lucid dreams. You can get started flying by either leaping up from the ground, getting a running start like Superman, or perhaps easiest is take off from a high place, the top of a hill, or a building. Once aloft, you can enjoy aerial acrobatics, gliding over the countryside, flying with dream friends, or leaving Earth and exploring the cosmos. Sex For most people, sexual pleasure is the most private of behaviors, to be shared only with few trusted intimates, and even then many personal fantasies may remain secret throughout life, often with no possibility of fulfillment. In dreams, the world of imagination and fantasy comes to life, as real as real can be. It is an entirely personal, private, secret world, in which you can attain fulfillment of any fantasy with no fear of social reprobation or physical harm (or disease). It is a great shame to feel shame about a dream sex experience. The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 5-12"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 5 Breaking Rules Make a mess and don't clean it up. Run a red light. Insult your boss. Walk out of work. Cut to the front of the line. Tell the IRS to stick it. Walk into someone else's house. Steal things. Dance in the street. Take off your clothes. Eat rich desserts or spare ribs. Walk through walls. Any of that sound like fun to you? You can do such things in dreams, without hurting anybody, even yourself. Actions violating social and physical laws like this will reinforce your lucidity, as discussed in Section 3, since you know all too well you would never do those things if you weren't dreaming. They will also help you overcome barriers you have built around certain types of behaviors — inhibitions that may extend unnecessarily to other areas of your life. It is easy to forget that the rules that maintain social order are for exactly that purpose and therefore do not apply in private situations, and that as the social order changes we may find it adaptive to change our behavior. We are better off if we have the ability to choose the right behavior for the right situation rather than responding unconsciously and, perhaps, inappropriately. Observing the Dream Sometimes the most amazing thing to do in a lucid dream is just to look at it. Many lucid dreamers have found the clarity, complexity and apparent solidity of the dream world astonishing. If the dream looks, sounds, feels, smells, and tastes so real, what does that say about the reality of waking life? It is wonderful to realize that all the glorious detail of the lucid dream is produced by your own mind, and this realization can raise your belief in your own powers of creativity. In the dream, truly and plainly, beauty is in the eye, that is, in the mind, of the beholder, who not only beholds but conceives the beauty. Of course, not all dream things are beautiful, but even when we encounter ugliness, because it is our creation, we can own it as part of our experience and, as we wish, improve it or use it. 4fr The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 5-13"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 5 Exercise 6: Changing the Dream Extra Materials Needed Your dream journal Introduction In dreams we have more power over the people, events and circumstances in our environment than we do in waking life. Even in non-lucid dreams our thoughts and feelings greatly influence the behavior of the dream. For example, imagine that you dream that you are flying in an airplane. You might cheerfully believe that you are on your way to a vacation in Hawaii, and your experience will be pleasant, culminating with you basking in sunshine by the turquoise sea. On the other hand, you might remember that you are afraid of flying, and the dream may take a bad turn, ending in a plane crash. When you ride an airplane in the waking world, your fears and expectations, fortunately, lack such power. The fact that your inner experience profoundly affects your dream reality shows how important it can be to know when you are dreaming, so that you can deliberately alter your outlook in and the subsequent outcome of your dreams. Although thoughts and feelings do not act as overtly on the waking world as they do in dreams, most people are familiar with how their mental set can influence the effect an event has on them. A public speech can seem a terrifying ordeal or an opportunity for advancement. In lucid dreams, you can see the immediate results of having positive expectations and this experience will help you guide your feelings in a positive direction in waking life as well. There are many ways that you can change the course of a lucid dream. Your choice of the ones most appropriate to you and the dream at hand will depend on your intention. Opinions vary widely about methods and benefits of dream control. On one end there is the Tibetan Buddhist thousand-year-old tradition of training disciples to exercise complete dominion over the phenomena of the dream by using their will to change fire into water, great into small, and so forth. On the other end lies the worry of some more recent dream-workers who recommend a \"hands-off\" attitude towards dreams, believing our unconsciously evolved impulses to be wiser than choices we can make deliberately. Our approach lies between these extremes. The teaching of the Tibetan Buddhists is designed to help Buddhist monks recognize the illusory nature of the dream world, as a step towards transcending this world. They have little concern for the matters of the world of daily life, an unrealistic goal for most of us. The opposite approach of non-interference can be interesting and valuable in dreams that proceed smoothly, and in which your actions are in accordance with your personal ideals. However, if you encounter difficulties, frustrations, or fearful events in the dream, you may benefit from exerting control over your behavior, that is, acting consciously, rather than out of unconscious habit. Thus, instead of running from a monster, in reaction from your natural response of fear, you can decide to overcome the fear and face up to the dream threat. In this way, you can learn that the \"natural\" impulse is not necessarily the healthiest, and that conscious direction, in dreaming as well as waking, can help you to grow and attain greater freedom and fulfillment in life. None of this is to say that playing with the dream for the sheer enjoyment of it is a bad idea. Pleasure is good for you — and few situations in life offer as much pleasure as lucid dreaming does. The recreational potential of lucid dreaming may be especially valuable to people whose lives are unusually restricted, such as prisoners or the physically handicapped.

The exercise following will help you organize your exploration of the various methods of directing your lucid dreams. Pre-sleep Dreams can be affected by pre-sleep actions, in particular, incubation of dreams about specific topics or places, and by setting the intention to have lucid dreams. The pre-sleep approach, at least as it applies to stimulating lucidity in dreams, was the focus of Units 1 through 4. Wishing Dreamers can frequently alter the course of their dreams by simply wishing for certain things to happen. This is often referred to as \"dream magic.\" By wishing, you may be able to make objects or people appear, disappear, or change, or you may completely transform the dream scene. Inner state The dreamer's disposition and responses can affect the events and characters of the dream. As discussed in Chapter 5 of Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming, expectations play a major role in determining the course of dreams. Our expectations are rooted in our moods and feelings. In dreams, the behavior of the world reflects our feelings about it. A dark street at night could be the setting for a dream of a terrifying struggle with an assailant, or it could just as easily set the scene for a thrilling romantic encounter. Which it becomes depends on whether the dreamer is feeling nervous, expecting threats, or pleasurably excited, expecting adventure. Even if your first reaction to a scene is negative, you can choose to change your feelings, for example, from fear to curiosity, from repulsion to compassion, from anger to forgiveness. Looking Whatever you choose to look at becomes the primary focus of your attention. In dreams you can direct the progress of events by directing your gaze. Thus, you could choose to explore a certain potential in a dream further by looking towards some part of the dream scene. Dream gaze may even be able to help you influence the emotional aspects of your lucid dreams. Dr. Tholey suggests that threatening dream figures can be tamed by looking them in the eyes. Perhaps this works because eye contact between people signifies equality rather than dominance and submission. The action of looking our dream monsters or muggers in the face arises from an inner state of courage and openness. Speaking Talking, like looking, is a way of focusing your attention in a particular direction. Thus, by saying aloud to yourself, \"This is a dream,\" as described in the section on Staying Lucid, you can maintain your awareness on knowing that you are dreaming. You can also use speech in dreams to express your inner state by addressing dream characters. You can convert the energy of a fearful encounter from destructive to constructive by asking your aggressor what he, she or it wants from you or how you can help. You may be able to acquire information about yourself by conversing with dream characters, and you can have emotionally fulfilling experiences as a result of expressing your love and compassion. Action Taking action is perhaps the most obvious means of controlling events, in dreams and waking life. Even when not aware that we are dreaming, our actions inevitably affect the dream's outcome. Lucidity can help us to choose actions that will lead to desirable outcomes that are appropriate to the dream state. The Lucidity Institute, Inc. © 1995 5-15"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"A Course in Lucid Dreaming Unit 5 For example, imagine you realize you are dreaming while frantically searching for your car keys so you can get to work on time, it would be more appropriate to stop your fruitless search and accomplish something you can only do in dreams than it would be to use magical means to find your keys and to drive extra fast to get to (dream) work on \"time/' Likewise, in an anxiety- filled pursuit dream, lucidity can give you the perspective needed to choose to turn and face your pursuer rather than continuing to run. Your action would alter the course of the dream, directing it towards a more positive outcome. Asking the Aid of Dream Characters Lucid dreamers occasionally report that the cooperation of dream characters has helped them to achieve their goals. Insofar as we see the people in our lives as sources of information and guidance, we are also likely to embody this knowledge and helpfulness in the \"other people\" within our dreams. Some people have asked dream characters to remind them that they are dreaming in future dreams, with success. Dream characters may also be able to provide us with valuable advice — wisdom that we have known but not been using in our lives. Or they can direct us in how to achieve our desires in the dreams. This avenue of dream manipulation has scarcely been explored and undoubtedly merits much investigation. Be creative and experiment. Keep in mind, however, that dream characters generally do not respond well to being treated like enslaved \"figments of the imagination.\" When we create dream people as embodiments of our personal knowledge, we also attribute to them the dignity that accompanies wisdom and therefore, we should treat them with the respect we owe to people who are helpful to us. Again, it is important to remember that in dreams we model the world we know, in which people have feelings and do not always respond exactly as we would like. If you become frustrated through seemingly unproductive encounters with dream characters, do not give up, but experiment with different approaches. Note that not all dream characters are likely to be sources of knowledge. A lot of them are probably the \"extras\" of your mind, people made up to populate the dream city street, or fill the dream cafeteria. Seek wisdom from dream characters that represent the kind of people from whom you would expect wisdom in waking life. Instructions: Controlling Lucid Dreams 1. Learn about various methods of controlling lucid dreams. If you have not already done so, read the catalog of methods above. 2. Analyze a past lucid dream (or a non-lucid dream). A. Select one of your past lucid dreams for analysis of the ways you manipulated its course. The dream should be one that was long enough that you were able to do more than become lucid before awakening. If you do not have any examples of lucid dreams, select a non-lucid dream. B. Note the circumstances before and within the lucid dream that correspond to the seven methods of manipulation discussed above (pre-sleep, wishing, inner state, looking, speaking, acting, aid from dream characters) and describe each instance of manipulation briefly on Methods of Guiding Lucid Dreams Record #1 in the box for the method it represents. Almost certainly, other methods of manipulating lucid dreams will appear in your dreams, but for the purpose of this exercise, focus on the seven defined above. If you are using a non-lucid dream, do this exercise by noting how your actions and feelings influenced the dream. List instances and label them just as described for lucid dreams.

See what dream events followed the actions you have listed, and note how they appear to relate to your methods. Briefly write a description of the results of your manipulative actions in the spaces provided on the Methods of Guiding Lucid Dreams, Record #1. 3. Record manipulations and outcomes from your next lucid dreams. Apply the analysis procedure in Step 2 to your next lucid dream. Then, review the methods and the resultant outcomes in the two analyzed lucid dreams. Ask yourself the following questions. Have you been achieving your goals in dreams? Is there a method you could have used that would have better helped you get what you wanted? Were any of your methods counterproductive? How would you do things differently if you were to have the same dream again? What methods would you like to try in your next lucid dream? Take notes on your responses to these questions in your dream journal for your personal future reference. 4. Continue this exercise as long as you like. Use the enclosed Methods of Guiding Lucid Dreams Record #2 to continue studying the way your actions and inner states in lucid dreams affect the course taken by the dreams.
