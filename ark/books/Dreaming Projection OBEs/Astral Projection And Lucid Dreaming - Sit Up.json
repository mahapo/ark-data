As a teenager, I read every book on astral projection and lucid dreams I could get my hands on. I was a regular at the library (even though they had limited information) and spent all of my allowances in buying books. It became an obsession that I could not control. One day, what I have been wanting more than anything else, occurred, I astral projected. One night, I was meditating in the hopes that I would be able to astral project. I have been trying for three months with no success. I put the alarm clock to wake me at 4 o'clock in the morning to try a technique that I read in a book. I continued with my meditation, and eventually, fell asleep. I woke up early in the morning from the sun shining brightly in my eyes. I noticed that I was not awakened by the sound of the alarm. I was really disappointed and became sad that I would never be able to experience the adventures that I have been reading. After a couple of minutes of feeling sorry for myself, I still felt kind of sleepy, so I fluffed up my pillows and went back to sleep. To make a long story short, I finally had my first out-of-body experience. Years have passed by and many things occurred during this period. I had many astral projections and lucid dreams, but they never were controlled and occurred when I least"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 6 expected them to. I wanted to be able to project when I wanted to and not when destiny decided. So, I sat down and started noting what I may be doing wrong. You would expect that after 11 years of studying astral projections and lucid dreams, I could have them anytime I wanted. Well, 1998 was the year my life turned around. It was the year I discovered SUNEYE Method 1. I was beating my head trying to find out the reason for my failures. I tried thinking about every technique that worked and did not work for me. I soon discovered that most of my astral projections and lucid dreams occurred during the mornings. That was it, my mind is wide-awake during the morning but I still feel sleepy. I knew that I was coming up with something, but realized that I did not have astral projections and lucid dreams every morning. There was still something missing. I must have done something else that activated the astral projections and lucid dreams. I started thinking of all the techniques (reality check, affirmations, etc.) that I have tried during the morning hours and remembered the first astral projection experience 11 years ago. I added a mixture of techniques and decided which ones worked and which ones didn't. As years passed by and I made new discoveries, I created new powerful methods, which has aided me on my astral projection and lucid dream voyages just about every morning."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 7 Factors What is SUNEYE Method 4? Well, to understand this method, you have to know a little about what causes a lucid dream and astral projection. At the SUNEYE website, we said that two factors causes lucid dreams and astral projections, but we recently have found that there are three more. The 5 factors that causes lucid dreams and astral projections are: 1. State of Consciousness 2. Body Awareness 3. Desire 4. Technique 5. Environment Once these factors are present, inducing a lucid dream and astral projection becomes natural. Natural you say? Yes, lucid dreams and astral projections are very much a natural phenomenon, much like sleep is. Well, if that was the case, how come I never experienced them? The answer to that question is that, you have already experienced them every night, more or less. You see, you dream and astral project every night (even though scientist have not been able to prove this). You are just not aware that these things are occurring to you, and becoming aware is the key. And how do you become aware of lucid dreaming and astral projecting? By practicing the five factors above."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 8 Let me explain each of the factors and show how it affects our ability to have lucid dreams and astral projections. • State of Consciousness - There is a state, or level, that you conscious mind needs to reach in order to be aware of dreaming and astral projecting. Once you are able to enter and hold this state, you are halfway to experiencing lucid dreams and astral projections. • Body Awareness - The same way that there is a conscious state that you mind needs to be in order to achieve lucid dreams and astral projection, there is also a state that your physical body needs to be in. It is a state of rest and unrest. • Desire - Well this one is self-explanatory, or is it? I know people that are really obsessed with the idea of having a lucid dream or astral projection. The problem is that it does not come through in the technique that they use. Some ways of expressing your desire are through affirmations, visualizations, and hypnosis. They must express your desire in order for it to become effective. For instance, a person that is addicted to smoking might want to quit, but the desire must be deeply rooted in to his/her subconscious to achieve any positive results. • Technique - The technique or method you use has to be thoroughly analyzed and tested. I have seen a lot of techniques that are based on theory. They are published in books, and eventually, accepted by practitioners, even though, they never work. The consequence is people believing that they will never be able to have an out-of-body"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 9 experience or lucid dream because the techniques did not work for them, when the fact is, the technique was based on theory and never tested for its effectiveness. In order for a technique to induce astral projections and lucid dreams, the person that created the technique has to really understand how astral projections and lucid dreams occur. • Environment - This is the most important factor, and also, the factor that is mostly disregarded. By environment, I mean the physical environment your mind and body must be in order for astral projection and lucid dreams to occur. People think that by doing a technique, it will get them to astral project or lucid dream, not at all. Your mind and body must be in a state that is conducive to astral projections and lucid dreams for any technique to work. The best techniques will not work, otherwise. After all of the techniques that I have tried, I have found that in order for you to have an easy and natural lucid dream or astral projection, your mind must be alert, but your body must be deeply asleep. This is the reason people have turned to deep relaxation techniques or PMR (Progressive Muscular Relaxation), thinking that it will help their bodies get deeply asleep. The problem with these techniques is that, even though your body might become deeply asleep, your mind will end up falling asleep with it. For the few that have been able to"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 10 keep their minds awake while their bodies fell asleep, reports that, astral projections and lucid dreams are usually very blurry, confusing and uncontrollable. What makes it even worst, the experience usually lasts a few seconds because, even though you manage to keep your mind alert, it still wants to fall deeply asleep and you will have to triple your concentration efforts to stay in control. As you will see, there are other environments necessary for induction. Just understand that, in order for you to have astral projections and lucid dreams, the technique or method that you use must have all of the five factors mentioned. Most only contain one, and a very few contain two. SUNEYE Method 4 contains all five factors. This is why it has such a high success rate. Most people that have tried the method have reported positive results the first time they tried it."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 11 Techniques Involved What makes SUNEYE Method 4 so successful are the powerful SUNEYE techniques involved. Using the techniques by it self could help you have out-of-body experiences or lucid dreams. Putting them together causes an explosive effect that creates a sure-fire method of induction. The SUNEYE techniques involved in SUNEYE Method 4 are: 1. Third Eye Focus 2. 6 Hour Sleep/1 Hour Awake 3. Self-Hypnotic Suggestions 4. Sit Up Third Eye Focusing Later on, I will give you detailed instructions on how to perform the third eye focus technique exactly as instructed by the Yogis, but for now, understand that it entails the moving of your eyes to the Ajna chakra. The third eye, or Ajna chakra, as Yogi text calls it, is located in the center of the head, above and behind eye level. Modern science calls it the pineal gland, approximately 9- mm x 6-mm, and does not understand exactly what its function may be, but do agree that it is affected by light."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 12 Many texts have claimed shifting of consciousness when the third eye is focused upon. Hypnotists usually induce hypnosis to a subject by having them look up at a shiny object, not only because it causes eye fatigue, but also because it causes the mind to accept suggestions easier. Yogis believe that concentrating on the third eye causes psychic powers because of this same reason. The power from the third eye focus technique comes from the ability to make a subject focus on a single thought. It is a powerful focus of the subconscious making the technique the easiest way to make your mind accept your most wanted desires. It is like a magnet, in which, once focused upon, all of your mental suggestions become sucked in by your subconscious. The third eye is a direct doorway to your subconscious and that is why the Yogis believe that, out of all the meditation methods, the third eye focus technique is the best way to calm the scattered mind. These are the reasons I use it in SUNEYE Method 4. It has made it extremely easy for my students and I to control a stressful mind. When focusing on the third eye, you easily loose awareness of your physical body. All of your trespassing thoughts dissipate and single-minded concentration on a thought increases. The Yogis deeply believe that, once the Ajna chakra is opened through focusing upon, the powers of astral projection and dream control are achieved. They do not focus on the third eye chakra for these reasons, though, but to reach enlightenment."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 13 The people that have tried the third eye focus technique in SUNEYE Method 4 say that they notice an increase of clarity in their thoughts, as if their subconscious mind accepted every suggestion they inputted. When they stopped using it, their OBEs and LDs began to decrease. Mark tried the technique and realized how it focused his self-hypnotic suggestions: “By concentrating on my third eye, I found that no other thoughts entered my head. Except, those of \"I will induce a lucid dream\", \"I will induce an OOBE\" and small clips of what it would be like to go to the place where I saw a couple of shooting stars when I had gone out the night before... I fell asleep quite quickly compared to other nights this week.” Djey noticed immediate results using this technique in her meditation: “Adding Joe Russa’s “third eye focus technique” to my usual formulas of cycles-through the chakras and meditation, had immediate results. First night/morning experienced clear hypnagogic images, pale green and then a very sharp colorful landscape... Practice “third-eye concentration” again for about five minutes and soon felt gentle vibrations and buzzing in ears.” Jagan and I became really good friends during his training. He told me that his out-of- body experiences and lucid dreams were very blurry. I told him to try the third eye focus technique during his OBEs and LDs and see if it makes a difference:"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 14 “My scenery is not that bright during my OBEs. Last night I sat down on the floor during the OBE and meditated on my third eye. From then on, the scenery became vivid. Maybe that is what I have to do for some time before I continue with the rest of the experience.” The following is the detailed instructions on how to perform the third eye focus technique as seen on many Yogi texts. “...roll-up the eyeballs until they are fixed at a point on the forehead, between the eyes-in much the same way as the Yogis do... This method is a strain upon the eyes, but is one which has been found very effective, - as the result of numerous experiments and experiences.” 1 To assure that you are doing this method effectively, I will try to make the instructions a little clearer from the research that we have performed. With your eyes open, place the tip of your finger between your eyebrows just above the eyes. Move the tip of your finger perpendicularly away from your face 3 inches (use a ruler to help you estimate the length). Now, try to look at the tip of your finger as clearly as you can. This is the position you want your eyes to be in when you close them. While keeping sight of your fingertip, close your eyes.   1 Higher Psychical Development-The teachings of the Yogis by Hereward Carringtion. 1983, NewCastle Publishing Co., Inc. North Hollywood, California."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 15 Another person that tried SUNEYE Method 4 had problems doing the third eye focus technique her first time. Clairity soon realized that it became a lot easier the second time around. “I went back to my couch, put my earplugs in, dimmed the light a little and did the third eye technique for 5 minutes. I find that what seems to work for me is stating \"everything is a dream\" and \"I am dreaming\" as I focus on my third eye. BTW, I can now roll my eyes to my third eye and hold them there until I decide to stop (I could only do this for less than a minute when I first started this technique).” 6 Hour Sleep/1 Hour Awake The Lucidity Institute made a breakthrough in the field of lucid dreams when it publicly announced their discovery of the nap method. Even though they were not the first to discover this form of induction because research has been done by many adepts way beforehand, they were the first to publicly survey and announce it. In an excerpt from an article at their Internet web site, the Lucidity Institute explains their findings."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 16 “Getting up an hour early, staying awake for 30-60 minutes reading about lucid dreaming, doing MILD briefly, then taking a morning nap is a very effective way to induce lucid dreams.” 2 After long and strenuous research with several people, I perfected that method making specific changes that creates the environment necessary to induce, not only lucid dreams, but also, out-of-body experiences, which is called, the 6-hour sleep/1-hour awake method (for lack of a better title). The Lucidity Institute’s nap method was created solely for the induction of lucid dreams, and not for out-of-body experiences. It is far easier to induce lucid dreams, but you need specific procedures to induce out-of-body experiences, which the nap method did not have. This is understandable because the Lucidity Institute only researches lucid dreams, and not, out-of-body experiences. The theory behind the nap method and another similar method called sleep/wake/sleep method (both are the same method) is that, if you are asleep but your mind is alert, then your mind should be able to consciously control your sleep or dream environment. You loose consciousness when you regularly fall asleep. You may be able to remember a dream or so, but for most of us, we have no control of the events that takes place in our dream world. This is where the nap method comes in.   2 An Hour of Wakefulness Before Morning Naps Makes Lucidity More Likely by Stephen LaBerge, Leslie Phillips, & Lynne Levitan. From NightLight 6(3), 1994. The Lucidity Institute, Palo Alto, CA."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 17 These methods make your mind alert enough, so that, when your body falls asleep, you do not loose total consciousness and are aware of the events taking place when you sleep. Out-of-body experiences occur when your mind is at its most alert state. This is where the main differences between the nap method and the 6-hour sleep/1-hour awake method, takes place. The 6-hour sleep/1-hour awake method gives you the specific time when your mind will be at its peek alertness during sleep. The nap method averages the amount of sleep and wakefulness that you need, making it more probable that you will not reach conscious alertness at its peek state. Because of the lack of precise timing, the nap method had another drawback. Let's say that you regularly sleep 4 hours and we use the nap method, you would have to wake up after 3 hours of sleep. Studying the theory involved, your mind would be too tired and would not be sufficiently alert causing your dream not to become lucid because not enough sleep was taken. Let's say that you sleep for 9 hours. The nap method will have you awaken after 8 hours of sleep. Research shows that an average person will be fully energized and refreshed after 8 hours of sleep. This will make your body too energized for lucidity to take place and will eventually not let you fall back to sleep. Studying this made me realize that there is a certain amount of hours you would need to sleep in order for your body to remain"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 18 tired and your mind to become alert. This is where the 6-hour sleep/1-hour awake method comes in. As you can see, the 6-hour sleep/1-hour awake method is as simple as its name. You simply sleep 6 hours, stay awake for 1 hour and do something active during this period, then go back to sleep. Another discovery we have made that the Lucidity Institute does not mention in its method is that, because of your biological clock and circadian rhythm, you have to perform these methods at a specific time in order for it to be effective. That is what the 6- hour sleep/1-hour awake method has you do. The specific time will be explained in the actual method later on in this book. Self-Hypnotic Suggestions Hollywood has always displayed hypnosis as a person being under a trance and having no control over his/her actions. Nothing could be further from the truth. When you are under a hypnotic trance, you have complete control of your actions. If a hypnotist gives you a suggestion to jump of a building, you will probably just look at the hypnotist and tell him/her to jump off in your place."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 19 If the hypnotist gives you a suggestion that you accept, then the suggestion will have an effect. If you do not accept the suggestion, then it will have no affect on you. Then what is hypnosis? Hypnosis is repeated suggestions given to a subject under a trance from a hypnotist, to perform an action, or to cause an effect. The word trance may sound mystical, but it basically means your body being relaxed and your mind being free of thoughts. The trance that is used in SUNEYE Method 4 is light, meaning, your body does not need to be deeply relaxed and your mind will not be forced to be free of thoughts. Self-hypnosis is repeated suggestions a person gives to him/herself, to perform an action, or to cause an effect. A self-hypnotist repeats hypnotic suggestion mentally, or by recording the suggestions to a tape player, and playing it during a trance. The suggestions that are needed and are used in SUNEYE Method 4, are suggestions that are short, specific, and in the present tense. The subconscious mind is like a computer. It does not like general questions. If you simply ask a computer for help, the computer will not understand what you need help on and will be ineffective in providing an answer. If you specifically tell a computer what you need help on, the computer will give you the answer you need."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 20 During my research, I have found that general suggestions do not provide positive results, if it provides results at all. When I specifically tell my mind what I want in a short, specific sentence, the results are surprisingly accurate. The self-hypnotic suggestion that you will give yourself is done mentally. You will tell yourself these suggestions lying down, right before going to sleep, because your mind is drowsy and more susceptible to commands during this time. Sit Up The Sit Up technique is a technique I performed in my successful attempts at astral projection and lucid dreams. I discovered this technique after searching for the common denominator of my successful attempts. After researching it even more, I found out that it was important for success. The positive side to this technique is that it maximizes your chances of having an out-of-body experience or lucid dream. Another positive is that it made my lucid dreams and out-of-body experiences last a lot longer with very clear imagery. The negative side to this technique is that it will be harder to sleep. Here are the instructions for performing the Sit Up technique. 1. Incline your body to a 120-130 degree angle. Look at illustration 1a and 1b to see how this would look like. One way you could accomplish this is too sit on your sofa. Do not push your lower back against the back of the sofa as this will cause curvature of the spine and will not relax your body for sleep. Most sofas have a low backside causing your neck"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 21 to bend backwards to the point that you look upwards. Following step #2 should prevent this neck curvature. Illustration 1a Illustration 1b The best way to accomplish the Sit Up technique is to use a declinable or lawn chair and positioning it to a 120-130 degree angle. You can measure this by getting a degree ruler, placing it against the joint of the chair parallel to the floor, and preferably, measuring a 130-degree angle. The best reason to use these chairs is because they have a high backside that does not let your neck bend backwards. 2. The most important thing to consider in this technique is comfort. IF YOU DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE, YOUR BODY WILL NOT SLEEP. No matter what kind of chair you use, ALWAYS put a pillow vertically on your back and fold it towards one end to push your head forward thus giving support. If you have two pillows, you could use one for your back and fold the other to lift your head. You can also buy pillows that are"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 22 long, giving you the ability to fold it at one end to lift your head. You want the pillow to be as fluffy as possible, preferably cotton or goose feathers. Make sure that none of your muscles are tense, but relaxed. Let your body sink in to your seat and take a couple of long deep breaths to relax. By lifting your head, you are making your field of vision face forward instead of upwards at a 100-110 degree angle from the floor. Your mind is use to having your head face upwards, sideways, or downwards during sleep, but it is not accustomed to you sleeping with your head facing forward. So, by sleeping this way, your mind becomes more alert while your body falls asleep. 3. Like I said in step #2, the most important thing to consider in this technique is comfort. Most declinable or lawn chairs have feet rests. Sofas, on the other hand, do not come with this added feature. You could buy a feet rest stand at most furniture stores or place a small table in front of you with a pillow on top so you may rest your feet on. You could also choose to sleep on the floor while resting your upper body against the bed or sofa. Remember the pillows!"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 23 The Method SUNEYE Method 4 is broken up into two phases. The first phase is the preparation for the second phase. The second phase is where a lucid dream or astral projection will take place. SUMMARY 1. Sleep for 6 hours starting between 11:00 PM - 1:00 AM. 2. Stay awake for 1 hour. 3. Go back to sleep, preferably doing the Sit Up technique. FIRST PHASE OF SLEEP 1. Set your clock to awaken you 6 hours from the time you plan to begin sleep, which should be anywhere between 11:00 PM - 1:00 AM. 2. While lying down on your back and preparing to fall asleep, close your eyes and perform the third eye focus technique while mentally repeating yourself the following suggestions, “Today will be the day that I have an out-of-body experience” or “Today, I will become aware that I am dreaming”. If your mind starts to wander or you catch yourself falling asleep, you will notice your eyes loosing its focus to the third eye. Just roll your eyes up again to your third eye and continue the self-hypnotic suggestions. Eventually, you will loose consciousness and fall asleep or you will be to sleepy to continue, in which, you could stop induction and allow yourself to fall asleep. 3. Sleep for 6 hours."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 24 SECOND PHASE OF SLEEP 1. Wake up and wash your face with cold water. Stay awake for 1 hour. During this period, you could read and visualize about lucid dreams or astral projection. At least 3 times during this hour, wash your face with cold water, and move around as not to cause sleepiness. 2. After the hour is up, lie down or use the Sit Up technique and prepare yourself to fall back to sleep. (You can try lying down flat on your back, but if you do not have an out- of-body experience or lucid dream, or notice that they are blurry and last for a short period of time, then use the Sit Up technique). Close your eyes; perform the third eye focus technique and self-hypnotic suggestions until you feel the vibrations set in (you will know what these vibrations are once they come). If you start to loose focus, gently place your focus back to the third eye. 3. Let yourself fall asleep. You might have trouble falling back to sleep for up to 1 1/2 hours, but this is normal. Eventually, you will fall asleep and that is when the fun will begin. One of the following things may happen: • You may not have fallen asleep after a long period of time, but are very drowsy. You could then focus on your third eye to force the vibrations to occur. You will feel a harmless surge of electricity all over your body. Finally, when these surges subside, you will be in a paralyzed state. All of this is normal and is suppose to happen. Then, you could get out of your body. (At this point, you are entering the advance levels of these phenomenons. If interested, our site has advance level manuals that you may order.)"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"SUNEYE Method IV - Sit Up - Version 3.0 by Joe Russa (SUNEYE) Page 25 • You will fall asleep, wake up, and already be in a paralyzed state, which you will then need to make yourself get out of your body. • You may be in a highly vivid dream, in which, you will become aware that you are dreaming. You can continue with the lucid dream or turn it into an out-of-body experience. (Turning lucid dreams into out-of-body experiences is part of our advance level manual, 'Navigating The Other Worlds', which may be ordered at our site) • You may experience a false awakening and turn it into an out-of-body experience or lucid dream. A false awakening is a dream, in which, you believe that you have awakened and carried on with your daily routine. These dreams are immensely vivid, even though, you are not in control. Here are some final notes. If you find yourself paralyzed or floating above your body, you have passed the beginner level. To learn how to navigate in the other dimensions, our advance level manual, 'Navigating The Other Worlds', could be ordered at the SUNEYE site by visiting http://fly.to/suneye . Due to the extra hours of sleep performed in this method and our body's ability to accustom itself to changes, it is best if this method is performed once a week or when it is mostly needed. Too much sleep will not let your body be physically rested enough when retrying this method. SUNEYE Method 4 has had extraordinary success.

I received a letter from Alexander telling me how he tried to use SUNEYE Method 4 with little results, until he found out that he left some things out in the instructions. “Greetings, Joe! First of all, I would like to thank you for the wonderful OBE technique of yours, SUNEYE. I tried it several times, with no significant effect, but I guess I wasn't intentional enough. Two nights ago I did everything \"by the book\". I woke up at 5 AM, returned to sleep while focusing on the sixth chakra and telling myself, that now I shall have an OBE. Everything happened exactly - and I emphasize, exactly - by the scenario you've described. First, I had a dream, in which a small, but a strong girl was picking on me, and I couldn't get rid of her. Then it was as if someone told me (or I told myself), \"This is a dream, why waste an effort?\" - lucidity! Since it's a dream, I decided to wake up into what I expected - a paralysis. I heard a noise of a wind, as I do in my ASP events, and some voices/music in a left ear. Almost immediately, and with an extreme ease, I floated out of my body toward the ceiling, seeing its approach. The whole process occurred as though by some program. I swam in the air, went through the wall of my bedroom and flew into our living room...
