After Casolaro’s death, his brother, Dr. Anthony Caso- laro, originally gav e the notes to ABC’ s Nightline program in order to allow six journalist acquaintances of his brother a chance to review his leads. Tony Casolaro then turned the papers over to Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), an office in the University of Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia, Missouri. That office still makes the papers available to researchers. 1 The collection includes court documents, a newsclipping file, tour guides and annual business r eports that per- tain to Casolar o’s investigations, and what r emained of his handwritten notes. These did not include any papers that Casolaro had with him the night he died. Wide-ranging sources of information supplement this scar ce record of the life, investigative work, and death of D anny Casolaro. These include: affidavits filed by arms merchants and convicted felons; mainstream and non-mainstream periodical sources, including some that publish messages r eceived from chan- neled aliens, others notorious for their far-right connections, lite-left leanings, and radical chic pose; unattributed sour ces on the Internet; anonymous samiz- dat ; participants in Casolaro’s investigation; peripheral players; researchers who knew Casolaro; and r esearchers whose wor k expanded on the O ctopus thesis. While some might question the credibility of some of these sources—as, indeed, some questioned the credibility of Casolaro’s own sources—the authors include them here because they illuminate the research in obvious ways.

No answer. She slid her passkey into the hole and opened the door. The bed was turned do wn, but looked unr umpled, as if it had not been slept in. A man’s clothing rested on the bed’s foot.

Bittinger arrived quickly and v entured into the bathr oom. The door and the shower curtain partially obscured her view, but she saw a half-empty bot- tle of red wine by the toilet, a cigarette ashtray by the tub, and then a piece of broken glass and gouts of blood splashed onto the wall. A pair of pale, bony knees stuck out from the tub. She noticed two towels drenched in blood under the sink.

They determined that the dead man in the tub was a white male in his early 40s. They found a dozen deep gashes in his wrists, a shoelace around his neck, and two plastic wastepaper basket liners floating in the tub, as if someone had tried to asphyxiate him. When the paramedics lifted the body from the tub, a single-edged razor blade appeared, along with an Old Milwaukee beer can and a paper coaster. On the bedroom desk sat an empty composition notebook, a legal pad with one page removed, and a Bic pen. The page from the legal pad lay near- by with a note written on it: To those who I love the most, Please forgive me for the worst possible thing I could have done. Most of all I’m sorry to my son. I know deep down inside that God will let me in. If these were the dead man’s words, they were the last of his obscure writ- ing career. A wallet found at the scene, filled with cr edit cards and a driver’s license, identified the man as Joseph Daniel Casolaro of Fairfax, Virginia. Danny Casolaro had published thr ee books, and wor ked as a journalist of sorts, writing for tabloids and trade magazines.

V"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2 THE OCTOPUS The Octopus was Casolaro’s name for a handful of spooks and power bro- kers in the intelligence community who manipulated public ev ents as wide-ranging as the 1980 October Surprise that may have cost Jimmy Carter the presidency, and the BCCI bank scandal in the early 1990s. Like the tenta- cles of his metaphoric sea cr eature, the slashes in both wrists—eight on one side, four on the other—pulled Casolaro down into oblivion, ending his inves- tigation into a po wer cabal whose inv olvement in a list of notorious contemporary political crimes he had documented in his book. Perhaps Caso- laro erred in changing the book’s title from Behold, a Pale Horse , taken from the Biblical admonition fr om Rev elation 6 : “Behold a pale horse and its rider ’s name was death.” Even as Casolaro focused his investigation on tracking software, his man- uscript dealt with many connected crimes. It included contra war chemical and biowarfare weapons developed on the tribal lands of the Cabaz on Indians of Indio, California, weapons possibly used in the O ctober 23, 1983 blast at a compound in Beirut that left over 300 American and French military person- nel dead. H is research also looked at bizarr e murders among the Cabaz on Indians involving administrators of the tribal land; the priv atization of CIA dirty tricks through the notorious Wackenhut security firm, the policemen for both the Cabazons and the mysterious Area 51, home of secret spy planes and rumored UFOs; Vietnam MIAs; corr uption at H ughes Aircraft; the human genome project; even the Illuminati secret societies of the 18th century. To his friends, Danny Casolaro was, above all else, the ultimate “nice guy.” He came from a well-to-do background in McLean, Virginia, the hub of the intelligence community that pr eoccupied his adult attention. H is father had been a successful obstetrician. Although his Catholic I talian family had expe- rienced its share of tragedies—a congenital hear t defect took one of D anny’s five siblings, an infant, and an older sister died of a dr ug overdose in Haight- Ashbury—Danny grew up with the good things in life. B y all reports, he was a congenial, open-minded and tr usting soul with fe w serious worries. A t age 20, he left Provident College to sear ch for treasures of the I ncas in Ecuador. When he returned, he settled into a marriage that lasted thirteen years and pro- duced one son, Trey (J. Daniel Casolaro III). He lived in a $400,000 home on three acres in Fairfax City, Virginia, where he kept horses. He played the piano. His literary tastes ran along the lines of Jack Kerouac and the Beats; he was an Elvis Costello fan. Danny Casolaro had achieved only modest success in his chosen profession of writing.

His novel, The Ice King , a Hemingway-like novel about mountain climbing, had been published by a vanity press. He also pub- lished a short story collection, Makes Me Think of Tall Green Grass , and worked on two films, Rain For A Dusty Summer and To F ly Without Wings , the latter narrated by Orson Welles. According to one source, “Danny wasn’t an inves- tigative reporter. He was a poet.” 1 The first piece of Casolaro’s life to pass into conspiracy lore was that a mys- terious informant may hav e supplied him with the last bit of evidence he needed to prove the existence of his O ctopus cabal. Just prior to leaving for Mar tinsburg, Casolaro warned his brother, “If anything happens to me, don’t believe it’s an accident.” 2 According to friends and family , little in Casolar o’s disposition or behavior could have led to suicide. The gashes in his wrists were too deep to be self-inflicted. The suicide note was unconvincing. The discov- ery of his body, the rush to autopsy—without the consent of family—and the quick cleaning of the murder site increased suspicions. Something in Casolaro’s Octopus research quite likely led to his murder. ———— 1. James Ridgeway and Dough Vaughan, “The Last Days of Danny Casolaro,” Village Voice , October 15, 1991. 2.

PROMIS Breaking V 5 After a brief return to college, Danny Casolaro picked up stringer work for var- ious tabloids and magazines. H e eventually found his way to Computer Age Publications , which r eported daily on the personal computer trade. Casolar o stayed there for ten years, eventually becoming part-owner. He sold his stake in the company in 1990. Unfortunately, friends said Casolaro had vastly underesti- mated the value of the newsletter, and had sold it for far less than it was worth. 1 In early 1990, Danny Casolaro was on the make for a ne w beginning. He was looking for a great story, something he could sink his teeth into, something that would catapult him toward the monetary rewards he desired. A friend and fellow worker in the computer magazine business, Terry Miller, suggested that Casolaro look into a developing scandal involving software made by a company called Inslaw, the Institute for Law and Social Research. After discussing the case with one of the company ’s founders, William Hamilton, Casolaro felt like this might just be the right project. The Inslaw case began in 1982, when the US J ustice Department granted Hamilton’s company ten million dollars o ver three years to adapt a computer program to the needs of US attorneys in tracking criminal cases fr om office to office. The program was called Prosecutor’s Management Information System, or PROMIS. Hamilton explained that, as a former member of the super secr et National Security Agency (NSA), he and his wife N ancy developed PROMIS with funding from the government’s Law Enforcement Assistance Administra- tion (LEAA). After the LEAA funding was phased out at the end of the Car ter adminis- tration, the H amiltons converted Inslaw into a for-pr ofit business, with the government’s knowledge and approval. Hamilton had sent a letter to the Depart- ment of J ustice requesting they waiv e any rights to the enhanced v ersion of PROMIS, and on August 11, 1982, a lawyer for the Department responded, ver-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"6 THE OCTOPUS ifying that Inslaw had the rights to any privately funded enhancements added to the public domain version of PROMIS. The PROMIS program was developed for the purpose of tracking individu- als pursued or pr osecuted by the J ustice Department, and included the vital capability of interfacing with other databases. As Hamilton explained his situation, Casolaro must have grown increasing- ly aware of the pot-boiler possibilities inher ent in this stor y. PROMIS was the Maltese Falcon of a conspiracy web into which Hamilton had fallen. Hamilton made it clear to the computer-savvy Casolar o that the enhancements he had made to PROMIS were not minor. Early enhancements enabled the software to be run on other, less-powerful computer systems than the original, including IBM, Wang, Burroughs, and Prime; later enhancements—the ones taken by Jus- tice—allowed it to run on a DEC VAX minicomputer. 2 If Hamilton sounded bitter when he talked about the deal he had struck with the government, he had his r easons. The 1982 agr eement with the J ustice Department, through which Inslaw was to be paid $10 million for placement in US prosecutor offices and enhancements for sev enty-four smaller depar tment offices, would have been just the beginning of PROMIS’ applications. Hamilton estimated that the demand for the softwar e might eventually exceed five billion dollars. In place of that watershed business, H amilton received a decade-long legal battle. The problems began after Inslaw delivered the modified PROMIS to the Jus- tice Department. First, payments to the H amiltons were suspended. Next, the Department accused Inslaw of overcharging. By February of 1985, the J ustice Bill and Nancy Hamilton Elliot Richardson"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"7 PROMIS B REAKING Department had withheld almost two million dollars fr om Inslaw. When it became obvious that the Justice Department was not going to honor its contract, the company ’s attorney , former US A ttorney G eneral E lliot Richar dson, renowned for his role in the Watergate scandal, advised the Hamiltons to sue. In June 1986, the Hamiltons took Richardson’s advice and filed suit. 3 As the lawsuit pr ogressed, the H amiltons learned about secr et dealings behind the scenes at the Justice Department relating to Inslaw. On St. Patrick’s Day, 1987, the first of several whistleblowers stepped forward. Anthony Pasciu- to, the deputy director of the Justice Department’s Executive Office for United States Trustees, secretly met with the H amiltons, and told of pr essure from Thomas Stanton, the director of his office, to get Trustee officer William White and others to liquidate Inslaw. Pasciuto also said that Cornelius B lackshear, the US trustee in New York, knew what Stanton was doing, and that he had talked about the pressure on Inslaw to US Cour t of Appeals Judge Lawrence Pierce. Blackshear, under a deposition by Inslaw’s lawyers, confirmed his statements to Pasciuto, but the following day met with a representative of the Justice Depart- ment and recanted in a sworn affidavit, saying that P asciuto had confused the Inslaw case with another one. After offering his testimony , Pasciuto listened while White, his superior in the Department, denied the statements that Pasciu- to said had been made to him. I n anger and frustration, Pasciuto also recanted. Despite this, Pasciuto lost his job two days after he testified. A J ustice Depart- ment memo recommended his dismissal, saying, “...but for Mr. Pasciuto’s highly irresponsible actions, the Department would be in a much better litigation pos- ture than it presently finds itself in.” 4 Even though Pasciuto had changed his stor y, the federal bankr uptcy judge hearing the case, Judge George F. Bason, accepted Pasciuto’s original testimony. The judge also noted that White had recently joined a law firm practicing in bankruptcy matters, and that his futur e with the firm might hav e been jeopar- dized if he had muddied the water with the US Trustee’s Office. Bason made the observation that Cornelius Blackshear had also offered “two different versions of the same event,” and that the first v ersion, which confirmed Pasciuto’s original testimony, was the most cr edible. In September, 1987, J udge Bason ruled on Inslaw vs. the United States of America, finding the government guilty of trick- ery, deceit and fraud. He ruled that that the US Department of Justice had stolen the PROMIS software. Judge Bason stated that officials of the Justice Department had attempted to bankrupt Inslaw through an “outrageous, deceitful, fraudulent game of cat and mouse, demonstrating contempt for both the law and any principle of fair deal- ing.” Judge Bason also wrote to Attorney General Edwin Meese, suggesting that an outside official be appointed to r eview the evidence because of evidence of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"8 THE OCTOPUS perjury by officials in the Justice Department. Meese did not answer the letter. 5 On F ebruary 2, 1988, Judge Bason ordered the Justice Department to pay Inslaw approximately $6.8 million in licensing fees, and an additional near $1 million in legal expenses. Bason postponed his assessment of punitiv e damages. An appeal was upheld b y US D istrict Court Judge William B. B ryant. 6 Judge Bason’s assessment of punitiv e damages against the J ustice Department never came. In November, 1987, Judge Bason threw out a motion by the Justice Depart- ment for the liquidation of I nslaw. A month later, Bason received word that he would be denied reappointment to the bench. The judge became one of four out of 136 federal bankruptcy judges to have been denied reappointment in the pre- vious four years. The decision was made by a four-person merit selection panel that had been appointed, in obvious conflict of interest, by Judge Patricia Wald, who had pr eviously been employed by the Justice Department. Outrageously, Bason’s position was filled by S. Martin Teel, Jr., a Department of Justice lawyer who had represented the IRS in its audits of I nslaw and had recommended liq- uidation of the company. 7 In Mar ch, 1988, Pasciuto, the man who had r ecanted his earlier testimony about Department corruption, decided to come clean. In a letter from his attor- ney, Pasciuto described Justice Department actions designed to destr oy Inslaw, quoting a statement by Robert Hunneycutt of the Department’s finance offices, that “people in the US A ttorney’s offices don’t like I nslaw,” and that inv oices from the company were among those designated never to be paid. 8 In A ugust, 1989, the behavior of the J ustice Department with r egard to Attorney General Richard Thornburgh Attorney General Edwin Meese"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"9 PROMIS B REAKING Inslaw had gained such infamy that the chairman of the J udiciary Committee, Jack Brooks of Texas, began an inv estigation with a letter to A ttorney General Richard Thornburgh. Thornburgh questioned the need to r einvestigate, but promised full cooperation. As the inv estigation proceeded, however, he seemed to do all in his power to thwart it. At first Thornburgh refused to appear before the committee or to surrender Justice Department files relating to the case. This forced the Judiciary Committee to subpoena almost fiv e hundred documents. Thornburgh finally relented and released the files, although one sour ce in the House of R epresentatives alleged that appr oximately twenty of the files w ere missing. 9 In D ecember, 1989, Inslaw attorney Richardson submitted a writ of man- damus to the US District Court in Washington, D.C. asking for the government to intervene with the appointment of an independent investigator to further pur- sue Inslaw’s allegations, no w supported by a cour t ruling, about the theft of PROMIS b y the J ustice D epartment. Richar dson stated that, “ Attempts to acquire control of PROMIS were linked by a conspiracy among friends of Attor- ney General Meese to take adv antage of their r elationship with him for the purpose of obtaining a lucrative contract for the automation of the Department’s litigating divisions.” 10 This was where the case stood when William Hamilton and Danny Casolaro talked on the phone. Casolar o found Hamilton’s story interesting, particularly since it dealt with one of his inter ests, computers. Casolaro took the bait, but only when Hamilton started telling him about Michael Riconosciuto. ———— 1. “Autopsy Backs Suicide Ruling,” Washington Times , Aug. 16, 1991. 2. “Area Writer Investigating...,” Washington Post , 8/13/91; Fricker, Richard L., “The Inslaw Octo- pus,” Wir ed 1.1 , premiere issue, 1993 p. 80. 3.

Steinberg had put Bill Hamilton in touch with M ichael James Riconosciuto, a 44-year- old denizen of the shadowy world of covert operatives. Riconosciuto first called Hamilton on May 18, 1990, and talked with him for two and a half hours, spinning a gossamer of connections that added startling new dimensions to the Inslaw case. 1 Riconosciuto, in hundreds of collect telephone calls to Hamilton, rev ealed inside knowledge of the government conspiracy to steal PROMIS from the Hamiltons. He stunned Hamilton further when he told him that he had personally modified the PROMIS software as research director of a joint v en- ture of the Cabaz on Indian tribe of I ndio, California, and the nation ’s third largest private security firm, Wackenhut. Riconosciuto revealed that part of his job in the modification of the soft- ware had been to create a “back door access” for spying into the files of its users. 2 These users included Great Britain, South Korea, Japan, Jordan, Canada, Israel, Egypt, Canada, and I raq—Bill Hamilton tallied the figur e at “ as many as eighty-eight countries”—for use in such activities as the tracking of terrorists. 3 According to Riconosciuto, A ttorney General Edwin Meese had provided PROMIS to Dr. Earl Brian and Peter Videnieks from the Department of Jus- tice, who had then super vised the Wackenhut/Cabazon project to copy the program. 4 Riconosciuto initially had been excited by the software. He told one inter- viewer: “...this package wor ked, OK? I mean it r eally and truly worked. And when I got my first copies of it and ran it up, I was dumbfounded. I have a sta- tistical exercising package where I can put computer software and/or hardware, and/or hardware/software systems through their paces, and I can determine at which point it will become unreliable...

Earl Brian had some backing, and he was going to buy out some well placed start-up companies that already had a running start, and then he was going to pump money and talent and the right connections into them, and make them go...” 5 Riconosciuto was not the only one to extol the vir tues of PROMIS. Harry Mar tin of the Napa Valley Sentinel , while editing sev eral defense publications, believed that an Israeli software package which he tested utilized PROMIS, and had the capability to “[deal] with the complete militar y structure, and who’s who and what ’s what. I mean, it ev en got do wn almost to the number of shoelaces: how many handguns—everything... It gets into numbers and details. And that’s what this software has this tremendous power to do.” 6 The theft of PROMIS, according to Riconosciuto, wasn’t all that was going on at the Cabaz on I ndian R eservation. The Cabaz on/Wackenhut v enture included the production of advanced weaponry, including biological weapons, and fuel-air explosives (FAX), a new technology supposedly the equal of some nuclear w eapons in explosiv e po wer. Riconosciuto claimed to hav e been involved in the production of the fuel-air explosives in collaboration with Ger- ald Bull of S pace Research Corporation, an arms dealer who designed the “supergun,” and was murdered in Brussels, Belgium in 1990. 7 Riconosciuto dropped additional bombshells on Hamilton. He maintained that M eese had pr ovided B rian with PR OMIS as a pay-off on a fav or. Riconosciuto made the dramatic allegation that William Casey, outside counsel to Wackenhut prior to his wor k in the Reagan administration, had hired him and Brian in 1980 to facilitate the now infamous “October Surprise,” in which the Reagan administration allegedly paid the I ranians not to release American hostages until after his election. Riconosciuto claimed that he and B rian had paid the I ranians forty million dollars in bribes. The PROMIS software, so Riconosciuto said, was Brian’s payment for his participation. 8 Riconosciuto also claimed that he had been instrumental in exposing the Nugan Hand bank scan- dal; that he had met “the Jackal,” the famed international terrorist; and that he had made a tape recording of a clandestine meeting with William Casey that he was holding as an “insurance policy” on his life. Could he be believed? At least some of what Riconosciuto said could be cor- roborated. The Cabazon-Wackenhut joint venture did exist from 1981 to 1983, and Riconosciuto was involved with it, at least in some capacity. 9 A report from a task force of the Riverside County, California Sheriff’s Office also placed Earl Brian (“with the CIA”) and Riconosciuto at a w eapons demonstration put on by the Cabazons and Wackenhut. 10 Amazingly, even Riconosciuto’s allegations about Brian’s involvement in the so-called October Surprise could also be verified, at least to a degree.

By late 1990, according to his friends, Casolaro spoke of little else. He immediately set about investigating this new informant’s background. What he learned only complicated the matter. 12 Casolaro discovered that Riconosciuto had been a gifted child whose science projects, including the construction of an argon laser, had enabled him to work as a research assistant to Dr. Arthur Schalow, the Nobel laureate. Other things in Riconosciuto’s past had a shadier aspect. After leaving S tanford University, Riconosciuto migrated to Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco, where he went to work on an undergr ound newspaper. Riconosciuto told Casolar o that he had acquired some photos that the ne wspaper had published which sho wed a nar- cotics agent having sex with an underage girl, and because of this the nar c had framed Riconosciuto on drug charges. In 1973 Riconosciuto was sent to prison for two years for manufacturing psychedelic drugs. Casolaro didn’t buy Riconosciuto’s statement that he was innocent of the drug charges.

On Mar ch 21, 1991 Michael Riconosciuto filed a sworn affidavit on the Inslaw case. He began by stating that US J ustice Department agent Peter Videnieks had threatened him if he cooperated with a House Judiciary Committee inves- tigation of Inslaw. 1 The following text of the affidavit pr ovides a toe-hold for Danny Casolaro’s research: I, M ICHAEL J. RICONOSCIUTO, being duly sworn, do hereby state as follows: 1. During the early 1980s, I served as the Director of Research for a joint venture between the Wackenhut corporation of Coral Gables, Florida, and the Cabazon Band of Indians of Indio, California. The joint venture was located on the Cabazon Reservation. 2. The Wackenhut-Cabazon joint venture sought to develop and/or man- ufacture certain materials that are used in military and national security operations, including night vision goggles, machine guns, fuel-air explo- sives, and biological and chemical warfare weapons. 3. The Cabazon Band of Indians are a sovereign nation. The sovereign immunity that is accorded the Cabazons as a consequence of this fact made it feasible to pursue on the reservation the development and/or manufacture of materials whose development or manufacture would be subject to stringent controls off the reservation. As a minority group, the Cabazon Indians also provided the Wackenhut Corporation with an enhanced ability to obtain federal contracts through the 8A Set Aside Pro- gram, and in connection with Government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities. 15 Chapter 4: “Danger Man” V"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16 THE OCTOPUS 4. The Wackenhut-Cabazon joint venture was intended to support the needs of a number of foreign governments and forces, including forces and gov- ernments in Central America and the Middle East. The contras in Nicaragua represented one of the most important priorities for the joint venture. 5. The Wackenhut-Cabazon joint venture maintained close liaison with certain elements of the United States Government, including representa- tives of intelligence, military and law enforcement agencies. 6. Among the frequent visitors to the Wackenhut-Cabazon joint venture we re P eter Videnieks of the US Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., and a close associate of Videnieks by the name of Earl W. Brian. Brian is a private businessman who lives in Maryland and who has maintained close business ties with the US intelligence community for many years. 7. In connection with my work for Wackenhut, I engaged in some soft- ware development and modification work in 1983 and 1984 on the proprietary PROMIS computer software product. The copy of PROMIS on which I worked came from the US Department of Justice. Earl W. Brian made it available to me through Wackenhut after acquiring it from Peter Videnieks, who was then a Department of Justice contracting official with responsibility for the PROMIS software. I performed the modifications to PROM IS in Indio, California; Silver Springs, Maryland; and Miami, Florida. 8. The purpose of the PROMIS software modifications that I made in 1983 and 1984 was to support a plan for the implementation of PROMIS in law enforcement and intelligence agencies worldwide. Earl W. Brian was spear- heading the plan for this worldwide use of the PROMIS computer software. 9. Some of the modifications that I made were specifically designed to facilitate the implementation of PROMIS within two agencies of the Gov- ernment of Canada; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS). Earl W. Brian would check with me from time to time to make certain that the work would be completed in time to satisfy the schedule for the RCMP and the CSIS implementations of PROMIS. 10. The proprietary version of PROMIS, as modified by me, was, in fact, implemented in both the RCMP and the CSIS in Canada. It was my under- standing that Earl W. Brian had sold this version of PROMIS to the Government of Canada. 11. In February 1991, I had a telephone conversation with Peter Videnieks, then still employed by the US Department of Justice. Videnieks attempt- ed during this telephone conversation to persuade me not to cooperate with an independent investigation of the government’s piracy of Inslaw’s proprietary PROMIS software being conducted by the Committee on the Judiciary of the US House of Representatives."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"17 “D ANGER M AN ” 12. Videnieks stated that I would be rewarded for a decision not to coop- erate with the House Judiciary Committee investigation. Videnieks forecasted an immediate and favorable resolution of a protracted child custody dispute being prosecuted against my wife by her former hus- band, if I were to decide not to cooperate with the House Judiciary Committee investigation. 13. Videnieks also outlined specific punishments that I could expect to receive from the US Department of Justice if I cooperated with the House Judiciary Committee’s investigation. 14. One punishment that Videnieks outlined was the future inclusion of me and my father in a criminal prosecution of certain business associates of mine in Orange County, California, in connection with the operation of a Savings and Loan institution in Orange County. By way of underscoring his power to influence such decisions at the US Department of Justice, Videnieks informed me of the indictment of these business associates prior to the time when that indictment was unsealed and made public. 15. Another punishment that Videnieks threatened against me if I cooper- ated with the House Judiciary committee is prosecution by the US Department of Justice for perjury. Videnieks warned me that credible wit- nesses would come forward to contradict any damaging claims that I made in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, and that I would subsequently be prosecuted for perjury by the US Department of Justice for my testimony before the House Judiciary Committee.

Ridgeway and Vaughan, p. 38."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Earl Brian Following the lead of Riconosciuto ’s revelations, Danny Casolaro took a long look at a man named Dr. Earl Brian. Riconosciuto claimed that this man, along with Peter Videnieks, had headed the alleged Wackenhut/Cabazon project to alter the PROMIS software. Casolaro eventually developed a dossier on Brian. Brian was a high-profile individual who had been a combat physician during the Vietnam War. He reportedly worked in an air support unit for the Operation Phoenix political assassination program, a well-known covert action program to wipe out the Viet Cong in Vietnam. After his return to the States, Brian became Secretary of Health and Welfare in California, under Governor Ronald Reagan. In 1974, Brian had r esigned his cabinet position to go into priv ate business, which Casolaro learned had allegedly included arms deals with the Shah of Iran. Brian’s company Xonics had been cited by the Security and Exchange Commis- sion for illegal commissions and for issuing press releases with bogus information meant to boost stock prices. Brian also was involved in a scandal involving the confiscation of computer tapes with the records of 70,000 California state w elfare files. These tapes were later discovered at the University of Southern California. After an unsuccessful campaign for a Senate seat, Brian joined the USC faculty. 1 During the Reagan administration, Brian served as an unpaid chairman of a Reagan task force on health car e cost reduction, reporting directly to Attorney General Ed Meese. Brian also served with Meese on a “pro-competition” com- mittee. 2 Fur ther associations of B rian and E d Meese had come out during Meese’s confirmation hearings, when Meese had admitted that his wife had bor- rowed $15,000 fr om an advisor , E dwin Thomas, to buy stock in B rian’s company. Meese had not listed the transaction in his financial disclosures. Brian headed Infotechnology, Inc., a powerful New York holding company which con- trolled UPI, the Financial News Network, and the Learning Channel. 3 If these connections led far afield from Inslaw, others dovetailed neatly. Hadron, Inc. was V 18"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"19 E ARL B RIAN also controlled by Brian. Hadron, Inc. had suddenly taken an affluent turn— after being $12 million in the r ed—upon Meese’s ascendancy to the office of Attorney General. The company now subsisted on government revenues, includ- ing a $40 million contract with the US Department of Justice. The name Hadron, Inc. rang a bell with Bill Hamilton. Hamilton eventual- ly realized that I nslaw’s difficulties may hav e begun as early as A pril 1983. Hamilton had been in his office when he received a telephone call from Dominic Laiti, the chairman of H adron, Inc. Hamilton recalled Laiti telling him that Hadron, Inc. was trying to corner the market on law enforcement software, and that “they had pur chased Simcon, a manufactur er of police depar tment soft- ware—and A cumedics, a company that pr ovides computer-based litigation support services for courts.” Now Laiti was offering to buy Inslaw from Hamil- ton in or der for H adron, Inc. to obtain the PR OMIS software. According to Hamilton, when he turned down the alleged offer, Laiti bragged of his powerful contacts in the Reagan administration, and told him “ we have ways of making you sell.” 4 Within 90 days of the date of the alleged Laiti call the deal betw een Inslaw and the Justice department began to unravel. 5 A little research also showed that Peter Videnieks, prior to o verseeing the PR OMIS contract for the J ustice Department in 1981, had been in charge of three contracts between the US Cus- toms Service and Hadron, Inc. 6 In light of the links betw een Earl Brian, Peter Videnieks, and H adron, Inc., suddenly D ominic Laiti’s “ways of making y ou sell” threat took on more substance. Many of Riconosciuto’s claims about Brian were backed up by information in the following March 21, 1991 affidavit filed on behalf of I nslaw by Ari Ben- Menasche. 7 I, ARI BEN-MENASHE, being duly sworn, do hereby state as follows: 1. Between August 1977 and September 1987, I was employed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)/Military Intelligence External Relations Department. 2. In my above capacity, I had contacts with the Office of the Israeli Prime Minister’s Anti-Terrorism Advisor. 3. In 1982, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Anti-Terrorism Advisor was Rafael Eitan. 4. In a meeting that took place in December 1982 in Mr. Eitan’s office in the Kirya in Tel Aviv, Israel, Mr. Eitan told me that he had received earlier that year in the United States, from Mr. Earl Brian and Mr. Robert McFarlane, PROM IS computer software for the limited use of the IDF’s Signals Intelli- gence Unit for intelligence purposes only.

As a special intel- ligence consultant to the I sraeli prime minister in 1989, B en-Menasche maintained that a Chilean arms manufactur er told him that he had been a go- between in Brian’s deal to sell PROMIS to Iraqi intelligence. Two years prior to that, according to Ben-Menasche, he attended a meeting in Tel Aviv where Brian claimed that the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency all used PROMIS, and then gave the software to Israeli intelligence. Even with this independent corroboration, Earl Brian continued to deny any connection with Riconosciuto and Ari B en-Menasche. He insisted that he had only read about Inslaw in the papers, although the company ’s founders contin- ued to insist that Brian’s company had tried to acquire it in 1983. 8 Then Richard Babayan, an Iranian arms dealer in prison awaiting trial on securities fraud, corroborated Ben-Menasche’s statements, connecting B rian to the sale of the software to Iraq and South Korea. In an affidavit dated March 22, 1991, Babayan swore: I, RICHARD H. BABAYAN, being duly sworn, do hereby state as follows: 1. During the past several years, I have acted as a broker of sales of mate- rials and equipment used by foreign governments in their armed forces, intelligence and security organizations. 2. In the capacity described in paragraph #1, I attended a meeting in Bagh- dad, Iraq, in October or November, 1987, with Mr. Abu Mohammed of Entezamat, an intelligence and security organ of the Government of Iraq. Mr. Abu Mohammed is a senior ranking official of Entezamat and a person with whom I had extensive dealings over the previous three years. 3. During the aforementioned meeting with Mr. Abu Mohammed, I was informed that Dr. Earl W. Brian of the United States had recently completed a sales presentation to the Government of Iraq regarding the PROMIS com- puter software. Furthermore, it is my understanding that others present at Dr. Brian’s PROMIS sales presentation were General Richard Secord, of the United States, and Mr. Abu Mohammed. 4. In early to mid-1988, in the course of subsequent visits to Baghdad, Iraq, I was informed that Dr. Earl W. Brian had, in fact, provided the PROMIS com- puter software to the Government of Iraq through a transaction that took place under the umbrella of Mr. Sarkis Saghanollan, an individual who has had extensive business dealings with the Government of Iraq since the late 1970s in the fields of military hardware and software. I was also informed that the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Government of Iraq acquired the PROMIS software for use primarily in intelli- gence services, and secondarily in police and law enforcement agencies. 5. During the course of the visits described in paragraph #4, I also learned from Mr. Abu Mohammed that the Government of Libya had acquired the PROM IS computer software prior to its acquisition by the Government of Iraq; that the Government of Libya had by then made extensive use of PROMI S, and that the Government of Libya was highly recommending the PROM IS software to other countries. I was informed that the high quality of the reference for the PROMIS software from the Government of Libya was one of the principle reasons for the decision of the Government of Iraq to acquire PROMIS. 6. In the capacity described in paragraph #1, I attended a meeting in early 1988 in Singapore with Mr. Y.H. Nam of the Korea Development Corporation. 7. T he Korea Development Corporation is known to be a cutout for the Kore- an Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA). 8. I learned from Mr. Y.H.

Further inves- tigation by Coleman revealed that these were bootleg copies of PROMIS, “made without the knowledge of Inslaw, to which a ‘backdoor ’ software routine had been added. No matter how securely the front door might be barred with entry codes and passwor ds, American operators, holding the key to the secr et back door, could break into the PROMIS systems operated by Cyprus, Egypt, Syria, Pakistan, Turkey, Kuwait, Israel, Jordan, Iran and I raq whenever they wished, access the data stored there and get out again without arousing the slightest sus- picion that the security of those systems had been breached...” 9 In 1992, Ari B en-Menasche published a memoir of his car eer in interna- tional arms trading called Profi ts of War . In it, he explained his understanding of William Hamilton’s NSA background in establishing spy posts against the North in Vietnam, where he computerized a Vietnamese-English dictionary and began developing early versions of PROMIS, according to Ben-Menashe. 10 “The pro- gram he was developing would have the ability to track the mo vements of vast numbers of people ar ound the world. D issidents or citizens who needed to be kept under watch would be har d put to move freely again without Big Brother keeping an eye on their activities.” 11 Elaborating on his sworn statement, B en- Menasche explained that some officials wor king for the Reagan administration had hoped to use the Israelis to sell PROMIS to intelligence and police agencies throughout the world. Ben-Menasche quoted RafiEitan, the anti-terrorism advi- sor to the I sraeli PM mentioned in the affidavit, as saying “ We can use this program to stamp out terrorism by keeping track of everyone. But not only that, we can find out what our enemies know, too.” 12 Ben-Menashe also gav e some description of ho w he envisioned the PROMIS software might work: “Using a modem, the spy network would then tap into the computers of such ser vices as the telephone company , the water board, other utility commissions, credit card companies, etc. PROMIS would then search for specific information. For example, if a person suddenly started using more water and mor e electricity and making mor e phone calls than usual, it might be suspected he had guests staying with him. PR OMIS would then start searching for the records of his friends and associates, and if it was found that one had stopped using electricity and water , it might be assumed, based on other records stored in PROMIS, that the missing person was staying with the subject of the inv estigation. This would be enough to hav e him watched...” B en-Menashe also detailed PR OMIS’ notorious “back door ,” which allowed Israeli access, via modem and coded passwor ds, to the files of any foreign intelligence service using PROMIS."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Details about ho w PROMIS works, why it made such a priz e for Earl Brian, were and remain sparse and vague. In a newsletter produced as part of a database on intelligence literature and personalities called Namebase , author Daniel Brandt argues that Ben-Menashe’s chapter on PROMIS compromised an other wise “frequently believ able” book and should hav e been deleted. Brandt states that “a ‘back door’ to get around password protection is easy for any programmer,” 13 and it explained why the intelligence community might be interested in peddling it to for eign governments. “Please note, however, that you still need physical access to the computer, either through a direct-connect terminal or a r emote terminal through the phone lines, in or der to utilize a back door. Ari Ben-Menashe wants us to believe that foreigners allow techni- cians from another countr y to install ne w computer systems in the hear t of their intelligence establishments, and don’t even think to secure physical access to the system before they start entering their precious data. “Then he claims that PR OMIS ... can suck in ev ery other database on earth, such as those used b y utility companies, and correlate everything auto- matically...I don’t like to see whistleblo wers like B en-Menashe needlessly discredited by their own high-tech gullibility.” 14 One person who might hav e had a vie w of ho w PROMIS works was Charles Hayes. Newspapers identified H ayes as a salv age dealer in P ulaski County, Kentucky, near the temporary home of Ari B en-Menashe in Lexing- ton, who pur chased $45 wor th of surplus computer equipment fr om the government in July 1990. The equipment included 13 terminals, nine print- ers, two car tridge module driv es, 19 backup car tridges and two central memory units—equipment that had been used b y the US A ttorney’s office since 1983 to maintain information via PR OMIS on the witness pr otection program, informants, office emplo yees, and outstanding grand jur y cases. In August, when federal officials discovered that a weak magnetic screwdriver had failed to purge this information fr om the equipment adequately , two FBI agents dispatched to make inquiries of H ayes were kicked out. 15 Three days later, Hayes began to cooperate with the US A ttorney’s office, denied that he had possession of any information that might hav e been on the equipment, and invited an inspection. Inspectors discovered that the serial numbers of the two cartridge modules that H ayes claimed were the ones he bought did not match the numbers of the modules the J ustice Department had sold. 16 Hayes then claimed he had sold the modules, but did not name the pur chasers until after federal officials filed a lawsuit. 17 Justice D epartment attorneys later claimed that Hayes had indeed tried to sell the secret information to an under- cover informant, but criminal charges w ere never filed. 18 The case led to a 24 THE OCTOPUS"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"25 E ARL B RIAN congressional investigation of computer security; the Justice Department now tosses rather than sells its extra data storage devices. Even Bill Hamilton did not have a firm grasp on the workings of the full, modified PROMIS system. In a 1992 inter view, he maintained that it could run on “ any UNIX machine, H ewlett Packard UNIX, RISC 6000, A T&T, AS400 under its own operating system and on mainframes under MVS,” that it was comprised of 88 pr ogram modules and that the sour ce code—replete with the Inslaw name throughout the code commentar y— was kept b y any government that had it. When asked how a foreign country could modify the source code without discovering the back door, Hamilton was cryptic: “I don’t know what’s meant by the back door. What we’ve been told is that not only the software was sold, but computers with extra chips...What the chips do, w e’ve been told, the extra chips, is to broadcast the data inside PROMIS to satellites owned by the NSA ... but w e don’t know enough about it as they ’ve never shared anything with us.” 19 This possibility neatly b ypasses objections that physical access is required for a back door to work. Ari B en-Menashe claimed that Earl B rian’s company H adron sold PROMIS to Jordan as a test for the back door . Hadron technicians installed PROMIS for Jordanian intelligence in Amman, connecting it also to the com- puters of the city’s public utilities, IBMs sold to Jordan in the late 1970s. From a small apar tment in Amman, a M ossad-connected importer/exporter used PROMIS “to find out everything about everybody—as well as to tap into Jor- dan’s military secrets,” downloading it all to disks and passing it on to his contacts whenever he left the country. With the help of Wackenhut and the Cabaz ons, accor ding to B en- Menashe, the US developed its own version of the back-door and the US and Israel began looking for a neutral company through which it could sell the pro- gram to for eign intelligence ser vices. The company chosen for the task was Degem, a computer firm with offices in I srael, Guatemala and the S outh African Bantustan homeland. It had been taken over for the purpose by Robert Maxwell, the publishing mogul who drowned under mysterious circumstances in 1991. 20 Through M axwell’s D egem, wor king in tandem with B rian’s Hadron, the software found a home with the militar y regime in Guatemala, where it tracked leftist insurgents. “E ven if they traveled under a false name, various characteristics, such as height, hair color , age, were fed into r oadside terminals and PROMIS searched through its database looking for a common denominator. It would be able to tell an army commander that a certain dissi- dent who was in the nor th three days before had caught a train, then a bus, stayed at a friend ’s house, and was no w on the r oad under a differ ent name. That’s how frightening the system was.” According to Ben-Menashe, PROMIS"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"was used in South Africa to track and squelch the organizers of a strike among the black coal miners via their mandator y identity car ds. 21 Degem also sold PROMIS to the Soviet Union and the system was utilized by its GRU intelli- gence service at least until the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev. 22 Ben-Menashe had one more footnote to add to the PR OMIS story in his memoir. He claimed that because of Inslaw, an attorney, Leigh Ratiner of the Washington law firm Dickstein and Shapiro, was forced into early retirement in an agreement that forbade him to practice law for five years. This happened shortly after Ratiner began representing Inslaw for the firm. According to Ben- Menashe, this also happened after Dickstein and Shapiro received a $600,000 transfer from a CIA-Israeli slush fund for the purpose of getting Ratiner off the case, via Earl Brian. 23 ———— 1.

Earl B rian’s role in the PR OMIS theft was spelled out explicitly b y Inslaw lawyer Elliot Richardson in the New York Times in 1992. Richardson was the attorney general who actually stood up to Richard Nixon’s corruption during the Saturday Night massacre. Brian sued over the New York Times article and lost. Richardson had written the article to encourage investigation of the case, but B rian used the oppor tunity to star t a nuisance libel suit. O n Nov ember 29, 1995, the New York Court of Appeals dismissed Brian’s claim and declared that Richardson’s assertions came under free speech protections. Although never prosecuted over the PROMIS allegations, Brian survived only one more year after the libel suit befor e other past shady deals began to catch up with him. I n October 1996 a California jury convicted him of Federal bank fraud, conspiracy and lying to auditors.

In March 1969 the National Police Evaluation System went on line, recording ‘police assignment data’ for analysis and ‘counter-measures.’” In 1970 Big Mack’s bilingual r eplacement, the B ig Mack Special Collection Program, shifted the bur den of reporting and accountability to the RVN Territorial Intelligence System. In January 1970 the VCI Neutralization I nformation S ystem was inaugurated to r ecord all anti-V CI operations. The National Police Criminal Information System (NPCIS) was implemented in A pril 1970 to track VCI who w ere held bey ond ‘statutory limitations.’ Designed to ‘inter face’ with a Chieu H oi [amnesty program] ‘tracking system,’ which aided province security committees in the ‘post-appre- hension monitoring of released VCI,’ NPCIS was also compatible with the VCI Neutralization and Identification System, which stored in its classified files ‘ a history of the VCI member from the time of his identification to his neutralization.’” Phoenix program police system upgrades happened at r oughly the same time that the S t.

Maxwell’s body was found floating in the ocean near his yacht, the Lady G hislaine, off the Canary Islands on November 5, 1991. He had not been seen for hours preceding his death. These types of rumors, of connections to Mossad and other international spy groups, had long circulat- ed about M axwell, and his publishing empir e’s finances had come under official r eview. Never theless, Spanish authorities concluded that Maxwell died of a heart attack, although he had no history of hear t disease. Maxwell’s daughter Ghislaine said the family was satisfied with the investigation, but his sons, widows and lawyers insisted that the death was accidental, perhaps with an eye toward Maxwell’s $35.8 million insurance against accidental death. (“Maxwell’s Mysterious Death Raises More Questions,” MIN Media Industry Newsletter , No. 47, Vol. 44, November 25, 1991.) One of the forensic specialists who worked on the autopsy later noted that a perforation under Maxwell’s left ear could hav e been caused by an injection of a lethal substance. Labor P arty MP George Galloway openly speculated in the British House of Commons that Maxwell was murdered because “dead men tell no tales.” Britain’s PM John Major was even moved to deny publicly that British intelligence was investigating Maxwell’s finances after his death. By 1995, however, Britain’s Serious Fraud Office had spent $13.9 million tracing M axwell’s web of o ver 400 companies (Reuters, 2/15/95), resulting in charges against M axwell’s financial advisors, Larr y Trachtenberg and Robert Bunn, and his two sons, Ian and Kevin, for defrauding pensioners. A second charge of conspiring with his father was br ought against Kevin Maxwell, age 36. The charge claimed that months before the elder Maxwell’s death, he and his son used other pension assets and shar es in another Israeli company, Scitex Corporation, to illegally raise money for other Maxwell companies (Reuters, 5/26/95). The collapse of Maxwell’s empire—which ultimately led to son K evin stand- ing in the unemployment line and widow Elisabeth unsuccessfully fishing for a publisher to handle her memoir—began well before he died, lending credence to the suicide theory. 20.

F rom the theft of the PR OMIS software, the trail led to the October Surprise, to Ed Meese and Earl Brian, to the Cabazon reservation and to points bey ond. The connections kept multiplying. Casolar o made plans to visit the reservation, but never did. 1 The Cabazon tribe has only thirty members, making it one of the countr y’s smallest tribes. I ts desolate, thr ee-and-a-half mile deser t reservation is located near Indio, California, in the Coachella Valley outside of Los Angeles, to the Salton Sea’s north. The tribe was as destitute as the land it owned until the arrival from Florida in 1978 of D r. John P. Nichols, a white-haired and bearded Burl Ives lookalike. By the early 1980s, Nichols had transformed the Cabazon land- scape into an enormous casino operation, replete with a power plant and housing developments. It became a center for international business, par ticularly in the weapons and security trade. I n his notes, Casolar o calls J ohn Philip Nichols “flaky—beyond a reasonable scope of achiev ement.” He also calls him “ a dan- gerous man.” Nichols had been described by others variously as a charlatan and a spook, but a man with an ob vious talent for writing successful grants. A Cabazon chairman, Art Welmus, described the tribe’s predicament when Nichols came on the scene: “ When you don’t have nothing and y ou can’t get grants, you’re last on the totem pole. Where can you get a star t?” 2 After Nichols had taken control, Welman remarked, “It’s all contr olled by outside for ces. These poor Indians are brainwashed. They don’t want to lose the money they ’re get- ting.” 3 The origins of grantsman N ichols’ Svengali-like hold o ver the Cabaz ons remain as obscure as the job history on his résumé.

Other jobs listed on Nichols’ résumé includ- ed stints as a M ilwaukee brewer and labor organiz er, a mental health pr ogram director in K entucky, Wisconsin and M ichigan, and manager of a Coca-Cola plant in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The résumé included a number of falsifications and items conveniently left out. A ccording to his claimed alma mater , the Philatea Theological S eminary of the F ree Protestant Episcopal Chur ch in London, Ontario, Nichols never earned a doctorate in theology. As a labor organizer, he had been arrested for mishandling union funds and was later picked up on a fugi- tive warrant. Other facets of Nichols’ life also resisted a narrow reading of his background in “socio-health and economic-development planning.” Although he left the bot- tling plant after a year, Nichols spent ten more years in Chile, Bolivia, and Brazil. Although he play ed a significant r ole in organizing two million M arxist and Catholic voters into the leftist Chilean E vangelical Church, 4 he later bragged about his involvement in the murder of democratically-elected President Carlos Allende, as well as the attempted murder of Castro, under the orders of the CIA. 5 Later, Nichols denied that he ever made such statements. He characterized him- self as “a simple social worker.” Nichols also worked at one time as business par tners with G. Wayne Reeder, an alleged CIA operative. Reeder was partners with Neal Bush, brother of George W. B ush, and defaulted on o ver fourteen million dollars debt to the failed S il- verado Savings and Loan and San Marino Savings and Loan companies. During their association, R eeder was one of many people who pr ovided Nichols the commodity he needed to succeed as a grantsman: contacts. Among many others, Uganda’s Idi Amin and Chilean president Eduardo Frei made the list, and police reports indicated that Nichols had business contacts in sixteen foreign countries. 6 Whatever Nichols was, social wor ker, big money shmooz er or something else, he quickly took o ver the management of the Cabaz on tribe and began building his empire in the desert. Benefits accrued to an operation based on Indi- an lands. The sovereign status of I ndian lands grants cer tain advantages to investors, including tax advantages, relative freedom from government scrutiny, and the b ypassing of legal r egulations—such as envir onmental impact state- ments—which would be r equired on non-r eservation lands. O ne of the first schemes Nichols put into action was the mail or der sale of tax-fr ee cigarettes from the reservation. This operation employed about ten Cabazon Indians in a non-air conditioned trailer . The Indians reportedly made about one hundr ed dollars a week for their work. The cigarette sales succeeded, and within two years"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"the tribe branched out into the sale of tax-fr ee liquor. The state of California stepped in this time, however, and sued and won for unpaid tax es on the liquor. From available records, it appears the back tax es were never paid. S imilarly, Nichols’ plans for a telethon, an Indian Olympics, the processing of coal and the importations of gold, and the dev elopment of a pharmaceutical firm all fell through—rankling tribal members, who charged that N ichols had manipulated tribal factions and brought in non-Cabazons to vote on these operations. 7 Nichols had bigger plans. I n 1979 he put together the arms-manufacturing par tnership between the Cabaz on tribe and the Wackenhut Corporation, called Cabaz on Arms. Wackenhut remains one of the world ’s largest private security operations and the thir d largest priv ate prison contractor in the U nited States. Among numerous other operations, Wackenhut has supplied guar ds for US embassies worldwide, security for nuclear installations and test sites in the U nited States, and security-related enterprises in thirty nine countries around the world. Wackenhut is a private detective agency founded in 1954 by former FBI man George Wackenhut and three ex-FBI friends in Miami, a hotbed of rightist polit- ical activity at the time. G eorge Wackenhut had impor tant political connections—Florida go vernor Claude Kir k and S enator G eorge S mathers among them—and shared a predilection with J. Edgar Hoover for acquiring files on people. H is connections helped build his agency into a po werful private police force with huge government contracts. Senator Smather’s law firm hired guards from a Wackenhut subsidiary to work nuclear bomb test sites in Nevada and Cape Canaveral, a workaround to the federal law forbidding priv ate detec- tives from working for the government.

Inv estigator John Connolly noted that “B y 1965, Wackenhut was boasting to potential investors that the company maintained files on two and a half million suspected dissidents—one in for ty-six American adults then living. I n 1966, after acquiring the priv ate files of Karl B arslaag, a former staff member of the House Committee on U n-American Activities, Wackenhut could confidently maintain that with mor e than four million names, it had the largest priv ately held file on suspected dissidents in America.” 8 By then, almost half of Wackenhut’s executive staff were former FBI mem- bers, two of whom had been senior officers of the division in charge of domestic intelligence. Current and past members of the Wackenhut board of dir ectors included former CIA D eputy Director Frank Carlucci, former D eputy CIA Dir ector Bobby Inman, former CIA Director Admiral William Raborn, and for- mer FBI Director Clarence Kelly.

And Videnieks’ job, as contracting officer, was to deal with industry.” 9 To assist in the administration of Cabaz on Arms, J ohn P hilip N ichols recruited Peter Zokosky, husband to the Mayor of Indio and the previous head of an ammunitions manufacturing company called Armtech. Under the impres- sion that Nichols intended to star t a similar arms manufacturing operation on the Cabazon land, Zokosky soon discovered himself “involved with drug dealers, schemers, contras and murderers.” 10 In 1981, Nichols, Zokosky, and A. Robert Frye, a vice president of Wacken- hut, trav elled to Q uebec in an attempted $18 million dollar pur chase of Valleyfield Chemical Products Corporation, a weapons propellant manufacturer. The deal went bust due to Canadian government objections. The trio then went to Indiana, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C., setting up the manufacturing of combustible cartridge cases and thr ee hundred pairs of night vision goggles.

In 1982, Fred Alvarez, a Cabazon tribal leader, and two companions, w ere found murdered on the Indio reservation. Alvarez had been critical of N ichols’ and Wackenhut’s dealings with the Cabaz on tribe, 12 and he had mentioned to friends that he had received death threats. Investigative reporter Virginia McCul- lough later came to believ e that Alvarez had discovered that monies rightfully belonging to the Indians were being embezzled by the partnership called Bingo Palace Inc. 13 Alvarez knew what he was getting into, ho wever. He had told the Indio Daily News , “My life is on the line. There are people out there [on the reser- vation] that want to kill me.” According to Riconosciuto, “Alvarez was present at all the meetings, and he was gung-ho behind Nichols, and everything that was going on ther e. OK? We were all red-blooded Americans, and we believed in the things that were going on! The way things w ere shaping up with the R eagan Election Committee and the things that were being orchestrated made us all concerned.

I mean, in specifics.” 34 THE OCTOPUS"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"35 I NDIO Linda Streeter-Dukic, Alvarez’ sister, described early relations of Alvarez and the inner circle around Nichols as being amicable, but said that when he started objecting to some of the schemes coming down from Nichols and the other tribe leaders, they began to send him on business trips. O ne trip was to D enver, in June 1981, to attend a confer ence. Streeter says that, while in D enver, Alvarez was offered a large amount of money to carr y drugs back to I ndio, but had turned the offer down. “When he got off the plane,” she said, “ the police grabbed him, threw him spread-eagle against a car and searched him and his bags.” Alvarez’s mother said that only Nichols and his son were aware of Alvarez’s trip to Denver. 14 On the morning of July 1, 1981, a meeting was scheduled by Alvarez with attor- ney and former Cabaz on chairman Joe Benitez. The intended topic of discussion was how to oust Cabazon control from Nichols. When Benitez arrived at Alvarez’s home in Rancho Mirage he found Fred Alvarez shot through the head as he sat in a chair. Alvarez’s girlfriend and another friend were also nearby, shot dead. 15 16 The murder of Alv arez and his friends took place during a period when Nichols, Zokosky, and a Wackenhut associate named Bob F rye were travelling around the country on munitions business. Zokosky told reporter John Connol- ly, “I felt like they w ere stalling. We had no meetings scheduled.” 17 Zokosky returned to Indio, and the following day the bodies of Alvarez and his compan- ions were found. The day after that, Nichols returned to Indio. When Zokosky told Nichols about the mur ders, “Nichols seemed unaffected, like he alr eady knew.” Zokosky stated that Nichols, “... dialed a number and asked for Bob Frye. ‘Alvarez has been mur dered,’ he said into the phone a fe w seconds later. After another few seconds, Nichols said, ‘Okay, so long,’ and hung up.” 18 The investigation of the deaths by the police was slipshod and hurried. Police familiar with the case note the friendship of N ichols with one of the investigat- ing detectives. One police investigator believed he was r emoved from the case because of pressure put on his superiors from the outside. When the investigator pursued further on his o wn, he r eceived death thr eats, one fr om a cr ossbow- wielding man. Fearing for his family, the man gave up and moved out of town. 19 In any case, the investigation languished until the appearance of Jimmy Hughes. Hughes had been N ichols’ Wackenhut bodyguard, and he r eported to I ndio police officials that he was Nichols’ bagman for the murders of Fred Alvarez and his friends. Hughes described Nichols and two of his sons, Mark and John Paul, as having doled out $5,000 in cash in fr ont of him, with or ders to deliver the money to two men in the nearby town of Idyllwild. Hughes stated that, “Nichols admitted to me the or dering of the Alvarez murder. He stated there was a US- government co vert action... P ressures fr om unkno wn Washington, D.C. government agencies have caused a possible shutdown of this case.” 20"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"According to H ughes, the mur derers included sev eral ex-G reen B erets employed as firemen in Chicago. Hughes went into hiding in Sonoma and Lake counties after the murders, under the protection of the Riverside county District Attorney’s office and the California D epartment of J ustice. The FBI offer ed Hughes protection under a witness protection program, but he turned it down, fearing “Nichols has made a deal with the FBI thr ough the Wackenhut Corpo- ration. Possibly ... he himself has been pr otected by the FBI.” 21 Hughes also stated that the Alvarez investigation had been interfered with by “an agency out of Washington, D.C.” Offering no other specifics, he said, “ The FBI is small potatoes compared to the agency.” NAPA Sentinel editor Harry Martin detailed curiosities about the investiga- tion that followed Hughes’ revelations: “The chief investigator for the Riverside County District Attorney’s Office was later taken off the case and transferred to the Juvenile division and then giv en early retirement. Shortly after his r etire- ment, the DA investigator states that he was pulled off the r oad one day by a CIA agent and told to forget all about the ‘ desert’ if he wanted to enjo y his retirement.” 22 After Jimmy Hughes came for ward with information he left the countr y, reportedly traveling to Guatemala. Hughes was said to be in possession of doc- umentation linking the men at Cabaz on to a hit list of political targets including Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, who was mur dered in 1986; Israeli intelligence agent Amiran Nir, who died in a mysterious plane crash; and Cyr us Hashemi, a key player in the events of October Surprise, also murdered in 1986. The expansion of Cabaz on enterprises continued after the mur der of Alvarez. In 1983 the Department of Defense gave the Cabazons authorization to manufacture weaponry. At that time Nichols also engaged in discussions with Stormont Laboratories, a genetics lab, about the possibility of manufacturing a bio-weapons detector. In March 1983, a casino and bingo parlor appear ed on the reservation—visible on the left side of H ighway 10 driving in to P alm Springs. Part of the funding for the bingo parlor came fr om a $90,000 HUD grant, given ostensibly to the Cabazons for the construction of a museum. In 1983, the Cabazons contacted La F rance Specialties, another weapons manufacturer, to seek assistance in building a w eapons factory on the I ndian lands. A letter to La France said that the weapons intended to be manufactured included assault rifles with laser sights, sniper rifles with one mile-plus range, 9mm machine pistols, rocket systems, night vision scopes, and battle commu- nications systems. 23 Danny Casolaro focused on the most grisly of the Cabazon murders in his notes, that of Riconosciuto associate P aul Morasca: “In 1982, the body of 36 THE OCTOPUS"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"37 I NDIO thirty-y ear-old Paul Morasca was found hog-tied and fatally strangled in his condominium on San Francisco’s Telegraph Hill. Morasca, who had been work- ing among the Cabazon Arms confidantes, reportedly had the access codes for offshore accounts containing hundr eds of millions of dollars in dr ug money ostensibly for covert operations.” 24 Michael Riconosciuto said of Morasca’s death, “And then my associate Paul Morasca was found murdered. I was the one who found him. And Nichols and others tried to keep me away from our condominium office in San Francisco. It was suspicious to me. And after almost four teen days of not seeing Paul—and then a day after he missed a critical meeting that ther e’s no way he would have missed—that’s when I went looking for him. And Nichols tried to get me down to the desert on an emergency basis to work on some project so that I’d be oth- erwise occupied. And I said that I’d be down there as soon as I found out what happened to Paul. And he was r eally pushy and r eally stressed out. When he came across to me on this, it made me even more suspicious. And other people that I talked to tried to dissuade me, and it was just not normal, the amount of pressure and emphasis they were putting on this situation. I knew in my gut ... Paul was dead! He’d been slowly strangled to death.” 25 Three days after Paul Morasca’s murder, a woman named Mary Quick— 63 years old, a school teacher and Women’s Auxiliary president of Fresno’s American Legion—was headed toward Legion Post 509 when she was killed by a single gunshot to the head in an appar ently unrelated mugging. A year after the murder, however, police learned that Riconosciuto claimed a busi- ness association with Mary Quick’s nephew, Brian Weiss. Police sources told the San Francisco Examiner that Weiss gave his aunt a bank car d with secret account numbers, perhaps the same access codes that may hav e led to P aul Morasca’s murder. According to the police, “She had no connection (to any of the principals) and could be trusted. Mary Quick was to be instructed to give information only to P aul (Morasca) or M ichael Riconosciuto. She was not aware of what the computer car d was for and had nev er received the card.” Riconosciuto claimed that M ary Quick’s murderers were probably trying to recover the card. 26 After the death of his wife, John Philip Nichols became involved with a twen- ty-seven-year-old heroin addict. Nichols attempted to hir e a hitman to kill his girlfriend’s alleged suppliers, but made the mistake of soliciting the hit thr ough a police informant. On tape Nichols can be heard saying, “I’ll pay five hundred and five hundred,” for two murders. Nichols also made clear that there would be addi- tional work for the proposed hitman: “I need some work done in Latin America. I do a lot of business do wn there.” Nichols proposed that the murderer move to Las Vegas, and “not freelance, but work out a guaranteed income.”"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"In J anuary of 1985 John P. Nichols was arrested on charges of soliciting the murder of five persons. The case never came to trial. Nichols pleaded no contest and was sentenced to prison for four y ears, although he ser ved only nineteen months. The felony conviction forced Nichols’ official removal from his job run- ning the Cabaz on reservation. The elder Nichols continued as “ mental health counselor” to employees and the Indians on the reservation, however, while his son, John Paul Nichols, became tribal administrator. A thirty thousand square foot casino and bingo hall were soon under construction, and a deal was cut with Colmac Corporation to construct a $150 million power generating plant on the reservation. Other business dealings b y the Cabazon tribe included plans for a thirteen hundred luxury housing pr oject to take adv antage of HUD funding, and an industrial incinerator for medical wastes. Both pr oposals would hav e taken advantage of the fact that environmental impact statements would not be required because of the land ’s so vereign status—a legalism pointed out b y Michael Riconosciuto in his affidavit of March 21, 1991. An extensive Southern California Edison electrical facility has also been developed on Cabazon land. 27 In 1990, control of the Cabazon reservation was turned over to John Paul’s younger brother, Mark. Mark had served six months in jail in F lorida for pos- session and sale of cocaine and LSD in 1978. Also in 1990, a pari-mutuel offtrack betting parlor was opened, courtesy of a grant from HUD. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 made the practice of I ndians opening betting parlors and casinos commonplace b y the early 1990s. I n fact, the act allo wed tribes like the Cabazons to buy property outside the reservation but regulate it under the same rules of sovereignty that protected the industrial incinerator and Riconosciuto’s manufacture of chemical weapons from federal control, creating great potential growth for such enterprises. 28 Casolaro began looking into illegal operations connected to other Indian reser- vations in the United States. He found connections to the Papago Indian reservation and the alleged shipment of drugs by the CIA and the criminal underground. In his notes on Cabazon, Casolaro remarked: “Guns to Iraq—Missiles to Iran—Dope— for money” with arrows showing that dope money funds the above. 29 Casolaro had a har d time trying to come up with a title for his unfolding story. He listed several alternates for his manuscript: “On the Trail of the Mon- eycatchers,” “On the Trail of an Unlikely Alliance,” “On the Trail of an Alliance Gone Awry,” “Rogue Spies, Big Oil, Organized Crime and Secret Empires,” and the prophetic “Death of the Poet.” Each suggested some connection to what he had learned in his research on the Cabazons, struck as he was with its importance to the Inslaw case.

He didn’t realize at the time, but he was describing a part of the interlinking cabal he would later call “ The Octopus.” The following excerpt is from the book proposal. Behold, a Pale Horse will be a haunting odyssey that depicts a manifesto of deceit, decisions of conscience, good and evil, intrigue and betrayal. John Philip Nichols found his promised land just north of Mexicali on the wild grasses above the Salton Sea. He was sixty-years-old then and the Cabazon Indian reservation on the edge of Sonora was an ideal place for him to nurse his secret self. This is vast desert emptiness where the yucca reaches nearly forty feet high, where the Mormons saw it as a symbol pointing to the promised land and they called it the Joshua Tree. But the Joshua Tree is an ugly, unsymmetrical lily with burly arms crooked at the elbow and it points everywhere, not unlike John Philip Nichols, as if asking itself “what shall I do next?” There is a point on the ridge of the Little San Bernardino mountains known as Salton View where you are more than five thousand feet above the desert and where, to the north, you can see the great escarpment of Mount San Jacinto and, to the south, the man-made Salton Sea, the orchards of the Coachella valley and, on a clear day, old Mexico. It is always clear in Indio and with the clarity of the warbler in the cotton- wo od grove, John Philip Nichols knew that he could bring his box office charity and all his earthly possessions into the reservation of the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians. With no more than two dozen Indians and nearly"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"42 THE OCTOPUS two thousand acres of desert solitaire, cactus and cotton grove, the Cabazon reservation was a suitable home for gambling, dope, dirty money and gun running and all the fugitive visions that line the edge of oppression. John Philip Nichols didn’t howl under twelve full moons before the gambling was underway and, in the desert night, people flocked from all over to Indio Bingo and to the poker casino at the fork of Highway 10 and Highway 86. Under a major corporation’s umbrella subsidiary, later to be named Cabazon Arms, the gun runners and the money traders soon arrived, the weapon makers and the generals from Babylon, contra resuppliers, covert operatives from both the East and West and, in what one source calls “a marriage of necessity,” the dope dealers, the mobsters and the murderers. Whatever John Philip Nichols saw in the dark cathedral of those desert nights in silence and certainty cracked and came unglued. After a number of still-unsolved execution-style murders and solicitation-for-murder charge for which he was jailed, the dark vision of John Philip Nichols eroded. Although he’s been released from a short stint in prison, he’s a one-eyed Jack now since only Indio Bingo gambling—managed by his sons, the Las Vegas-managed poker casino, the Indians and the most formidable crea- tures of the desert remain. Sev eral of the Cabazon Arms associates during the 1980s are coming out of the shadows to take top billing for the actual par ticipation in the multi-million dollar laundered payment to the Iranians to delay the release of the hostages, in shutting down the dope and dir ty money schemes of N ugan Hand and resur- facing its activities, in assisting G erald Bull in the refinements and distribution of his weapon arsenal including his S uper Gun and in the dev elopment of the Fuel Air Explosive technologies—thought to be responsible for the Beirut bomb which killed two hundred forty-one US servicemen. An international cabal whose services cover parochial political intrigue, espi- onage, the trade of w eapon technologies, bioto xins, drug trafficking, money laundering and murder has emerged from an isolated desert Indian reservation just north of Mexicali. While this cabal continues, its origins were spawned thir- ty years ago in the shadow of the Cold War. In recent months, however, several of its members hav e gratuitously taken cr edit for the purposeful delay of the release of the hostages until after the 1980 election, scuttling and r esettling the schemes of the Australian-based Nugan Hand bank, their involvement with Ger- ald B ull, assassinated last spring in B russels and the dev elopment and distribution of fuel air explosive technologies."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Chapter 8: Wild Rumors V 43 The facts that Danny investigated astounded him, but the r umors were out of this world, some of them quite literally. Rumor had it, for instance, that the Cabaz ons belonged to worldwide “Reservation Operations” run on Indian lands by the “Enterprise” and Wacken- hut under the project name “Yellow Lodge.” 1 Yellow Lodge allegedly produced advanced warfare projects, including parthenogenic viruses co-engineered with Stormont Labs in Woodland, California. Stormont Labs later acknowledged that it had discussions with Wackenhut concerning biological weapons. 2 Yellow Lodge ran operations on Jicarilla Apache lands and other Indian reser- vations, including a center called “D6” located in D ulce, New Mexico. Danny learned that some UFO enthusiasts identify this location as the site of a huge underground joint human/alien base. O thers believe the alien base to be go v- ernment disinformation intended to confuse the r eal natur e of the D ulce operation. 3 In his notes D anny mentions “MJ 12—extraterr estrial,” alleged b y the more excitable end of the UFO research spectrum to be a super-secret US mil- itary group charged with signing a non-aggression pact with space aliens. 4 He also mentions “Area #51,” and “P ine Gap.” Area 51 is a militar y test site in Nev ada for advanced aerial weaponry. Although only through a recent job-haz- ards lawsuit has the Air Force begun to admit to the existence of the base, Area 51 has long been known as the staging ground for the U2 spy plane, the SR17 Blackbird, and is much-rumored as the home of the post-Stealth marvel called the Aurora. In 1989, a man named Bob Lazar went public with claims that he had worked at Area 51, taking apart and reverse-engineering alien space craft. Although even UFO skeptics ackno wledge some consistencies in Lazar ’s sto- ries, his efforts at documenting his credentials and work history have met with some doubt. 5"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"44 THE OCTOPUS Pine Gap is the top secr et underground American base located near Alice Springs in Australia, officially known as the Joint Defense Space Research Facil- ity. 6 Pine Gap allegedly serves as the central American base for the monitoring of spy satellites and interception and decoding of various forms of broadcast com- munications between foreign powers unfriendly to the US. P ine Gap was built in 1968, ostensibly as a means of sharing space pr ogram data with the A us- tralians. Opposition to the base gr ew as it became clear er that it had a mor e prosaic purpose—espionage. I n his 1987 book The Crimes of P atriots , author Jonathan Kwitny demonstrated that CIA manipulation led to the early end in Australia of the administration of Labor P arty PM G ough Whitlam, in par t because of his opposition to P ine Gap. Indeed, Whitlam was rousted after his public complaints about intelligence agency deceptions over the tragic US poli- cy in East Timor, and the CIA’s funding of Australia’s right-wing Country Party. By a quirk of Australia’s constitution, Whitlam was not driven from office by an election, but was removed by a governor-general he had appointed, one who had strong ties to the CIA. 7 No doubt the paranoia about this destabilization of the US ally down under fueled other r umors among locals about the undergr ound Pine Gap base involving alien/government collaboration. 8 One early page of Danny’s notes seemingly ties together Area 51, Pine Gap, a small Pennsylvania town called Tonoma, and possibly one of its citizens, someone named Fred Dick. Perhaps tracing one of many convoluted dead ends that Danny traced, the authors of this book dispatched an inv estigator to the “Tonoma, PA” in the notes, but failed to find D ick, even after placing a classified in the local newspaper, or any indication of what may have linked him to the two mysterious military bases. 9 Buried in notes written much later , however, were references to Tonomopah, Nevada, near Area 51. Fred Dick, however, remains a mystery. Although he had an interest in computers and science, Casolaro’s interest in the UFO world began with Michael Riconosciuto. Riconosciuto had a proclivi- ty for flights of flying saucer fancy going back at least a generation. After Casolaro’s death, he told one computer magazine that Danny had learned noth- ing more than what one of two intelligence agency factions wanted him to know in order to embarrass the other faction. One faction was called Aquarius and had a leadership sub-group called MJ-12. 10 Riconosciuto even told one writer that he had witnessed the autopsy of an alien body . The writer concluded that Riconosciuto “would have told anyone anything to get out of prison.” 11 Rumors also had it that Riconosciuto had worked for Lear Aircraft in Reno, Nev ada. This connected him to both John Lear, Sr., creator of the Lear jet, and often claimed by UFO buffs as having done research on anti-gravity for the gov- ernment, as w ell as John Lear, Jr., a former CIA pilot who also hit the UFO circuit with tales of saucers and aliens in cahoots with the US go vernment.

Other members of this nexus have included the redoubtable William Cooper, whose 1991 book, Behold a Pale Horse , shared the title of the first draft pr oposal of Casolaro’s manuscript and became notori- ous for its examination of Area 51, its reprinting of the anti-Semitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and its claim that JFK was shot by the driver of his car in the presidential motorcade. To a lesser extent this nexus also included Gordon Novel, by r umor and confession a minor play er in the K ennedy assassination and the Watergate scandal. Some have suggested that the bizarre tales of extraterrestrials coming from this nexus ser ve as disinformation to deflect attention away fr om serious issues such as gun-running and black project weapons development. 12 Riconosciuto had his o wn inter-generational connection to the UFO lor e, and his own link to the Kennedy assassination. His father Marshall had been a business associate of Fred Crisman, a man involved in the Maury Island incident, one of the earliest UFO incidents to follow pilot Kenneth Arnold’s famed flying discs over Mt. Rainier in 1947. 13 Arnold, in fact, investigated claims by Crisman and Harold Dahl that Dahl, his son, his dog and two others witnessed six saucers as the crew boated in Puget Sound along the shore of Maury Island. Dahl’s child was burned and his dog killed when one of the saucers spewed metallic debris on the boat. Crisman and Dahl mailed metal fragments of the debris to Amazing Stories editor Ray P almer, who hir ed Kenneth Arnold himself to inv estigate. Confused by what he was hearing from Crisman and Dahl, Arnold called in two Air Force Intelligence officers. They conducted some interviews, collected some of the debris, and were headed back to home base on a B-25 when an explosion on their early morning flight killed them both. The Maury Island incident was written off for years as a hoax, 14 but recent research has brought up the possibil- ity that Crisman used his possession of the saucer debris as a means to a car eer among the spooks. 15 Flying saucer crash retrieval rumors mounted in 1947 near the Riconosciuto stomping ground in Tacoma, Washington. The Tacoma News Tribune reported upon a retrieval by William Guy Bannister, the FBI Special Agent in Charge of the area at the time. 16 Bannister became famous much later in life when he shared office space with the F air Play for C uba Committee in N ew Orleans, possibly employing Lee Harvey Oswald as an agent provocateur . Crisman, too, had been connected to Oswald via a subpoena from the investigation of JFK’s death by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison. Some alleged that C risman was one of the three hoboes photographed after their arr est in the railroad yard behind the infamous grassy knoll on November 22, 1963.

Here is D anny’s account of this episode, fr om his Octopus manuscript: It is a pale moon that illuminates the characters in this story. With chords of fear and longing, it is a world of darkness and betrayal that everyone thinks they know but few have seen. The real faces in this world are all too human. Danger Man’s mind is as balkanized 1 as the script he lives and the land he travels. Perhaps betrayal becomes a way of life. 2 The back- ground music no longer echoes national anthems 3 but T. S. Eliot’s Gerontion : “Think/neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices/are fathered by our heroism. Virtues/are forced upon us by our impudent crimes.” These impudent 4 crimes are the subject of this update and a brief capsule seems as hopeless as carving the Lord’s Prayer 5 on the head of a secret agent. For, like the enormous Danger Man himself, this story will resist 6 shrinkage. Its events are too febrile, its local color too relentless. 7 The sun had burned away the morning fog when I arrived in Seattle on Easter Sunday, bound for Everett, some thirty miles away. I had come to visit and retrieve a tape recording from the intriguing Danger Man himself, forty-three-year-old Michael J. Riconosciuto, whom lawmen had deposit- ed in the Snohomish County jail in Everett, Washington. The tape Danger Man has recorded a month earlier, he alleged, was a direct threat from a former Justice Department official describing two legal entanglements that were about to befall him if he cooperated with a mushrooming Capitol Hill inquiry. If this tape was retrievable, I knew this scandal was about to be publicly born."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"48 THE OCTOPUS It was during the last year that I began calling Michael “Danger Man.” During hours of telephone calls from him, he had told me in exotic detail of his participation in “an enterprise” that worked its way around the world, trading in dope, dirty money, weapons, biotoxins and murder for the secrets of the temple. I had been able to unearth some documenta- tion and a number of other people who were willing to provide a rich array of detail regarding Danger Man, his former associates and the under- ground empire he described. But now he had become a key witness in the eight-year-old legal battle between the Justice Department and Inslaw, a District of Columbia com- puter company whose software tracking system called PROMIS has been used by law enforcement to track cases and criminals. “but it will track anything once its provided with the rules,” Inslaw’s founder says. Inslaw charged, and two courts have agreed, that the software—selling for $150,000 per user—had been stolen by a handful of people in the Justice Department in the course of a contract dispute. Now, Inslaw charges, the software has been distributed by profiteers to intelligence and military agencies in, among other countries, Iraq, Libya, South Korea, Israel and Canada. Inslaw’s William Hamilton had independently learned from a Canadian official that PROMIS was being used in nine hundred different locations in Canada. A little more than a week before his arrest, Danger Man had filed an affi- davit in the case on behalf of Inslaw saying that private interests had hired him in the early 1980s to modify the software for Canadian distribution. Those private interests, he told me, represented tentacles of the under- ground cabal that made its home on an Indian reservation just north of Mexicali. In the affidavit, Danger Man said he was called in February by a former Justice Department official and warned against cooperating with an investigation into the case by the House Judiciary committee. He added that the former Justice official told him that if he talked to investi- gators he would be implicated in an unrelated criminal case and would lose another ongoing child custody case. Late Friday evening on March 29, on the Key peninsula off Puget Sound, Danger Man was arrested for distribution of methamphetamine. I arrived in Snohomish County two days later on March 31. This is pon- derosa pine and giant fir country flanked by the Cascade Mountain range to the east, Port Gardner Bay and the Olympic Mountains to the west with the Snohomish River snaking through the north end of the city of Everett, the county seat. By late evening, I had been to the jail a number of times and each time Danger Man was refused visitors on the orders of the U. S. Marshall in Seattle. Still, Danger Man was able to find me at a nearby motel and call several times from the jail with cryptic directions for the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"49 P URSUIT OF THE T APE retrieval of the tape, his expected movement the following day to a fed- eral magistrate in Tacoma and more details about how dangerous he was becoming to the enterprise. That enterprise moved drugs, guns and money to the ever changing tem- ples of power in different parts of the world, the geography changing with the political climate unless the political climate could be changed to suit the enterprise, according to Danger Man, two other “agents of influence,” and a former Israeli agent. But no one is supposed to talk about it and Danger Man told me again of his best friend Paul who had been murdered in San Francisco almost ten years earlier. “Paul was the best there was as a money mover. The access codes he maneuvered were offshore accounts amounting to over a billion dollars,” Danger Man said. “They don’t play around. You’re just found dead one day.” Traveling to Tacoma with Danger Man’s lawyer, I saw seals basking in the only shaft of sun I had seen so far in the Northwest—fat with their catch of steelhead trout moving to freshwater spawning. We talked of Danger Man’s allegations, some documentable, and the tape that both of us had been promised. “Michael sure called this one,” the lawyer said. We arrived in Tacoma just before the 3 PM hearing. Danger Man filled the courtroom with his pres- ence. Under six feet tall, he was immense in frame but agile and graceful in movement like some giant white rabbit or perhaps some hybrid fugitive creature related to a fox. A former Air America pilot who says he may know Danger Man under a name other than Michael Riconosciuto says, “He was called ‘the Fat Man’ in Asia.” Richard Brenneke won’t even talk about Danger Man over the telephone. (Brenneke’s claims through the years regarding his role in an “October Surprise” plot to delay American hostages in Ran until after the 1980 election have been bouncing around for some time.) The hearing before a federal magistrate in Tacoma concerned bail for Danger Man which was refused. While the complaint charged an isolat- ed incident of distributing drugs on March 29, there were four other dates mentioned in which confidential informants with audio and video record- ings were used as well. The next day—April 2—I was driven from Gig Harbor to a patch of bog in the peninsula on the reaches of Puget Sound. This is where, I was told, Danger Man had thrown a copy of the tape from a car on the night of his arrest. I was driven up into the hills on the peninsula. Here the high pine trees, mostly wolf pine, and the red cedar stay in the rain shadow. The"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"50 THE OCTOPUS ground is mostly scrubland and skunk cabbage heavy with the scent of wild herbs and flowers, especially in the pouring rain. Many of the people live in huts, some attached to mobile homes, in the backwater of the peninsula. The first man I was to meet on this far end of nowhere was an old, grey-bearded Swede in a wide-brimmed leather hat. He came out of his hut talking in staccato rhythms and reciting broken poetry. He appeared somewhere between sixty and seventy years of age. “Can you cry?” he asked me. “Then prepare to shed a tear and shed them now,” he said. He hardly paused on the hillside in the pouring rain before advising that “The fault is not in the stars. The fault is in ourselves.” When he stopped talking, he started singing and finally I was able to ask if he had a tape for me. My driver said, “No. He doesn’t have the tape. We just wanted you to meet some of Michael’s old friends.” Sitting side by side under a tarp, the bearded old Swede took me on a compulsory guided tour of Danger Man from the time he was a child win- ning science fairs to now. Prior to working with the Nobel Laureate at Stanford’s Physics Lab at sixteen and seventeen years of age, he had suddenly already distinguished himself in mining, sonar, lasers and com- munications. Much of that I had heard before. Nobel laureate Dr. Arthur Schalow, in a lengthy interview months before, remembered Danger Man well. “You don’t forget a sixteen-year-old youngster who shows up with his own Argonne laser,” Dr. Schalow had told me. There was an old arti- cle about Danger Man when he was ten-years-old after he strung up an alternative telephone service in his neighborhood. The old Swede, Danger Man’s father and my driver wanted to make it very clear that this was a person who made very powerful people take notice of him when he was a boy. But why, I asked, would this group pursue him. Everyone, including Danger Man’s father, would tell me “To control him.” He had been running from that, I was told, since the mid-‘80s when he left the Indian reservation. And now he was regarded as a rogue always presenting a moving target having been harassed through the years by brigades of law enforcement for one charge or another. I had even found an old letter of his dating back to 1982 in which he described having “to present a periscopic image to the public.” The rain did not let up as the old Swede danced in the brush. I watched a big jack rabbit dart under and then away from the old Swede’s tarp before it limped trembling and hidden in the grass. While some creatures are born to hunt, other are born to flee. These are nature’s fugitives, and, like the fox, have a curious freedom in the masks they wear and access to obscure regions where no one will follow. Sometimes they have the protective coloring of the hunter but that is the ruse of the fox. They learn that instinctively."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"51 P URSUIT OF THE T APE By the end of the week I had trucked back and forth across Puget Sound by daylight and nightfall in an odyssey of pursuit for the tape. I would meet Danger Man in jail and talk with him many times from the Kitsap County jail to which he had been moved on the peninsula. I had also been placated, I presumed, with documents concerned mostly with weapons, fuel air explosives, documents relating to Gerald Bull, assassinated the previous spring in Brussels, Carlos Cardoen in Chile, min- ing papers, lab papers relating to scientific experiments with lasers, and letters regarding the return of that mysterious billion dollars which Danger Man said had come from the Nugan Hand bank in Australia. I had already seen some of these documents in the months before but now it looks as though the gumshoes from the House Judiciary Committee would also see them. Tw o Capitol Hill investigators had arrived on my heels to interview Danger Man. By the end of the week they had arrived in Seattle, had discussions with the U. S. Attorney, and made arrangements to have Danger Man moved. “I’m screwed,” Danger Man said, “don’t you see. These guys are my only hope. I’ve come up with the cheapest way to refine platinum there is. But I’m screwed because they’ll try to show that the chemicals I use at the mine are precursor ingredients to making methamphetamine.” The chem- icals at one of his labs included, he said, chloracetone, sodium cianide, nitric acid, ammonium chloride and bags of platinum dust. If I received the tape, the original, I was to give it to the investigators, he said. I could make a copy, he added, to bring back to Washington, DC. The next morning, Danger Man was moved from his cell on the Kitsap peninsula to Seattle where the Judiciary Committee investigators and their stenographer would be interviewing him. I arrived in Seattle and met both investigators. Despite their refusal to let me accompany them on their interview with Danger Man, we reached an agreement to engage in dia- logue back in the nation’s capitol. They spent all day with Danger Man and then, I learned, provided documents from another repository which I had not seen in Bremerton at the southern tip of the inlet. Having arrived on the 3rd of April, both investigators left on the 5th. By the tail end of the week, I had learned that federal agents had raided one of Danger Man’s labs in the mountainous Pine Creek area west of Tonasket still high in rain and snowmelt as well as his place in Aberdeen, a coastal strip town and still another place in Anaheim, California. I had previously talked to a Denver businessman about Danger Man and his elusiveness. “I watched Mike demonstrate a new laser weapon he had created,” the Denver man said, “a wand that blew whatever he pointed it"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"52 THE OCTOPUS at straight up in the air.

When the time came and we gathered at Fort Hood, Michael just didn’t show. That’s the way he was then and I don’t expect he’s any different now.” The beginning of spring always has its moody, bad tempered transitions but with the tape never emerging, I was more than a little frustrated and more than doubtful in the tape’s existence. “I hope, for your sake, I’m wrong,” I told him when he was back in the jail at Kitsap County. He was unhappy I was leaving. I could sense his feelings grow mute in embarrassment, everything in him withdrew, a silence arose. I was going to be indulgent with whatever he said which I knew would still leave both of us empty handed; for ultimately, and precisely in the deepest and most important matters, especially if he was telling the truth, he was unspeak- ably alone.

An attorney fr om Philadelphia, Dennis Eisman, known as the “Fatal Vision lawyer” because of his inv olvement in the Jeffrey McDonald case, was in touch with Casolaro and was scheduled to travel to Washington to defend Riconosciuto, planning also to meet with a woman who had evidence of threat to his client. In April, Eisman was shot and killed in his car in P hiladelphia. According to one sour ce, just prior to E isman’s death, indictments were pending against him and other attorneys for narcotics traffick- ing and money laundering. The indictments never appeared. As soon as Michael Riconosciuto found out that Eisman was dead, he called Virginia McCullough. McCullough said that he was “absolutely panicky in jail.” Riconosciuto told her, “They’ve killed my attorney,” and asked her to telephone another attorney working on his case, James Guthrie, to warn him. McCullough did, and Guthrie told McCullough, “I’m out of here.” 1 Nine days after Michael Riconosciuto issued his affidavit in the Inslaw case, he was arrested. In April 1991, police arrested Riconosciuto on one count of dis- tributing methamphetamine manufacture at Lakebay in Washington state. Inv estigators for the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives met with Riconosciuto in Tacoma, spent six hours taking depositions from him, and asked him for proof for his statements by way of legal documents. Accord- ing to one report, Riconosciuto asked for clear “Lawyer-Client Privilege” labeling on documents when he called them in from his attorney, as a precaution against search and seizure by government agencies. Nevertheless, Riconosciuto’s jailers opened the privileged packages and refused to forward them. Instead, the report goes on, they contacted the NSA, which sent a team to r eview the material. By the end of December 1991, the agency had not commented on when the docu- ments would be returned to Riconosciuto. 2"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"55 M YSTERIOUS D EATHS Casolaro confered with Riconosciuto r egularly in late 1989, and fle w to Tacoma for the trial and to act as a legal inv estigator for ten days. 3 Their meet- ing and the fruitless search for the alleged tape recording of Videnieks may have contributed to a certain disillusionment that Danny felt about “Danger Man” by the time he r eturned home. “ That guy is nuts,” he told a journalist after his Washington trip. 4 No such assessment of Riconosciuto ’s sanity was needed to determine that his statements w ere suspect. In addition to life among the ufo- nauts, Riconosciuto failed to pr oduce an oft-requested passport to corroborate his claimed trips to I ran. When asked b y the CNN M oneyline program to describe Peter Videnieks, whom he claimed to have met on several occasions and who threatened him on the lost tape, Riconosciuto was unable to do so . 5 Four days after interviewing Danger Man on June 19, 1991, former Nixon campaign aide Alan Michael May died in his home in San Francisco. During the interview, Riconosciuto had talked about May’s involvement in the October Sur- prise. The initial coroner’s report attributed May’s death to heart attack, but an autopsy showed the presence of polypharmaceuticals in his body. Anson Ng, a r eporter for the Financial Times of London, pursued J immy Hughes, the Wackenhut security guard central to the Alv arez murder case, to South America in an attempt to get an inter view. While in Guatemala during July 1991, Ng was murdered by a single bullet to the chest. His death was ruled a suicide. The Guatemalan government was asked to r etrieve Ng’s floppy discs and personal papers regarding his investigation. It did so and turned them o ver to a US intelligence agency. In a press conference a few weeks later, Senator Alan Cranston requested that these items be returned, but they never were. 6 More than a y ear earlier, on M arch 31, 1990, a B ritish journalist named Jonathan Moyle was found dead, hung in a hotel room closet in Santiago, Chile. “Although Casolaro and Moyle were probing different leads, their investigations involved some of the same people,” said columnist J ack Anderson. 7 Moyle, an editor at London’s Defense Helicopter World , had been investigating the weapons trade, specifically the alleged sale of non-militar y US helicopters to I raq for re- fitting as attack choppers. The notes Moyle left behind contained reference to a sophisticated missile guidance system that held I raqi interest, although whether or not it used the system in its disastrous SCUD attacks during the Persian Gulf War is unknown. Instrumental in the arms-dealing Moyle had investigated was Carlos Cardoen, the same man Ari Ben-Menashe identified as the intermediary between Iraq and Earl Brian for the PROMIS software deal. 8 Initial reports called Moyle’s death a suicide, but evidence, including the presence of a strong sedative in his system and possible asphyxiation, suggested otherwise. 9 It is unclear whether or not M oyle kept contact with D anny Casolaro, although his notes include r eferences to Carlos Car doen and the I raqi missile"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"56 THE OCTOPUS deal. Casolaro knew about Alan M ay and had also learned about Anson Ng ’s death shortly after it took place. He also remembered the January murder of Alan Standorf. Riconosciuto had intr oduced Casolaro to S tandorf as an electr onic intelligence operative of the NSA, working at the Vint Hill military installation in Virginia that gathered information from espionage satellites and other sources throughout the world. Casolaro agreed that Standorf had important information linking the Justice Department to parts of the various scandals he had researched. After Standorf’s death, D anny mentioned to a friend, B ill Turner, that a key source had vanished. 10 Did Danny feel the tentacles tightening? I f so, it was not r eflected in his research notes. He collected information on vicious killers and po wer brokers, but gave no clue that he thought they were coming after him. Over time, M ichael Riconosciuto lost thr ee lawyers and an inv estigator under what could be constr ued as mysterious circumstances. In February 1987 Larry Guerrin, a priv ate investigator conducting I nslaw-connected work for Riconosciuto, was killed in Mason County, Washington. After Eisman’s death, in April 1993, another attorney who wor ked with Riconosciuto, J ohn Crawford, died suddenly from a heart attack in Tacoma. 11 The decomposed body of a third Riconosciuto lawyer, Paul Wilcher, was found in Wilcher’s Washington, DC apartment on June 23, 1993. Wilcher also had been an attorney for the pilot Gunther Russbacher, who claimed to have videotape proof and sixteen witness- es to his having flo wn George H. W. Bush to one of the O ctober Surprise meetings. 12 Wilcher belonged to the American P atriot Fax Network and had recently prepared an ambitious fifty-fiv e page fax summarizing information on circumstances leading to the fier y deaths of D avid Koresh and his follo wers in April 1993 that he sent as a challenge to A ttorney General Janet Reno. The fax included details of the stor y of his client, R ussbacher, concerning the O ctober Surprise, and a page of information on the Inslaw case, pointing out that an exec- utive assistant to S enator Robert Byrd, Democrat from West Virginia, was the wife of Peter Videnieks, who had threatened Riconosciuto. 13 The mysterious death list came also to include the ex ecution-styled slaying of Ian Spiro and his family, a wife and three daughters, in San Diego on Novem- ber 1, 1992. Spiro reportedly worked for US and British intelligence agencies on operations that included the October Surprise, Iran-contra and the hostage cri- sis in Lebanon. Spiro spoke with Riconosciuto, for whom he was helping collect documents to present to a grand jury, only a few days before his death. 14 Later, others would begin to develop lists of significant deaths related to the Inslaw case in much the same way many began making connections betw een the deaths of witnesses and others associated to the JFK assassination tw enty five years earlier.

She disap- peared on Aug 18, 1992 but her body was not disco vered until the following April, in a ravine near Lake Bay, Washington. 15 Another Riconosciuto ally, Pete Sandvigen, who was wor king to help Riconosciuto defend himself fr om the drug charges, died the following December, an ammo clip from the gun he car- ried mysteriously missing. 16 Barry Kusnick, a computer engineer who had worked on PROMIS enhance- ments, also made the list. According to one report, Kusnick’s enhancement was called Brainstorm, an artificially intelligent program that applied the prognosti- cating ability of PROMIS to individual thought patterns. I t ostensibly allowed PROMIS to deduce from personality characteristics the potential action of the person being traced. As in the I nslaw case, Kusnick apparently had made the modifications under a go vernment contract that the go vernment failed to pay, attempting to drive Kusnick into bankruptcy. Kusnick had previously done com- munications and intelligence wor k for N orthrop Corporation and the US military. His body had not been found, and nine months after he was r eported missing family members were unable to get known business partners to acknowl- edge knowing him. Five boxes of his belongings were found in a lock-up facility. 17 Sherman Skolnick, long-time chairman of Chicago’s Citizen’s Committee to Clean Up the Courts, charged that nearly forty witnesses in the Inslaw case had been murdered and complained that a federal judge appointed to review the case failed to show concern over the safety of other witnesses. He also claimed that a Special Federal Grand Jury in Chicago planned to do an end-r un around the judge and issue high-level indictments. Skolnick also reported that three of the grand jury witnesses joined with Riconosciuto to file suit against the judge for obstructing the indictments, and that the judge had an FBI agent interr ogating witnesses who was himself suspected of murdering Casolaro. 18 Most interesting of all the mysterious deaths connected to I nslaw, however, was that of 1960s political activist A bbie Hoffman. Hoffman wrote an early piece on the October Surprise for Playboy magazine and shortly thereafter was involved in a suspicious automobile accident. Most regarded his death on April 12, 1989 as the suicide it was reported as, caused perhaps in part due to depres- sion he suffered from the continued pain resulting from that accident. Others, however, suspected foul play in H offman’s death, notably D avid Dellinger, a fellow member of the Chicago 8. D ellinger’s suspicions ev en led him to attempt to retrieve the coroner’s report for examination, but he was stopped by a threatened court battle. “They basically would not allow that to go to court,” Dellinger concluded, “but [Abbie’s] son Andrew and Abbie’s first wife Sheila, are convinced he was killed.” 19"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"———— 1.

He had worked at the Cabazon reservation with Riconosciuto. Riconosci- uto and N ichols formed a business par tnership in the 1970s to manufactur e fertilizer, pesticide, and weaponry, including fuel air explosives and the G-77— an inexpensive sub-machine gun invented by Nichols—but the two had argued in 1984 and had not spoken since. 3 Casolaro and Nichols spoke on the phone fifteen times in J uly, calls which lasted as long as two hours. They met at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington, D.C. on July 10, 1991. Casolaro was so impressed with the sophistication and “insider” knowledge his new friend Nichols had that he came to consider him a mentor. At one point, Casolar o spoke to him about his money tr oubles and Nichols offered financial assistance—in exchange for a twenty-five percent inter- est in Casolaro’s home and right of first refusal if he sold it. 4 To tempt his girlfriend, Wendy Weaver, into accompanying him to his meet- ing with N ichols at the F our S easons, Casolar o described N ichols as the president of the Bechtel corporation, just arrived from Kuwait. Nichols intimat- ed at the dinner party that he was going to be named state security minister of the Caribbean island of Dominica, which would become a center for rebuilding Kuwait. Nichols repeatedly warned Casolaro that what he was r esearching was dangerous. Nichols warned Casolaro at least five times about the danger of asso- ciating with Riconosciuto. He warned that if Casolar o said anything that w ent against Nichols’ former partner Riconosciuto, he would be killed.

Later that ev ening, Casolaro con- fided to Weaver that Nichols “really scared him.” In his notes, Danny Casolaro characterized Nichols as “very powerful.” 5 On another night, Casolaro and a different friend met Nichols at Clyde’s in Tyson’s Corner. Nichols again talked about Dominica, saying he had just done a radio broadcast in his new position as minister of state security, and he also said that he was part of a planned CIA coup that was going to happen ther e. Caso- laro’s friend claimed that N ichols “had this stor y that they w ere going to turn Dominica into a CIA base, had plans for a desalination program and pulled out this design drawn by a French architect of a dome the size of Texas Stadium that was half under water.

The friend was shocked. “I said, ‘D anny, I’m gonna take you out back and whip your ass! You just put me in a meeting with this man and didn ’t tell me what the hell—why didn ’t you tell me befor e?’” Casolora explained he just wanted to see how Nichols would react. 6 Casolora related Nichols’ stories about D ominica in his N otes “Before the reins of the Octopus are turned over to several younger players, the game con- tinues now—July, 1991—on the tiny Caribbean island nation of D ominica.

Joseph Cicippio, later taken as a hostage in Lebanon, was an employee of Ali & Fahd at the time, and stated that Nichols represented himself as an agent for the US go vernment in the takeo ver bid. Cicippio said that Nichols showed him J ustice Department identification, and had information which he assumed could only have been acquired through government contacts. 8 Casolaro learned more about Nichols from Richard Stavin, formerly a special prosecutor for the J ustice Department’s Organized Crime Strike Force, who had some familiarity with N ichols’ attachment to the mob end of the enter tainment industry. On July 31, 1991 Stavin explained to Danny about Nichols’ connections to the Gambinos and the Yakuza, which the FBI had investigated in 1987 as part of its probe of Mafia presence in Hollywood. Stavin also mentioned that Nichols had at one time offer ed to become an informant for the J ustice Department, although he did not know whether anyone had taken him up on the offer. Stavin felt that passing this information on may have contributed to Danny’s death. 9 The FBI’s focus in 1987 was on M ob influence in the motion pictur e indus- try. They took particular interest in Eugene Giaquinto, a member of the board of directors of Nichols’ Meridian Arms, a firm that was to manufacture the G-77 gun in South Korea. At that time, Giaquinto also served as president of the home enter- tainment sector of MCA, which o wned Universal Pictures. In his application to wiretap Giaquinto, agent Thomas G. G ates, who later supplied information to Casolaro, suggested that FBI investigative files indicated that in 1978, Nichols had been “an international money launder er for money generated thr ough narcotics trafficking and organized crime activities.” 10 The wiretaps caught Giaquinto and Nichols discussing a takeo ver of MCA, and r evealed Giaquinto’s connection to renowned mobster John Gotti. Although the investigation was derailed by mem- bers of the Reagan administration, Giaquinto left both MCA and M eridian, but not before unsuccessfully trying to secure an appointment for Nichols to head an industry anti-video piracy operation in Asia. Nichols denied any involvement with the Yakuza or the Mafia. Ron Rosenbaum wrote in Vanity Fair that Nichols traced “the trouble to an FBI misunderstanding of his scr eenplay career. He says he was introduced to a high lev el executive of MCA sev eral years ago at a coffeeshop . When the MCA man encouraged him to turn some tales he’d told him into screen- plays, they became friends, and briefly, business associates. Unknown to him, the MCA man was the subject of a full-cour t-press FBI investigation for being a key organized-crime link to the entertainment industry. And so, Gable [Nichols] says his voice was picked up by taps on the MCA man’s phone.

However, the federal district cour ts dismissed Nichols’ suits twice. Gates, believing Nichols to be undeterred in his attempt at retribution, said in testimo- ny before the House Judiciary Committee that informants had twice told him that Nichols had placed a contract on his life. The other high point of Nichols’ movie career came with his cameo appear- ance as a terr orist in the 1992 S teven Seagal movie, Under Siege . Perhaps not coincidentally, Seagal became embr oiled in contr oversy when a writer , Alan Richman, claimed in GQ magazine that Seagal had appropriated details of the biographies of former associates R obert Strickland and G ary G oldman and passed them off as incidents in his o wn life. When investigator John Connolly later repeated the charges in Spy and made further claims that Seagal tried to set up Richman in a fake homosexual tr yst and tried to have Goldman killed, Sea- gal sued unsuccessfully. In 1993 Nichols sought damages against the Los Angeles Police Department over an incident that caused the revocation of his concealed weapons permit and, consequently, a cancellation of the money for the manufactur e of the G-77 b y Swiss financiers. According to his testimony , Nichols had been thr own to the floor, disarmed, handcuffed and carted off to a North Hollywood jail by LAPD officers responding to a disturbance complaint at a club called The Palomino. 12 Nichols said he was not involved with any disturbance but had only stopped in at the club for a couple of beers.

Casolar o may hav e worried that if he let slip his knowledge of Nichols’ association with the Mafia and the Yakuza during a conver- sation, Nichols might turn danger ous. Six days after talking to S tavin, Casolaro spoke again to his mentor. The following day Casolaro informed Stavin that Nichols had warned him off the investigation. At about the same time, Casolaro called FBI agent Thomas Gates and asked whether he should take seriously Nichols’ warnings that, “If you continue this investigation, you will die.” Gates later commented that Casolaro was “upbeat, not like a person contemplating suicide.” 14 ———— 1. In January 1993, writer John Connolly cast suspicion on the r elationship between Bill Hamilton and Robert Booth Nichols: “... despite Hamilton’s reservations about Nichols’ character, the man who designed a program for tracking criminals and the man who has been linked by the FBI to two crime organizations communicate with surprising fr equency. Last summer I visited H amilton’s office in Washington to get a copy of the phone records that would show his call to Nichols on August 9, 1991. He seemed reluctant. It took a fair amount of persuasion to convince him to turn it o ver—and what he gave me was a photocopy with all but that call blocked out. Shortly after leaving, I remembered that I had wanted to ask him something else and r eturned to his office. While I was waiting in the recep- tion area, the phone rang. The receptionist buzzed Hamilton: ‘Robert Booth Nichols, returning your call.’ When I asked Hamilton about the call, he replied, ‘I call Nichols all the time. It was just a coin- cidence that it was right after you left.’” (Connolly, John, “Dead Right,” Spy , January 1993.) 2. “Without the ears,” Ridgeway and Vaughan, p. 35. 3. Corn. 4.

S teinberg, who had earlier arranged the contact betw een the Hamiltons and Michael Riconosciuto, arranged for Casolaro to talk to an infor- mant who went by the odd name of CHIPS, a former C ustoms agent who was now assisting the Treasury Department. Steinberg believes that CHIPS turned Casolaro’s inv estigations fur ther in the dir ection of R obert Booth N ichols, toward the Gambino Mafia family and drug trafficking. Shortly thereafter, Casolaro made phone contact with E. H oward Hunt, 3 a name that appeares on the “A” list of many conspiracy researchers. Of late, Hunt had made a career writing spy fiction, but his infamy str etched back to his role as one of the Watergate burglars and befor e. Hunt had lost a defamation case against accusations that he had been inv olved in the JFK assassination. 4 Hunt had been active in many spook projects of the Kennedy era, most notably in the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. Even as Casolaro developed a “cordial, even effusive” relationship with Hunt, 5 he kept taking notes. In a memo, Steinberg observed that by this time, Casolaro was on the trail of Inslaw and related stories “back to a dir ty CIA ‘Old Boy’ network” that had begun working together in the 1950s around covert operations in Albania. These men had gotten into the illegal gun and dr ug trade back then and had contin- ued in that business ever since.

They are the men who make up THE OCTOPUS . They are not government officials but their tentacles can reach into any part of government in almost any country including legitimate and rogue spy networks. They are not notable industrialists but they can pull the strings of the oil and banking empires at will. They are not known criminals but they have successfully penetrated all factions of organized crime including the Mafia, the Japanese Yakuza, the secret Chinese Triads and the terrorist underground. With its tag team compartments, its exploitation of hundreds of people and formidable stealth, THE OCTOPUS will help to unravel the most compelling puzzles of the twentieth century. What may have begun for these few learned men as a utopian response to harsh post-war realities quickly gave way to what simple men have always known as the real enemy which is selfishness and its allied forces of fear, greed, and power. While a few of these eight men came together to insure the failure of an initiate in Albania in the fifties, almost every one of them helped to frustrate the Cuban Bay of Pigs invasion. What did the fiasco at the Bay of Pigs accomplish? President Nixon and Attorney General John Mitchell were becoming impossible as far as the Octopus was concerned. Even Kissinger was being difficult in bypassing normal circles of intelligence with Vietnamization and the China card.

After all, how could a democracy spit up a Prime Minister that could sack the security of the Western Alliance?

Casolaro saw the Octopus’ tentacles entwined throughout the creation of the Golden Triangle and Latin America drug trade, the Cuban Bay of Pigs debacle, the October Surprise, the BCCI banking scandal, and, almost as an afterthought, the theft of PROMIS software. Casolaro found a “Secret Team,” a high cabal of players operating a clandes- tine, parallel government, identified previously by other writers. 1 The cabal had operated beyond the control or scrutiny of the elected government, financed by drug-running from Southeast Asia and the Americas. Other researchers tended to see the O ctopus as a fog of political crimes ascribed to the alphabet soup of intelligence agencies, institutions or ev en the natural dialectic of the modern terrorist state and its citizenry. Casolaro’s Octo- pus, however, was no grand, unified mega-conspiracy theory. Casolaro believed the crimes could best be identified b y linking them to a small networ k of named individuals that made up his Octopus. He outlined their hierarchy and provided specific detail about their behind-the-scenes r ole in contemporar y political history. Casolaro named people both familiar and unfamiliar to other researchers. He deemed the “first level” operatives to be Richar d Helms, George Pender, John Philip Nichols, and Ray Cline. The second lev el included R obert Chasen, E. Howard Hunt, Edwin Wilson, Thomas Clines, and Ted Shackley. Working back- ward from the PROMIS theft, Casolaro saw them in new relationship, a nearly organic entity that impacted on both past and then current events.

Whether he approached his work as a student of history or as fodder for fiction, some of his r ealizations were not easy for him to face. A ccording to Virginia McC ullough, “Danny would say that he couldn’t believe the government would do drugs for arms. He was God, motherhood, and apple pie. I would say, ‘Look Danny, let’s get real, we’re living in the 20th century.’” 2 One new contact, William Turner, had been an aerospace engineer at Hon- eywell in Virginia until Hughes Aircraft bought his division. Turner, who lived a short distance from Casolaro, contacted him and furnished him with details of an alleged fraud by Hughes Aircraft. Turner claimed that when he r eported the fraud to his seniors they began a cover-up. Turner had left Hughes in April 1991. In A ugust, Turner and Casolaro met in M artinsburg, and Turner handed over documents which he said proved a “vast government conspiracy.” 3 Casolaro met with Turner again on February 21, at the Sheraton. The two discussed Casolaro’s concept of the O ctopus with Casolar o making fur ther connections betw een Oliver North and BCCI. In May or June they met again in I nwood, West Vir- ginia, drinking and bar-hopping. Casolar o was effusiv e o ver his book-in-progress, and promised Turner he would personally autograph a copy for him once it was in print. 4 McC ullough at this time also noticed Casolaro’s research taking on more focus and intensity. “In the middle of May he became very centered about what he want- ed from me. What he wanted from me was everything I knew Riconosciuto was involved with, with the Iran-contra, with the Cabazon Indian reservation, and how that pertained to the PROMIS software.” “It began to come home to me loud and clear that there was a real danger here.” 5 ———— 1.

The following chronology lists some of the ev ents and people that Casolar o believed involved the alleged super-cabal, “the Octopus.” It has been developed from Casolaro’s notes but expanded upon with additional research; Casolaro did not mention many of the internal connections documented here. OSS in China Casolaro’s Octopus may have begun earlier than he thought. During World War II the OSS chapter in China, D etachment 202, included in its memberships alleged Octopi Ray Cline (later station chief in Nationalist China between 1958 to 1962), E. Howard Hunt, and Richard Helms, as well as such future covert ops luminaries as Mitchell WerBell III (arms dealer, trainer of terrorists, and on-and-off employee of the CIA) and Major General John Singlaub. Singlaub later commanded the CIA’s infamous Operation Phoenix assassination program in Vietnam, which provided yet another link to other alleged O ctopus personnel. China has historically had sub- stantial involvement in opium pr oduction and trade, although it is not kno wn whether the Octopus took much notice of the commodity at this time. In his notes, Casolaro lists Helms, Hunt, Shackley, Pender, Clines, Nichols as being “OSS.” 1 The Albanian Operation The history of the O ctopus as delineated b y Danny Casolaro begins with the OSS/British intelligence Albanian operation, which took place after World War Chapter 15: Tentacles V 72"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"73 T ENTACLES II. The Americans and B ritish set upon a plan to tr y to dislodge a S oviet bloc country from Moscow’s influence, believing that this might lead to the shatter- ing of the Soviet bloc. Albania was chosen because of its political instability, and because of the belief that a large number of Albanian dissidents w ere waiting for the opportunity to revolt. According to the CIA’s Frank Wisner, it was “a clini- cal experiment to see whether larger rollback operations [by the OSS] would be feasible elsewhere.” 2 Using bases in M alta and Lib ya, joint commanders J ames McCargar and Kim Philby (the head of MI6 division in charge of Eastern Europe and the Sovi- et Union, liasing betw een British and American intelligence) super vised the landing of hundreds of agents into Albania via parachute or across the border of Greece. Almost all of these operatives were killed or captured. Kim Philby was an agent in the KGB’s British “ring of five,” and was run by Yuri Moldin, whose specialty was r ecruiting and wielding homosexual agents. P hilby defected to Moscow, and later admitted that he had betray ed the Albanian mission to S oviet intelligence. E. Howard Hunt played a subordinate role in the Albanian opera- tion, working out of Washington, D.C. 3 Although Danny Casolaro does not state it explicitly in his notes, he appar- ently conceived the Octopus starting as an anti-Communist response to Philby’s betrayal; a conclav e of OSS/CIA v eterans, dispersing and coalescing in what Casolaro called “tag team compartments” and reaping huge profits through assas- sination, arms sales, the contr ol of governments, international drug trafficking, and the promotion of international fascism. 4 Coup d’Etat in Guatemala The Octopus soon surfaced again. E. Howard Hunt played an important role in the 1954 overthrow of Jacobo Arbenz’ Communist-inclined (but not Commu- nist) government in Guatemala, which had been democratically elected. Arbenz made the mistake of appropriating 225,000 acres of land from the United Fruit Company (later renamed United Brands), an organization alleged to hav e been established by the Mafia and deeply involved in international drug shipping since the early 1900s. John Foster Dulles and the State Department lined up behind United Fruit, which was not unusual since Dulles’ law firm represented the com- pany, and his brother Allen (at that time the director of the CIA) had earlier been the president of United Fruit. Allen Dulles also shepherded an extensive postwar collaboration with the Nazis, most notably with Project Paperclip in which hun- dreds of Nazi scientists and soldiers w ere brought to the U nited States. Allen Dulles served as the international lawy er for George Bush, and on the Warren Commission, ostensibly investigating the death of John F. Kennedy."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Guatemala was prevented from buying arms fr om the US or its allies, for cing Arbenz to purchase arms from the Czechs, which in turn confirmed American suspicions that G uatemala had gone Communist. The Guatemalan operation was part and parcel of the activities of the CIA in combatting revolutionary activ- ity and industrial nationalization in the Caribbean, M exico, and Central America, later echoed in the CIA ’s attempts to inv ade Cuba and assassinate Cuban premier Fidel Castro. 5 The American invasion of Guatemala was assisted by the Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean (ACLC), a group started by ex-FBI, possibly CIA, Min- uteman, and alleged Kennedy assassination conspirator Guy Banister in the same year as the takeover. Lee Oswald purportedly knew Banister, used his office, and was alleged b y private detective Jack Martin to hav e been one of B anister’s agents. 6 Banister and Michael Riconosciuto’s father Marshall have been connect- ed to UFO activity—hoaxed or other wise—in the Tacoma, Washington region. (See Chapter 8.) Significant in understanding the purpose and the r each of the O ctopus is that the ACLC comprised a portion of what evolved into the World Anti-Com- munist League, with pr eparatory meetings beginning in 1958, although the group was not officially founded until 1966. Funding for the WACL was alleged to have been funnelled thr ough alleged Octopus member Ray Cline, who had been a member of the OSS in China, and station chief for the CIA in Taiwan between 1958 and 1962. Researcher John Judge has stated that the WACL was financed by Nationalist Chinese opium money. 7 The chairman for the WACL was at one time Major General John Singlaub, linked closely and repeatedly to alleged Octopus personnel. The WACL has over time included in its membership Nazi SS, Solidarists, mercenaries, death squad members, and other fascist elements. Ray Cline had also been influential in fur thering the purposes of the inter- national right wing in collaboration with Chaing Ching-kuo, the son of Chiang Kai-shek. In the late 1950s they formed the P olitical Warfare Cadres Academy, with recruiting managed by the WACL. The Academy has been responsible for training many of the men inv olved in death squads, terrorism, and “unconven- tional warfare” throughout Latin America. 8 Cuba When Fidel Castro—who initially was anti-American, but not Communist— came to power in Cuba in 1959, he was rebuffed and diplomatically snubbed in his appeals for aid fr om the US. H e nationalized the countr y’s oil and gas resources and other industries, cutting American companies out when they had 74 THE OCTOPUS"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"75 T ENTACLES only begun to access Cuban resources. Castro also took over the lucrative Mafia- owned casinos on the island, incurring the wrath of that gr oup. President Eisenhower subsequently approved $13 million for a covert war against Castro, whuch included sabotage missions and at least eight attempts on the C uban leader’s life by the CIA (following plans drafted by E. Howard Hunt). A possibly significant factor in the war against C uba was that, prior to Castro’s 1959 revolution, the island had been a major center for the M afia for heroin and cocaine processing and shipping fr om Marseilles. A dr ying-up of this impor tant drug conduit greatly concerned the Mafia and its long-term partner, the CIA, which had used the island ’s casinos to launder payments to mobsters. The OSS/CIA’s partnership with the Mafia had begun with Operation Underworld in 1936. 9 CIA operations targeted against C uba were run by Theodore Shackley and Thomas Clines out of the JM/WAVE CIA office in Miami, which grew into the largest CIA station in the world, emplo ying over 3,000 agents and operating through at least 55 dummy corporations. 10 According to a statement b y E. Howard Hunt, Richard Nixon was the White House “secret action officer” in charge of the 53/12 Group of the National Security Council, which ran the Bay of Pigs fiasco. 11 The Mafia supplied intelligence r eports on C uban troops and ships and r ecruited men for the CIA inv asion force. Mafia don Santos Traffi- cante, later implicated b y some r esearchers in the JFK assassination, wor ked through Frank Sturgis (aka Frank Fiorini), who engaged in pr e-invasion raids and was a member of the O peration 40 hit squad to assassinate C uban leaders. Richard Whattley, a mercenary involved in this operation, stated of the B ay of Pigs operation that “ Trafficante would order Sturgis to move his men and he ’d do it. Our ultimate conclusion was that Trafficante was our backer. He was our money man.” 12 Other members of assassination teams included C ubans Felix Rodriguez, and Rafael “Chi Chi” Quintero, and Mitchell WerBell III, 13 under the supervi- sion of E. H oward Hunt, whose boss was station chief Theodore G. Shackley. Quintero appeared frequently in important covert operations, including as a Spe- cial Forces training advisor in Vietnam, doing jobs for the CIA’s Task Force 157, and as supply officer for weapons shipments to the contras, working with Shack- ley, Clines, H akim, and S ecord. Also alleged to hav e been inv olved in assassination attempts on Castro is Dr. John P. Nichols, the administrator in the Cabazon/Wackenhut venture which Danny Casolaro investigated. Edwin Wil- son is said to hav e been a “junior officer ” in the attempts to assassinate Castr o and his supporters. 14 The Bay of Pigs operation, in which 1,400 CIA trained and armed anti-Cas- tro Cubans invaded Cuba, was led b y Theodore Shackley, and took place on April 15-19, 1961. The operation was a miserable rout for the anti-Castro forces,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"and Kennedy was blamed by many of the involved JM/Wave operatives for the defeat, for withdrawing logistical suppor t. 15 A sense of the impor tance ascribed to the Bay of Pigs operation is provided by E. Howard Hunt in his autobiogra- phy, Give Us This Day : No event since the communization of China in 1949 has had such a pro- found effect on the United States and its allies as the defeat of the US-trained Cuban invasion brigade at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961. Out of that humiliation grew the Berlin Wall, the missile crisis, guerrilla war- fare throughout Latin America and Africa, and our Dominican Republic intervention. Castro’s beachhead triumph opened a bottomless Pandora’s box of difficulties that affected not only the United States, but most of its allies in the free world. These bloody and subversive events would not have taken place had Cas- tro been toppled. Instead of standing firm, our government pyramided crucially wrong decisions and allowed [Cuban unit] Brigade 2506 to be destroyed. The Kennedy administration yielded Castro all the excuse he needed to gain a tighter grip on the island of Jose Marti, then moved shamefacedly into the shadows and hoped the Cuban issue would simply melt away. Although not specifically named as a member of the O ctopus by Casolaro, there is much to suggest that G eorge H. W. Bush was part of the management of the Bay of Pigs invasion. This evidence includes the code name of the opera- tion, Operation Zapata, reflecting the name of B ush’s oil drilling company. At the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Bush had oil rigs located thirty miles north of Cuba near Cay Sal, an important CIA operations base. F ormer members of the CIA have alleged that Bush allowed the CIA to use Zapata as a front for its operations, and that Bush also functioned in disbursing CIA monies to agents in the area. 16 In Casolaro’s notes he makes the follo wing connections: “Zapata—1953— Nar cotics S muggling—Shadow go vt.” 17 There ar e other speculativ e links between Bush and Casolaro’s Octopus, including the fact that the B ush family fortune was secured in large part through the rise of Hitler, through his father’s Union Banking Corporation, which acted as a front for the Nazis, specifically the major German financier Fritz Thyssen. To this day, George Bush retains many connections linked to the N azis and fascists. G eorge Bush is also a member of the Yale Skull and Bones secret society. Founded by General George Russell in the early 1800’s, Skull and Bones has long been a recruiting ground for the CIA. General Russell was the anglophile Boston Brahmin said to have dominated the opium trade in the 1800s as successor to the Perkins opium syndicate. Skull 76 THE OCTOPUS"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"77 T ENTACLES and Bones recruited from other Boston Brahmin families—such as the Bundys, Coffins, P aynes, S loanes, Tafts, and Whitneys—also alleged to hav e been involved in the opium markets, with the Bush family historically serving as oper- atives for these Eastern Establishment inter ests. The curr ent R ussell Trust organization also has been connected to Wackenhut. Another connection of George Bush to the Octopus is his acquaintance with George DeMohrenshildt. DeM ohrenshildt apparently worked as an agent of the CIA, had N azi connec- tions, may also have been a Soviet agent, and, events suggest, may have been Lee Harvey Oswald’s handler. According to one sour ce, Bush’s connection to D e Mohrenshildt went back to the late 1940s. Bush’s name and address were found in De Mohrenshildt’s address book after the latter ’s death, which took place shortly before he was supposed to testify before the Warren Commission. 18 The anonymous Com-12 briefing refers to the B lack Rose Organization, which runs a “Black World Order” using drug monies from the Golden Triangle and the Golden Crescent. According to this anonymous but intriguing r eport, the current chairman and co-founder of the B lack Rose is alleged to be G eorge Bush (known in underworld circles as the White Rose). Bush is alleged to have developed a her oin shipment ring while Ambassador in China, and to r un cocaine from Panama through his offshore oil rigs. 19 Although not noted in this samizdat document, Theodore Shackley (linked to drug trafficking in Southeast Asia) was the head of the CIA’s Far East Division during the time that Bush was the American ambassador to China. When Bush became CIA director in 1976 he made S hackley Associate Deputy Director of Operations, the thir d most impor tant position in the CIA. O ne anti-Castro group in Miami at the time of the Bay of Pigs was called the White Rose. The ultimate significance of the White Rose—perhaps leading back to the real power behind international dr ug running—may reside in G eorge Bush’s association with Boston Anglophile inter ests and his claimed connection to British royalty; the white rose is the symbol of the House of York, which fought the War of the R oses against the H ouse of Lancaster . Many researchers have noted British aristocratic and banking interests behind world drug trafficking. An anonymous informant stated to Barbara Honegger that George Bush was elected an honorary (i.e. non-Italian) member of the Italian Masonic (and CIA and Mafia and Vatican-supported) cabal Propaganda Due (“P2”) in 1976. H is induction coincided with his appointment as director of the CIA. P2 is an influ- ential secret society, hardwired into major clandestine networ ks, and known to have chapters around the world. The terrorism cell within P2, it was discovered by I talian police, was called “the Rose of Twenty.” 20 David Yallop, in his book In God’ s Name , states that, “On the surface P2 was and still is a fanatical insurance policy against potential Communist go vern-"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"ments. E xcluding I taly, ther e ar e still branches functioning in Argentina, Venezuela, Paraguay, Bolivia, F rance, Portugal, and N icaragua. Members are even active in Switzerland and the United States. Moreover, P2 interlocks with the Mafia in Italy, Cuba, and the United States. It interlocks with a number of the military regimes of Latin America and with a v ariety of groups of neo-Fas- cists. It also interlocks very closely with the CIA. I t reaches right into the heart of the Vatican. Apparently the common interest of all these elements is a hatred and fear of communism.” 21 Note the parallel with the anti-Communist purpose of the Octopus, as viewed by Danny Casolaro. Kennedy Assassination After the Bay of Pigs invasion, John F. Kennedy promised “to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.” 22 He did not carry out his threat, however, beyond dismissing Allen D ulles in July 1961, and his cohor t Charles Pearre Cabell in December 1961. Richard Helms, as CIA Deputy Direc- tor of P lans, remained. Richard Helms also had the dubious distinction of suggesting to Allen Dulles the creation of the CIA’s infamous MK-ULTRA pro- gram in 1953. 23 Helms became the dir ector of the CIA in 1966. S hortly thereafter, at the time of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison’s prosecu- tion of Clay Shaw, former CIA agent Victor Marchetti overheard Helms during staff meetings repeatedly ask an assistant “ Are we giving Shaw all the help w e can?” 24 Still on board at CIA after K ennedy’s “purge” was E. Howard Hunt, an Octo-spook that Casolaro met on the phone. Hunt had helped set up the Bay of Pigs, was one of the Watergate “plumbers,” and was alleged by one Lee Harvey Oswald familiar to hav e involved him in a mind-contr ol operation. 25 While Kennedy stated to aides that “the CIA will have to be dealt with” before travel- ling to Dallas, the opposite appar ently came true. Persistent allegations placed Hunt and another Watergate burglar, Frank Sturgis, in Dallas on the day of the assassination. Some researchers have also alleged that Sturgis and Hunt were two of the thr ee “hobos” on the railr oad tracks behind the grassy knoll who w ere arrested by Dallas police. 26 Mark Lane, one of the earliest critics of the Warren Commission, documented Hunt’s inability to defend himself in cour t against accusations of his pr esence in D allas in his book, Plausible Denial . 27 One of Lane’s key witnesses in that trial, Marita Lorenz, named E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, Orlando Bosch, Lee Harvey Oswald, the Novo Brothers, Gerry Patrick Hemming and Pedro Diaz Lanz as part of a convoy that traveled from Miami to Dallas for the JFK hit. The Novos were later held for the Lettelier mur ders; Bosch was imprisoned for bombing a C ubana Airlines jet in O ctober 1976, killing seventy-three people. Were these more Octopus hits? 28 78 THE OCTOPUS"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"79 T ENTACLES And what of the G eorge Bush address found in the addr ess book of CIA agent G eorge D eMohrenschildt, a close associate of Lee H arvey O swald’s? DeM ohrenschildt had been a spy for the OSS in German intelligence, and some have speculated that he also may hav e been B ush’s CIA “handler .” 29 Jeanne DeM ohrenschildt alleged that her husband had been a N azi spy, 30 and J. Edgar Hoover had written a memo concerning “Mr . George Bush of the CIA,” who had been briefed on November 23, 1963, about the reaction to Kennedy’s assas- sination by anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Miami. Bush, Helms and Hunt held keys to answers behind the mother of all assas- sination conspiracy tales, as w ell as the strings to an O ctopus puppet who may have had special knowledge regarding JFK’s death: Richard Nixon. The Water- gate tapes of June 23, 1972 have Nixon and H. R. Haldeman, his chief of staff, scheming to put a halt to the FBI inv estigating Watergate because it might expose “the Bay of Pigs thing.” Later, Haldeman said that he believ ed that the “Bay of Pigs” phrase was code for JFK’s assassination. 31 Researcher Paul Kangas points out that the tape r eveals “Nixon discussing the role of Bush’s partner, Robert Mosbacher, as one of the ‘Texas fundraisers for Nix on.’ On the tapes N ixon keeps referring to the ‘C ubans’ and the ‘ Texans.’ The ‘ Texans’ were Bush, Mosbacher and B aker. This is another dir ect link between Bush and evidence linking Nixon and Bush to the Kennedy assassina- tion... In the same discussion N ixon links ‘ the Cubans,’ ‘the Texans,’ Helms, Hunt, Bernard Barker, Robert Mosbacher and ‘the Bay of Pigs.’ Over and over on the Watergate tapes, these names come up around the discussion of the pho- tos from Dallas that Nixon was trying to obtain when he or dered the CIA to burglarize the Watergate.” 32 Frank Sturgis told the San Francisco Chronicle that “the reason we burglarized the Watergate was because N ixon was interested in stopping news leaking relating to the photos of our r ole in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.” 33 In 1976 it was revealed that Richard Helms had lied to the Warren Commission when he said that the CIA had not made contact with Lee Harvey Oswald (Freedom of Information Act documents showed otherwise), but George Bush used Agency pressure through a call to Associated Press to prevent the story from surfacing. 34 The career movements of alleged Octopus member Ted Shackley also illumi- nate Bush’s secret life: from 1952 to 1959 and 1965 to 1966 Shackley worked in Germany; in the 1962 to 1964 period he was S tation Chief in Miami; Shackley became station chief in Saigon and Vientiane from 1964 to 1974 and chief of the CIA’s Far East Division thereafter, while George Bush served as the Ambassador to China. After Bush’s ascension to CIA director, Shackley was promoted to Asso- ciate Deputy Director of Operations, considered the agency’s third most powerful job. Shackley was put in charge of Central American operations. 35"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Another nexus between Casolaro’s research and the JFK assassination con- cerns the Banca del Lavoro, a state-owned Italian bank that he was investigating as part of the BCCI tentacle of the O ctopus. According to the Torbitt Docu- ment, an unpublished report of some controversy among researchers (although there does not seem to be an indication that Casolaro had a copy), the Banca del Lavoro financed the training of an assassination team in Mexico, some of whose members wound up in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. 36 The bank’s branch in Atlanta came under inv estigation for five billion dollars in loans it made to Saddam Hussein prior to the G ulf War, the so-called I raqgate scandal, with George Bush at its center. Southeast Asia The main sour ces of the her oin supply shipped to America since the 1930s were established through the actions of the US intelligence agencies, par ticu- larly the OSS/CIA. B eginning in the mid-‘30s, thr ough a collaboration with the Sicilian-American Mafia and the Corsican under world, the OSS helped create “the French Connection” in Marseilles, France. The CIA, in the early 1950s, also supported the opium-growing Chinese nationalist Kuomintang in the Burmese Shan states. This was accomplished through two dummy corpo- rations, Civil Air Transport (later named Air America) and S ea S upply Corporation, flying in weapons and cash, and flying out raw opium. Sea Sup- ply had been founded b y CIA man P aul H elliwell, who later play ed a prominent role in the B ay of Pigs and other CIA operations against Castr o. Other airlines were partially or wholly owned by the CIA, and were considered part of “Air America.” For a sense of the extent of the CIA ’s power, it should be noted that Air America was the largest airline in the world at the time of the Bay of Pigs. 37 Beginning in 1954, the US began its war against S outheast Asian revolu- tionary movements. This meant collaboration with men like Ngo dinh Nhu, the rich drug dealer who was the br other of South Vietnam’s President Ngo dinh Diem, and tribes like the M ontagnards (or Hmong, whose opium the CIA’s Air America regularly transported). The Montagnard tribesmen assassi- nated an estimated 100,000 non-combatants in Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand. Among the Montagnards in Laos could be found alleged Octopi and CIA Saigon station chief Shackley, with Thomas Clines working in support of drug lord Vang Pao and his M eo tribes, with opium being shipped to M afia lord Santos Trafficante. The Phoenix Project, run by Shackley and Clines (with alleged participation by another supposed Octopus operative, Dr. Earl Brian, as well as M ajor General John Singlaub) in S outh Vietnam in 1974-5, was 80 THE OCTOPUS"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"81 T ENTACLES responsible for killing appr oximately 60,000 civilian Vietnamese, financing said to have been provided by Vang Pao drug monies. It was during this peri- od in Vietnam that Clines and Shackley met arms dealer and rogue-CIA man Edwin Wilson, with whom they were later to become close friends. Wilson is another person alleged by Casolaro to be a member of the Octopus. 38 Shackley is mentioned in a letter fr om the drug lord Khun Sa to the US government dated 28 June 1987: “During the period 1965 to 1975 CIA Chief in Laos Theodore Shackley was in the dr ug business.” The letter also says: “Santos Trafficante acted as his buying and transpor ting agent while Richard Armitage handled the financial section with banks in Australia.” 39 Watergate Danny Casolaro’s investigation of the Octopus continued to note many of the same individuals appearing and re-appearing in the major conspiratorial scan- dals of the era. Casolaro attributed Watergate to the Octopus. Watergate and the fall of the M afia-funded politician Richar d N ixon arguably began in April 1971, on the tenth anniversary of the Bay of Pigs deba- cle. E. Howard Hunt, allegedly retired from the CIA although still working for the CIA fr ont Robert Mullen & Co., travelled to Miami, Florida to r ecruit agents for the White House Special Investigations Unit (the Plumbers) from Bay of Pigs veterans. Richard Helms, an alleged Octopus member and DCI of the CIA at the time, was informed of the formation of the P lumbers on the first day of its operation. The personnel employed in the Watergate burglary were all veterans of the Bay of Pigs, but more importantly, all of them also w ere closely linked to the CIA, either as officials or contract agents. These were E. Howard Hunt, G. Gor- don Liddy, Bernard Barker (E. Howard Hunt’s lieutenant during the Bay of Pigs operation), Agency security specialist J ames McCord, Eugenio Martinez (who had been involved in three hundred fifty-four anti-Cuban forays, only to find himself arrested at Watergate), and Frank Sturgis. The CIA furnished psy cho- logical profiles to the team, and also provided material assistance to Hunt. 40 On J une 17, 1972, the P lumbers were caught in the D emocratic National Committee’s offices at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. Theories as to what the Plumbers were doing in the Democratic headquarters vary from planting or removing an electronic bug, to the theft of a secr et file of information on a prostitution ring which implicated D emocratic party figures, or, in another ver- sion, John Dean. White House aide Chuck Colson came to view the Plumbers as a team whose first purpose was to spy on Richar d Nixon, owing their allegiance only to the CIA. Richar d Nixon also believed, according to his autobiography ,"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon , that he had been trapped: “ The whole thing was so senseless and bungled that it almost looked like some kind of setup .” 41 Casolaro noted: “President Nixon and Attorney General John Mitchell were becoming impossible as far as the O ctopus was concerned. E ven Kissinger was being difficult in bypassing normal circles of intelligence with Vietnamization and the China card.

Helms believed that Nixon was trying to co-opt the po wer of the CIA, and undermine its str ength with plans for a domestic intelligence agency . Apparently Casolaro believed that the Watergate debacle was a CIA (or O ctopus) operation meant to destr oy Nixon and his administration. Assassination in Chile The Octopus thrashed again in 1973 in Chile. S hackley and Clines headed up the “Track II” CIA strategy in Chile, acting in support of DCI Helms and Henry Kissinger in the assassination of democratically-elected P resident S alvador Allende Gossens (the hit allegedly per formed by two Cubans) and eight other assassination attempts against Chilean officials. B y his own admission, John P. Nichols, who later ran the Wackenhut/Cabazon enterprise, was involved in the Allende assassination plot. As Casolaro wrote in his notes, “A different, margin- ally more officious costume was worn in Chile. S ince this operation pr ovided accumulated debt for favors performed, the Octopus was now mature enough to know how to collect those debts. What were the favors performed, and what was the due bill?” 42 Iran, Iraq, Libya, and the “October Surprise” CIA presence in Iran began circa 1953 with Operation Ajax, launched to defend British oil inter ests in the countr y against nationalist inter ests led b y D r. Mohammad Mossadegh. With CIA assistance, the Shah retained control in the country. 43 In 1965, Henry Kissinger masterminded a secr et war employing the Kur ds, supporting the Shah against Iraq. Additional support to the K urds was provided by the Israelis. After the Iraqis launched a major attack against Kurdis- tan, Henry Kissinger washed his hands of the matter , and suspended suppor t. Starting in 1975, Kissinger , CIA Director William Colby, and Shackley inter- vened in Iran in support of governments friendly to the US. By 1980, however, the United States had switched its support to Iraq, in opposition to Iran. 82 THE OCTOPUS"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"83 T ENTACLES In Libya, Edwin Wilson, along with friend and former CIA man Frank Ter- pil, worked for Qaddafi, training his air force, providing airplanes, weapons, and mercenaries, as well as a laboratory for the manufacture of assassination equip- ment and plastic explosives bombs that could be carried thr ough airport metal detectors. Wilson also offered training of Q addafi’s forces in “espionage, sabo- tage, and general psy chological warfare.” During this period Wilson supplied reports on his activities to Theodore Shackley at the Agency, and federal cour t testimony suggests that Wilson was acting thr ough an arrangement with the CIA. Wilson also hired Cuban Bay of Pigs veterans like Rafael “Chi Chi” Quin- tero, whom he had met in 1967, through Thomas Clines. Wilson is said to have made $15 million from this Libyan operation, but it was hardly the only money- making scheme that he was involved in at the time. 44 Casolaro wondered outloud about the actions of the O ctopus: “Who drove the Shah out of po wer? Can best friends do this to each other? [Casolar o may have been referring to the relationship between Helms and the Shah dating from their childhood time together in a S wiss boarding school.] What role did the Octopus play and for what r easons? Who lit the fires for the war betw een Iran and Iraq?” 45 Casolaro asked, “What part did the Octopus play? What was its pur- pose in the big pictur e? Is any picture that big? Jimmy Carter had bruised the Octopus as badly as Nixon did with more directed focus. Why did the Octopus come off the ocean floor for this to make sure no rescue was possible? What hap- pened to those S ea Stallion helicopters, the most dependable helicopter in aviation history? [This refers to the Car ter Administration’s aborted attempt at rescuing the Americans held in I ran.] Everyone knows that hostages equals money but why is it that no one has asked what happened to the billions of dol- lars in frozen assets?” One of the ways in which Jimmy Carter may have “bruised the Octopus,” as Casolaro noted, was through the imposition of a 1979 embar- go on the shipment of arms to Iran. Certainly that bruise healed quickly. Octopus familiar Ted Shackley appeared, after his alleged r etirement from the CIA in 1979, in 1984 negotiations for the shipment of arms to Iran by the Reagan administration. Shackley passed informa- tion from Iranians General Manucher Hashemi and Manucher Ghorbanifar (who had held influential positions in the SAVAK secret police under the Shah and were close to the Ayatollah Khomeini) to Oliver North and alleged P2 member Michael Ledeen in the White House. The Iranians suggested that arms shipments to “mod- erates” such as themselv es in Iran could do much to pr event the Ayatollah fr om taking sides with the Soviets, and could speed the release of the American hostages. The billions of dollars of arms shipments began, using I srael, Taiwan, and South Kor ea as middlemen, as early as 1981, with some of the pr ofits from the Iranian shipments being diverted to help the contra cause in Nicaragua."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Nicaragua During the Reagan administration the holy banner of a war on dr ugs was used to create a war in N icaragua against the S andinistas, funded in par t by illegal drug trafficking. Prior to the arrival of guns from the CIA in 1982, the contras were a rag-tag band, b y reports engaging in mor e cattle rustling than fighting against the Sandinistas. After small success initially against the S andinistas, in 1983 the CIA redoubled its aid to the contras with additional aid, air suppor t, and through the mining of N icaraguan ports. At the same time, contra leaders were negotiating weapons shipments through the Wackenhut/Cabazon arrange- ment in Indio, California. While the CIA was engaging in its merr y little war, Congress was initiating legislation to halt the funding of the contras, and b y 1983 the Boland Amend- ment r estricted abo ve-board funding of the contras. I n violation of this Congressional statute as w ell as international law , the CIA w ent ahead with covert funding and support. After a series of r evelations about US involvement in Nicaragua, however, the contras found that their CIA supplies were beginning to dry up. Private donations were sought, and channelled to the contras through the NSC, with Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver L. North as the official con- tact point for the contras. According to a r eport of the S enate S elect Committee on I ntelligence released in 1987, North worked through at least thr ee accounts at the G eneva branch of Credit Suisse, with monies being channelled to the contras, as w ell as the Mossad and the Afghan r ebels. Albert Hakim and General Richard Secord were signatories on the account. The same branch of Credit Suisse was used by Manucher Gorbanifar—alleged by the CIA to be a shar ed agent of the Mossad and the I ranian Savama intelligence agency (successor agency to SA VAK)—as well as Mossad agent Yacov Nimrodi in the purchase of US armaments for Iran. 46 Bush, Shackley, Clines, Singlaub, Hakim, Felix Rodriguez, and Rafael “Chi Chi” Quintero, pop up again in v arious capacities pr oviding arms to the contras. Another major par ticipant in the contra supply operation was r etired General John Singlaub, who had been spotted in alleged Octopus circles since China dur- ing World War II. 47 Did drug running have anything to do with the secr et government’s war in Nicaragua? Casolaro thought so. In his notes he wrote: “Exploiting foreign pol- icy objectives with the contras in N icaragua is one thing but why was the creation of a Latin American equivalent to the Golden Triangle so irresistable?” 48 Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North’s contra supply operation used known drug traffickers in the transport of weapons to the contras, and those same traffickers shipped drugs bought from the contras into the United States, via military bases 84 THE OCTOPUS"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"85 T ENTACLES which included H omestead Air F orce Base near M iami. Major shipments of drugs were flown out of the ranch of CIA operative John Hull, who met on sev- eral occasions with Oliver North. Jack Blum, Special Prosecutor for Senator John Kerry’s Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and I nternational Operations, said in interview, “There is no doubt in my mind that Oliver North knew about narcotics trafficking....” 49 Blum is not the only one who linked N orth to drug trafficking. According to Tim Ross, a veteran BBC broadcaster in Columbia, “I n late ‘84, early ‘85, Nor th brought five Afghani military advisers to Columbia on a speaking tour , three left, two stayed. The two that stayed were chemists who introduced hero- in manufacturing to Columbia. H e also brought in an I sraeli agronomist who helped to cultivate opium poppies.” 50 Although North has denied any involvement in drug trafficking, some entries in his diaries ar e difficult to explain. J uly 9, 1984: “... wanted air craft to go to Bolivia to pick up paste, want aircraft to pick up 1,500 kilos.” July 12, 1985: “$14 million to finance Supermarket came from drugs.” The term “Supermarket” refers to a Honduran weapons depot which was used for contra re-supply. 51 After North left the National Security Council due to his part in the Iran-con- tra affair, a handwritten flowchart of some of his covert network (which he labeled “Project Democracy”) was disco vered in his safe. P roject Democracy had been authorized by Reagan’s National Security Decision Directive 77, while North had been appointed b y NSC dir ector Robert McFarlane to head up the co vert net- works. North’s flowchart lists approximately twenty “Resource Development” and “Financial Management” companies as well as gun-running operations (including Amalgamated Commer cial E nterprises, S outhern Air Transport, Trans World Arms, Defex-Portugal, and Udall Research Corporation) linked to the CIA’s Gen- eral Secord, Albert Hakim, Ted Shackley, and Thomas Clines. One factor links the majority of these companies: funding fr om the National Endowment for Democracy. 52 NED includes in its management Henry Kissinger, Sally Shelton Colby (the wife of ex-CIA dir ector William Colby), Barbara Haig (Alexander Haig’s daughter), John Richardson (of the CIA, a former law partner in Allen Dulles’ Nazi-linked firm, Sullivan and Cromwell), Carl Gershman (former head of Social Democrats, USA and the Young People’s Socialist Alliance), and Jay Lovestone (founder of the Communist P arty, USA). Links lead fr om Gershman and Lovestone to the Trust, the Bolshevik group led by Trotsky and Bukharin and financed by the Morgan Guaranty Trust (a company run almost entirely by Skull and Bones members), and associated with Dulles’ Sullivan and Cromwell law firm. When Dulles formed the CIA, Lovestone’s Socialist labor operations were merged with it, forming the American Institute for Free Labor Development.

Kissinger is alleged to have joined a KGB homosexual spy ring which had pene- trated EUCOM G-2 headquar ters in Oberammergau, Germany at World War II’s end. Kissinger is also closely connected to the Chatham House British intel- ligence think tank, the nexus of post-Round Table New World Order influence. 54 In 1983, the NED was organiz ed as a “ private foundation,” although financed by Congress to the tune of eighty million dollars. I ts “private” status kept it safe from Freedom of Information requests as well as governmental audits. NED has been involved in hundreds of programs as a “private CIA,” including destabilizations of President Marcos of the Philippines and the Panamanian gov- ernment, support for the Nazi PAN party in Mexico, channeling of money to the contras, and support for operatives of the Medellin drug cartel. Some observers have stated that the NED’s operations are more extensive and more effective than those of the CIA. 55 The NED has been alleged to be a private intelligence network with the pur- pose of establishing a fascist, corporatist world state, a theme which also seems to inform the movements of Casolaro’s Octopus. The model of this state can be observed in Michael Ledeen’s book, Universal Fascism , in which he extolls a fas- cist state based upon the ideals of Gabriele d’Annunzio, Mussolini’s predecessor. Ledeen was connected to P-2, which was in turn connected to the NSC. 56 Reporting directly to North (as well as being a consultant in the Pentagon and State Department) was M ichael Ledeen. Ledeen was r esponsible for obtaining Israeli Mossad spy Jonathan Pollard his job in the D epartment of the Navy, for establishing a line of Israeli influence into the NSC, and is known in Italy to have been a member of the Propaganda Due (P2) Masonic lodge. P2, with a member- ship believed to include Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig, is the organization known to have taken over the highest levels of Italian government and responsi- ble during the ‘70s and ‘80s for an attempted bankr upting of the Vatican, in an alliance that linked the P2, the KGB, and major networks of drug trade. The Wall Street Journal detailed a meeting between Alexander Haig, Michael Ledeen, and high-ranking P2 member and number two man in I talian intelli- gence Francesco Pazienza. Pazienza is said to have been involved in shipments of US arms to Iran arranged by the Reagan administration. 57 The direct historical antecedent of P2 was the P ropaganda Uno lodge of Freemasons Giacomo Mazzini and Albert Pike.

Is this the essence of the philosophy of the men in Casolar o’s Octopus? 58 The October Surprise The October Surprise, if factual, can be viewed as yet another stunning coup d’e- tat , like the assassination of K ennedy and the ouster of N ixon. The October Surprise is the persistent allegation that individuals high in the administration of Ronald Reagan had, with or without the pr esident’s knowledge, arranged for fifty-two American hostages held in I ran to be detained until after his election, thus stealing the thunder (and a landslide of v otes) from his opponent, Jimmy Carter, derailing his reelection. Casolaro on the October Surprise (as well as the Inslaw case), excerpted from his Behold, a Pale Horse book proposal: “While rumors of the hostage release delay circulated for years after the election of Ronald Reagan, it wasn’t until 1988 that testimony [was] offer ed by two covert operatives in two different courts regarding their knowledge and participation of a hostage-release stall managed b y then Reagan campaign chief William Casey. But now, two more covert operatives have emerged from that desert reservation in the journey of this stor y effort to confirm that pr evious testimony and pr ovide richer details regarding the laundered payment by the Saudis and other particularities in order to prevent what Casey feared the most, a surprise release of the hostages before the election almost guaranteeing windfall v otes for P resident Jimmy Carter. The alleged reward to another Reagan insider for that mission to Iran in the summer of 1980 has been almost wholly responsible for the leaks leading to this odyssey. For it was in that reward in the form of a multimillion dollar go vernment contract that technologies were found to have been stolen by the government from another com- pany. In that other company’s recovery from bankruptcy, its CEO has been the real life star and gumshoe in this drama that continues to unfold each day .” 59 Casolaro also wrote: “Since Reagan was not a favored son of the octopus, why did it work so hard to insure his selection in 1980? Even if the participation by campaign officials in holding the hostages until the election was limited to just the acquiescence of smiling gentlemen who kne w better, why was the v eil removed when it could have been so absolutely secret?” 60 Casolaro obviously believed in stories that a deal had been struck by George Bush and other members of the R eagan administration with the Ayatollah Khomeini to detain the hostages.

The evidence for the “O ctober Surprise” begins with statements of A bolhassan Bani-Sadr, the former president of Iran, who claimed after-the-fact knowledge of the event. Another source backing up the Bani-Sadr story was Ari Ben-Menashe, a member of I sraeli intelligence, who corr oborated Bani-Sadr and also offer ed insider knowledge about the Inslaw case. Other sources varied in terms of their credibility. Additionally suggestive is that there is a twenty-one hour gap in George Bush’s schedule corresponding to the time he is supposed to have been in Paris negotiating the hostage detainment, and con- flicting stories from Bush and his staff about what he was doing when the alleged negotiation with the Iranians took place. In an affidavit Attorney Paul D. Wilcher sent to Attorney General Janet Reno, he too detailed the existence of a “S hadow Government,” parallelling in precise terms the Casolaro Octopus, and their partic- ipation in the O ctober Surprise: “The October Surprise treason refers to the top secret trip then-Vice Presidential candidate and former CIA Director George Bush (along with a planeful of some tw enty-five to thirty other top CIA co vert opera- tives—including a handful of prominent Republican and Democratic Senators and Congressmen) took to Paris on the weekend of October 18th and 19th, 1980. While in P aris, B ush secr etly met with r epresentatives of the Ayatollah Khomeini, paid them bribes in the amount of $40 million, and promised to deliv- er to the man additional $5 billion in arms (the shipments of these arms began flowing even before the election), in exchange for the Iranians’ agreement NOT to release the fifty-two American hostages they held in Tehran until after the Nov ember 4th, 1980, US Presidential elections—in order to guarantee the humil- iation and defeat of P resident Jimmy Carter in that election—and in or der to cement the CIA’s lock on the White House for the next twelve years under George Bush. The Reagan and Bush Administrations—and Congress, in separate House and Senate October Surprise investigations in 1992 —have tried to tell us that the October Surprise never happened—that Bush and his CIA cr onies never made this secret trip to Paris on October 18th and 19th, and that no secr et deal with the Iranians was ever struck.

Here, in an endeavor run by one of the largest private police forces in the world, contras and criminals bargained for arms ship- ments, and met with CIA operativ es. Here, testing of fuel-air explosiv es were allegedly performed, a technology said to hav e been used later b y extremist Islamic groups against the US military in Iran. Here, the voicing of an unwant- ed opinion, as in the case of Fred Alvarez, might leave your life forfeit. With his investigation of the Cabazon reservation, Danny Casolaro was treading on dan- gerous ground, indeed. Many of the events that took place in the final days of Danny Casolaro’s life are connected to Wackenhut. Casolaro was investigating the unsolved murders of Alvarez and his friends on the Cabazon reservation—and planned to visit the reservation. Casolaro’s death is alleged to hav e occurred shortly after he had requested an interview with John Philip Nichols about the Cabazon/Wackenhut collaboration. Casolaro’s contact with two women who looked “ too good to be true,” may have been just that. Wackenhut has been sho wn to use women to compromise their targets, as in Wackenhut covert operations connected to the Alaskan pipeline.

Gough Whitlam, the Labor Party candidate elected prime min- ister of Australia in 1972, was concerned about the cozy relationship between the ASIO, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, and the CIA, and that ASIO had gone rogue. This in turn caused concern at the CIA. Ted Shackley is said to have gone “paranoid” and to have ordered a dimunition of the informa- tion made available to them, while Ray Cline mentions “a period of turbulence to do with Alice Springs.” Fearing the curtailment of their Australian operations due to an approach- ing renewal date for the P ine Gap base, the CIA flex ed their muscles, and perhaps a couple of tentacles. O n November 8, 1975, a message of pr otest about Prime Minister Whitlam was sent by Theodore Shackley to the head of ASIO. On May 11, 1975, the CIA and OSS-connected G overnor General of Australia John Kerr removed Whitlam as the head of government, using con- stitutional pretext. According to CIA analyst K evin Mulcahy, the CIA effor t was headed by Milton Wonus, a friend of N ugan Hand Bank’s (and possibly the CIA’s) Bernie Houghton. 64 After removing Whitlam from office, the Octopus was still not finished with Australia. At 4 A.M. on January 27, 1980, the body of banker Frank Nugan was found in his Mercedes in Lithgow, Australia. He had died from a single gunshot from the .30 caliber rifle which lay on the seat beside him. Nugan had been half owner, with partner Michael Jon Hand, in Nuhan Ltd., a group of banks found- ed in 1973, whose most visible subsidiar y was Nugan Hand bank in A ustralia (and whose name is usually applied to the enterprise). H and had been a Green Ber et in Vietnam, working closely with Air America, his commanding officer at the time being William Colby. Hand is also alleged by former associates to have been a drug-runner. The deceased Frank Nugan had been a lawy er in A ustralia.

It seems to be mor e of an independent organization with former CIA people connected with it, and they ’re in business to make money, but because of their close personal relationship with the agency they will do favors for the Agency. “This would include providing cover in some instances for operators, it would include laundering of money, it would include cutouts for any sort of highly clan- destine activity the Agency is involved in but does not want to be any way directly connected with. When these organizations cooperate with the agency, the Agency uses its influence, both dir ectly within the go vernment and indir ectly through other proprietaries and through other friendly organizations within the establish- ment, to throw business the company’s way because they want the company to flower and succeed because it provides good cover for them.” 66 Shortly after the death of Nugan, Michael Hand, Yates, and CIA-connected alleged drug-runner Bernie Houghton led a group of former Southeast Asia mil- itary operativ es in sev eral ransackings of N ugan H and files. A r oomful of documents were shredded in the process. 67 Inquiries following the death of Nugan found that Nuhan Ltd., which had been claimed to have moved one billion dollars through its channels each year, was flat broke. The company was placed under the control of a bankruptcy court. With prosecution of the bank pending, in J une, 1980, Michael Hand and Bernie Houghton fled Australia and vanished. The only lead about the curr ent whereabouts of Michael Hand is offered by the anonymous Com-12 document: “Hand is currently the most wanted individual the Australian government has its sights on. He is living in the M iddle East under the pr otection of an I slamic group by the name of the ‘Grey Wolves.’” 68 The business of N ugan Hand was laundering money , particularly money connected to illegal activities, including the sale of dr ugs.

Millions of blacks in these countries were not allowed to vote, and their efforts to take control of their homelands were characterized by the CIA and Establishment press as Communist. Arms sales to these white minority go vern- ments were engineered by Edwin Wilson with B ernie Houghton and M ichael Hand representing Nugan Hand, which provided financing. 71 An anonymous but intriguing document is the Kiwi G emstone, alternately known as the O pal File, provided a gr eat deal of additional information about Nugan Hand, placing the operation within a greater international Mafia context. 72 Egypt In 1979 Edwin Wilson and Theodore Shackley formed EATSCO, the Egypt- ian American Transport and Services Corporation, which, according to some sources, obtained an exclusive and highly lucrative Pentagon contract to ship US arms to E gypt. Wilson also included in the par tnership Richard Secord, Thomas Clines, Hussein K. Salem, and Erich von Marbod (at the time Deputy Dir ector of the Defense Security Assistance Agency in the P entagon). Secord and his partners were indicted in 1983 for $8 million in “billing abuses” to the government. Michael Ledeen, at the time a State Department advisor, stepped in, suggesting to US Attorney E. Lawrence Barcella that the overcharged funds may have been used for the funding of black operations (thus r endering them a “hands-off” proposition for prosecution).

Part of the information that was in transit with these now-deceased individuals was material which could be used to destroy the “Enterprise.” Included was the connection to the Syrian drug smuggling ring and the man by the name of Manozar Al-Kassar. Kas- sar was deeply involved in the drugs and arms for hostages deal with Secord, North, Poindexter, Hakim, and all the others of the Black Rose Group. McKee’s operation uncovered an Aqua-Tech group (CIA deep cover opera- tives) which was actually the team the CIA employed to help provide cover protection, safe routing and screening procedures for the Middle East drug- running operations. Part of their duties was to cover and deflect interest from other intelligence offices from Europe and other countries, especially US agencies and, in particular, another deep cover operation working some- where within the Office of Naval Intelligence. The ONI [Office of Naval Intelligence] Group is working currently to topple the “Enterprise” and restore the intelligence community to fall back within the guidelines of their original intent. The most pertinent of their motives is a sal- vage operation on the US Constitution and the prevention of an extreme right-wing, fascist wing within the US government and intelligence commu- nities (known to many as Aquarius or the Fourth Reich [Order of the Rose]). West German intelligence and Mossad uncovered the fact that a bomb had been placed on board PanAm Flight 103 by detecting a different briefcase than the one regularly used by the drug smuggler. As mentioned, McKee’s team was on board the same flight with key evidence which would be dev- astating to the “Enterprise.” When the bomb information was relayed to the proper sources, the reporting agencies were ordered by the CIA Cover Oper- ations Group to “Disregard.” The parameters of this operation reach to the highest levels of many world governments.

Profits accrued from the looting of the S&Ls were some- times used in the financing of the contra movement. Predictably, the CIA moved to block the investigation of operatives connected to the S & L and bank failures. One case of an S&L nosediv e is instr uctive. Stefan Halper and Harvey D. McClean, Jr. were co-workers on the 1980 Bush campaign. Halper had also been the son-in-law of alleged Octopus member Ray Cline. McClean was connected to organized crime figure Herman K. Beebe, an associate of Mafia don Carlos Mar- cello. Beebe provided funding for the Palmer National Bank, which Halper and McClean founded in 1983. Palmer Bank engaged in lending to persons and orga- nizations providing aid to the contras, funds which included money sent to Oliver North’s Swiss bank accounts. Halper later set up the legal defense fund for North. Another bank failure was Vision Banc Savings, owned by Robert I. Corson, identified as a money launderer by federal sources, and also reputed to be a CIA operative. Corson’s bank was involved in a number of highly lucrativ e land pur- chases and resales in 1986. These transactions, according to the Christic Institute, were made by buyers connected to the CIA and the M afia, using a por tion of Manuel Noriega’s cocaine profits. After the funds were transferred to Vision Banc, they were transferred as unsecured loans to a number of companies inv olved in the funding of the contras and r un by Richard Secord. Secord and Theodore Shackley were both on the receiving end of funds in the collapse of several S&Ls. The George Bush family also took advantage of the virtually unregulated state of the industry. Bush sons Jeb and Neil both made out like bandits fr om the col- lapse of S&Ls. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) absorbed a $4.6 million loan that Jeb Bush and Armando Codina (the leader of the right-wing Cuban American National Foundation) had defaulted on to the B roward Federal Savings and Loan in Sunrise, Florida, despite the partners’ possession of posh real estate holdings in Miami. Neil Bush and two partners in Good International, Inc. defaulted on $132 million in loans from Silverado Banking Savings and Loan, for which Bush had served on the Board of Directors from 1985 to 1988. Bush had not disclosed his connections to the firm when arranging the loan. Neil Bush is also connected, through the receipt of an $86 million dollar loan to his company, to Robert Corson and Herman Beebe, Sr., the figures mentioned above in the collapse of S&Ls. Brother Jeb Bush is also connected to Wayne Reed- er, an associate of B eebe, who defaulted on a $14 million loan fr om Silverado.

BCCI was engaged in laundering money fr om drug profits and arms-trade, pr oviding banking for known international terrorists, and the razing of national tr easuries. BCCI was also at hand for the National Security Council when it needed a conduit for con- tra money or for other covert measures. An informant stated to Time magazine that, “BCCI was a full-ser vice bank. They not only financed arms deals that one go vernment or another wanted to keep secret, they shipped the goods in their o wn ships, insured them with their own agency and provided manpower and security. They worked with intelligence agencies from all the Western countries and did a lot of business with East bloc countries.” 76 Time quoted an unnamed American State Department official who said, “when you look at the S audi support of the contras, ask y ourself who the middleman was: ther e was no go vernment-to-government connection betw een the Saudis and Nicaragua... “It was BCCI that financed and brokered [Chinese] Silkworm missiles that went to Saudi Arabia, and those were equipped with sophisticated Israeli guidance systems. When you couldn’t sue dir ect government transfers or national banks, BCCI was there to hot-wire the connections between Saudi Arabia, China, and Israel.” 77 Drugs were a major part of the revenues of the bank. According to a US intelligence officer quoted by Time, “If BCCI is such an embarrassment to the US that forthright investigations are not being pursued, it has a lot to do with the blind eye the US turned to the heroin trafficking in Pakistan.” 78 Among the clients of BCCI w ere Manuel Noriega, Ferdinand Marcos, Sad- dam H ussein, and the P alestinian terr orist A bu N idal. When BCCI w ent belly-up, investigators estimated that $10 billion or mor e was missing fr om the bank’s coffers. 79 According to US investigators, the US Justice Department acted to interfere in probes of bank illegalities, including the blocking of a deposition by a key wit- ness. Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau stated, “We have had no cooperation from the Justice Department since we first asked for records in March 1990. In fact they are impeding our investigation, and Justice Department repre- sentatives are asking witnesses not to cooperate with us.” 80 Researcher Sherman Skolnick discussed BCCI and the October Surprise: “A source on the committee r ecently told me that the committee wanted to bring out the fact that there are large private business deals—not government to government, but private business deals—between George Bush and former Pana-"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"96 THE OCTOPUS manian dictator General Manuel Noriega and between Bush and Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. “These deals went through BCCI and through another bank which interfaces with BCCI, the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). However, there’s great pres- sure not to bring that out at the hearings. “So can we have confidence in Kerry’s committee? You can judge for yourself. Kerry is, along with P resident Bush, a member of the S kull & Bones Society at Yale University... Kerry is also chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which has received campaign contributions from BCCI. Kerry him- self received a $5,000 contribution from BCCI officials.” 81 The connection of BCCI to P resident Bill Clinton was discussed in an inter- view with Tom Brown, who investigated both the Mena, Arkansas drug and arms transshipment point (See Chapter 20), as well as the “Bank of Crooks and Crimi- nals, International.” Brown mentioned Stephens Inc., stating that, “This company is one of the biggest bond sales and inv estment banking firms in the countr y. It’s located right in Little R ock, Arkansas and has a dispr oportionate influence on the government of the state of Arkansas. Back in 1977, Stephens Inc. invited some peo- ple from BCCI to come into this country, and they set up the purchase of what has now become First American Bankshares in Washington. Now in December of 1991 the Arkansas Democrat had a report entitled ‘Reports Link Stephens to BCCI.’ The story was written by Hal Brown and identifies the same Curt Bradbury not only as a former Stephens employee, but as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Worthen National Bank. Bradbury is quoted as saying, ‘First of all, I don’t know anything about any BCCI ties, and neither do y ou.’ This is in December of 1991. Remember, it was in 1977 that Stephens, Inc. invited BCCI into this country and organized the whole BCCI takeover of Clark Clifford’s First American Bankshares. It just so happens Stephens Inc. owns 38 percent of Worthen National Bank. Now we go back to August of 1991. At that time there was another article in the now- defunct Arkansas Gazette . This article was entitled ‘Little Rock on the BCCI route to power.’ The article was written by Paul Barton. I quote this article: ‘Curt Brad- bury, then a financial analyst for S tephens Inc., and no w chairman and chief executive officer of Worthen National Bank of Arkansas provided [a BCCI officer] research about F inancial General, including a copy of its latest r eport. Financial General was the parent company of the National Bank of Georgia, the bank run by Bert Lance [longtime crony of former President Jimmy Carter].’ “That purchase of F inancial General and the N ational Bank of G eorgia is what evolved into First American Bankshares, the Clark Clifford bank in Wash- ington. What is the Clinton connection? Worthen National Bank (headed by the aforementioned Bradbury) gave Clinton a $2.5 million line of credit for his pres- idential campaign.” 82"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"97 T ENTACLES No less of an Establishment mouthpiece than Time magazine has talked about the connections of BCCI to an organization called “ the black network,” which “functions as a global intelligence operation and a Mafia-like enforcement squad. Operating primarily out of the bank ’s offices in Karachi, P akistan, the 1,500- employee black network has used sophisticated spy equipment and techniques, along with bribery, extortion, kidnapping and even, by some accounts, murder.” One wonders if this “black networ k” might not be identical to G eorge Bush’s Black Rose, and a controlling tentacle of Casolaro’s Octopus. 83 An Arab operative of the Black Network states, “I was recruited by the black network in the early 1980s. They came to me while I was in school in the US; they spoke my language, knew all my friends and gave me money. They told me they wanted me to join the organization, and described its w ealth and political power, but at first they never said exactly what the organization did.” 84 Summary What Danny Casolaro had come to see was a collusion of international crime and political power focused around a handful of men, primarily CIA operatives, who had banded together after World War II. Following the associations that Casolaro made, starting with the OSS in Albania, the trail of mur der and conspiracy led from this tight net of good old bo ys in US intelligence to a complex w eave of major international criminals and po wer brokers; to N azis and fascists at least sometimes wearing the uniform of the US militar y, to drug trafficking networks melding seamlessly into international banking; to priv ate armies and death squads; to secret societies such as Skull & Bones and P2; to men busily engaged in looting banking institutions and national treasuries; and to the presidents and potentates of the world. These men reaped and are still reaping staggering profit while at the same time constr ucting omnipresent world criminal and fascist net- works—and all in the name of anti-Communism. What Danny Casolaro planned to expose was an O ctopus indeed, and cer- tainly no figment of his imagination. ———— 1.

Bill Hamilton noted that a number of Casolaro’s contacts involved in US intelligence warned him that some of the leads he was following could be fatal. 1 Hamilton also claimed that, “Danny was planning to go to a par ticular facility in the Washing- ton, DC area, owned by the United States government, a facility with connections to one or more of the people who run ‘the Octopus.’ I think you can assume it’s a covert intelligence facility, from the way that it ’s presented. And just going to this facility, I was warned, could get him killed. The other thing that he was doing was making inquiries, over the telephone, to the S yndicate in Los Angeles. And those inquiries had rattled the cages of some people out there. And there was some concern that they might respond to the rattling by killing Danny. The claim that I have heard from some sources is that someone with mob responsibilities (I guess you’d call it)—some person in the mob—is a member of the leadership of ‘ the Octopus’ and it’s someone from the Los Angeles mob. And Danny was on to it.” The whereabouts of this security installation was communicated to Danny Caso- laro by Robert Nichols. 2 Casolaro had also received threats from a man associated with the matters he was investigating among the Cabazons. “Now that you know this stuff you will have to die,” he quoted to a friend as one threat against his life that he linked to his investigations of Indian reservations. 3 As R obert Booth N ichols passed warnings to Casolar o about M ichael Riconosciuto, Riconosciuto was warning him about N ichols. Riconosciuto said that he mentioned to Nichols an attempt by the Cali cocaine cartel to stop the extradition of an alleged Columbian dr ug-runner named G ilberto Rodriquez Orejuela and Nichols, “went ballistic.” Riconosciuto later implied that Casolaro may have died for the sake of this information, “B ut by the time I heard about it, there was nothing I could do, you know, except to warn Danny.

Every day I was calling the Hamiltons, asking if anybody had heard from Danny. And I was frantic.” 4 Toward the end, coincidences began to enshr oud Casolaro. A woman he picked up at a par ty surprised him with the depth of her kno wledge about his research and the claim that she knew someone connected to the Octopus. He ran into a friend of P eter Videnieks, the Justice Department official Riconosciuto accused of threatening him, at a restaurant. The man claimed to have served in Special Forces and had pr eviously worked for a company connected to I nslaw. He had been so forthcoming with information that he alarmed Casolaro’s com- panions. Casolaro experienced “ queer coincidences that would feed any one’s paranoia.” 5 The Hamiltons believed that in the last days of his life Danny Caso- laro was being tailed b y a man named Joseph Cuellar, an Army special ser vices officer and friend of Peter Videnieks. 6 On S unday, August 4, Casolaro attended a pool party at real estate agent and close friend D anielle Stalling. Stalling had attempted to subdivide Casolar o’s property for sale to provide him with badly needed funds. Stalling noticed Caso- laro’s concern over threats to his life. H e convinced his brother John, who had been staying with him, to move to other quarters. 7 On M onday, August 5, Caso- laro’s housekeeper, Olga, came by his home to find Casolar o conferring with a man in the kitchen. Olga described the man as heavy and possibly East Indian. 8 That same day, Casolaro telephoned Bill McCoy, a retired Army CID officer liv- ing in Fairfax. They discussed the Octopus and Casolaro claimed that Time has given him the go-ahead for an ar ticle about it. He also told McCoy that Time- Warner had agreed to finance his wor k. Both claims w ere later denied b y the Time-Warner gr oup. Casolar o also described to M cCoy a r ound-the-world excursion in which he planned to inv estigate the O ctopus, financed b y the advance money. Casolaro wanted to visit thirteen countries in two months, fin- ishing the trip off with a visit to arms mer chant Edwin Wilson at an I llinois prison. Casolaro noted in his papers: “ When the A dvance Comes, R OAST PIG—SUMMER PARTY.” He feels that he has his quarr y in his literary sights and saw the main dish as an ironic statement. 9 Tony Casolaro saw his brother on Monday, August 5, and thought he looked tired. Danny said he’d been getting threatening calls in the middle of the night, ruining his sleep , adding that the calls had been going on for about thr ee months. 10 A close friend, Ben Mason, appeared at Casolaro’s house around 3:30 PM, and although M ason was anxious to go to a r estaurant to eat, Casolar o retrieved five pages of material from a box and showed it to Mason. The first page had information on contra arms transfers, allegedly involving Adman Khashoggi. Two more pages were photocopies of BCCI checks for one million and four mil- lion dollars, drawn on Adman Khashoggi and Manucher Ghorbanifar accounts."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"104 THE OCTOPUS These checks had been known to researchers since 1987 or earlier. Another page contained a passport photo of Hassan Ali Ibrahim Ali, said to be the man- ager of Sitico, allegedly a front for Iraqi arms deals. From the way Casolaro spoke to Mason, it seemed that he had met I brahim. Doug Vaughan’s research deter- mined that the pages had come fr om Bob Bickel, who had gotten them fr om Richard Brenneke, another figur e prominent in Casolar o’s research, someone who had provided testimony about the O ctober Surprise. Casolaro had Mason look at an outline for the Octopus book, and mentioned that he was discouraged about his agent’s inability to sell the book. H e said that he dr eaded the idea of obtaining a new agent. 11 In contrast to what he said to McCoy, he had received his third rejection, this one fr om Little, Brown and Company. Casolaro knew that there was a $178,000 balloon payment due on his home Mortgage. He had taken at least two loans. 12 Did Casolaro have a reasonable expectation that he would sell the book and receive the elusiv e advance? Some critics, notably D avid Corn in the Nation, commented on the “ overly dramatic, purplish pr ose” evidenced b y Casolaro’s notes (James Kilpatrick said associates had considered his style “florid”), and his other works were virtually self-published. In his notes and drafts, ho wever, the published fiction sho ws pr ofessionally spar e wor k, suggesting that Casolar o began with r ough, almost str eam-of-consciousness drafts that he subsequently polished into something tighter. His finished prose was certainly not worse than much that is published by mainstream book publishers. While he knew that con- spiratorial fiction a la R obert Ludlum could be lucrativ e for publishers, that Casolaro planned to fictionaliz e his view of the O ctopus was at odds with his eagerness to pr ove the tr uth of the sea-beast ’s existence. Perhaps he had plans beyond the single manuscript. Danny Casolaro’s investigations were never less than far-reaching. Harry V. Mar tin, reporting later in the Napa Sentinel , listed some of the subjects Caso- laro was gathering information on during this period: D ominic and Bob Bolsano; Gemini Industries; the Papago Indian tribe; the Menominee Indian tribe; gold and platinum smuggling from Southeast Asia, via Mexico, through the Papago reservation in New Mexico, and gold smuggling from South Viet- nam; the Cabazon Indian tribe, the murders and political intrigue connected to it, as w ell as the attendant issues r egarding sovereign tribal land and the weapons/gun traffic; the P rimerit Bank of N evada; BCCI and other r elated institutions; Dr. Earl Brian; Peter Videnieks; Community Banking of South- ern California; H ome Savings of S eattle; Theodore Strand; Robert Booth Nichols; Department of Commerce EDA funds; the Wackenhut Corporation; former Bank of America dir ector Bill Jenson; the death of journalist D on Bolles; a corridor between Mexico and New Mexico which the Drug Enforce-"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"105 B RINGING B ACK THE H EAD OF THE O CTOPUS ment Agency r efused to patr ol; an IBM-T el Aviv connection linking the PROMIS software to Israeli intelligence. Casolaro had also dev eloped arcane avenues of research into Nevada’s mysterious Area 51, the human genome pro- ject, 13 and ev en, his notes r eflected (perhaps as backgr ound on M ichael Riconosciuto), psychedelic history, specifically Ken Kesey and Billy Hitchcock, who helped fund Timothy Leary’s Millbrook commune. These topics have preoccupied the computer nets and writings of those inter- ested in conspiracy theories befor e and since Casolar o became their cyber-folk hero. They certainly could have been fodder for a writing career. The volume of the accumulation alone suggested that Casolaro had plans for the future with or without the magical advance. In fact, he had cast his original proposal as a series of articles and a book. Casolar o did have a mild form of multiple scler osis, an often debilitating disease fatal to a small per centage of its sufferers. It may have caused him moments of disorientation, but he did not feel str ongly enough about it to have it treated and he did not discuss it with people close to him. I n fact, most did not know about it until after Casolaro’s autopsy. The one talk he did have about MS, with friend and nursing teacher Ann Marie Winfield, ended with an assurance from her that it probably was not serious and her obser vance that Casolaro did not seem concerned or suicidal over it. 14 If he was suicidal, his behavior contradicted it. H e visited the office of his insurance agent and made a payment on his house insurance. 15 According to one report, “A review of his financial records indicated that he had made a July mort- gage payment of about $2000, and still had $2,700 in his bank account. 16 On T uesday, August 6, Casolaro finished what he was wor king on, having working steadily at the typewriter since the previous day. His housekeeper Olga assisted him in packing a black leather bag, and watched him pack papers into a briefcase. When she lifted the briefcase, she found it heavy. Casolaro told her, “I have all my papers...Wish me luck. I’ll see you in a couple of days.” He hugged Olga and she crossed her fingers for good luck. Suicide? “Not in a million years!” his cousin and sometimes drinking partner Jim Gualteri would later insist, “D anny wasn’t a coward. He wasn’t afraid. He would have never done that. Danny had a regular girlfriend. He was a good per- son. H e was a sw eetheart who liked to laugh a lot. D anny was a pr etty happy-go-lucky guy. He was very happy with his life. I would call D anny very inquisitive. Writing was a great passion in his life. H e was writing a book that would blow everybody’s mind away in terms of revelations about the government and all the sinister things that were going on.” 17 Before leaving the house, Casolaro received a call from Ben Mason. “Danny was upbeat,” Mason said. “He was enthusiastic about his sour ce in West Vir- ginia.” 18 Mason had called to discuss Casolar o’s financial situation—a topic"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"106 THE OCTOPUS Casolaro had also discussed with another friend, Art Weinfield. Both Mason and Weinfield had concurr ed with Casolar o on the impor tance of getting that advance, and Casolaro told Mason that if it were not forthcoming he would have had to borrow from his family, as he had done many times in the past. 19 Jim Gualteri affirmed this last point: “Knowing how close the family was, they would have never left Danny in the lurch for money. Very close-knit family.” 20 Shortly before his trip to Martinsburg, Casolaro called Virginia McCullough. They had often discussed the idea that members of the go vernment might have been engaging in drug running in order to fund guns. Casolaro told McCullough, “You know, Virginia, I’m becoming a believ er.” McCullough said that Casolar o sounded “distressed, but distressed ... because he had to face the tr uth.” At the same time, McCullough recalled, “he sounded very upbeat. When he came back he would have Justice right where he wanted them in the Inslaw matter.” 21 Casolaro had also called Albr o Lundy Jr. of Beverly Hills approximately a week before his death. Lundy recounted that Casolaro related that he was close to finding out who was in control of the Octopus, and made a new connection: to the issue of missing Vietnam POWs and MIAs. 22 One of the r easons Casolaro went to Martinsburg was to inter view for a second time one or mor e members of the staff of S enator Robert Byrd. The interview had been planned for F riday night, August 9, 1991. Casolar o had mentioned to the Hamiltons that one chapter of the Octopus book would be about Senator Byrd. He believed the secrets that would crack the I nslaw case resided with members of Byrd’s staff. He also told Bill Turner that he was going to meet with two of Byrd’s staff, one of whom was related to Mrs. Peter Vide- nieks. Reporter Sarah McClendon said that Casolaro had spoken with Mr. and Mrs. Peter Videnieks. Mrs. Videnieks is Byrd’s chief of staff in his Washington office, and had two r elatives working on B yrd’s staff. 23 Bill Hamilton also claimed that the M artinsburg stay was supposed to inv olve a meeting with Videnieks and Earl Brian. 24 “He had been researching this thing for a long time and was very excited about the information he was finally getting,” said B en Mason. “He was in good spirits and very excited about the source he was going to see in West Virginia. There is no way in the world that he would have killed himself.” 25 “He had been digging into stuff for months and getting no where,” Casolaro’s brother Tony said in a telephone interview. “Then, suddenly, he said he had this big br eakthrough, some source he had.” Danny had also told his brother that if an “ accident” befell him, not to believ e it. A ccording to B ill McCoy, Casolaro made one more call on August 5, to Bob Bickel, a Texas oil engineer and former C ustoms Bureau informant, and told him that he was going to bring back the head of the Octopus.

A note fr om Arthur Pallotta to Casolar o attached to an unidentified ar ticle in Casolar o’s newsclippings file on the human genome pr oject and its first dir ector, James Watson, read: “Danny—Cannot think of one pr oject so massive and comparable to the ‘M an In The Moon.’” The $3 billion H uman Genome Organization (HUGO) wor ked to decode the human genetic structure. Its director, James Watson, co-discoverer with Francis Crick of DNA, resigned over con- flict of interest questions regarding his stock ownership in companies like E li Lilly, Angen, Inc., and Ongene Science, Inc., charges that Watson bitterly denied. Moral and ethical issues of genet- ic testing and genetic degradation haunt genome r esearch, but its potential to cur e disease is enormous—as is the potential for pr ofit for medical treatments resulting from it. Casolaro’s clip- pings collection included stories on the European Economic Community’s delay of the start of its own human genome project for the sake of the ethics issues. It also included an article on research at Howard Hughes Medical Institute that gave symptoms of arthritis to a rat through the insertion on a human gene, and the isolation of cancer and gender identification genes. The Human Genome Project also discovered genes for cystic fibr osis and fragile X syndr ome, responsible for many forms of mental retardation. Casolaro’s interest along these lines may have coincided with an interest in Creutzfeldt-Jakob, or Mad Cow, Disease and other bacterial research work done by sub- contractors to Wackenhut like the Stormont Laboratories of Woodbine, California. In O ctober 1992, HUGO issued a r eport recommending the collection of genetic material from 722 “Isolates of Historic Interest” (IHIs), or indegenous ethnic people whose numbers ar e diminishing and leave sample DNA of each community with its regional institution or a national government. Another purpose was to locate and secure patents on unique genes that could be used to fight disease. “Access to an IHI’s complete genetic make-up means it ’s theoretically possible to devise cheap and targeted biological w eapons trained solely on that community ,” reported the northern California independent newspaper Community Endeavor (6/15/93), “Human rights vio- lations against indigenous people, b y their o wn governments and/or go vernments within their regions, is a major cause of their physical extinction.” This and similar issues may hav e attracted Casolaro’s interest to the Human Genome Project, but he may also hav e been more interested in possible treatment for his own undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"108 THE OCTOPUS 14.

In Martinsburg, witnesses saw Casolaro sitting in his car behind the IRS building, appar ently waiting for a contact. M ichael Riconosciuto later told NBC’s Unsolved Mysteries series that “Danny had a source there inside the IRS’ computer data center that was giving him hard copy printouts of IRS infor- mation on certain specific targets that Danny was after.” 1 Shortly before noon, on Thursday, August 8, Casolaro checked into r oom 517 of the Sheraton Hotel in Martinsburg. A few minutes later he went to the Stone Crab Inn, a r estaurant located near an exit nor th on I nterstate 81. H e drank a bottle of wine during his nearly three hours there. Around 3 PM, Caso- laro left for a P izza Hut located within a block of the S heraton. He ordered a pitcher of beer, but after being told by the waitress she could not serve him alco- hol without food, he also ordered pizza. 2 Casolaro flirted with her, saying he was member of the Edgar Allen Poe Society, and quoting from the poem epigraph to Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby . This was not out of character for Casoloro. Wendy Weaver, an old girlfriend, r emembered when Casolar o once gr eeted her at a restaurant with roses, in a tuxedo, and wearing a tin hat he had painted gold. 3 He sat alone for about half an hour, then left. Around 5 PM, Casolaro went into the lounge at the Sheraton, Heatherfield’s, with a man described by a wait- ress as “maybe Arab or Iranian.” The man complained about slow service to the waitress, but D anny apologized for him, saying he had had a har d day. They drink about four beers apiece, and then left the cocktail lounge. Casolaro returned to the lounge for a bucket of ice about 5:30 PM. O n the way back to his room, Casolaro ran into Mike Looney, the hotel guest who was staying next door to him. Looney noticed the ice bucket Casolar o was carrying and commented, “It’s a hell of a note when you have to walk all the way to Vir- ginia to get a bucket of ice.” Looney encounter ed Casolaro again around 8 PM 109 Chapter 17: Final Hours V"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"110 THE OCTOPUS in the bar.

After the women left, Looney commented to Casolar o, “It looked too good to be tr ue.” Danny had been drinking imported bottled beer, but switched to less expensive glasses of draft beer during happy hour. He and Looney struck up a conversation about the Octopus research, and Casolaro told him he was going to meet a con- tact—an Arab, Looney thought he r emembered—whose information would crack the case. The appointed time came, but no contact appear ed. Casolaro left, possibly to make a phone call or to relieve himself. When he returned,he told Looney that the source was only going to furnish some trav el documents, and so he didn ’t mind getting drunk. Casolaro and Looney remained in the bar until last call, ar ound 11:30 PM. Looney later recalled, “He was excited about what he was doing. He thought he was onto something big. He was convinced that there was a conspiracy. I was tak- ing a kind of devil’s advocate position.” 4 Casolaro’s next known movement was 2 PM, Friday, August 9, when he met with informant Bill Turner in Turner’s car in the lot of the S heraton (to avoid what Casolaro assumed was his bugged r oom). Turner said, “[D anny] came bouncing up with that famous old smile of his and opened the car door and got in...” 5 Turner said Casolaro was carrying a cardboard accordion file, and that he gave Casolaro some papers regarding mismanagement at Hughes and the Penta- gon.

Casolar o’s last words to Turner were, “Bill old buddy, got to watch your p’s and q’s and look over your shoulder.” 6 Casolaro returned to the Stone Crab Inn Friday at about 2:30 PM, where he had a shrimp cocktail and began drinking bottles of B ud Lite. He paid with a credit card at 5:12 PM and told the bartender that he had “a rough night.” The bartender thought D anny looked lonely and intr ospective. The bar tender remembered him as “a man with something to say. He was just like this, ‘Take a minute and talk to me.’ He told me to keep smiling.” After leaving the Stone Crab Inn sometime before 6 PM, Casolaro made a pay phone call on Interstate 81 and a collect call to his mother’s home. He spoke with his niece and said he’d be late and might not make it all to the family din- ner. This was hardly unusual. When his brother Tony recalled the incident, he noted that “When the phone rang, we knew it would be Danny. It was like him to show up late or not at all.” 7 Casolaro’s whereabouts from that point are unknown until around 10 PM, when he entered a convenience store located near the Sheraton and waited while the clerk brewed fresh coffee.

When D anny’s br other Tony spoke with detectiv e Sergeant George Swartwood, the one who first informed the family of D anny’s apparent suicide, Tony r eceived a contradictor y description of the body ’s wounds—cuts on both the wrists and the arms. Tony then told Swartwood about Danny’s investigative work. Research papers and notes, other than the terse sui- cide message, were nowhere in evidence at the mur der scene; the detective did not know they should hav e been. N o autopsy had been planned. S wartwood directed Tony Casolaro to the medical examiner ’s office, where coroner Sandra Bining in turn refered him to the West Virginia medical examiner, a man with the coldly appropriate name of James “Jack” Frost. On late Monday, Frost agreed with Tony about the suspicious cir cumstances of Danny’s death and scheduled an autopsy for the follo wing Wednesday. He observed to the incredulous Tony Casolaro that the body had already been embalmed. Because of the hastily drawn conclusion of suicide, S andra Brining had turned Casolar o’s body o ver to the funeral home. B ecause the family had not r eceived prior notification, the embalming had violated the law—and had made the autopsy that much mor e difficult.

The body had been mo ved to the Brown Funeral Home and its director, Charles Brown, had done the embalming. 1 Sandra Brining performed a brief medical examination befor e the autopsy. She took a blood sample fr om the heart, noted old scars on the right leg and scalp, and an old br uise inside the upper, right arm. She also counted the slash scars on his wrists. The right wrist had seven or eight slashes; 2 the right had three or four, all of them deep, strongly inflicted cuts. It was then that Brining deter- mined that the death was a suicide. Dr. James Frost’s autopsy agreed with Brining’s conclusion that Danny Caso- laro’s life spilled out through the cuts on his wrists. Frost determined that there were no signs of struggle and not enough drug residue in blood and urine sam- ples to indicate an ar tificial inhibition of any such str uggle. He reported, “no alcohol found in body ... traces of codeine fr om Tylenol III and an anti-depres- sant drug were found.” 3 Toxicological tissue tests also indicate the pr esence of hydrocone, used in the painkiller Vicodin, six tablets of which Casolaro’s dentist had prescribed for him three years previously, but the quantity of the anti-depres- sant was too minute to identify. “Of the five or six things that bothered me the most, this is one of them,” Tony Casolaro commented later, “Because they found no pill bottle, no written prescription at any pharmacy.” 4 This was only the beginning of the suspicions that spr ead out like ripples behind an octopus swimming off after an attack. The first involved the recent death of Alan Standorf, the electronic intelligence specialist whom, according to Rodney Stich, Casolaro had met thr ough Michael Riconosciuto. Casolaro had called Standorf a key source. After Casolaro’s death, when Art Weinfield accom- panied Casolaro’s sister M ary Ellen and son Trey to the M artinsburg police station to recover Danny’s car, they ran into detectives who identified themselves as working for the National Airport Authority in DC. 5 The detectives explained that they w ere looking into possible connections betw een Danny’s death and Standorf’s, a “low-level” civilian NSA employee at the restricted Vint Hill mili- tary facility. Standorf was killed by a blow to the head in early January. If he was not killed for the $500 he had just r etrieved from an ATM, then his body was made to look that way. It had been discovered at National Airport in late Janu- ary, wrapped in his coat in the back seat of his car, money missing. The detectives explained that Army intelligence officers joined their inv estigation of the case twice before an anonymous caller mentioned the link to Casolar o. While the detectives never came up with evidence connecting the two cases, accor ding to Ridgeway and Vaughan, they did discover that their anonymous tip came fr om one of Casolaro’s last informants, Bill Turner. 6 Fearful that he might be the next target of the Octopus, Bill Turner got him-"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"116 THE OCTOPUS self arrested in late September on a bank robbery charge. A similar strategy had been used by a spook named Richard Case Nagell when he realized he was entan- gled in the conspiracy to kill JFK. In September 1963 Nagell shot up a bank in San Antonio, was arrested and thereby removed as a par ticipant. 7 Less than an hour and a half after a bank robbery in the rural town of Gore, police picked up Turner and matched him with images fr om the bank ’s security camera. Was Turner justifed in such actions, steering the police to connect D anny’s death with Standorf’s and fleeing into police custody? Turner failed to make two appoint- ments to discuss this with the authors of the original edition of this book and thereafter his telephone number became unlisted. O ne person who would sup- port Turner’s fears was Harry Martin of the NAPA Sentinel . “Basically what we’re dealing with is Air F orce counterintelligence,” said M artin in an inter view, “What Casolaro was finding was pr ocurement fraud, manufacturing fraud and kickbacks. He didn’t start out in that dir ection, but that ’s what he stumbled across. And, of course, that is what did him in... O ne of my contacts in the Air For ce came back from Virginia the same weekend as Casolaro’s death. Of course, it hadn’t quite been reported. He came back and his knuckles w ere raw and he had scratches on them and he talked about beating up this guy in a hotel in West Virginia.” “Again,” Martin adds, “I didn ’t have Casolaro on my mind at the time... At the same time the contact indicated that he had gotten ahold of all these papers from this guy and that he destr oyed those papers. When you put two and two together—the contact had these papers and he dealt with H ughes Aircraft—-and the fact that the guy had been in West Virginia for two days and came back like he had been in a fight...” 8 Mar tin declined to give the name of his contact. One report had Bill Hamilton providing some support for the scenario: “We had one meeting with an FBI agent and the First Assistant US Attorney from Los Angeles on our February submission. And they had questions principally about material in that submission about the death of the journalist D anny Casolaro. During the meeting they confirmed to us that something w e had heard from a confidential source was true. And that was, a maid at the hotel in M artinsburg, West Virginia had seen a man coming out of D anny Casolaro’s hotel room the morning he was found dead, but befor e his body was disco vered. Then, subse- quent to that meeting, the Justice Department attempted to deny that they had, in fact, confirmed that during the meeting with us. And that effor t to deny it makes you very uncomfortable, you know?” 9 Perhaps Bob Bickell also felt some of that discomfor t. On August 5, Caso- laro had called Texas oil engineer Bickel, who at one time worked as a Customs Bur eau informant, apparently to talk about Robert Booth Nichols and his asso- ciation with a former Justice official named Michael Abbell and Columbian drug"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"117 R IPPLING W AVES lord Gilberto Rodriquez, both of whom were being investigated for their con- nections to the Cali dr ug cartel. Bickel previously had aspir ed to blo w the whistle on CIA chief Robert Gates’ role in shipping weapons to Iraq in the late 1980s. He had given Casolaro photocopies of one million and four million dol- lar checks drawn on the BCCI accounts of Iran-contra go-betweens Khashoggi and Ghorbanifar. He also gav e him the passpor t photograph of H assan Ali Ibrahim Ali, a fr ont man for I raqi weapons sales. (Doug Vaughan traced these papers back to Richard Brenneke.) The check photocopies had circulated among researchers for years but when matched with the passport it seemed to represent a great breakthrough to Danny. Was Hassan Ali Ibrahim Ali the “maybe Arab or Iranian” man that a waitress saw Casolaro with at the Sheridan that night? Bickell had told Bob McCoy that Casolaro was trolling for the head of the Octopus on his final night, and he later told a writer that “D anny had con- fronted Robert Booth Nichols about his relationship with Mike Abbell.” 10 Writer Chris S eymour, whose unpublished six hundr ed page manuscript in par t explored the drug traffic angle of Casolaro’s work, suggested that the drug angle pre-occupied the fifteen phone calls to N ichols found on Casolaro’s phone bill the month prior to his death. This view supported the report that Casolaro had been collecting information about Nichols’ various connections to the Gambino family and the Yakuza from former J ustice Department prosecutor Richard Stavin. Stavin’s report emphasized that names found in Casolar o’s notes includ- ed members of FIDCO, the First Intercontinental Development Corporation, a group in California created to re-construct bombed-out Beirut in Lebanon. The FIDCO board member list contained the names of Texas oilman Clint Murchi- son, Jr. and Howard Hughes crony Robert Maheu, names that also had emerged during Nichols’ pursuit of damages against the LAPD for revocation of his con- cealed weapons permit in 1993. The list also included N ichols as a senior vice-president of FIDCO’s Investment Committee. 11 Seymour claimed that FIDCO was set up in 1983 to take adv antage of financial aid then being offer ed to Lebanese president Amin Gemayel, aid that helped smooth out dr ug traffic avenues. Correspondence from former Reagan aide Michael McManus to engineering executive George Pender, both FIDCO board members, and to Gemayel, established the influx of over three billion dol- lars in money and assets into the Lebanese ruins. According to Seymour, the US Senate Judiciary Committee determined in 1985 that G emayel’s finance minis- ter supervised the impor tation of Turkish opium into Lebanon, wher e it was processed into heroin, sent to Italy and eventually exported for sale in the US. A report in High Times named Gemayel’s brother as an asset to the CIA. 12 “Of note also is the fact that Bekaa (Valley) in Lebanon later became a center for process- ing Columbian Car tel cocaine for r e-export to E uropean markets.” 13 In one"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"proposal for the Octopus manuscript, Casolaro had indeed asserted that the fuel- air explosive Michael Riconosciuto developed on Cabazon land was used in the bomb that killed over three hundred US Marines in Lebanon in October 1983. Could it have been research along these lines that led to his death? For his part, Ari Ben-Menashe gave Bill Hamilton another hint about Caso- laro’s company on the night of his death. B en-Menashe claimed that two FBI agents from Lexington, K entucky had scheduled a meeting with Casolar o in Mar tinsburg with proof of the illegal sale of PR OMIS to the FBI and M ossad. One of the agents, E. B. Car tinhour, had a gr udge about the fact that R eagan teflon had protected administration officials from indictments over the October Surprise. Ridgeway and Vaughan could not get a response from Cartinhour, but a colleague insisted that he had nev er heard of Casolaro and could not discuss Ben-Menashe because it involved classified information. 14 Lester Knox Coleman III, the former Defense Intelligence Agency operative who swore in an affidavit about seeing bootleg PR OMIS software at C ypriot Police headquarters, had yet another theory. On August 3, Casolaro called him after reading the affidavit and asked if he could help on the Octopus project with more information. That Casolaro could track him so easily impr essed Cole- man—it actually upset him a bit—so he took the opportunity to strike up a deal. He would tell Casolar o more of what he kne w if Casolar o helped him find information on John McCloskey, a divorce lawyer who had recruited him into the DIA. The lawyer had links to the intelligence community and BCCI, and so was ripe for Casolaro’s interest as well. The phone call ended with a pr omise to exchange information. In nine days, ne ws of Casolar o’s death after a meeting with an unkno wn informant reached Coleman. Was that final meeting with McCloskey? Coleman later discovered that McCloskey owned a horse farm down the road from where Casolaro died, although he had not been seen in the ar ea for a couple of y ears. When he called McCloskey’s telephone number in Martinsburg, he reached the Shenandoah Women’s Center and the people ther e had nev er hear d of McCloskey. Coleman called William Hamilton about his suspicions only to learn about threats Hamilton had received because of PROMIS. The thought of how quickly Casolaro had tracked him added to Coleman’s fear that he may be the next target for “ sanctions” because of his inv olvement with the PR OMIS affair. He explained as much to Swedish authorities when he petitioned for asy- lum. 15 Coleman and Bickell’s stories came together in an odd way. Coleman’s book also gave the particulars of a sting operation called “Khourah,” involving heroin shipments from the Bekaa Valley to the US. Seymour notes that two years pre- viously Michael Riconosciuto tried to trade details of the DEA sting to the FBI. 118 THE OCTOPUS"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"119 R IPPLING W AVES Notable among Riconosciuto’s claims was that the operation ’s head, DEA man Fred Ghanem, was related to FIDCO participant Maurice Ghanem. 16 The veracity of these contradictor y conspiracy scenarios about D anny Caso- laro’s death must be measur ed against attempts b y the v arious authors and characters to associate their r esearch and experience with this famous case.

I n nearb y waters, ho wever, other behemoths thrashed about for supr emacy in an ev en larger conspiratorial sea—the law . The legal forces lined up against I nslaw became visible when the H amiltons discovered that Associate Attorney General D. Lowell Jensen had, as District Attorney in Alameda County, California, promoted DALITE, a rival manage- ment software, to fifty-eight county California district attorney offices. Larr y Donoghue, the man responsible for selecting software used by the Los Angeles office and later named deputy district attorney for Los Angeles County , recalled that, “Jensen called me into his office and I w ent away feeling what I regarded to be unusual and significant pressure to select the DALITE system.” PROMIS, however, had won the Los Angeles County office and, as Bill Hamil- ton later r emarked, “... evidently J ensen bore a gr udge.” Hamilton added, “Jensen was promoted to associate Attorney General in May or June of ‘83— and that’s when all the contract disputes came up.” Jensen served as chairman of the o versight committee in charge of PR OMIS. Additionally, Jensen had served with Ed Meese for twelve years in Alameda County while M eese had been a deputy district attorney . In 1985, Meese promoted Jensen to Deputy Attorney General. Jensen also came under scr utiny during the S enate’s Iran- contra investigations when a memo was discovered from him tipping off Oliver Nor th that the federal prosecutors were aware of his actions. This from a Jus- tice Department official charged with prosecuting the matter. 1 There was no misunderstanding in the go vernment’s handling of PROMIS. The government, or at least a particular segment of it, was out to get Inslaw, according to Frank Mallgrave, as quoted in Wired : Chapter 19: Inslaw and the Law V 120"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"121 I NSLAW AND THE L AW On a gorgeous spring morning in 1981, Lawrence McWhorter, director of the Executive Office for USA attorneys, put his feet on his desk, lit an Ital- ian cigar, eyed his subordinate Frank Mallgrave and said through a haze of blue smoke: “We’re out to get Inslaw.” McWhorter had just asked Mallgrave to oversee the pilot installation of PROM IS, a job Mallgrave refused, unaware at the time that he was being asked to participate in Inslaw’s deliberate destruction. “We were just in his office for what I call a BS type discussion,” Mallgrave told Wired . “I remember it was a bright sunny morning... (McWhorter) asked me if I would be interested in assuming the position of Assistant Director for Data Processing... basically working with Inslaw. I told him... I just had no interest in that job. And then, almost as an afterthought, he said ‘We’re out to get Inslaw.’ I remember it to this day.” 2 The position eventually went to C. Madison “Brick” Brewer. Bill Hamilton had previously fired Brewer for poor job per formance. H amilton originally thought Brewer’s actions against Inslaw were due to Brewer’s personal vendetta, but that was before revelations concerning Earl Brian, the October Surprise pay- off and the rest of the sordid mess surfaced. 3 The Justice Department determined that no conflict of interest existed for Brewer in his new assignment. Brewer tes- tified in federal court that he received approval from Deputy Attorney General Lowell Jensen, whose v ested interest in the riv al DALITE softwar e had been damaged by the contract awar d to I nslaw in the 1970s, for all of his actions regarding Inslaw. Perhaps revenge had transformed I nslaw’s contract disputes into a legalistic attempt to trash the company. Things could nev er be that simple in I nslaw’s case, ho wever. Joined with Brewer’s at J ustice was Peter Videniecks, the man who, accor ding to M ichael Riconosciuto, had threatened him to discourage him fr om testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. Videniecks had his own incestuous connection to Inslaw: he had worked in the Customs office maintaining its contracts with Earl Brian’s Hadron, Inc. systems consulting group. Videniecks and Brewer led Jus- tice to demand that Inslaw turn over PROMIS just in case an alleged impending bankruptcy made it impossible for the company to live up to its contracts. Inslaw agreed, but with the stipulation that Inslaw retain all rights to enhancements to the program and that Justice only provide it to the US Attorney’s office. Justice, predictably, reneged, and made no effor t to determine the v alidity of I nslaw’s claims of ownership to PROMIS enhancements. The Justice Department began to withhold payments, making Inslaw’s subsequent forced march into bankrupt- cy court a self-fulfilling prophecy, and beginning the process that originally had attracted Casolar o’s attention. As I nslaw’s pr oblems mounted, Earl B rian’s"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"122 THE OCTOPUS Hadron, Inc. made a play to take over the company through Dominic “We have ways of making you sell” Laiti. Another company, SCT, financed by investment bankers linked to Brian, also attempted a buy-out. Inslaw ultimately hired Leigh Ratiner of Dickstein, Shapiro and Morin, to file suit against Justice to the tune of $30 million. Ratiner established the bankr upt- cy court as having jurisdiction in the dispute with the unique argument that Justice had seized control of PROMIS. As Inslaw’s creditor, this violated a tenet of the B ankruptcy Act forbidding cr editors from controlling the pr operty of debtors. 4 The strategy led to Judge George Bason’s favorable ruling for Inslaw in 1987, which also led to B ason’s early removal from the bench and, according to Ari Ben-Menashe, possibly also to Leigh Ratiner’s early retirement by a pay-off to his law firm. 5 Federal district court judge William Bryant upheld Bason’s decision after an appeal by the Justice Department, and the Supreme Court denied review in October 1991. A separate appeals court, however, deciding on an appeal made by the Justice Department, ultimately overturned Bryant on the basis of the juris- dictional argument. A thr ee member panel of judges determined that federal bankruptcy court had no jurisdiction in the case. N o judgement was ever issued exonerating the Justice Department from its actions in the Inslaw matter. Casolaro had given some thought to other legal dimensions of the I nslaw predicament. In undated notes, he made an extensive study of computer software and hardware case law, from the point of view of trade secret protection, trade- mark protection, contract law and patent law and copyright law . From that perspective, he underlined the concept of “ a reverse engineering approach” that he felt was applicable to the legal status of PR OMIS. Called the “ clean room technique,” it is used as a method of av oiding copyright infringement in the developing of software products of similar functions. The clean room uses two teams, one receiving and decompiling the protected work legally and “producing a document setting forth ideas and specifications that are in the unprotected idea domain.” The second team takes the document and, with no further communi- cation with team one, creates a new product without infringing on the protected aspect of the original software. Casolaro noted that such reverse engineering had been used by many computer manufacturers to clone Apple and IBM comput- ers. Apple and IBM never pursued legal action against the clean room technique because they feared an unfavorable legal action. 6 Perhaps for similar reasons, the PROMIS problems were never played out in the copyright arena. During these legal maneuvers, information concerning the illegal distribu- tion of PR OMIS on the international mar ket continued to come in. O n January 8, 1991, Communications Canada (AKA the Canadian Workplace Automation Research Centre, or CWARC) wrote a letter to I nslaw requesting information on the program, stating that “CWARC is aware that your company’s"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"123 I NSLAW AND THE L AW software products ar e being used in federal depar tments and agencies.” Inslaw, however, had nev er authorized a Canadian sale of PR OMIS. The Hamiltons’ daughter Patricia also swor e in an affidavit that an official of the Canadian Department of Communications informed her that the R CMP w ere using PROMIS in 900 offices in Canada. 7 In Nov ember 1992, Bill Hamilton learned the identity of a potential client for PROMIS. A man had come to H amilton in February 1983, was wowed by the presentation of the software, but never came back to purchase. The customer had identified himself as D r. Ben Orr. Through a photograph identification, Hamilton discovered that Dr. Ben Orr was the chief of Israel’s anti-terrorist intel- ligence division under Menachem Begin, and director of LAKAM, the scientific intelligence gathering unit of the defense ministr y in Israel. He had no doubt been sent b y the J ustice Department to look at war es promised. 8 Ari Ben- Menashe verified the pseudonym. 9 On J une 9, 1993 two plaintiffs, Brenda James-Soulliere and Virginia Welmas- Nichols, filed a slander suit against enterprises and individuals that had wor ked to bring one portion of Casolaro’s research—the murder and malfeasance among the Cabazons—to a broader audience through broadcast and print media. The court filing described the plaintiffs as members of the Cabaz on tribe and r esidents of Riverside County . The defendants included sev eral w ell-known r esearchers, notably Virginia McCullough, Harry Martin and D ave Emory, radio stations KPFK and KFJC, and D ave Emory’s tape service, Archives on Audio . The com- plaint also listed 600 unidentified “Does” as responsible for the slander as well. Since 1980, Emory had broadcast commentary on the influence of fascism on contemporary life through various radio programs in the San Francisco Bay area. Beginning in April, 1991, Emory began broadcasting some of the earliest and most in-depth reporting about Casolaro, the Cabazons, and the Inslaw scan- dal. The court filing listed his November 15 and 17, 1992 shows as the offending programs, along with one fr om November 22, 1993. The November 15 show had featured a discussion with NAPA Sentinel editor Harry Martin about the Cabazon involvement with Wackenhut, the modification of PROMIS, and the development of biological and chemical w eapons; the November ‘93 broadcast included comments by Virginia McCullough regarding the Cabazon/Wackenhut venture, tribal gambling operations, and connections to the mob . Emory made tapes of the program available through his tape service, Archives on Audio . Sev eral interesting documents surfaced as court exhibits for the trial, includ- ing correspondence between John Philip Nichols and Robert Booth Nichols, a long letter fr om J ohn N ichols detailing w eapons r esearch dev elopment b y Cabazon Arms, and inter-office memoranda fr om Wackenhut. A defendant ’s motion for dismissal was granted by the court on October 29, 1993. 10"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"124 THE OCTOPUS The first congressional investigation of the Inslaw matter came from the Sen- ate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by Sam Nunn. During the course of that inquiry, its chief investigator, Ronald LeGrand, quoted a senior officer at Justice that he refused to name as saying the Inslaw case “was a lot dirt- ier for the Department of Justice than Watergate had been, both in its br eadth and its depth.” Although Inslaw lawyer Elliot Richardson later pointed out that LeGrand “now says he and his friend were only discussing rumors,” he concurred with the sentiment. Richardson was one of the fe w people to emerge fr om the Watergate days as a man of integrity, having lost his job for refusing to fire spe- cial prosecutor Archibald Cox at Richard Nixon’s direction. Richardson would ultimately call for a special prosecutor for the Inslaw case. “When the Watergate special prosecutor began his inquiry,” Richardson remarked, “indications of the President’s involvement were not as str ong as those that no w point to a wide- spread conspiracy implicating lesser government officials in the theft of I nslaw’s technology.” 11 The Nunn Committee issued a r eport concluding that the J ustice Depart- ment had victimized Inslaw and, in addition, had intimidated witnesses befor e the committee—some of them into silence for fear of their jobs; others into being advised b y the litigation division befor e testifying. J ustice also r efused access to any r ecords whatsoever, a precursor to the tr eatment the department would give the next inquiry into Inslaw—the House Judiciary Committee, head- ed by Jack Brooks. 12 Brooks’ committee concluded that “The history of the Department’s behav- ior in the Inslaw case dramatically illustrates its 1. r eflexive hostility and ‘circle Jack Brooks William Barr."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"125 I NSLAW AND THE L AW the wagons’ approach toward outside investigations; 2. inability or unwillingness to look objectively at charges of wr ongdoing by high level Justice officials, par- ticularly when the agency itself is a defendant in litigation; and 3. belliger ence toward Justice employees with views that run counter to those of the agency ’s upper management. The fact that the Department failed to recognize a need for an independent investigation of the Inslaw matter for more than seven years is remarkable. Failure to do so has effectively shielded officials who may have com- mitted wrongdoing from investigation and prosecution.” Despite the stone walling by the Justice Department—in fact, with special mention of it—Brooks’ committee reached conclusions favorable to Inslaw. It had reviewed the volume of legal material and histor y of PROMIS and Inslaw, the Cabazons and Wackenhut, and their relationships to Michael Riconosciuto, Robert Booth Nichols, John Philip Nichols and Earl Brian; the sworn statements of Riconosciuto; the allegations of Ari Ben-Menashe, Charles Hayes, and Lester Coleman; Richardson’s 1989 writ of mandamus filing r equest for independent investigative counsel; and v arious soft-pedalings and inter ference by Justice. Although the committee did not include D anny Casolaro’s death as par t of its formal investigation, it did note the irregular circumstance of his death: “Mr. Casolaro died on August 10, 1991, and his death was officially ruled a suicide on January 5, 1992, over five months later. The criticism of the investi- gation of Casolar o’s death b y the M artinsburg, WV, police center on the following areas: Prior to any cor oners’ investigation and before his family was notified, Mr. Casolaro’s body was embalmed, which may have limited the effec- tiveness of autopsies or to xicological examinations. S ome evidence has also surfaced indicating that immediately follo wing the disco very of the body , the room was not sealed by the Martinsburg authorities, potentially allowing for the contamination of the possible crime scene. Additionally, it was reported that the room in which Mr. Casolaro was found was cleaned before a thorough criminal investigation could be conducted.” The committee took a statement fr om Richard Stavin about the natur e of Casolaro’s Octopus research and the inv olvement of Robert Nichols and John Philip Nichols; and another fr om FBI field agent Thomas Gates. Gates men- tioned that Casolar o’s phone book, containing G ates’ number had not been located during the police inv estigation. He also mentioned that M artinsburg police had found “hacking” wounds on Casolaro’s arms not consistent with them being self-inflicted. Gates had concluded this was cause to suspect murder. The House Judiciary Committee reached three conclusions: that the current attorney general, William Barr—who had succeeded Richar d Thornburgh the day Casolaro’s autopsy report was released—should immediately settle I nslaw’s claims in a fair and equitable manner; that Justice department officials with any"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"126 THE OCTOPUS prior participation in the Inslaw litigation be excluded from further involvement except as needed to supply information to futur e investigations as needed; and that the Justice Department appoint and independently conduct “ a full, open investigation of the I nslaw allegations of a high lev el conspiracy within the Department to steal enhanced PROMIS software to benefit friends and associ- ates of former Attorney General Meese, including Dr. Earl Brian.” Ancillary to this last conclusion was a r ecommendation for an inv estigation into D anny Casolaro’s death. 13 Thornburgh had ostensibly r egarded the Inslaw affair as a simple contract dispute. Faced with intense criticism fr om the J ustice Department, however, Thornburgh’s successor Barr acceded to the request for a special prosecutor. He appointed a retired federal judge, Nicholas J. Bua, in November, 1991. Unfor- tunately, and despite the tr emendous momentum to decide things in a way satisfactory to Inslaw, Bua’s report, filed in March 1993 with Janet Reno as attor- ney general, did to the case’s legal standing what had been done to Casolaro. Incredibly, Bua cleared the J ustice Department, the office for which he worked, of wrongdoing in the affair. 14 News of the report did not surface until late May because it was being edited to take out information supposedly relevant to national security. 15 According to Bua, the evidence was not sufficient to sup- port the claim that the Justice Department, specifically Ed Meese and crony Earl Brian, stole PROMIS from the Hamiltons and sold it illegally to police agencies around the world. B ua also appar ently complimented M ichael Riconosciuto’s story-telling abilities (“a historical novel; a tale of total fiction woven against the background of historical facts”) but pooh-poohed his contention that he modi- fied the softwar e to giv e it back door access. B ua also maintained that the removal from the bench of judge G eorge Bason, who had originally r uled in favor of Inslaw, was only a coincidence. According to Bua, Bason had not been re-appointed because he was an inefficient administrator . Bua added two final insults to his list of appalling conclusions: D anny Casolaro had committed sui- cide and ther e was no evidence that the J ustice D epartment attempted to influence the investigation of his death. Not mentioned in the report was the $25 million B ua had offered Elliot Richardson to settle the case—mor e than triple the amount awar ded in the first federal ruling for Inslaw. Bua made the offer in a December 1992 phone call to Richardson and, according to Richardson, they had at least two follow up calls about it. 16 Bua’s report was deficient in many obvious ways, and Inslaw filed a report on July 12 , 1993 to point them out. F or instance, Bua failed to do a basic code comparison between PROMIS and the software currently being used by the FBI, instead relying on the expertise of a Georgetown University professor that such"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"127 I NSLAW AND THE L AW a comparison would be a waste of time. B ua also was selective in his choice of interviewees from Justice Department who had knowledge of the case, neglect- ing to talk to them all. The I nslaw r ebuttal also maintained that B ua’s information on George Bason came in large part from Judge Roger Whelan, the judge from whom administrative problems were inherited by Bason, or so went the House Judiciary Committee Testimony of U. S. District Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson. Whelan at the time also worked for AT&T, an Inslaw creditor. 17 The July 12 rebuttal contained eighty pages and ten attachments, expanding the particulars and adding to the documentation perhaps mor e than any other legal document, 18 especially factoring in the twenty-nine page addendum Inslaw released on February 14, 1994. The last items in this chapter highlight some of its many revelations. Robert Maxwell [Robert] Maxwell’s role as a cutout for a foreign nation’s sale of computer software has been implicitly acknowledged by the actions of the FBI. Robert Maxwell’s dissemination of computer software was the subject of an FBI for- eign counterintelligence investigation in 1984. Ten years later, in January 19 9 4, Inslaw obtained, under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), eighteen pages relating to an investigation on this subject in New Mexico in June 1984. The FBI furnished the documents to Inslaw in response to a FOIA request for documents relating to Maxwell’s involvement in the ‘dissemination, marketing or sale of computer software systems, including but not limited to the PROM IS computer software product, between 1983 and 1992.’ The FBI heavily redacted the eighteen pages and ascribed the redactions to the secre- cy requirements of national security. One month before the FBI released the documents to Inslaw, it partially reclassified two of the pages that had been officially declassified in their entirety one year earlier. The FBU redacted the newly reclassified portions in the copies given to Inslaw. Robert Maxwell also developed a business relationship during the latter half of the 1980s with two computer systems executives from the Meese Jus- tice Department, at least one of whom had responsibilities relating to the proprietary version of PROMIS. Robert Maxwell set up a tiny publishing company in McLean, Virginia, in August 1985. That company then hired two senior computing systems executives from a unit of the Meese Justice Department that operated the proprietary version of PROMIS. One was the Director of the Justice Data Center, the Justice Department’s own internal computer time-sharing facility where the proprietary IBM version of PROM IS was operating for one of the legal divisions under license from Inslaw. the Director of the Justice Data Center resigned his estimated $90,000-a-year Senior Executive Service position to become Vice President for Technical Services at the six-employee start-up national defense com- pany owned by Robert Maxwell."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"128 THE OCTOPUS Submarines The Navy confirmed to a reporter for Navy Times that it has a PROMIS soft- ware system and that it operates its PROMIS on a VAX computer in support of its nuclear submarines. The Navy’s Undersea Systems Center in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, furthermore, notified the reporter in writing that its engineers had locally developed this VAX version of PROMIS; that its PROMIS is installed only at its land-based facility at Newport, Rhode Island; and that its PROMIS has never been installed on board any nuclear submarine. Inslaw has, however, obtained a document published by the same Undersea Systems Center in 19 87 that reveals its PROMIS is not only operating at the land-based ‘test facil- ity’ in Newport, but it is also operational on board both attack class and ‘boomer’ class submarines. The Navy, like the CIA and the NSA, clearly has dif- ficulty in giving a credible accounting of its PROMIS software. Danny Casolaro According to written statements of which Inslaw has obtained copies, another undeclared mission of the Justice Department’s covert agents was to insure that investigative journalist Danny Casolaro remained silent about the role of the Justice Department in the Inslaw scandal by murdering him in West Virginia in August 1991. Inslaw has acquired copies of two relevant written statements furnished to a veteran investigative journalist by a nation- al security operative of the US government, several months after Casolaro’s death. The individual who reportedly transmitted these written statements to the journalist by fax has testified under oath to being a national security operative for the FBI and CIA. Partial corroboration for his claimed work for the FBI is reportedly available in the sworn testimony of several FBI agents during a recent criminal prosecution. One statement purportedly reflects the operative’s personal knowledge and belief that Casolaro was killed by agents of the Justice Department and is allegedly written in the operative’s own hand. The other statement is an excerpt from a typewritten set of questions and answers. The questions were posed to a senior CIA official by the investigative journalist; the answers, purportedly from the senior CIA official, were reportedly sent by fax to the journalist by the national security operative, who was acting as an intermediary. The following is the pertinent questions and answer: Q: Do you have any information for [San Francisco-based investigative journalist] George Williamson yet regarding the Danny Casolaro matter? A: Ye s. Casolaro appears to have been working as a freelance writer at the time of his death and was gathering material for a book. He was investigating the Inslaw case. He was on the trail of information that could have made the whole matter public and led to exposure of the Justice Department and their involvement in the matter. Apparently he was very close to obtaining that information."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"129 I NSLAW AND THE L AW We do not agree with the consensus of opinion among the reporters who looked into this matter, that Casolaro committed suicide. Casolaro was mur- dered by agents of the Justice department to insure his silence. The entire matter was handled internally by Justice, and our agency was not involved. 19 ———— 1.

On other broadcasts, Emory outlined a larger context for the “October Surprise,” and thereby Earl Brian’s involvement with the PROMIS software. In the 1995 Archives on Audio catalog (POB 170023, San Francisco, CA 94117-0023), Emory explained that, “by 1976, George Bush’s CIA was actively supporting and grooming the Khomeini forces. The subsequent takeover of the US embassy in Teheran, the withholding of the US hostages until after President Carter’s defeat was assured, the Khomeini government itself and the I ran-contra scandal proper were all outgrowths of this pr o- found and long-standing relationship. It should be noted that par ts of this relationship have been misunderstood as what has become kno wn as the ‘October Surprise.’ Although there was massive collusion between the Reagan-Bush campaign and the Khomeini for ces during the 1980 election campaign, there was no ‘deal’ cut during the campaign. Rather, the ‘deal’ was part of a covert oper- ation begun years before and the collusion during the campaign was an outgrowth of it.” 11. Richardson. 12.

Danny Casolaro had been dead for two years and the key players in the investigation he began had ostensibly left power after the 1992 election. Columnist William Safire reported that Bill Clinton and George Bush struck a secret deal after Clinton’s election that the former pr esident would withhold criticism of the new administration for one year in exchange for Clinton’s soft- pedaling of the Iran-contra investigations. 1 A month before the end of that deal, a month before the former Arkansas governor’s first anniversary as president, the Clinton administration reopened the Inslaw investigation. In December 1993, the FBI began again to inter view Casolaro’s close associates and friends with an eye toward resolving the question of his death—was it a suicide or mur der? Under the new administration, the FBI was not satisfied with the determi- nation of Judge Bua’s report. It was still concerned with “Danny’s state of mind at the time of his death,” Casolaro girlfriend Wendy Weaver told the San Fran- cisco Chronicle . “They said they were going to interview all these people and then bring the findings back to their exper ts to determine if he was suicidal... I told them I thought it was murder.” 2 Press reports were silent as to why the case was being reopened at this time; indeed, few papers other than the Chronicle report- ed on it at all. Only the dim political purpose of the coming end to B ush’s year of silence even suggested an answer. Did the new administration take interest in this high pr ofile case, touching as it did on the intelligence backgr ounds of prominent Republican personalities, as protection against Clinton-bashing from the Bush camp? Or was there more to it?

In noting that H ubbell had been assigned to r eview the Inslaw case, long-time Washington watcher Sarah McClendon also noted that Casolaro had maintained that additional details about the I nslaw relationship with the Jus- tice Department could be had from employees in the office of Senator Robert Byrd. 3 McClendon affirmed Casolaro’s story that he had scheduled an inter- view with these employees for the Friday preceding his death. Senator Byrd’s chief of staff was the wife of Peter Videniecks, contracting officer at the Justice Department during the Inslaw period. McClendon quoted Bill Turner as say- ing that Casolar o told him that he planned to meet with two members of Robert Byrd’s staff. McClendon also noted the H amilton’s complaints that Hubbell and FBI investigator Scott Erskine had plans to release a report with- out having talked to impor tant Casolaro associates or inv estigating curious incidents, including a threat against Casolaro made by a friend of Videnieks, Joseph Cuellar, who apparently was also trailing the writer. 4 Hubbell himself had already been connected to the Inslaw case through the confessions of Danger Man. In April, 1992, Michael Riconosciuto told Village Voice ’s F rank Snepp of the link betw een guns-and-dr ugs operations at an airstrip in Mena, Arkansas—a story that already loomed as a major Clinton- era scandal because of Clinton ’s failur e to inv estigate the situation as governor 5 —and Park-On-Meter (POM), a par king meter manufactur er in Russellville, Arkansas, that figured prominently in making Webb Hubbell one of the early victims of another Clinton debacle, the Whitewater affair . 6 Riconosciuto claimed to have worked with Terry Reed, the Mena pilot whose rev elations first br ought the O liver N orth-styled smuggling operation to national attention. Riconosciuto also told Mark Swaney, the head of a University of Arkansas student group responsible for a petition drive to investigate Mena, that he had been involved in dev eloping chemical and biological w eapons in a pr oject connected to POM—apparently never explicitly that this was also connected to the work he did on Cabazon tribal lands—and that the company also man- ufactured external fuel tanks for C-130 transpor t planes. Riconosciuto had already confided to Alexander Cockburn that he had super vised high-tech equipment transfers and developed software to help launder money at Mena 7 and explained that POM, in conjunction with the infamous Wackenhut and Stormont Labs in Woodland, California, began pr oduction of the deliv ery system for the ne w chemical and biowarfare weaponry for use in the contra war in 1983. Long-range transpor t missions require the use of external fuel tanks, but again Riconosciuto was not explicit in connecting this with his tales of space aliens or the bizarre aircraft at Area 51 that had attracted Caso- laro’s attention. 8"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Riconosciuto told Cockburn that Park-On-Meter made the tanks for uncon- ventional guerilla war fare against the contras. POM was to r eceive chemical agents from the 354th Chemical Company of the Army R eserve, located on property across from the barn housing the POM facilities, for use in explosiv e devices made with the same equipment POM used to produce parking meters. 9 Stormont Labs ackno wledged only discussions with Wackenhut regarding biological weapons, and Wackenhut denied wor king with POM. POM pr esi- dent, Seth “Skeeter” Ward III, also Webster Hubbell’s brother-in-law, admitted that the company had some P entagon contracts, but only for “ re-entry nose cones for the nuclear warheads on the MX missile and nozzles for r ocket engines,” not chemical or biological weapons delivery systems, although he con- fessed to not kno wing what kind of air craft parts POM made for one of its contracts with McDonnell Douglas. 10 Ward also denied another central charge made by Danger Man: that POM received the first industrial development loan made by the Arkansas Development Finance Authority (ADFA), a controversial state authority co-written by Webster Hubbell in 1985. Bill Clinton appointed every member of the ADF A’s governing board and was r equired to approve its every bond issue, apparently with no other legislative means of guaranteeing that the money would be spent as intended. The ADFA primarily ser ved two masters: the S tephens, Inc., investment bank that received seventy-eight percent of ADFA’s underwriting fees and sales of housing and industrial bonds (Clinton had appointed two Stephens associates to the ADFA board); 11 and Clinton crony Dan Lasater, whose Lasater and Com- pany firm underwrote $664 million in municipal bond issues after the cr eation of the ADFA. 12 Lasater was a par ty animal renowned for cocaine soir ees at his Arkansas mansion, who claimed to hav e paid off dr ug debts of the P resident’s brother Roger. Even after a police inv estigation of Lasater in 1985 for dr ugs, Clinton approved a $30.2 million bond issue to o verhaul the state police radio system. In 1986, Lasater was sentenced to thirty months in prison for the distri- bution of cocaine (R oger Clinton was an unindicted co-conspirator) and was pardoned for it by Clinton. He remained connected to the White House through White House official Patsy Thomasson, manager of Lasater and Company, while Lasater was in jail. I n this mur ky financial atmospher e, and despite Ward’s denials, it is pr obable that the ADF A did issue one of its first bond issues to POM—with Clinton’s required approval. Mena did not provide the only evidence that the O ctopus swam in White- water currents, however. Its tentacles also str etched toward the most infamous scandal of the Clinton era: the Vincent Foster death. POM’s admitted jobs for the Pentagon and the funny finances of the ADFA remained obscure for the most part in the media.

The Rose Law F irm declared that Hubbell had failed to provide documentation for expenses he had charged to the firm and that POM lost $1 million in litigation expenses when H ubbell unsuc- cessfully pursued a patent infringement case he took on a contingency basis for his brother-in-law “Skeeter” Ward. “Unfortunately, because of public speculation about me and my former law firm,” Hubbell said in his resignation letter, “I will have to spend a significant amount of time on an internal matter with my for- mer partners.” 13 In addition to bringing POM out of the Washington spotlight, the resigna- tion shielded H ubbell fr om other accusations r egarding the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate investments. Specifically, Hubbell served on the Resolution Trust Corporation during its takeover of the Madison Savings and Loan, owned by Whitewater partner James McDougal and previously repre- sented by Hubbell. Hubbell failed to inform the RTC of the potential conflict. 14 Unofficially, Hubbell was the second victim of Whitewater, following White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum’s forced resignation for questionable meetings with federal regulators looking into the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate investments. Nussbaum had been responsible for removing Whitewa- ter files and a diary from the office of White House aide Vincent Foster less than three hours after Foster’s death from a gunshot wound. He was accompanied on that visit by Patsy Thomasson. Foster’s last weekend had been spent in the com- pany of Webster Hubbell, his wife and another couple—White H ouse counsel Michael Cardozo and his wife. Hubbell joined the group in Maryland after leav- ing the meeting that informed William Sessions of his dismissal as FBI director. After returning from a H awaiian vacation, Bill Clinton spent the w eekend in Arkansas dining with David Edwards, a former Stephens Inc. employee and con- duit for $23 million from the king of Saudi Arabia for the Middle Eastern studies program at the University of Arkansas. Clinton had one last twenty minute con- versation with Foster the Monday night before his death. 15 Oddly, one of Foster’s last phone conversations on the morning of his death was with B rantley Buck, the Rose Law Firm partner assigned to investigate Webster Hubbell and POM. 16 In 1995, new suspicions arose concerning the use of PROMIS in the world banking system. O ne post on the I nternet charged (or , rather, sarcastically reported the “false” charge) that Systematics, a subsidiary of Alltech Corpora- tion comprised of Systematics Financial Services Inc., Systematics Information Ser vices Inc. of Little R ock, Arkansas, and S ystematics Telecommunications Ser vices Inc. of Dallas, Pennsylvania, had modified the PR OMIS software for sale to private banks, with the attendant back-doors to allow the NSA to spy on banking operations. The post w ent on to charge that Webster Hubbell had"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"“helped work out strategies to use S ystematics software to spy on commer cial and central banks.” The anonymous source encouraged Internet readers to ver- ify the charge (or “the utter falsehood of these malicious lies ”), and attached a long list of bank and financial ser vice addresses, executive names and capsule histories of their conv ersion to Systematics software, replete with citations in American Banker. 17 The Systematics information and Vince Foster’s last weekend with Web- ster Hubbell and Michael Cordoza came together to float the last odd rumors about the PR OMIS pr ogram. I nstead of the r ecreational affair it was described as during the Congressional Whitewater hearings, the source of this new speculation suggested that the Clinton cr onies met to plot damage con- trol over a burgeoning scandal inv olving PROMIS. Nearly $3 billion had been emptied out of S wiss bank accounts belonging to doz ens of high-pow- ered political types—both D emocrats and R epublicans—by a CIA faction known during this period as “ the Fifth Column.” The Fifth Column group served as expert hackers, collecting routine foreign intelligence data, presum- ably through the PROMIS back-door, when they encountered Vince Foster’s name in the Mossad system. From there, they tracked Foster’s bank trail to the Banca Della Svizzera Italiana, a small Italian border bank, where the Israelis deposited $2.73 million. The rumors only speculated about what Foster gave the Israelis: high lev el intelligence information; encr yption codes; data on black operations subcontractors—he was dead before it could be figured out. Whatever it was, the F ifth Column tipped its hand to F oster that he was under investigation by removing the money, although according to the story his was not the only account raided. Making another apparently regular one- day trips to Geneva, Foster discovered the missing money, and later perhaps someone mentioned to him that he was under inv estigation for espionage, and thereafter he became suicidal. 18 ———— 1.

These businesses described them- selves variously as aircraft and parts delivery services, but stories of drug traffic continued. In 1989, new allegations w ere made b y a former inv estigator for the US militar y, Gene Wheaton, that the airfield was also used for commando training. The Arkansas state police inves- tigated and reported to the US attorney, but expected indictments were never returned, leading to the suspicion that the R eagan administration could add one mor e small cover-up to its tally. Apparently, Bill Clinton did not become inv olved with the stor y until a pair of students at the University of Arkansas—Mark Swaney and Tom Brown—appealed directly to their then-gover- nor to investigate. The appeal, and another call for a state grand jury from Arkansas’ deputy state prosecuting attorney, was stone walled. When Arkansas representative Bill Alexander met with Governor Clinton, he was told that $25,000 in state money had been set aside to inv estigate Mena. The amount was too slight for an effective investigation but even that was never delivered. The prosecuting attorney in Mena’s Polk County at the time said he never received the offer from the then-governor’s office. The IRS began an investigation of Barry Seals’ operation in Mena after Seal was murdered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana by Columbian drug traffickers, but according to Bill Duncan, a former IRS investigator, the investigators were warned off, causing Duncan to quit and testify befor e a House committee about all he had learned of money laundering, covert operations and drug smug- gling in Mena. The claim that Clinton was remiss in not investigating Mena was first made public by Larry Nichols in a defamation suit against the go vernor. Clinton had hired Nichols as marketing direc- tor for the Arkansas Development Finance Authority but fired him when his alleged contacts with the contras became too appar ent, citing the charge that N ichols had made unauthoriz ed phone calls to Central America as a r eason for the firing. In Nichols’ subsequent lawsuit contesting that charge, he also first publicized the claims of Gennifer Flowers. The court case of Terry Reed also added much to the Mena story. In 1988, Reed was charged with postal fraud for r eceiving insurance money on a false claim. R eed claimed that his airplane had been stolen as part of an Ollie North-styled project called “Project Donation,” wherein “dona- tions” to the contra cause w ere filed as lost or stolen with insurance companies and then reimbursed. According to R eed, he had no awar eness of “Project Donation” at the time of his plane’s disappearance, and so r eported it as a legitimate loss. The plane r eappeared after R eed learned of the Donation project and warned his contacts in the Ollie North network that he would have no part of it. Reed told his story with co-author John Cummings in Compromised: Clinton, Bush and the CIA , published by SPI Books/Shapolsky. The person who first r eported the discovery of what turned out to be R eed’s plane to the National Crime Information Center was Raymond L. “Buddy” Young, then working for Bill Clin- ton as security chief and since chosen by Clinton to head the Dallas regional office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Federal Judge Frank Theis later said that Young and an associate “acted with reckless disregard for the truth” in their version of how they came to realize the plane was not stolen. Charges against Reed were dropped. 6. Snepp, Frank, “Clinton and the Smuggler’s Airport,” Village Voice , April 14, 1992. 7.

A man named Gary Eitel testified before a Congressional committee headed by Rep. Charles Rose (D-NC), which examined the misuse of an “historic air- craft exchange program.” As early as 1991, Eitel learned that private air-cargo companies that contracted with the US Forest Service were using aircraft intended for firefighting duty on unauthorized overseas missions, some allegedly for the CIA. The mastermind of this scheme was a former Air Force pilot named Roy Reagan. After leaving the service, Reagan made a career bro- kering aircraft deals, and one former military C-130 he had brokered later crashed and burned on a CIA mission in Angola. In an interview with the Por tland Free Press , Gary Eitel described his May 23 deposition in federal court as more like an interrogation. Present were an obviously hostile group of powerful attorneys, including Stuart M. Gerson, appointed to the Justice Department by George Bush. Gerson was held over as acting Attorney General in the early Clinton Adminis- tration, and later represented defendant Roy Reagan. As Mr. Eitel prepared to testify before Rep. Rose’s congressional com- mittee, a shocking and suspicious turn of events occurred. Eitel’s friend and associate from T&G Aviation, Jack Chisum, was run down and killed by an automobile while walking along a roadside. As the May 23 deposition progressed in federal court, attorneys for the companies made repeated references to the fate of Jack Chisum, and clearly made attempts to reveal Mr. Eitel’s unlisted home address. Under questioning by former acting US Attorney General, Stuart Ger- son, Mr. Eitel discussed the fact that public service aircraft require no certification, when Gerson suddenly blurted out a totally unrelated ques- tion: “Do you know who killed Danny Casolaro?” Apparently, Gerson believed that Casolaro was murdered. Mr. Eitel believed that Gerson’s totally incongruous question was a direct threat. 1 ———— 1.

The only person in the S280 M ercedes sedan to emerge alive from the other end of the tunnel was the accompanying body- guard, Trevor Rees-Jones. The sedan had passed a white F iat and, after a blinding flash, 1 it crashed into a concrete tunnel pillar at somewhere between 90 and 110 miles per hour . The car ricocheted and then smashed into the opposite tunnel wall. Paul and the 42-year-old Dodi Al Fayad died instantly. Paramedics gave 34-year-old Diana a blood transfusion at the scene, but her heart stopped in the ambulance en r oute to the hospital and she died four hours after the crash. Diana’s death made an impact in world history similar only to the Kennedy assassination, which occurred in the year of Diana’s birth. Just like that event, the details of how she died became a matter of gr eat debate and conspiratorial theorizing. 2 Just as JFK’s death was officially investigated and declared the result of a single gunman acting alone, the official investigation of Diana’s death con- cluded that it was a simple automobile accident. And just as with JFK, a preponderance of unlikely coincidences and unansw ered questions left many people suspicious that the crash in the P ont D’Alma tunnel was an orchestrat- ed assassination, done for the sake of keeping D iana fr om pursuing her relationship with Dodi Al Fayad, an Egyptian, a Muslim and the son of power- ful businessman, M ohamed Al F ayed. 3 Some even suggested that D iana was pregnant with Dodi Al Fayed’s child at the time of her death.

Three years after D iana’s still unsettled death, which occurred six years after Casolaro’s, the disaster in the Pont D’Al- ma tunnel brought the story of the Octopus, PROMIS software, and Casolaro’s world of Iran-contra spies, arms mer chants and corrupt politicos back in the news. As noted, the shadowy presence of Adnan Khashoggi once again emerged in the background of Diana’s death. Khashoggi was D odi Fayed’s uncle and a well-known broker of military hardware deals involving Saudi Arabia stretching back to the 1970s. 4 Recall that Casolaro had only days left to live when he took his friend Ben Mason down into his basement and proudly showed him sever- al photocopied pages documenting contra arms transfers inv olving Khashoggi and a par tner, Manucher Ghorbanifar, as w ell as the copies of BCCI checks drawn on Khashoggi’s accounts. Mason later reported that Casolaro was elated over a sour ce he was about to meet in West Virginia, someone Casolar o described to Virginia McCullough as being involved in guns-and-drugs trans- fers. And, of course, Casolaro had told his fellow hotel guest, Mike Looney, that he was meeting with an Arab. No one has suggested that Casolar o planned to meet Khashoggi or ev en a compatriot, but he was investigating Iran-contra arms dealings and he did place great importance on that final meeting, and called it something that would wrap up his Octopus research. As with all of his r esearch, however, this tributary led to others inv olving Octopus entanglements bey ond Iran-contra and bey ond PROMIS and Inslaw. Casolaro’s focus on the Khashoggi documents almost cer- tainly inv olved kno wledge of Khashoggi ’s A pril 1986 meeting with Tony Rowland, Australian tycoon, publisher of The Observer newspaper and an adver- sary of Mohammad Al Fayed’s attempt to gain B ritish citizenship. 5 Khashoggi, Gorbanifar and journalist/Israeli foreign adviser Amiram Nir attempted to per- suade Rowland to join the I ran-contra effort by helping sell arms to I ran. The attempted alliance bogged down after the meeting, when Rowland inquired into US circles about covert support for such an effort. It seems very likely that Caso- laro knew about this alliance between Dodi Fayed’s maternal uncle, Khashoggi, and his father ’s bitter enemy , R owland. The deeper significance, of course, became clear after Casolaro’s death, and after Diana’s. 6 Although Casolaro had apparently wrapped up, or was going to wrap up after that final meeting, his r esearch into Iran-contra, he no doubt also took a strong interest in possible O ctopus involvement in other co vert arms deals involving Khashoggi. That was no small list. I t included such little and w ell known brouhahas in the world of international arms traffic as the P etromonde scandal, the Litton scandal, the Westland Scandal, the Lockheed scandal, the Nor throp scandal, the Lina Al-Bassam scandal and, most importantly, the cor- ruption involving the Al Yamamah contracts and Iran-contra."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"142 THE OCTOPUS The amount of attention and detail Casolaro brought to all this parahistory remains lost in the accordion file that disappeared at his death. Adnan Khashog- gi’s role in the N orthrop scandal of the early 1970s was w ell known to him, however. In 1972 and 1973 Khashoggi had served as the middle man in corrup- tion pay-offs (“commissions” for various arms-deals, often involving the sale of sub-standard equipment to the S audis) by the aerospace firm Northrop to the head of the Saudi Air Force, General Hashim M. Hashim and to his successor, General Asad Zuhair. Northrop, which also made illegal campaign contributions to Richard Nixon, paid S audi prince Khaled bin A bdullah over $500,000 in bribes, after Abdullah’s public complaint that “If I get nothing, then I will make sure Adnan gets nothing.” A Security Exchange Commission investigation of the situation led only to Northrop’s signing a pledge to no longer conceal the bribes. The Saudi royal family outlawed the commissions, but with laws that w ere ill-defined and never enforced. Extra-contractual “commission” payments con- tinued to maintain the w ealth of the Saudi royals. Khashoggi continued as the sole House of Saud contact for arms dealers, through a front company incorpo- rated in L uxembourg, Triad America Corporation, with funds N orthrop deposited into a Swiss bank for Khashoggi, who continued to funnel much of it to the S audi r oyals. Although the N orthrop deal ev entually did fall apar t, Khashoggi continued to use his connections to King F ahd and Prince Sultan to broker arms deals. 7 Not the least of these deals was the Al Yamamah contract umbrella, a central contractual arrangement signed in Riyadh in F ebruary 1986, that suppor ted both the British aerospace industry and the corr upt wealth of the S audi royal family. Through this series of contracts, the S audis turned over oil to the B ank of England, which allowed for its sale through Shell Oil and British petroleum. Profits from that were turned over to the UK’s defense ministry, which paid the British Aerospace corporation when it provided military hardware to Saudi Ara- bia. Like the Northrop arrangements, the Al Yamamah umbrella comes replete with “commissions” and bribes, and involves the delivery of substandard military hardware. 8 In a search for justice in what he r egarded as the mur der of his son and Princess Diana, Mohammad Al Fayed returned to the histor y and speculation about the multinational Octopus cabal. In the early fall of 2000, Al F ayed filed a Freedom of Information Act suit against the CIA and several other US intelli- gence services. He declared his intent to r ecover documents originally sur faced by a self-proclaimed CIA agent named O swald LeWinter.

Castle Securities was formerly Drexel Company, which was connected to Drexel, Burn- ham, Lambert and the junk bonds scandal. Taus states that many people who were involved in Castle Securities part of a group out of Freeport, Long Island known as the K-T eam. Most if not all K-T eam members w ere par t of the Iran/contra scandal. Taus reported that the K-Team was a CIA operation which included many infamous names such as Oliver North, Admiral John Poindexter, Richard Secord, and Adnan Khashoggi... Lord Earl Spencer (Diana’s father) was the best friend of Adnan Khashog- gi’s brother-in-law, Mohammad Al F ayed. Al F ayed was connected to the K-Team and its enterprises through Castle Securities. The ten year friendship between Lord Spencer and Al Fayed eventually lad to the intr oduction of Al Fayed’s 40-year-old son, Emad ‘Dodi’ Fayed, to Princess Diana. Mohammad El Fay ed and Adnan Khashoggi had been connected to the K-team thr ough their business deals. The K-team was/is made up of CIA operativ es who wer e/are members of Faction 1—the New World Order, and Faction 2—the opposition to the NWO. Al Fayed and Khashoggi were connected to the men who make up Faction 2. 11 The idea of the factional split in the global police intelligence community had a long life in the Casolaro saga. Danger Man Riconosciuto previously main- tained that two factions, COM-12 and A quarius, had leaked information to Casolaro in order to embarass and manipulate each other. As the accumulation of rumor and speculation continued to move Diana and the Octopus closer together in the thinking of conspiracy students, Riconsociu- to emerged again to make a connecting link. The Royal Canadian M ounted Police, key players in the original tale of the PROMIS software piracy, reopened its investigation into the affair in 1999/2000 when it conducted a series of inter- views with a former stockbroker in Ontario named John Belton. Reporters from the Tor onto Star discovered from Belton that the RCMP had reopened its inves- tigation into the Canadian r ole in the I nslaw affair and the possible thr eat it represented to Canadian security. “Belton said RCMP officers have already con- firmed to him that they do use the PR OMIS software [and the security of the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"145 D IANA RCMP has been compr omised as a r esult of trap doors in the softwar e]....The chainsmoking Belton unraveled his story at the kitchen table of his sprawling, ramshackle house near Ottawa.

Cour t documents, detailed notes of telephone conversations and newspaper clippings are marked up with highlighter and neatly organiz ed.” The Star quoted Belton as saying, “ You’re not dealing with paranoid crazies, or the UFO guys. I’m very serious about this.” 12 Belton’s story affirms details that have long been supplied by arms merchant and former Israeli spy Ari Ben-Menasche, who went on to work as a security con- sultant in Montreal. At the time of B elton’s revelations to the Canadian pr ess, Ben-Menasche reported that renewed interest in the case had led two Scotland Yard detectives to fly over and interview him. Their purpose: to discuss meetings Ben-Menasche had with none other than Mohammad Al Fayed. Details of that contact have yet to surface, but the Scotland Yard investigators were inexplicably accompanied by the two RCMP officers working on the (unofficially) reopened PROMIS case, Sean McDade and Randy Buffam. 13 Inv estigators also spoke with Riconosciuto ’s lawy er, Louis B uffardi, and Riconosciuto himself repeated the details of his involvement with PROMIS, but both made another unexpected connection of it all to a 1997 Octopus-style dou- ble homicide in Hercules, California. Like members of the Cabazon tribe before them, the bodies of 12-y ear-old Brendan Abernathy and his 43-year-old father Neal, who o wned a car r epair shop, were found bound in their living r oom, wrapped in electrical cable and shot ex ecution style.

The motorcyclist/photographer was not among the paparazzi arrested at the scene. The report of the flash persisted three years later, as a former MI6 agent named Richard Tomlinsin reported that “Henri Paul was an MI6 informer paid to spy on D iana and Dodi. The Diana crash was chillingly similar to a pr evious MI6 plot. That plot was to assassinate the S erbian leader Slobodon Milosevic in Geneva using a po werful laser strobe light—similar to that described b y witnesses to the Paris crash—to blind the driver.” The laser strobe, publicized greatly in an English documentary entitled Diana: Secrets Behind The Crash , was mentioned again by Dodi Al Fayed’s father Mohammed Al Fayed during a press con- ference announcing his Freedom of Information Act suit against the CIA and other US intelligence agencies for documents pertaining to the crash. One witness, secretary Brenda Wells, made state- ments strongly discriminating the strobe flash from the paparazzi flashbulbs."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"146 THE OCTOPUS 2. The following list outlines some suspicious details about the car crash: - It took an hour and for ty minutes to get D iana to the P itie Salpetiere hospital. Four other hospitals w ere closer. The White House, and consequently the US intelligence community, regards the Pitie Salpetriere as the official hospital of choice for officials vis- iting Paris. (This slowness has been described as part of the French inclination to stabilize a vicitm before proceding to hospital and as an attempt b y the ambulance to not aggra- vate Diana’s injuries.) - Early news reports had Diana up and walking around immediately after the crash. She also supposedly was able to speak some wor ds, and reportedly one photograph of the scene showed her utterly unbloodied. - A few weeks prior to the accident, the Mercedes had been stolen from the garage of the Ritz hotel, where the fatal ride began. Police recovered the car but found that its instr u- mentation had been tamper ed with. S hortly thereafter, the car was r einspected and reconditioned. - Contrary to normal procedures for bodyguards, guard Trevor Rees-Jones fastened his seatbelt before the ride. The others did not. R ees-Jones later claimed amnesia about the event, not due to trauma but to the drugs he recieved in the hospital for his severe facial injuries. - Henri Paul appears sober in video footage taken at the Ritz Hotel just before the fatal ride. The notion that Paul was severely alcoholic has been challenged by friends and family. - A mysterious $200,000 had been deposited in H enri Paul’s bank account just prior to the wreck. Former MI6 agent Richard Tomlinson claims the money came from MI6. - The French opened up the tunnel r oadway only hours after the crash and neglected to collect important evidence. Even establishment apologist Gerald Posner acknowledged the incompetence of the French investigation. - Seventeen cameras inside the tunnel failed to operate at the time of the crash. - The papparazzi photographer who may hav e owned the white Fiat encountered by the death car, James Andanson, died under questionable cir cumstances in May 2000. Police discovered Adnandson’s burned body in a charred BMW in the Aveyron woodland, near the village of Nant in Southwestern France. Previously, Andanson’s Paris office had been burglarized by three masked and well-trained men who wounded a security guard and for a while kept the office staff hostage. I t took four weeks for police to identify Andanson’s remains from DNA tests. Official investigators claim that the white paint of Andanson ’s Fiat did not match that r ecovered from scrape mar ks on the M erecedes, and consider Andanson’s death a suicide, despite the bizarre circumstances. 3. Mohammed Al Fayed owns the posh Harrod’s department store in London. He has worked hard to ferret out government documents held in secret and other information concerning possible plots in the death of his son D odi and his son ’s lover Diana. The UK go vernment has long denied Mohammed Fayed’s application for B ritish citizenship and has looked askance at the impact his wealth and influence have had on politics in E ngland. The UK government has also deferred his request for a full inquiry into the crash to the official F rench investigation most people find seri- ously flawed. Mohammed Al Fayed holds the view that Queen Elizabeth’s husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, ordered the deaths of his son and Diana and is now using the CIA, MI5"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"147 D IANA and MI6 to cover it up.

Khashoggi spent thr ee semesters studying economics at Chico S tate University in California before starting a business renting his truck to companies doing business in Saudi Arabia. After col- lege, he developed those contacts into a role as a liaison between US and Saudi corporations and the Saudi military, primarily under Sultan bin Abdul Aziz. That role, in its various legal and extra- legal dimensions, br ought Adnan Khashoggi to gr eat w ealth as a br oker of long-term deals involving military hardware. In the transformation fr om renting out his tr uck to shepher ding arrangements for tanks and jet fighters, Khashoggi came to own a dozen estates and a $70 million yacht docked at Porto Banus, Spain. The yacht, called the Nabila, appears in the James Bond movie Nev er Say Never Again . Khashoggi later sold it to his friend, D onald Trump. The 1987 biography of Adnan Khashoggi, published by Warner Books and written by Ronald Kessler, is entitled The Richest Man In The World. 5. Alex Constantine notes, “Tiny Rowland was the publisher of London’s Observer until reporter Tom Bower researched the financier’s past a few years ago and discovered him to be a former Hitler Youth Corps leader. Rowland served a spell in an allied detainment camp to ward the end of the war, then migrated to S outh Africa and found enormous w ealth there in the mining industr y. Thereupon he relocated to the UK to pur chase the Observer and rub shoulders with some of the most notorious movers in the world business community, including Daniel Ludwig, a hotel mag- nate who retains a PR agency solely to keep his name out of the ne wspapers.” (10/13/97) 6. Peter Rushton claimed on the alt.politics.org.cia internet list that he had been given “a large file of allegations against R owland” by Francesca Pollard as part of a counter-offensiv e launched by Mohammad Al Fayed against intrique by Arab industrialist Ashraf Marwan, working as a front for Tiny Rowland, to secure a large number of shares in the House of Fraser, the company that owns Fayed’ s Harrod’s. The battle between Roland and Mohammad Al Fayed was fought in part with the help of Nemi Chand Jain, known also as Chandraswami. The followers of Chandraswami, one of India’s swarm of gurus for the jet-setting elite, include I ndian Prime Minister Narasimha, Tiny Rowland and Adnan Khashoggi. At one point Chandraswami circulated a faked tape of Mohammad Al Fayed admitting that he acquired Harrod’s with the help of the Sultan of Brunei. He also introduced to Khashoggi a woman named Pamela Bordes, whose wile apparently helped Khashoggi seal deals. Bordes was quot- ed as saying she was physically afraid of Khashoggi but mentally afraid of Chandraswami. 7. In 1996, the Committee Against Corruption in Saudi Arabia (CACSA) reported, “The rever- berations of Saudi Arabia’s procurement of over eighty Northrop F-SE/F’s are still being felt today, even as the kingdom seeks to r eplace the top heavy air craft with ne wer, sleeker trainer-fighter models. Saudi Arabia also bought F-SNB’s from Northrop in 1971, the first phase of the contract, a few years before they bought the F-5EIF’s. The deal was worth $4.2 billion before they bought the F-5EIF’s. “The F-5’s still have to be maintained until they ar e replaced. Three years ago, the Minister of Defense, Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz, pressured Northrop to award the maintenance contract to the Al Salam Aircraft Company, which was described as ‘poorly managed.’ ( Mednews—Middle East Defense News , April 19, 1993). The joint venture company was established to handle the over- haul of both Royal Saudi Air Force and Saudia, the commercial carrier aircraft. Al Salam’s facilities at the Riyadh airport are inadequate because its overhaul hangars are not connected to the runway, rendering them inaccessible to planes, and because the hangars do not hav e an adequate power sup- ply for the maintenance and repair work Al Salam was set up to do.”"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"148 THE OCTOPUS Khashoggi’s talent at brokering deals emerged again in 2003. I n the New Yorker (“Annals of National Security, Lunch with the Chairman,” M arch 17, 2003), S eymour Hersh reported that Khashoggi arranged meetings between a wealthy Saudi industrialist named Harb Saleh al-Zuhair and Richard Perle, who ser ved in the B ush administration as chairman of the D efense Policy Board, an advisory group to the Pentagon. Perle was also one of the neoconser vative architects of the administration’s “pax Americana” foreign policy and a strident advocate of invading Iraq. It was his role as a partner in a venture capital firm that caught Hersh’s attention, however. The compa- ny, Trireme Partners L.P., produced defense and anti-terrorist technologies. It had sent a letter to Khashoggi stating that war and the fears of terr orism would gr eatly increase the demand for Trireme’s services. Boeing had already contributed twenty million dollars in an attempt to attract investors like Khashoggi and his friends, according to the letter. It was a shameless attempt at war profiteering, but also a clear conflict of inter est because of Perle’s government position. After the Hersh article, Perle was forced to resign as Defense Policy Board chairman, although he continued to serve on the board (along with the likes of Henry Kissinger). He even threatened to sue Hersh over the controversy. 8. Information about Al Yamamah comes largely fr om the dissident gr oup within Saudi Arabia, since British Aerospace does not reveal terms of the contract and the British press has been slow to investigate. The Committee reported that “The Saudi Arabian government has British Aerospace wrapped around its finger because r evenues from the al-Yamamah deal saved the company from going under. In the early 1990s, it was losing as much as $1.8 billion dollars a year... British Aero- space agreed to supply Saudi Arabia with forty-eight Tornadoes, thirty Hawks, thirty Pilatus PC 9s, two Jetstream trainers, and a variety of missiles and ground based equipment in exchange for oil. Two years later, under Al-Yamamah, the Saudi government ordered forty-eight more Tornados. In J anuary 1993, immediately after the company r eported one of the worst annual losses of any British company ever, Saudi Arabia ordered more Tornados. The focus of the Al-Y amamah contract is money , not w eapons. In the wor ds of G eorge Galloway, the S audi governemt has ordered “vast amounts of unusable weapons” which were worth millions of pounds to British aero- space. The Saudi government does not care whether the weapons work. The royal family is using the al-Yamamah deal as a cover.” (Internet posting, September 19, 1997.) Researcher DasGoat summarized, “It was in the context of the joint US-B ritish trade in arms in the Middle East, camouflaged by Operation Desert Storm—that Khashoggi’s brother- in-law M ohammad Al F ayed appar ently managed someho w to bring do wn the B ritish government, or rather the conser vatives around Thatcher (and her protege John Major) who, indistinquishable from Republicans around Reagan and B ush, turned their nation ’s treasury into a personal slush fund, making their fortunes from investing in corrupt and criminal activ- ities (whitewashed as covert operations or wars) in the arms and drugs market.” (To CTRL list, 9/11/97.) 9. “Edinburgh” here refers to Prince Phillip; “WHuse” refers to the White House; and David Sped- ding is the head of MI6. 10. In 1997, Rayelan Allan provided a fanciful but fascinating discussion of the history behind the fateful crash site, under the psuedonym “Ru Mills” via Brian Redman’s Conspiracy Nation : Princess Diana and her soon-to-be husband, Dodi Fayed, were fatally injured in the Pont de l’Alma tunnel. The site is ancient, dating back to the time of the M erovingian kings (ca. 500—751 A.D.), and before. In pre-Christian times, the Pont de l’Alma was a pagan sacrificial site. Note that in the pagan connotation, at least, sacrifice is not to be confused with murder: the sacrificial victim had to be a willing par ticipant."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"149 D IANA In the time of the Merovingian kings, the Pont de l’Alma was an underground chamber. Founder of the M erovingian dynasty was M erovaeus, said to be descended fr om the union of a sea creature and a French queen. Merovaeus followed the pagan cult of Diana. In Middle English, “soul” (Alma) has as etymology “descended from the sea.” “Pont” has as a Latin root “pontifex,” meaning a Roman high priest. (See also pons, pontis—bridge; passage.) “Alma” comes from the Latin “almus,” meaning nourishing. One translation of Pont de l’Alma would be “bridge of the soul.” Another would be “ passage of nourish- ment.” All tr ue E uropean r oyalty is descended fr om the M erovingians, which ar e believed to be descendants of Jesus Christ. During the Merovingian era, if two kings had a dispute o ver property, it was settled in combat at Pont de l’alma. According to legend, anyone killed there goes straight to Heav- en and sits at the right hand of G od, watching over all his foe was to do . The person killed in combat was actually considered to be the “winner,” since he became God’s eyes on earth and could even manipulate events. The current British royal family are imposters. The House of Windsor is a fraud. But the lineage of Lady Diana Spencer goes back to Charles II House of Stewart. The House of Ste wart is of “true” royal blood. Diana’s sons, William and Harry, have three quarters true nobility in their blood. Rayelan Allan developed her thesis that Diana’s death was arranged in order to use her image to create a world-controlling religion in the book, Diana, Queen of Heaven , available at the web site www.dianaqueenofheaven.com. 11.

Some nights he also met with a person Seth knew as Keith’s Sufi contact. Seth knew Keith well; 1 he knew little of the Sufis. Sufism has origins in the early Islam of the desert nomads, although the SufiOrder of the West was found- ed in London in 1910 for the “ transmission of spiritual truth in a manner that is consistent with modern, Western culture.” 2 For years, Jim Keith collected obscure bits of information for v arious zines 3 and books that featured his writ- ing. Unlike Danny Casolaro, whose story so intrigued Keith that he helped write this book on Casolar o, Keith did not operate in total obscurity . He was well- known, practically a celebrity in the world of marginals publishing. H e lectured regularly at conspiracy and UFO conferences and had several acclaimed titles to his credit. 4 Keith regaled conspiracy theorists for many years. He was pleased that he had found such an obscure source from a mysterious, religious/mystical back- ground, the S ufis. He had a second column due for a ne w online ne wsletter called Nitro News. Keith’s Sufi friend told him of returning from a trip to London for Dhikr , a celebration of Allah that often involved ecstatic trance states. He told Keith that the ceremony was attended b y the personal physician of D odi Fayed, the man who died with Diana on the fateful day of the P ont D’Alma tunnel crash. The doctor, a non-Sufi Muslim, privately revealed a great secret to Keith’s Sufi friend: Diana was pregnant when she died. The doctor had personally made the exami- nation and verified the pregnancy. Keith felt that this was just the thing to follow the Nitro News column he had written on the possible conspiracy in the plane crash that killed JFK, Jr . A ques- tion remained, however. What was that physician’s name? Keith hoped he could get two columns out of this, one asserting the idea of the pregnancy, another giv- Chapter 22: Jim Keith V 150"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"151 J IM K EITH ing the name of the physician. Nitro News had been slow in paying, so he want- ed to stretch out the writing chores. The Sufi provided him with the name after another assurance that his own name would be kept anonymous. Perhaps Keith thought of Casolaro as he parted company with the Sufi and determined to go home and knock out that column. H ome those days was a trailer outside of Reno. Keith returned to it and wrote this column: PRINCE SS DIANA WAS PREGNANT; FAYED’S PHYS ICIAN EXAMINED HER Recent French findings have not put to rest the suspicion that a conspiracy was responsible for the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, millionaire Dodi Fayed, and driver, Henri Paul, in Paris on August 31, 1997. The case for conspiracy is familiar enough to those who delve into the hidden side of world politics. Diana had crossed the reigning House of Windsor, and had taken on the color of an enemy to the throne of Great Britain. Born of competing Stuart Royal line, she had been a thorn in the side of the British Monarchy virtually from the beginning of her marriage to Prince Charles. She was far more popular than the aloof Charles, and a perception of unfair treatment by the Royal Family only added to already numerous calls for the abolition of the Monarchy. It is fair to think that the House of Windsor may have seen Diana as becom- ing dangerously powerful, and as a threat to its future. She was also viewed as a threat to other elements of the British establishment, including the arms industry, whose lucrative business in death was challenged by her calls for an international ban on land mines. Diana had already been targeted with surveillance and wiretaps by Britain’s domestic intelligence agency, MI5, and through the leaking of her private conversations to the press. At least two persons close to Diana and Dodi Fayed have told the press that the couple was planning on marrying. They had been dating for nine months, and Dodi’s purchase of a quarter million dollar diamond ring for her provided additional confirmation. The British establishment would have seen a marriage to Dodi Fayed as an alliance with the Muslim world, and there was the real possibility that Diana would convert to the Islamic faith. Equally important, Dodi’s father was bil- lionaire Muhammad Fayed, related to the Saudi Royal Family. He is alleged to have compromised many British politicians through the use of his bribes and other incentives. Of central importance to the belief that Diana may have been murdered are unconfirmed reports that she was pregnant by Dodi Fayed at the time of her death. Certainly, the birth of a child with Egyptian blood, half-brother to Diana’s sons, would have been seen as a devastating event to the rulers of Britain. So far, however, no conclusive proof has been offered that she was"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"152 THE OCTOPUS pregnant. I have now obtained the closest thing to proof that will probably ever be revealed. Confirmation of Diana’s pregnancy comes from a unique source: through the network of the Middle Eastern religious group called the Sufis. The Sufis are a meditative, mystical offshoot of the Islamic faith, and several members of this group are friends of the author. One of my Sufi contacts, who chooses to remain anonymous traveled to London to participate in Dhikr , a remembrance of Allah. Both Sufis and orthodox Muslims attended this ritual. My contact reports that while partic- ipating in this ceremony, he met Dodi Fayed’s personal physician, a man who is a Muslim, but is not a Sufi. In private conversation, the physician told him that Diana and Dodi Fayed had planned on getting married, and that he had personally examined her and determined that she was pregnant. If this is the case, why has this physician not come forward and told the press? One can only speculate. Perhaps this information is being kept secret as part of a larger indictment when Muhammad Fayed finally weighs in with proof of a conspiracy. Keith sent the new column to his editors at Nitro News , planning to use the physician’s name in the next one next. H e planned to do this after a visit to the Burning Man festival in Black Rock, just north of Reno. 5 The lore of the Burning Man attracted Keith. Larry Harvey, Jerry James and twenty sympaticos started the event by burning an eight-foot stick figur e of a man on Baker Beach in San Francisco in June of 1986. Harvey did it to purge himself of feelings from a romance gone wrong; the others had their own reasons to create a symbolic break from the past. The stick burning had long been moved to Black Rock and had become a massive 50-foot effigy for over 15,000 heavily dosed revelers. Keith did not have a past to purge, but he did hav e a reputation to protect and promote as Reno’s top party animal. As a top barfly on the Reno scene, especially for his UFO conspiracy talk gr oup at the Planet 9 bar on East Fourth Street, how could he not go? B urning Man consisted of intense mass hedonistic revelry, fireworks and pyrotechnics, thousands of free spirits practic- ing amateur performance art and drug-abundant celebration. He eventually found himself on one of the many stages at Burning Man. He was seen by many in the party atmosphere shaking hands, laughing with the rest of the crowd, bumping into people. At some point, however, he lost his balance and fell off the Burning Man stage. Keith’s long-time friend, Wayne Henderson, later imagined Keith’s situation the following morning:"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"153 J IM K EITH He is disheveled; still wearing most of what he was wearing last night (good performance; GREAT party) and the first thing he notices is that he’s got a monumental case of dragonmouth, and a headache.

His leg hurts. He gargles, showers. Gets another cup of 40- weight coffee. He rummages through a pile of papers on his work desk. Book manuscript (GOT to finish that intro) e-mails, articles, letters (got to answer that one from IllumiNet), back issue of Steamshovel Press (his leg hurts), more let- ters, more e-mails (should get online today, Conspiracy Journal is due), dog-eared invitation to a party at the Burning Man festival, what was I look- ing for anyway? God-all-MIGHTY, what the HELL did I do to my LEG? On the phone, make arrangements to go to the hospital and have a doctor look at this, put a splint on the darned thing, I’ve got work to do, for Chrissakes...” 6 The pain was such that K eith called paramedics, who deliv ered him to the Washoe Medical Center in Reno. He balked at the idea of anesthesia and surgery, but the Washoe doctors explained to him that the tibia fractur e he suffered at Burning Man required both. Keith’s nephew Chris Davis came out to be with him at Washoe. Keith told him, “I have a feeling that if they put me under I’ m not coming back. I kno w if I get put under , I am going to die.” 7 The doctors insisted that the surgical procedure was routine. Keith called his old friend from Planet 9, George Pickard, and told him that one of the hospital attendants had the same name as someone he debated months ago on MSNBC. The topic had been black helicopters and this person r epre- sented the Pentagon in arguing that the choppers just do not exist. 8 Ordinarily Keith liked these kinds of coincidences. They were fodder for his writing. This time, he told Piccard, it was getting a bit too weird. His came out to Washoe to be with Keith. “I was told that Jim was in room 106, on the first floor,” Pickard later reported, “When I checked that room, 106, I found an elderly lady with a completely different name. A nurse refused to tell me what happened and direct- ed me to an unidentified family spokesperson for information.” 9 Somewhere betw een nephe w D avis’ visit and G eorge Pickard’s attempt, Keith assented, very reluctantly, to the anesthetic and the surgery. He died on the operating table. On S eptember 7, 1999, a blood clot traveled from Jim Keith’s leg to his lung during or shortly after surgery that Washoe Medical Center doctors assured him was routine, and killed him. “ There’s no conspiracy her e,” Washoe County"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"154 THE OCTOPUS deputy coroner Steve Finnell later assured a Reno Gaz ette-Journal reporter, “This could happen to any one.

The strange coincidence that Nitro News , which posted Keith’s column about P rincess Diana to the w eb the day befor e Keith left for Burning Man, went mysteriously offline for two w eeks just before the news of Keith’s death, fanned the flames of suspicion. H ad Keith’s demise been orches- trated by the Octopus? Had someone whacked K eith’s knee at B urning Man? Did the Pentagon send an assassin to Washoe Medical? As with Danny Casolaro, a pr oper inv estigation nev er happened and most accepted deputy cor oner Finnell’s explanation, as disquieting as it seemed to other potential patients in Washoe County. Keith himself would have noted the coincidences: that he died shor tly after writing about Diana’s pregnancy, but before he named the physician; that ev en that column mysteriously disappeared from the web; that he died prematurely, at age 49, under unusual circumstances; the strange coincidence of the name of that hospital attendant. Death by blood clot in this way is rare, despite the assertions of the deputy coroner. It should not have happened. That it happened to Keith was one mor e of those bizarr e coincidences that leav e people scratching their heads, like all of the deaths surrounding Danny Casolaro’s research. Among Keith’s professional associates, news of his death hit Ron Bonds the hardest. Bonds ran IllumiNet Press in Lilburn, Georgia. IllumiNet published the majority of Keith’s books. Bonds wrote to one memorial site, “He was more like a partner here. He did all of our proofreading, he typed up stuff for me and w e talked on the phone ev ery day! He was like a consultant. I t’ll be a real drag to keep on without his help and input.” 12 Keith’s death took a large toll on Bonds and IllumiNet. Although he continued to publish—he had at least thr ee of the prolific Keith’s manuscripts on hand 13 —he and his wife began making plans to move into the real estate business. Bonds began IllumiNet after a brief career as a record producer and promoter for a Label called Elvis On Drugs , and at one point he started a church called the Church of B eaver Cleaver. A per verse sense of humor and a S outhern charm characterized everything that Bonds did. O ne of his early disco veries as a pub- lisher was Kerry Thornley, the Marine corps chum of Lee Harvey Oswald. Bonds"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"155 J IM K EITH had published The Idle Warrior , a no vel Thornley wrote about O swald long before the assassination, and The Principia Discordia , a Monty Pythonesque lam- poon of religion. Bonds also reprinted The Mothman Prophecies , a classic work of UFO literature by the writer John Keel, was sold as a Hollywood movie, but even in death, Jim Keith was his top-seller as well as his close friend. 14 Bonds carried on half-heartedly for months. Then, on April 7, 2001, he and his wife Nancy went to lunch at an El Azteca restaurant near their home in Lil- burn, Georgia. Later that night, at about 9 PM, Bonds headed to the bathr oom following an attack of nausea. F or the next six hours, his condition worsened, with diarrhea and vomiting, and he asked Nancy to call an ambulance before he collapsed on the floor of the bathr oom. He was unconscious when the ambu- lance arrived. It took him to Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta because it had a better trauma unit than nearb y DeKalb General. Medical personnel inserted tubes through his mouth and nose and into his lungs and intestines, but noth- ing stopped the sw elling and massiv e bleeding in his stomach and colon. O n April 8, at 5:30 AM Ron Bonds died from the bleeding at age 48. 15 After an autopsy the follo wing day, the Fulton county coroner, Dr. Hen- ninger, determined that the bacteria clostridium perfringens caused the swelling, and that it came from contaminated food Bonds ate at the E l Azteca. Health inspectors were called out and they discovered that the beef served at El Azteca contained bacteria in ex cess of what could be consider ed harmful to health, although an acceptable level for many people. Reactions to clostridium perfin- gens vary greatly among individuals and Bonds had suffer ed from chronic gastritis. Through credit card receipts, the health inspectors tracked down 118 El A zteca customers from that day. Only seven had diarrhea in the period fol- lowing their consumption of food at the restaurant, five had cramps and three vomited. A 1999 study b y the Centers for D isease Control indicated that a fatal reaction to clostridium perfringens food poisoning occurs in .0005 percent of cases. 16 The last book Bonds published b y Jim Keith was Biowarfare in A merica , which discussed targeted bioto xins. In it, Keith quoted Larry Wayne Harris, a man who had been arr ested by the FBI in February 1988 for possession of the anthrax bacterium, as claiming that an attempt was made against his life b y a needle wielding a cobra venom that induces massive clots to the lungs. 17 Then in N ovember 2001, a half-doz en additional cases of suspicious cir- cumstances surr ounding knee surger y operations w ere r eported acr oss the country. The first of these was a 23-year-old student in Minnesota named Brian Lykins, who died fr om a clostridium infection. The other cases also inv olved variants of the clostridium bacteria, eventually traced to a tissue bank in Atlanta, near Ron Bonds’ home. 18"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"156 THE OCTOPUS Another strange coincidence: Keith had written specifically about clostridi- um bacteria previously for FATE, the newsstand digest of paranormal stories. In typical Jim Keith fashion, he had tied it to another offbeat conspiracy topic, cat- tle mutilations. “Many mutilated cattle have been found marked with fluorescent paint,” wrote Keith, “probably to help identify them in the dark. But most telling is that a large percentage of mutilated cattle have also been injected with strains of clostridium bacteria (a genus that includes bacteria that cause blackleg and malignant edema). I n a 1970 inv estigation of bacteriological war fare, Senator Frank Church’s Senate Select Committee on I ntelligence determined that the CIA had stockpiled canisters of this same bacteria.” 19 How odd that Keith’s friend and publisher died of poisoning from the same bacteria, that many knee injuries ended in death due to clostridium and that the clostridium caused “blackleg ” in cattle, a term that r esonated eerily with the knee injury that claimed Keith’s life. ———— 1.

Article titles included “Around Again To Armageddon,” “Sympathy for the R evel,” “The Dulce Base,” “Operation Majority,” “Demolish Serious Culture,” and “Hallucinogenic Hypno-Vision and the Plasmatic Cells of Gaia.” Although Keith’s zine world of the late 1980s and early 1990s for eshad- owed the conspiracy theorist internet free-for-fall, it had the imprimatur of his unique personality. It also included many w ell-known personalities of the ongoing info undergr ound, such as G. J. Krupey, X. Sharks Despot, Wayne Henderson and Len Bracken. 4. Keith graduated from zines to books, eventually producing many well-known titles highly regard- ed by readers of conspiracy and parapolitical literature. They include The Gemstone File (IllumiNet, 1992); Black Helicopters: Strikeforce for the N ew World Order (IllumiNet, 1994); its sequel, Black Helicopters II: The Men In Black (IllumiNet, 1997); OK Bomb: Conspiracy and Cover-Up (IllumiNet, 1996); Mind Control—World Control (Adventures Unlimited Press, 1997); Secret and S uppressed (Feral House, August 1993); Casebook on Alternative Three (IllumiNet, 1997); Saucers of the Illumi- nati ; Mass Control: Engineering Human Consciousness (IllumiNet, 2000); and Biowarfare In America (IllumiNet, 2001). Keith also co-authored the first edition of The Octopus: Secret Government and the Death of Danny Casolaro , published by Feral House in 1996. 5. Bad Day At Black Rock is a famous Spencer Tracy movie released in 1955. Wilhelm Reich called it one of his favorites, in fact, and Keith was great admirer of Reich. Movie reviewers have identi- fied the location of the to wn of Black Rock in that movie as Arizona, California, and “remotely western.” The movie includes a character named Reno Smith, however, and it seems likely that it took place in the same town as the Burning Man festival."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"157 J IM K EITH 6.

By the end of 2001, mysterious deaths among micr obiologists specializing in infectious disease began to accumulate. They included: Dr. Benito Que (11/12/01, attacked by four men, at least one wielding a baseball bat, in M iami); Don C. Wiley (11/16/01, found dead after jumping, falling or being pushed from a bridge in M emphis, Tennessee); Vladimir Pasechnik (11/23/01); Robert M. Schwartz (12/10/02, stabbed); and Set Van Nguyen (12/14/01), suffocated in a laboratory airlock. This list moved from the conspiracy rumor circuit to front page news with the Casolaro-like “sui- cide” of David Kelly on July 18, 2003. Kelly, a microbiologist, had served as the head of the biological inspections team in I raq before the US inv asion. He was outspoken about “ sexed up” intelligence reports concerning Iraq’s biological weapons used by the US and Britain as a justification for the war. Like Casolaro, Kelly warned of “dark actors playing games” because of what he had researched and dis- covered before being found dead with a slit wrist not far fr om his Oxfordshire home. Kelly also had a direct connection with a previous name on the microbiologist death list. In 1989 he had helped debrief the Soviet defector Vladimir Pasechnik.

Legend has it that the ECHELON satellite system, which can photograph automobile license plates from outer space, utilizes some mutation of PROMIS’ extrapolation capabilities to fill in the visual contents of those long distance photos. 1 Fact has it that the coming “smart card,” a credit-card-sized surveillance tool that can hold over five gigabytes of information on its holder , has been pioneer ed in the H ong Kong transit system under the name, “the Octopus card.” 2 Fact and legend about PR OMIS came together after the world-changing disasters that occurred on September 11, 2001. An Irish nationalist known as “McGuffin” gave an unsourced report that Osama Bin Laden avoided capture by the US military in the months after the World Trade Tower and Pentagon crashes by using PROMIS. He asserted that the FBI turncoat Robert Hanssen passed the version of PROMIS used by British and German intelligence onto Russia, where it proceeded to find itself in the hands of the notorious chief Arab terrorist. 3 The Justice Department reporter for the Washington Times picked up the story and concluded, “The sophisticated software gives Bin Laden access to data- bases on specific targets of his choosing and the ability to monitor electr onic banking transactions, easing money-laundering operations for himself or others.” The Justice department’s complaint against H anssen charged that he made extensive use of FOIMS (F ield Office Information Management Systems) and COIN (Community On-Line Intelligence Systems), two of the FBI’s known case management software systems. The Times quotes sources as saying “FOIMS and COINS are believed to be upgraded versions of the PROMIS software program.” 4 “McGuffin” claimed that I nslaw’s Bill Hamilton told him that O sama Bin Laden paid the Russians $2 million dollars for an upgraded v ersion of the soft- Chapter 23: September 11 Epilogue V 158"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"159 S EPTEMBER 11 E PILOGUE ware, called “E nhanced PROMIS.” The Times quotes Hamilton as having no specific information about Hanssen, but suggested that a technical manual given by Hanssen to the R ussians according to the FBI, was “ related to the use of PROMIS as the standard software of the US intelligence community.” “McGuf- fin” argued that “H anssen, before his arr est, had play ed an impor tant role in installing [PROMIS] in MI5, MI6 and [Germany’s] BND.” 5 Michael Riconosociuto himself claimed to have met Bin Laden in the Spring of 1986 while networ king with representatives of the anti-S oviet mujahadeen. Danger Man proposed to sell shoulder-held missile launchers—called MAN- PADS, or Man Portable Air Defense Systems—for use against Soviet helicopters. According to the stor y, Bin Laden at the time trav eled under the name “ Tim Osman,” a pseudonym supplied “b y the CIA for his tour of the U.S. and U.S. military bases, in sear ch of political suppor t and armaments.” A pparently the meeting ended when Riconosciuto explained that his faction of intelligence world connections did not think B in Laden represented the true mujahadeen. The story ended with another plea to r elease Riconosciuto fr om his curr ent prison residence in Springfield, Missouri: “If the war against Osama Bin Laden (Tim Osman) is not a total fraud, then what is M ichael Riconsociuto doing in prison? Why doesn’t he have an office next to Colin Powell so he can give realis- tic advice on Bin Laden’s thinking?” 6 Another writer/editor team, Tom Flocco and M ichael Ruppert, made the case for the use of PROMIS in the insider trading deals that pr eceded the Sep- tember 11 tragedies. They received a non-denial fr om CIA spokesperson Tom Crispell that “the CIA had been using PR OMIS beyond American borders to scrutinize world financial markets for national security purposes,” and one from the FBI claiming that “the FBI has discontinued use of the PROMIS software.” Flocco notes that the latter denial “followed almost seventeen years of denial by the FBI and the D epartment of Justice—in court and under oath—that they used the software at all.” Nevertheless, Ruppert and Flocco maintain that stock screening and short selling that came in the days befor e the plane crashes 7 were accomplished with PROMIS, as was the financial tracking of B in Laden’s assets that happened in the aftermath. 8 Research tributaries leading to PROMIS keep alive Casolaro’s sense of histo- ry and parapolitics, and his foreboding about the developing world of perpetual surveillance and war. Despite the push to transform the tragedies of S eptember 11 into simple-minded, war-hungry patriotism—and whether or not PROMIS is ever proven to be a part of the manipulations—many Americans more readily accept the notion that O sama Bin Laden came to po wer under O ctopus-like funding.

The “anti-terror” war seems more about building a pipeline to the Caspian, exploit- ing the opium crop in Afghanistan and expanding the weapons trade than about protecting America from terrorists. 9 ———— 1.

What the hell would it take to monitor all that information from all those agencies? On the other hand, if bin Laden is their creature, perhaps one agency lets him know what another is doing against him. Sounds more like an elaborate cover to explain why we have not caught him or will not. Hanssen is a double agent case I think planted to feed disin- formation into the Soviet hands. His links to Opus Dei and COINTELPRO make me think he was really a very clever plant. So, I’d be cautious with these conclusions. P erhaps he did install something that would allow US intelligence to track Bin Laden, etc. That would make sense.” Cor- respondence with author, September 21, 2001. The issue returned again with the June 2003 resignation of Paul Redmond, the Assistant Sec- retary for Information Analysis for the H omeland Security department. Described by some as a “legendary spy catcher”—he had a r ole in the captur e of Aldrich Ames—R edmond resigned for “health reasons.” Most took that as polite co ver for Redmond’s frustration with underfunding of the department, but others connected it to a rumored secret investigation Redmond was conduct- ing into Hanssen’s role in delivering PROMIS to Osama. According to this rumor, Redmond had discovered shockingly long-standing common interests between the Bush and bin Laden families and was forced to resign. PROMIS, in fact, also had been given to Saddam Hussein by the senior Bush in the early 1990s. (Casolaro reported that Iraq was one of the countries that purchased the software illegally.) Although the stor y provided an opportunity for Inslaw’s story to be discussed anew in various opinion and editorial pieces, it seemed to trace to a single sour ce.

Even as the war moved into the Philippines, echoes were heard of Casolaro’s cross-connections between the domestic and the foreign in the global strategy of tension. Adam Parfrey gave the most detailed and succinct report: The ACLU worked tirelessly on behalf of A braham Ahmed, who the legal organization claimed was a victim of racist pr ofiling. On the same day as bombing, Ahmed attempted to fly from Oklahoma City to Amman, J ordan, but was stopped at H eathrow Airport after American Airlines flight security notified the FBI of the Middle Easterner’s suspicious behavior. Ahmed was cuffed and returned to the US after his luggage was found to contain such things as two car radios (the sort used to bomb Pan Am 103), silicon, solder, shielded and unshielded wire, a timing device, a photo album with pictures of weapons and missile, and a blue jogging suit similar to that seen worn by an Arab suspect in fr ont of the M urrah building on the morning of the blast. P erhaps prompted by ACLU’s media tirade, the FBI promptly released suspect Abraham Ahmed, and Pres- ident Clinton apologized to the Arab-American community. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols had continual contacts with known terrorist entities up to the day of the Murrah Building blast. Nichols was married to a Filipina woman, and took trips to Cebu City, Philippines ( without his wife) in late ‘92 and early ‘93 to meet with such friendly folk from the Abu Sayyaf terrorist org as Ramzi Yousef, Abdul Hakim Murad, Wali Khan Amin Shah and several others to discuss the bombing of the OKC building. Murad was arrested in 1995 for the initial World Trade Center bombing, and after vie wing the Oklahoma City Bombing on a N ew York jail television set, he r emarked to a guard that the “Liberation Army of the Philippines”—a group connected to Abu Sayyef, was responsible for the blast. Later, Abu Sayyaf leader Edwin Angeles corrected Murad for the record: “It was the Palestine Liberation Army and the Islamic Jihad which Murad was referring to. This army is associated with Hamas and is based in Lebanon.” After the Oklahoma City Bombing, Saudi intelligence told the FBI that Iraq had hired Pak- istanis to do the Murrah Building job.

Q: How did you first get in contact with Danny? Bill Hamilton: You should contact Terry Miller, president of Government Sales Consultants, which pr ovides advice to companies that sell computer-r elated products to the United States government. Q: He worked with Danny Casolaro at Computer Age Publications. Bill: That’s right. He was an old friend of Danny’s. In August of 1990, he talked to Danny and suggested that he look into inv estigating this thing. Again, that’s the month that Danny contacted us. He contacted us when we were on vacation at the beach in D elaware. He wanted to come do wn and see us at the beach, which was not convenient for us, so it didn ’t happen. But that began our con- versations with him. That lasted for a year until he died in August 1991. Q: Do y ou know anything at all about his r elationship with Computer Age at the time?

Bill: He talked about it. Q: Was he disappointed in the terms of the sales? Bill: I don’t know. That’s his private business. I worked with him mostly on the investigation of the J ustice Department. He was not a person who exhibited much interest in financial matters. I don ’t ever recall much of a conv ersation about terms of the sale of his newsletter. Q: It goes to the question of whether or not he was suicidal. S ome people have suggested the poor terms might have contributed to that. Bill: That’s ludicrous. That’s the most ludicrous thing I have ever heard. Nancy Hamilton: In the year of talking to this man, there was never any evi- dence that he was depr essed about anything, much less that. H e nev er mentioned that he was disappointed in that to my knowledge. He was excited about his investigation. Bill: It was much too serious a matter . He spent a y ear full-time looking into malfeasance by the government and the government has been unwilling to allow an independent investigation of his death. The malfeasance was in the J ustice Department and the Justice department insists that only it will be the judge of whatever happened down there and the local M artinsburg authorities who ar e not the kind of places you’d think about going if you were looking for sophisti- cated investigative capabil i ties. Nancy: If anything bothered him, it was what he was finding out about the way his government worked. He was a person who found it difficult to believ e that the government was capable of such skulldugger y. He didn’t want to believe it, just as we don’t want to believ e it. But when presented with fact, y ou have to accept it. And that is depressing. Q: When you first met, at what stage was the case? Bill: We had already had three weeks of trial in 1987, and this was 1990. We had already the thr ee hundred ninety-nine findings of fact that had alr eady been upheld by a separate opinion in the United States district court."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"165 A N I NTERVIEW WITH THE H AMILTONS Nancy: It was already under investigation by the House Judiciary committee.

Bill: There had been an extensive public record at that time. Q: So y ou were kind of like the story behind the story he was pursuing. Nancy: No, we were the story. Terry Miller told him that he should get on this story, that is was a v ery interesting story. He then called us to find out mor e about the story. He was into the Inslaw story. His investigation into Inslaw took him into other areas and at one point he expr essed frustration that he was get- ting all this information on these other things connecting, he thought, to I nslaw and was fr ustrated at getting the har d stuff he needed on I nslaw. Just a w eek before he died he expr essed to different people that he finally got the final evi- dence on Inslaw, pieces that directly affect Inslaw. Q: Was he sharing his research on the other topics with you as he went along? Bill: He was willing to. We didn’t really have time to entertain it. We’re trying to operate a business here and so we had limited interest in BCCI and the rest of it. Our meetings primarily consisted of telephone conversations with him every day. Nancy: And asking questions as he w ent about his investigation, because as he picked up information it would raise questions that he needed to ask us. We would answer his questions and he would pr oceed with his inv estigation. If something puzzled him about what he was told, ho w could this be, y ou know. That was the main thing. Q: At any point did he say he had a contract to get published? Bill: No. He was working on one and he was optimistic. He expressed optimism about getting one. In fact, he was planning a party in the final few weeks of his life. He was planning the guest list of a party to celebrate the book contract. Q: As time went along, you put him in contact with Michael Riconosciuto. Bill: Yes. But you have to understand how that works. We gave him lots of con- tacts. He’d take those contacts and get other contacts of his o wn."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"166 THE OCTOPUS Q: How did you know Riconosciuto? Bill: Riconosciuto called us a few months before Danny came on this case, in May in 1990, and spoke to us for two and a half hours, talking to us about the Wack- enhut/Cabazon joint venture, Earl Brian, Peter Videnieks and people like that. Q: How soon was it after that talk with Riconosciuto that y ou had him talk to Casolaro? Bill: August/September, 1990. We had one conv ersation with M ichael Riconosciuto in May, 1990, and we didn’t hear from him again until almost the end of that calendar year. Q: Did you find Riconosciuto believable at that time? Bill: A lot of what Riconosciuto said we found hard to believe but we attempted to find out whether or not it was tr ue. I would say that 75% of it turned out w e found corroborating evidence about it. So, most of what he told us about during that first telephone conversation seems to have been true. And we talked to peo- ple he wor ked with at the Wackenhut/Cabazon joint v enture who expr essed hostility toward him, disliked and disparaged him but who corroborated most of what he said in his affidavit to us. What they did not corroborate was the part of the affidavit that is most important to Inslaw’s case. And that is that the joint ven- ture, in addition to pr oducing fuel-air explosiv es and biological and chemical warfare weapons, night vision goggles and machine guns, was modifying the PROMIS software for Earl Brian. They didn’t deny it. They said they didn’t know about it. Over time they hav e admitted, these former colleagues who don ’t like Riconosciuto, that there was an NSA pr oject on the Wackenhut/Cabazon joint venture and that it ’s extremely highly classified, mor e highly classified than any other projects. And no one has ever explained what that project was. Q: So these people were hostile to Riconosciuto but they were actually saying the same thing.

I think the NSA project is very likely the PROMIS project. Q: Over time, Casolar o became mor e and mor e skeptical of Riconosciuto because, in addition to everything that could be verified about what he said, he said some pretty wild stuff after a while. Bill: I wouldn’t characterize it that way. He was disappointed when he went out to see him in jail after he was arr ested. He was not able to get a copy of what Riconosciuto claimed to have, which was a tape r ecording of Peter Videnieks threatening him. Whether that existed or not, I have no way of knowing. But a lot of the things that Riconosciuto talks about that are extreme sounding are things involving the United States intelligence agencies. And most of that stuff is probably true. US intelligence agencies use people like Riconosciuto. Nancy: That is very clear from what we have learned over all these years. They hire people like Riconosciuto . And they ar e the first to say that if y ou bring Riconosciuto in, look at him, you can’t trust anything he says. But in the Nor- iega trial, the government brought in just such witnesses. B ut we think what happens, from what we’ve learned, the government hires these people, they do things for the government that normally American citiz ens wouldn’t do, and then they do some things for themselv es that normal American citiz ens don’t do and the government can’t say anything about it because they’re their boys. Q: Let me bring up Robert Booth Nichols’ name. Would he fall into that category? Nancy: Of having worked for the government? Yeah. Bill: Oh, yeah. Q: Now you introduced Nichols to Casolaro as well, right? Bill: Yes. Q: Could you go over exactly how that happened? Bill: We contacted some reporters to see if they ever heard of Riconosciuto.

Did they ever encounter him? They had interviewed him and they also had interviewed at least one or two other people that had worked on that Wackenhut/Cabazon joint venture. They introduced us to Peter Zokosky, and we inter viewed him and he intr oduced us to Bob N ichols. We talked to Nichols. Nichols and Zokosky both have a low opinion of Riconosciuto but both verified everything he said in his affidavit except the PROMIS stuff. We talked a number of times with Nichols and met with him on a couple of occasions, once here in Washington, once in California when we were out there for some other reason. And he met with D anny here and Danny talked to him quite a bit. He’s more presentable than Riconosciuto in the sense of looking more middle-class, and bright, as is Riconosciuto. What he really is, I’m not sure. He obviously has had extensiv e dealings with intelligence agencies, both in our country and probably in other countries. Q: So what was his relationship with Casolaro like? Bill: He talked a lot to Casolaro. Q: Did it grow along the same lines as the one with Riconosciuto? Did he accept everything he said?

Q: Is it too far afield not to talk a little about PROMIS and when it first developed. Bill: That’s already documented. We can give you some documents on the history. Q: Let me ask about the current status of the case. Is there an appeal left? Nancy: No. We’re back in court Q: Back in court? Nancy: The US Congress, the Senate, passed a unanimous Congressional refer- ence sending the Inslaw case over to the government courts. Q: Are you familiar with the fact that Webster Hubbell reopened the investigation? Bill: He was appointed b y Janet Reno to look into the r esponses to the B ua report, which was commissioned by her predecessor but released by Reno. So we dealt with Hubbell. Q: Didn’t Bua essentially close the investigation? Bill: Bua was appointed b y William Barr. In December of 1992, B arr recused himself of Inslaw because he was going back to his old law firm, which in the meantime had been representing Earl W. Brian in the Inslaw case. Even that was a little too much for a person like B arr, I guess. It didn’t look too nice. So Bua supposedly didn’t submit the report to Barr and then there was an interregnum between Barr’s departure and the beginning of the Democrat confirmed as Attor- ney General. During that interregnum there was a Republican holdover of the Attorney General. Q: Stuart Gerson. Bill: Why Bua didn’t submit it to Gerson is hard to explain.

We did a very detailed rebuttal of the Bua report a month after Reno released it and submitted it for rebuttal a month after Reno and Hubbell went to the House and Senate Judiciary committees. Then we met with Hubbell a few months later, in the fall of 1993, October of ‘93. That was the first and only time. The rebuttal is striking in its disrobing of the Bua report. The Bua report is flimsy, on its own terms unconvincing, it contradicts the fully litigated findings of fact of two sitting federal judges and it contradicts the inv estigative findings of a major committee of congr ess. Just flatly contradicts all of that. S o if you accept the Bua report, you have to accept simultaneously that the legal system is a joke. That not only can y ou have one set of litigated findings that ar e mean- ingless, but that you can have two sets of litigating findings that are meaningless, and a congressional investigation. While that’s possible in theory, it’s unlikely in practice. It’s also alarming, and if the press had any brains they should have said, “Wait just a minute!” Because if that’s true, we’ve got real problems. Nancy: The judges, of course, had sworn testimony fr om both sides, in a court of law, whereas Bua talked only a few minutes to me and Bill. That was the end of discussion. And no key Justice people were put under oath. Q: Was there not an offer made befor e the Bua report was issued to make a settlement? Bill: Bua will lie about it. You ought to ask him. B ua has denied that he made an offer, and he’s a distinguished former judge who pr obably wouldn’t lie. But Bua called Elliot Richardson and said to him, “Have you given any thought to a global settlement figure?” He did this in November or December of 1992 when Barr was still Attorney General. And Elliot Richardson explained to him that it’s hard to come up with a global settlement when y our own Justice Department"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"171 A N I NTERVIEW WITH THE H AMILTONS won’t candidly discuss the scope of what they hav e done. What is the scope of the damages? What is the relative magnitude of the damages? How many copies have you made of this software and what else have you done with it? Q: What was the dollar figure at that point? Bill: He thought that Attorney General Barr would approve a settlement of $25 million quickly if he would make such a pr oposal. He also told thr ee different reporters that he was considering r ecommending this in his r eport. The reporters were being used as trial balloons for us. In the same time frame, the fall of 1992, he was considering recommending that the Department of Justice pay Inslaw twenty five to fifty million dollars. And when he mentioned $25 million to Elliot Richard- son, one of the reporters, an investigative producer at CNN, said he means fifty. Q: So the whole impetus had to come from you. These were just suggestions that Bua was dropping. Bill: Elliot said that he was a little surprised that the criminal inv estigator is the civil negotiator. Nancy: We had given the evidence of broad malfeasance in the department and to have the response be, “How much do you want?” we felt was inappropriate for someone who was supposedly an investigator. Bill: It’s a farce. Q: Now Bua denies it all. Bill: He denied it to the pr ess and then E lliot offered to make av ailable these detailed contemporaneous notes of the v arious conversations and then he shut up. He didn’t talk about it anymore. Q: All that happened before the report was issued. Bill: That’s right. Q: So the report comes out and that supposedly settles it or was there an appeal after that? Bill: But it can’t settle it. It’s the Justice Department exonerating itself."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"172 THE OCTOPUS Q: What I’m trying to determine is where Hubbell tried to focus the investiga- tion, the appeal. Nancy: Appeal is the wrong word. This isn’t a court. Bua is not a judge. He’s a former judge hired by Barr using Justice department lawyers. Bill: Paid by Barr and reporting to Barr. That’s not a judge. Nancy: But it gives the coloration of a judicial finding. Bill: But he is a lawy er for Attorney General Barr. He cannot put something down on paper, he can’t do anything without his client Bill Barr. So what hap- pens is that that report is released by Reno in March and she appoints another person with the honorific title of judge. J udge Hubbell will now review any problems that people have with the Bua report. So we submitted our rebuttal and we met with them in October. And we acknowledged that there were two areas of problems with the Bua report. Not problems, but two pieces of unfin- ished business... Nancy: Two that r equired further investigation, because our r ebuttal made it pretty clear that this report was ludicrous on its face. Bill: And the two that he had acknowledged Bua hadn’t done a good enough job on were Danny Casolaro and whether the FBI was using our softwar e. So that’s what he initially acknowledged that he would look into. Q: Did he make a public statement of some sort? Bill: Well, he told us. Nancy: We r eally don’t want to go into what Hubbell said to us. We don’t think that we should. Q: The only reason I ask is that when they originally announced that they w ere going to reopen the original investigation, very few newspapers reported on it all. Nancy: Actually, reopening the inv estigation they didn ’t. They said B ua had done a good job. And so the only two areas that they would look further at were the ones we mentioned. On those they ended up siding with the Bua report also."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"173 A N I NTERVIEW WITH THE H AMILTONS Q: That Danny Casolaro committed suicide and that there was no malfeasance on the part of the FBI. Nancy: That the FBI software was not our software. Bill: You have to understand that this is like ... the former J ustice department lawyer who is in the front page of the New York Times and Washington Post today, Michael Abell, who has just been indicted for obstruction of justice with regard to the Bolivian Cali cartel. It is no different than for that person to say “I was in the Justice Department for seventeen years and I am issuing a r eport that finds me innocent.” Thank you, Mr. Abell. the Justice Department is the defendant. The institution is the defendant. It is the same institution that is sitting in judge- ment on itself and contradicting the results of every single independent review of its conduct. In other words, the bankr uptcy court, the US D istrict court, the House Judiciary committee, the Senate permanent investigations subcommittee, all of those independent tribunals ar e wrong and w e’re right about ourselv es. We’re blameless. So when you look at it that way... Q: But when you’re talking about Hubbell’s investigation... Bill: Hubbell is the Justice Department. Q: But it’s a whole different set of personnel than these other investigations. Nancy: Not really. Same career people. Q: One of the most alarming things about the whole business is H ubbell’s con- nection to Park-On-Meter and how Riconosciuto makes claims to be connected to Park-on-Meter. It’s all such an inbred thing. The people that were involved in all this in the first place do seem to be R epublicans—Earl Brian, Ed Meese and Reagan—and her e, a ne w administration, D emocrats, differ ent people and they’re all connected to it too. Bill: Well, if you follow Mena, which I’m sure you have, they seem to hav e been a kind of partner to Reagan/Bush administration on some of these covert things. Q: Did you see a lot of evidence for that connected to y our problems? Did you know about Park-On-Meter?"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"174 THE OCTOPUS Nancy: We r ead about it. B ut you look at the H ubbell-Reno investigation, or handling of Inslaw, I should say, because it was no r eal investigation, when the Congress said let’s get it to an independent tribunal. Last fall, Charlie Rose intro- duced, last summer , actually , that they would send the case to another independent tribunal and while it was in committee, R eno rushed a letter to committee members to vote against it and summarizing their report which they hadn’t even copied and made available. So intense was their effort to keep us out of court again. You have to ask, why are they so intent, if there is nothing to it? What do they to lose by having people looking at this case again? Bill: There were two people we knew in the lobbying effort in the House of Rep- resentatives last fall to tr y to keep us fr om getting back to cour t, Edwin Meese and Janet Reno, personally. Nancy: And so when it was re-introduced this spring by Senator Hatch it passed by the unanimous consent of the Senate. Q: Is it their point that the softwar e that is being used no w by Interpol, the Mossad, the FBI and so on, is not PROMIS? Bill: They do not acknowledge any of this. Q: I know one of the failures of the Bua report is that it didn’t do a code com- parison. I take it that Hubbell investigation didn’t do one either. Bill: No. Nancy: We haven’t been anywhere near the FBI’s software. Bill: The US Attorney’s stuff, that’s what the court case was about. That’s all we knew about at the time. The US Attorney’s office have never paid us for the soft- ware. So we used the subpoena power and got the software and compared it with our privately financed enhancements, the r ecords of the department, who paid for it and all that, and w e proved at the time of the trial w e did not know that the software had been disseminated outside the US A ttorney’s office. We didn’t find that out until subsequent years. First of all, Bua hired a professor at George- town University, the computer science department, the head of the department. She’s the one who declined to compar e the code and made a fatuous statement that PROMIS tracks judicial pr oceedings and the FBI system tracks inv estiga- tions, so they couldn’t possible be the same softwar e. Just a fatuous comment."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"175 A N I NTERVIEW WITH THE H AMILTONS Our software tracks investigations at the state and local level, all over the United States. That’s a stupid thing to say. Then Hubbell hired a new professor from MIT, and they offered to have us attend his examination of the code. B ut they made it clear to us that w e would not be permitted to look at the code he would look at, the FBI code. We told them that we were not interested in pretending to support another phony exam- ination. If there was going to be any cr edibility, the people who dev eloped the PROMIS code have to be able to see that code. What are you afraid of in letting us look at it? We don’t mind that you have your own experts there, but we want to see it. We don’t, frankly, trust the government and we wouldn’t believe any- thing the Justice Department said under any administration. Q: Did they respond to that at all? Bill: They said no, you can’t look at it. So then they had their MIT professor say it’s not the same code and who knows what he looked at? Q: Are you familiar with this company in Little R ock, Arkansas called System- atics, Inc.? Bill: Yes. Q: The story there is that somehow PROMIS has been applied to the banking industry. Do you know anything about it? Bill: We are fairly confidant that it was installed in the World Bank in 1983 and the International Monetary Fund. Danny Casolaro introduced us to two former computer employees at the World Bank who told us all of this. There have been published articles in the international banking r egulator newsletter that inde- pendently verified that. So if you put it in the World Bank and the International Monetary fund, it’s not likely that you’ve just put it there. Any effort to take soft- ware as flexible as it is, you have to really think through how you’re going to use it in a different application area and think about ho w you’re going to use it in banking and then just put it in one bank, that doesn ’t make sense. So the hard- est evidence w e have has to do with the World Bank and the I nternational Monetary Fund, but logic supports the idea that it is much more widely used. Q: You hear a lot of different things about the way PROMIS has been applied. There has even been a report that one of its earliest uses was to extrapolate Sovi- et sub launches out of the Arctic ice."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"176 THE OCTOPUS Bill: I haven’t heard that one. Q: You haven’t? Bill: There was supposedly an application by the military, that it was out on loan from the Justice Department. Nancy: The software wouldn’t launch things. Q: No, the story is that it had the ability to track... Nancy: It does have that ability. It can track anything. Q: They apparently had a very difficult time prior to using it, using whatev er it was they used, tracking submarines thr ough the Arctic ice. The Soviets would just go in there and they would lose track of them. Bill: We are fairly confidant that they use PR OMIS on the nuclear submarines to track other submarines. They call it PROMIS. Nancy: It doesn’t do the tracking. You give it the information to make it keep track of your information. It has no capacity to do the tracking itself. Bill: It’s just keeping track of the tracking transactions, wher e you last saw it, when, the last sighting. Q: It doesn’t extrapolate from there? That’s the rumor, why PROMIS is so attrac- tive to people, is that it has great predictive capabilities. Bill: Not really. Nancy: It depends on how you use the information y ou have. It organizes it for you and it’s valuable that way, but it’s up to the human being using it to go from there. Q: Now you have two brothers in St. Louis, right? And one of them was the sec- retary to the police board in the early 1970s? Bill: I don’t know what years anymore. He was secretary of the police board once."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"177 A N I NTERVIEW WITH THE H AMILTONS Q: He was there at a time when they implemented something called REGIS. I s that connected to PROMIS? Bill: No. He created REGIS. Q: A different kind of software altogether? Nancy: REGIS isn’t software. It’s an organization. Bill: Regional Justice Information System. Q: So y ou say you have never seen what the FBI uses. Have you seen a demon- stration of the software of any of the groups that supposedly have PROMIS, like the Mossad or the Mounties, or whatever? Bill: Oh no, no, they won’t let us. Nancy: We’d love to see a demonstration. Although the demonstration isn’t... Bill: You have to look at the source code. Nancy: That’s what was wrong with the professor at Georgetown, saying, “I just looked at the screen and I don’t need to see any more.” That’s ludicrous. Q: So do you still own PROMIS? Or does the Justice Department? Bill: Why would the Justice Department own it? Because they stole it? You think that’s how it works? If I steal your glasses, they’re mine? Q: Of course, you’re right. Nancy: If you make a copy of the Lotus softwar e, you don’t own the software. You just have a copy. Q: So y ou still make PROMIS available to your clients? Bill: We sell it. Nancy: We don’t give it away. And the software is always changing. That’s what we’re about here, is developing new software, adding to it, creating new enhance- ments to it, keeping up with the times."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"178 THE OCTOPUS Q: Does it have a version, like PROMIS 1.7? Nancy: You can call it that, but it doesn’t matter. Q: Who are your clients? If the Justice Department supplying everyone with it... Bill: We don’t sell it to intelligence agencies. And w e don’t sell to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. We sell to state and local courts, prosecutors. We sell to big corporations. But we don’t sell to US and foreign intelligence agencies. Nancy: You may be thinking of a smaller pr ogram. It’s five hundred thousand lines of code approximately. So it’s not something you easily copy and dissemi- nate. It’s a complicated, sophisticated system. Q: Are you familiar at all with Casolaro’s investigation of Hughes Aircraft? That’s one of the theories, that in investigating Inslaw and the Octopus, he just kind of brushed up against manufacturing fraud involving Hughes Aircraft and that led to his death. Nancy: What he brushed up against was someone who was interested in Hughes Aircraft, who used to work for it, Bill Turner. As you may know, when a reporter works on a stor y, or even for Inslaw having a stor y, everybody and his br other who has some kind of pr oblem think maybe they can handle my pr oblem. So Bill Turner went to Danny hoping to get Danny interested in Bill Turner’s prob- lem at Hughes Aircraft. And that’s how he got into that. Q: You have no reason to believe there was more to it than that? Nancy: What do you mean by more than that? That’s how he came into Hugh- es Aircraft. He met with Turner the night before he died and Turner had given him, according to Turner, a stack of documents. Bill: I don’t think there is anything particular to Hughes Aircraft. That may all be true or not tr ue, I don’t know. But in setting out to inv estigate the Justice Department’s theft of PROMIS, this is the point Nancy made, he ended up pick- ing up stones and finding stuff about BCCI, about the October Surprise, sales of high technology to Iraq, to Saddam Hussein, before the war, and about Iran-con- tra, and I think that reason he did is that some of the same people ar e involved with all of these things, making money. They don’t say, “Let’s do something bad. Let’s make some money .” That’s what D anny told me this whole thing was about, people set out to make money by selling drugs, weapons, stolen software."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"179 A N I NTERVIEW WITH THE H AMILTONS Nancy: I think that when he died, a lot of the headlines and ne ws shows said, “Reporter Investigating BCCI” because BCCI had just br oken on to the scene. That meant something to someone. B ut what we’ve told you is actually what happened. Q: So y ou are convinced that he was murdered. Bill: We think that there has never been an honest inv estigation of what hap- pened to him and that ther e are all of the indications that w e are aware of strongly suggesting that he was murdered. But we’re not saying that OK, there— accept that he was mur dered. We’re saying, get out of the way and let an independent investigation, by an independent counsel... Nancy: Who doesn’t have any interest... Bill: ... who doesn’t have anything to hide, do an investigation. Let it take place. Nancy: There’s too many questions about his death for any reasonable person to say, yes, this was suicide. And there’s a lot of misinformation out there that worry about his finances. We didn’t see it. He was not a guy who gav e a damn about his finances. We know other things, that his family had money , offered him money. Bill: Friends offered him money. He didn’t kill himself for that. Q: So do you believe it was because of his investigation of the Inslaw case, or do you think that with all these things, it could hav e been anything, therefore, let’s find out. Nancy: We can’t know. If we knew, we wouldn’t be wondering any longer. But he certainly was into a lot of things during his inv estigation. BCCI is a major , major scandal. Bill: And it looks increasingly convincing to us that the PROMIS software was installed throughout the BCCI empire to keep track of wire transfers of money and letters of credit so that NSA could monitor. I believe that the PROMIS soft- ware was used in all kinds of things. There are two things knitting all this together. One is that the same people ar e making money in all these differ ent kinds of businesses. And the other thing that is in many instances PR OMIS was the useful way of keeping track of everything that was happening."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"ARMS INDUSTRY: RESEARCH AND PROCUREMENT BULL, GERALD PR/AI/BG-02 90 FAME MA GAZINE AR TICLE ABOUT MURDERED BALLISTICS GENIUS GERALD B ULL WHO ATTEMPTED TO BUILD A SUPER GUN FOR IRAQ.

Its details are examined in the book Maury Island UFO (IllumiNet Press), a prequel to The Octopus , for which the following interview was conducted. Q: Do y ou remember Fred Crisman, or Jon Gold? What can you tell me about him? Are you familiar with his memoir, Mur der In The City ? A: Mur der In the City really wasn’t a memoir for Fred Crisman. Mur der In The City was about a political episode in Tacoma that Fred Crisman played a role in. Q: But it is written by him, right? A: He’s the author of it, yes. He had a talk show there and there was a big, heat- ed political battle in Tacoma. My father was on one side and D ave Rollins was on the other side. These are two guys that grew up together and were rivals. Q: Who is the other one? A: Dave R ollins. Q: This is what’s mapped out in Jon Gold’s, AKA Fred Crisman’s, book. A: Yes. I had known Fred ever since I was a small boy, probably about eight years old. And I trav eled all over the world with him. I pr obably made twenty trips abroad with him."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Q: One of the gr ey areas with C risman for me is what r ole he play ed in the Maury Island UFO thing. A: The Maury Island UFO was an event that he created. Q: He created it out of whole cloth? A: I have about almost 1600 pages of handwritten notes by Fred Crisman. Q: Oh y eah? A: Uh huh. Q: An unpublished manuscript? A: Yes. Q: That’s a new one. A: Fred was working with Mary C. Johnson at Boeing. Q: What is the name again? A: Mary C. Johnson. Mary Catrina Johnson. In security at Boeing. And they had done some tests or something and... Q: This is late 1940s? A: Yes. And there was a public outcr y over it. Too much public scr utiny into what was going on. So Fred came up with this cover story. Q: The cover story was intended to cover up what was happening at Boeing? A: Yes. Q: Which was what? A: Some sort of test. Q: Test? 221 A N I NTERVIEW WITH M ICHAEL R ICONOSCIUTO"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"222 THE OCTOPUS A: Some sort of aircraft. Q: Aircraft tests at Boeing? A: Yes. And what happened was that something had gone wrong and some debris had fallen over Maury Island and they had to get the stuff back. Fred did, in fact, get the stuff back. Q: That is my understanding just from reading the books on the thing, that he held on to it. There is no indication that he turned o ver everything he had to those two investigators that died. A: Now the two investigators that died were basically in on it. They were out to investigate the security screw ups at Boeing and the procedures for running their test program. Q: I see. So you’re saying this was a test on an advanced but conventional aircraft that went awry? This is what fell on H arold Dahl and Crisman wasn’t actually part of the actual incident, right? He comes in later? A: He comes in later, yes. But the problem is that a dog that belonged to Harold Dahl died of radiation sickness. Q: Oh, really? A: Yes. And there was something... Q: Dahl’s son was also injured. A: Yes. There was something radioactiv e on board. It was a big scandal, a big problem. When these Air Force guys died, Fred was absolutely bent out of shape, and he related that to me. Q: All of this is in this manuscript that you talked about, right? A: Yes, and personally, he told me what went on behind it. Q: Do y ou know anything more about that slag that fell on them? Do you know what it was?"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"223 A N I NTERVIEW WITH M ICHAEL R ICONOSCIUTO A: No. Other than there was a reactor of some sort on board this aircraft. It was an advanced radar platform of some sort. And Mary C. Johnson has cor- roborated the story many years later, like in 1982 and 1983 and ‘84. I spent a lot of time with Mary C. Johnson. Q: Does she still work for Boeing? A: Oh, no. She’s deceased. She was up there in years. Q: When you say she corroborated it, you mean corroborated it to you. She didn’t talk to the press or anything like that? A: Oh no. She wouldn’t have any reason to. She was a career type person and she was a kind of mentor to our little group up in Seattle. She and Arlen Bell’s widow were on the board of directors of one of our companies. I had bought her home out in Lake Bay, Washington. She used to come out and visit us all of the time. I spent a lot of time with her. Q: OK. So, at the time, Crisman was working for what, military intelligence or something of that sort? A: He was a point man on cleaning up a mess. And it was just a fluke that those Air Force guys died in that plane crash. Q: So as far y ou understand K enneth Arnold’s role, for instance, and Ray Palmer’s role in this, is that C risman helps to inject into the media that this was some kind of UFO event and Palmer kind of glommed onto that. He has no direct role in the cover-up, right? A: Crisman was a master at emotional contagion. An absolute master at it. I n the OSS, over occupied territories in E urope where they were doing nuclear research, Crisman had a deal with some guys out in the Army Air Corps, and they were dropping these do-nothing, sophisticated gizwidgets that w ere in bombs. The Germans couldn’t ignore them. They looked like high-tech sur- veillance devices, you know? Q: How large were they? A: Oh, probably twelve to fifteen pounds each. And there were would be sever- al of them in a good-siz e aerial bomb. The German High Command’s attitude"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"224 THE OCTOPUS was that they w ere sophisticated somethings and they w ere being dr opped in their most sensitive areas. The German scientists kept telling them, “No, no, no, nothing.” And it was one of the... the stor y’s been documented in a book but I can’t think of the name of it. It was a great brain drain on their nuclear program. Fred gave me some astronomical figure on how many man years took away from the scientific effort of their nuclear program at a critical time. And Fred got these scientists from Princeton and the U niversity of Chicago and he got some r eal eggheads to come up with this scam that he ran on them. F red was a master of this kind of thing. Q: We’re still talking about late ‘40s here, right? A: Right. In Indochina, Fred had a history of doing that stuff. Q: These widgets that you’re talking about were just totally fake little things that they attached to bomb drops? A: Well, they actually did have some substance. Enough so that they couldn’t be ignored. Q: I have a news article from July 11, 1947 talking about G uy Banister, then working as a SAC (Special Agent in Charge) for the FBI in Butte recovering what is reported as a flying disc that’s thirty and a half inches in diameter. I wonder if there’s a connection there. A: In post World War II they had a dev elopment phase with these radioactiv e discs to cloud the film of aerial sur veillance platforms. They used differ ent schemes and they had a lot of tr ouble recovering them. They had a lot of screw ups. Q: So these things had a function then? A: Yes. And extreme raditaion will destroy most films, especially in sensitive aer- ial photography. Now Fred was very, very close to George Wackenhut. Q: I don’t know if that’s been established before. A: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I’ve known of it since 1963, maybe the first time I ever saw them together. Do you know who Chuck Emmert is?"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"225 A N I NTERVIEW WITH M ICHAEL R ICONOSCIUTO Q: I haven’t heard the name yet, no. A: OK. His mother was a wealthy Florida socialite who financed George Wack- enhut when he originally stared Wackenhut. Q: Is that a name that I could do a Lexis Nexus search on? A: I doubt it, He managed to stay pr etty buried, although his mother—I can ’t remember her first name—but she was big in southern Florida, with anybody in social circles down there would be able to steer you to her. Q: Did Crisman ever talk about the Kennedy assassination with you? A: Yeah, he did. Q: What about this idea that some people hav e that he was one of the thr ee hoboes in the railroad yard behind Dealy plaza? A: Well, I don’t know about that. He gave me his version of what happened. Q: He did give it to you. A: Oh, yeah. A mutual friend of ours was a former Treasury Department agent who, during the Warren Commission, was one of the investigators for the com- mittee Q: Do y ou want to name him? A: His name is Bob. I don’t know where he is now. I lost track of him about ten years ago. Q: Do y ou not want to give a last name? A: I really don’t. I think he just wants ... he was very, very ill at the time I last saw him. He was working for us. I was with both he and Fred when Fred found out that he had turned over information to Garrison. Q: Fred had turned over information? A: No, this guy Bob."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"226 THE OCTOPUS Q: Bob turned information over to Garrison? A: Right. What I found astounding was that when Bob was wor king on the Warren Commission, what the hell was that? Why didn’t he turn that over the Warren Commission? And one day I asked him and he said he did. They knew everything. Q: Now when y ou say that stuff , what exactly ar e you referring to her e? Crisman’s story of his role in the assassination? A: Right. What had gone on. Q: Is it possible for you to summarize that briefly, or is that in the 1600 page manuscript you were talking about? A: Here’s something that happens: everybody says, “Hey, how come you know about everything?” Every conspiracy that’s ever gone down the pike. It kinda seems that. If something happens, hey, Riconoscuito’s got something to say about it. Well, I can’t help it that I was raised around Fred Crisman. I mean, I can’t help that cosmic act of fate in my life. Q: I understand what you’re saying, and things r eally are connected. People have trouble accepting that fact at all, that there connections to be made. A: I get treated like I’m delusional. So I find that around certain things, the less I say, the better off I am because most people ar e not going to take the time to go check it out. Very few people even know who Fred Crisman is or what kind of a player he was. I tried to tell some r eporters from the Village Voice , “I kne w Fred Crisman.” They refused to believ e me. “ There was a thing written about it.” “ Yeah, yeah, sure, show us the book...” H ow can show a book when I’m in a jail cell... I have a friend who was a SAC the day that happened. Q: The day of the Kennedy assassination? A: Yeah. I’ll tell you what, I got it more than just from Fred. Q: I’m still curious about exactly what F red Crisman told you. Is it possible to summarize it?"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"227 A N I NTERVIEW WITH M ICHAEL R ICONOSCIUTO A: I really don’t want to go into that. Calls ar e taped here. Fred left a momen- tous... Q: What about that manuscript? A: He had it squirreled away and as far as I know, it’s safe. The party that has it is very reliable. At this point in time, it is irrelevant to me getting out of prison. The things that concern me are the things connected to this case. I was just fas- cinated by the fact that Crisman came up. It seems that Contact magazine found out that Crisman knew my father and then they found out that he actually knew me and they just went wild. They made a big deal out of it. Q: Which magazine? A: Contact . And UFO Magazine ... This Colin Brown was hanging ar ound Ted Gunderson... Q: Brown was the guy that worked for Technical Consultant magazine. A: I think so. Q: And you did an interview with him. A: Not really. I talked to him on the phone a couple of times and I wanted some help on my case. I didn ’t want to talk about w eirdness. I was r esearch director at Wackenhut and at the time I was ther e we took over Area 51 in Nev ada and we also had the N evada test site and he was pumping me for all kinds of stuff out of ther e and I just told him, “H ey, I don’t want to get into that. I’ve got enough pr oblems right no w. I’m facing life in prison on dr ug charges and it all stems from the Cabazon/Wackenhut joint venture and I just don’t need to get into this stuff.” Q: Did Danny Casolaro pump you for information about that? A: Yeah. Danny found out a lot of stuff. In fact, Danny had a lot of information on that and I’m surprised you didn’t get it. Q: The papers that were collected after he died originally went to ABC’s Night- line . By the time they got to me, they had been picked o ver pretty cleanly. But there are notes in there about Area 51. Some, not a lot."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"228 THE OCTOPUS A: That whole subject matter with Wackenhut is one that I would want to steer clear of. Again, there’s an aura of being delusional and I’ m concerned about credibility here and the fact of the matter is that Wackenhut is is the only com- pany that has ev er had the security contract for any of these places, ev en though they are supposed to go up for open bid. And this is the way it ’s been since the early ‘50s, when these various agencies in these various places were set up. Wackenhut was steered right in and I happened to hav e been born into a situation by virtue of my father’s contacts, my maternal grandfather’s contacts. I was just around. Q: You appear in that book, Mur der of a City , as wiring your father’s office. A: Well, no. We ran a cable TV company. Q: I’m currently trying to track this article that has a photograph of y ou and it talks about a child prodigy, a child genius working with various kinds of sound equipment. It’s really this glowing piece about what a genius y ou are working with sound. A: I was doing commer cial sound as a teenager . I made a lot of money as a teenager doing commercial sound. I was involved with various rock’n’roll groups during what is known as the instrumental sound era. Most of these groups hit the char ts. The Viceroys. The Ventures. The Wailers. Paul R evere and the Raiders. I don’t know if you’re familiar with any of those groups. Q: Sur e. Who wouldn’t be familiar with the Ventures? The guitar gr oups are what you’re talking about. A: Yeah, the instrumental sound. Q: And you worked with them? A: You bet. Q: Like producing albums and so forth? A: Kearney Barton and myself. Q: You did the sound at the gigs or you produced albums?"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"229 A N I NTERVIEW WITH M ICHAEL R ICONOSCIUTO A: The whole bit. Back then we had Ampex three track recorders. That was the state of the art at that time. I was doing special effects and things like that. I was pretty involved and I made a lot of money. Q: So as a teenager you were working as an entrepeneur ? A: Right. I was building sound systems, building these new huge 300 watt tube amplifiers, transmitting tubes, sound reinforcement systems, you know, PA sys- tems. Q: And this was at the time that your father was involved with Crisman? A: He knew Crisman ever since he was in high school. Q: He has his own business going on. A: Adver tising, public relations. My father worked on Kennedy’s campaign staff when he got elected and he got Governor [Al Rosalini] elected up in the state of Washington. He was the point man for former S enator Warren Magnuson, Scoop Jackson. He was one of Scoop ’s top advisers.
