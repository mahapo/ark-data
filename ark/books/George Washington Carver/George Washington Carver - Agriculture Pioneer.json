After the Civil War, he became an important scientist. He was the first black man to receive a graduate degree in agriculture. Carver was a skilled botanist . He became famous for his work with peanuts and other plants. He used them to make new products. Carver was also a great teacher. He taught both students and farmers crop- rotation methods. That meant they would change the crops they planted each season. It let the soil rest between plantings to keep it healthy. Carver was a great scientist, but he was humble, too. He was offered a lot of money for his discoveries. But he never accepted it. He believed the plants and their secrets belonged to everyone. \t George Washington Carver in 1915 George Washington Carver \t peanut plant Many Uses for the Peanut Carver may be best known for the detailed and amazing work he did with the peanut.

He was more dead than alive. His mother was not found. Carver and his brother had no living relatives. So the Carvers raised them as their own children. Carver was sickly and weak. He could not do work in the fields. So, he helped with the laundry, cooked, and learned to sew. Born a Slave Carver had a brother named Jim. Their mother’s name was Mary, and she was a slave. She was bought by a German couple named Moses and Susan Carver. They did not approve of slavery, but still they used slaves as workers for their farm. The Carvers treated Mary and her children well, though. Slave raiders kidnapped Carver and his mother when he was just an infant. John Bentley, the Carvers’ neighbor, took the job of finding them. Moses offered a reward for their safe return. He would give 40 acres of prime timberland and one of his racehorses. \t Slaves were used to harvest cotton and other crops. What Is an Abolitionist ? For many years, slavery was legal in North America. Abolitionists were people who believed that slavery was wrong and should be illegal. The word comes from abolish , which means to destroy. That’s what they wanted to do to slavery. A Big Reward The reward Moses Carver offered for finding his slaves was worth $1,100. That was a lot of money for the time! \t Frederick Douglass was a well-known abolitionist. \u0018 \u0018 \u0018 \u0018"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Carver was curious about nature. He collected specimens of many plants and insects. He experimented with the soil. He wanted to find out what the best soil was for each kind of plant. He saw that plants have an internal plumbing system. It brings water and nutrients from the soil to the leaves. Early Education The Carvers tried to send the boys to a local school. They were turned away because they were black. The schools in Missouri were segregated. Carver finally started school when he was about 11 years old. He walked eight miles to get there. He arrived too late in the night to find a room with a family. So he slept in a barn. Carver moved in with the childless black couple who owned the barn. He helped them by doing household chores. No Resources Carver’s childhood house had few books in it. In fact, when he was growing up, there were only two books in the house. They were Webster’s Elementary Spelling Book and the Bible. The Plant Doctor Young Carver often helped his neighbors with their sick plants. He would nurse them back to health. As a child, he was a natural at botany. So he was nicknamed “The Plant Doctor.” Young Herbalist The lady that Carver lived with taught him which herbs and plants could be used as medicine. She was a midwife . That is a person who delivers babies. She also took care of sick people. \t Segregation meant that white people and black people were kept separate, as on this bus.

She was the oldest of five daughters. Her family moved to Cuba. There she was raised on a sugar plantation. She was able to go to school both in Cuba and in New York. She did especially well in her science classes. Britton studied botany. She graduated from a college called the Normal School. Afterward, she worked there. She was very interested in moss. Although she did not have an advanced degree, she became a leading expert in the field. After she married a college professor, Britton was put in charge of the moss collection at Columbia University. She also worked to preserve wildflowers. She helped start the New York Botanical Garden. Her husband became the garden’s first director. Britton published more than 340 scientific papers. She has had many moss species named after her. Britton died in the Bronx, New York, when she was 74 years old. Kansas Carver followed some neighbors who were moving to Fort Scott, Kansas. He did whatever he could do to earn money. When he had money, he went to school. When he ran out of money, he worked. He faced a great deal of racial prejudice at this time. Carver lived with the Seymours in Olathe, Kansas. Lucy Seymour taught him how to iron ruffles and pleats on fancy clothes. He moved with them to Minneapolis, Kansas. He finished high school there. In 1890, Carver became a high school graduate. He applied to Highland College in Kansas. When he arrived to register for school, he was rudely turned away. The college did not accept black students. This was a bad blow for Carver. \t Fashion of the time was complex with many details. Ironing such garments, as Carver did, would have been complicated work. W Washington received many letters. In his town, there was also another George Carver. The other man often received Carver’s letters. Carver added the W for Washington as his middle initial, even though he really didn’t have a middle name. People often asked him what it stood for. He would answer, “Washington.” 10 11"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Art or Science? Carver became friends with a white couple. They lived in Winterset, Iowa. They encouraged Carver to apply to college again. They saw his potential. They believed in him. Carver enrolled at Simpson College in 1890. He was going to study art. After paying his tuition, Carver only had 10 cents left. For one month, he lived on beef suet and corn meal. Carver’s teachers didn’t want him to study art. They didn’t think he could earn a living with it. The art director saw that Carver had a natural way with plants. She suggested he study botany . Botany is the science of plants. Carver stayed at the college for less than a year. Then he transferred to Iowa State. He went there to study agricultural science. Katherine Esau (1898–1997) Katherine Esau was a pioneering plant anatomist . Anatomists study how living things are put together. She was possibly the greatest plant anatomist of the 20th century. She wrote the books \t Plant \t Anatomy\t and \t Anatom y\tof \tSeed\t Plants . They are still considered the most important books on plants ever written. Esau was born in the Ukraine. She was born to a Mennonite family. Her father was the mayor of their city. Esau learned to read and write before even starting school. She studied Russian, German, and English. She took piano lessons and went to a gardening school. After her first year of college, she had to move to Germany because of the Russian Revolution. When Esau was in her 20s, her family moved to America. They went to a town in California. It was near Fresno. Esau first found work as a housekeeper. Then she found work in a seed company. From there, she moved to Davis, California, where she worked and continued her studies. Later, she settled in Santa Barbara, California. She bought her first computer at the age of 86. She had to take lessons to use it! When Esau was 91 years old, she received the National Medal of Science. Esau died at the age of 99. Winner! Carver entered a drawing contest at the Chicago World’s Fair in 1892. He won an honorable mention for his painting of a yucca plant. \t Suet is made from beef fat.

He was the first black person to attend the college. He was not allowed to live in the dormitories. They were only for the white students. He slept in an old office. He had to eat in the basement of the dining hall. That’s where all the employees ate. Carver had many struggles. Despite it all, he excelled in school. He learned about how pollen works in plants. He also learned about crossbreeding plants. This could create new and better breeds of plants and flowers. Carver also learned how to apply science to farming. He studied soil composition. He learned how the nutrients in the soil affect how plants grow. \t cornflower pollen David Grandison Fairchild (1869–1954) David Grandison Fairchild was born in Michigan. He studied agriculture. After his studies, he joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He worked there as a botanist and a plant explorer. Fairchild searched the world for plants that could be brought to America. He introduced more than 80,000 species and varieties of plants to the United States. He brought cherry trees from Japan. He also introduced pistachios, nectarines, bamboo, and avocados. Fairchild married the daughter of Alexander Graham Bell. They had two children. When he retired, his family settled in Coconut Grove, Florida. He worked to establish a national park in the Everglades. \t Farmers must understand soil and its nutrients in order to grow healthy crops. Living Things on His Jacket Carver always wore a wrinkled, shabby suit. But he also always had a flower or a piece of evergreen on his jacket lapel. 1\u0018 1\u0018 1\u0018"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Professional Life Carver graduated from Iowa State. Then he earned his master’s degree. He had many job offers. Booker T. Washington invited Carver to Alabama. Washington was a former slave. He was also the driving force in creating the Tuskegee Negro Normal Institute. The school taught academic classes to black students. It also taught practical subjects. Washington asked Carver join the faculty of the school and to create an agricultural department. Washington believed it was important for black people to be self-sufficient. He wanted them to own land. He also wanted to help farmers work their land better. Carver arrived in Tuskegee. He noticed the cotton crops there were small and sickly. He saw the land was barren . It was eroded. He planned to teach the farmers better planting and growing techniques. He knew they needed to grow other crops. Tuskegee Classes The classes at Tuskegee were very interesting. They included things such as farming, carpentry, and brickmaking. They also included shoemaking, printing, and cabinetmaking. Tuskegee Negro Normal School in Alabama \t Booker T.

The land didn’t have much grass, flowers, or shrubs. The soil was mostly dry clay. Not much grew there. Carver and his students cleaned up the land. They prepared it for planting healthy crops. No Resources Again When Carver arrived at the school, the agriculture building was not finished. He had to teach in a shack. It had no heat. Carver had no supplies except for his microscope. It had been a gift from his friends at Iowa State. He needed equipment to teach. So, he sent his students to search for things from the community to use in his laboratory. Carver believed it was important to save everything and to waste nothing. What Is Chemurgy? Carver pioneered research in chemurgy (KEM-ur-jee). This is the field of science that uses agricultural products for industry. Who Invented Peanut Butter? Peanut butter has been invented and reinvented many times in history. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg patented a “Process of Preparing Nut Meal” in 1895. He used peanuts. Carver’s research on the peanut began in 1880. So, he is sometimes credited with the invention. \t Carver found many ways to make useful things out of plants. \t Carver and his students put together their own laboratory. 1\u0018 1\u0018 1\u0018 1\u0018"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Carver didn’t agree with the way most students were taught science. They listened to lectures. They read books and learned vocabulary. But they didn’t really understand plants. Carver believed in hands-on learning. His students learned by working outdoors. They did experiments . He took his students on nature walks. He showed things to them. Carver wanted to teach in the community. Farmers needed help. He wanted to go to the farmers. Carver created a movable school. His students built it inside the Jesup Wagon . It was like a motor home. It was donated by a man named Morris K. Jesup to help the school. The students drove it to the farms. From it, Carver taught the most recent techniques in farming. \t Carver’s “movable school” Emma Lucy Braun (1889–1971) Emma Lucy Braun was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. Her parents were teachers. They encouraged her to appreciate the woodlands. Braun earned three degrees from the University of Cincinnati. She earned her doctorate in botany. Braun had a sister named Annette. Annette was a zoologist . She was the first woman to earn a doctorate from the University of Cincinnati. The sisters were research partners. In the 1940s, the sisters moved together to a house on two acres in the woods. This is where Emma Braun lived for 30 years. After her retirement from teaching at the university, Emma Braun continued to write and explore. She and her sister would wander the countryside. They would look for interesting or unusual plants. They found many new things throughout Ohio. Braun also worked to save natural areas and to create nature preserves.

Did you know that corn can be used to make plastic? It is renewable and can degrade over time. What can be made from corn plastic? Items include trash bags, shopping bags, plastic cups, and disposable eating utensils. Even packing peanuts, golf tees, and ski tickets are sometimes made from corn plastic. You might even be listening to your favorite music on a player made from corn plastic! In the 1980s, electronics industry leaders began using such plastic for the faces of their products. So, today the music of Korn can be played through corn-based plastic. How corny is that? The Peanut Man Carver found over 300 uses for the peanut. People called him “The Peanut Man.” The following is a list of some of the things he created from the peanut. \t Carver used many different techniques to turn peanut plants into useful products. Carver could have made a lot of money from his discoveries. But he believed God inspired and guided his work. He believed his discoveries belonged to the people. He did not want his creations patented. He only applied for three patents during his lifetime. • chili sauce • mock meats • plum punch • cosmetic substitutes • oleo mar garine • paper • glue • linoleum • axle gr ease • wallboard • cloth dye • instant coffee • mayonnaise • laxatives • aspar agus • fuel briquettes • gasoline • insecticides • plastics • ink • wood stains • rubber \u0018\u0018 \u0018\u0018 \u0018\u0018"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Wizard of Tuskegee Other people wanted Carver to work with them.

The carmaker Henry Ford was also interested in Carver. He needed sources for rubber in America. He needed rubber for tires and other car materials. Carver would not leave Tuskegee. Carver stayed at Tuskegee until he died in 1943. He never married. He was dedicated to his work. Carver’s work changed science forever. Before Carver did his research, almost no one used plant materials. They were only used for food and clothing. Much more scientific advancement has been made because of Carver’s creative approach to agriculture. Inventor Carver invented synthetic rubber. He also made material for paving highways.
