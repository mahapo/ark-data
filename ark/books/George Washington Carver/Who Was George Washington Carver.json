Mrs.Baynham lived in the biggest house in Diamond Grove, Missouri, in the mid-1870s.Inside the house, everything was in order: pretty paintings and nice furniture.But outside, in the garden, her roses weren’t blooming.[../image/GWCarver1.jpg]Why not? she wondered. Her friend Susan Carver’s roses were blooming. Her roseswere big and beautiful—and bright red! Mrs. Carver lived on a nearby farm. Mrs.Baynham went over and asked what her secret was to growing such perfect flowers.“It’s our George,” Mrs. Carver said. “He’s the one who knows about roses.”George was the ten-year-old boy who lived with Mrs. Carver. She was his fostermother. Mrs. Carver had been taking care of George since he was a baby. AndGeorge had been taking care of Mrs. Carver’s plants and flowers.Actually, George helped out around the farm in many ways. He loved Mrs. Carveras if she were his own mother. He would have done just about anything she asked.But he was especially happy when she asked him to help with her garden. [../image/Revision-1_a.jpg]So George went over to Mrs. Baynham’s house to take a look at her roses. He knewright away what was wrong. Her roses needed to be moved to a different part ofthe garden, where they could get more sun. He moved the plants, and soon theywere in full bloom![../image/GWCarver3.jpg]Word spread quickly. And young George started helping many of Mrs. Carver’sfriends with their plants and flowers. One week, a neighbor needed help with herlilies. Another week, a friend asked for help with her begonias. George alwaysseemed to know how to fix whatever problem there was. Soon, he became known as“the Plant Doctor.”George never lost that helpful spirit, nor his love for plants and the best wayto grow them. He was George Washington Carver, and he used his passion fornature to become one of the most famous, and helpful, scientists in the world."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 1Orphaned[../image/GWCarver4.jpg]George Washington Carver was born into slavery in Diamond Grove, Missouri, nearthe end of the American Civil War, which was fought from 1861 to 1865. Georgewas black; his owners, Moses and Susan Carver, were white.[../image/GWCarver5.jpg]Moses and Susan were German immigrants. They didn’t like slavery, but they had a240-acre farm that needed much work, and Missouri had entered the Union in 1820as a slave state. In 1855, the Carvers purchased a thirteen-year-old slave girlnamed Mary. They treated Mary well and were happy for her when she gave birth toa son named Jim in 1859. Several years later, George was born.[../image/GWCarver6.jpg]No one knows exactly when George was born, because most records among slaveowners were poorly kept. Most likely George was born in 1864. His father, Giles,was a slave who was owned by a neighbor of the Carvers. He was killed in afarming accident not long after George’s birth. No one knows exactly how manybrothers or sisters George had.George lived with Mary and Jim in a small cabin on the Carver farm. The cabinwas the original house on the farm. Moses and Susan had since built a largerhouse, and they lived in that one. One night when George was still an infant, hewas asleep in the cabin. Suddenly, there was the sound of men on horseback.Moses knew what that meant. Twice before, his farm had been attacked by raiders—called bushwhackers—who were fighting on the Confederate (Southern) side in theCivil War.[../image/GWCarver7.jpg][../image/GWCarver8.jpg]Missouri’s role in the Civil War was complicated. Even though Missouri was aslave state, many of the people who lived there were against slavery. So somemen on the Union (Northern) side fought for Missouri to remain as one of theUnited States and to free the slaves. But some of Missouri’s men fought tocreate a separate nation that would keep slavery legal. They were on theConfederate side.[../image/Revision_-3a.jpg]Moses was caught in the middle. He had slaves, but since he also wanted slaveryto be illegal, he upset people on both sides.[../image/GWCarver10.jpg]The bushwhackers wanted to take the slaves and sell them in a nearby state suchas Arkansas. Moses raced to the cabin and called out for Mary. Moses grabbedJim, and Mary grabbed George. Moses and Jim escaped, but it was too late forMary and George. The men grabbed her and her baby, and they galloped away intothe night.The next day, Moses hurried to Neosho, Missouri, which was about eight milesaway. There was a man in Neosho who was a scout for the Union side. The manmight know where to look for Mary and George.Several days later, the scout came back. He was clutching George, who was verysick with whooping cough, but alive. There was no sign of Mary. The raiders hadabandoned George. Mary was never heard from again.[../image/GWCarver11.jpg][../image/GWCarver12.jpg]Jim and George were left without a father or a mother, but Moses and Susan weredetermined to give the boys a family. The Carvers moved Jim and George into themain house and treated them as if they were their own children.Even though the Thirteenth Amendment freed all slaves in 1865, the boys stayedwith the Carvers, whom they called “Uncle Moses” and “Aunt Susan.” George wasknown simply as “Carver’s George.”THE END OF SLAVERY[../image/GWCarver13.jpg]PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN’S EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION WAS A BIG MOMENT IN USHISTORY. THE PROCLAMATION WAS ISSUED ON JANUARY 1, 1863. IT DECLARED THAT THESLAVES IN THE TEN STATES FIGHTING ON THE CONFEDERATE (SOUTHERN) SIDE IN THECIVIL WAR WERE FREE.TECHNICALLY, THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION HAD LITTLE EFFECT. THE CONFEDERATESTATES HAD TRIED TO LEAVE THE UNION AND WEREN’T ABOUT TO HONOR ANYTHING LINCOLNSAID. BUT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MADE CLEAR THAT THE CIVIL WAR WASN’TJUST ABOUT SAVING THE UNION, BUT ALSO WAS ABOUT ENDING SLAVERY.WHEN THE UNION (NORTHERN) SIDE WON THE WAR, SLAVERY WAS OVER EVERYWHERE IN THEUNITED STATES. IT BECAME OFFICIAL WHEN THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE USCONSTITUTION TOOK EFFECT ON DECEMBER 6, 1865."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2ChildhoodEvery day, George explored the fields and flowers and animals on the Carverfarm. It was a big farm, about the size of 180 football fields! Moses and Susangrew corn, wheat, and potatoes. They raised cows, pigs, and horses.[../image/GWCarver14.jpg]There was always plenty of work to do on the farm. Jim and George were expectedto help the other farmhands as much as they could. Jim was big and did some ofthe chores that took strength, such as plowing the fields. But George neverseemed to be fully healthy after he recovered from whooping cough as a baby. Hewas often sick. “My body was very feeble, and it was a constant warfare betweenlife and death to see who would gain the mastery,” he once wrote.[../image/GWCarver15.jpg]Because he was often sick, and not very strong, George was excused from theheavy-duty work on the farm. But he still wanted to be helpful. So he did whathe could, such as taking care of the plants and flowers and feeding the animals.[../image/GWCarver16.jpg]George didn’t go to school as a youngster, but he still had quite an educationon the farm. From Moses, he learned to waste nothing. Moses believed thateverything the family needed to live was available right there on the farm. FromSusan, George learned how to sew, cook, and clean. Susan even made her ownclothes with the help of a spinning wheel she kept in the house.[../image/Revision-2.jpg]When George was eight years old, he was baptized a Christian. Because he lovednature so much, George always referred to God as “Creator.” George went tochurch on Sundays, about a mile away from the farm. During the week, he playedwith the neighborhood kids. Most of them were white, and he learned to get alongwith people no matter what color they were.Mrs. Baynham was white. One day when George was helping her with her roses, sheshowed him the paintings in her house. George decided he wanted to paintpictures like that. He didn’t have any brushes or paint or canvas or paper. ButMoses had taught him to make good use of whatever was available. So Georgesqueezed the juice out of some berries, took a small stick, and started paintingon a flat rock.When George wasn’t working or playing, he took long walks in the fields and thewoods, talking to plants and flowers, and caring for them. He cleared a spot inthe woods where he kept his own little nursery—a special place for plants.“Strange to say, all sorts of vegetation [plant life] seemed to thrive under mytouch,” he said.[../image/GWCarver18.jpg]He collected rocks, too, and stashed them by the chimney in a corner of thehouse. Susan would make him clean out the corner, but the pile would soon growagain.[../image/GWCarver19.jpg][../image/GWCarver20.jpg]George was incredibly curious. He wanted to learn everything he could about theplants and flowers and animals he saw every day. When he saw a coneflower, hewanted to know why it was purple. When he saw a black-eyed Susan, he wanted toknow how it got its name.Sometimes, Moses and Susan knew the answers—but not always. The Carvers had anold spelling book. George read the book cover to cover, but it didn’t have theanswers he was looking for, either. George wanted to go to school and learn allthat he could.[../image/Revision-4.jpg]Diamond Grove’s school was in the same building where George went for church onSundays. One day, he and Jim walked to the school. Imagine George’s excitementat finally being able to find the answers to all of his questions! And imaginehis disappointment at being told that the school was for white children only.The kids George went to church with on Sundays and played with in theneighborhood could go to school, but he and Jim couldn’t. They walked back home.Jim went right back to helping out on the farm, but that wasn’t enough forGeorge. He didn’t give up his dream of going to school. When he was aboutthirteen, George went to Moses and Susan and told them he wanted to leave. Theywere the only parents he had ever known, and he loved them very much, but hewanted to go to school. His plan was to hike to Neosho, which had the nearestschool for black children.[../image/GWCarver22.jpg]Moses and Susan always said the boys were free, and they could leave if theywished, so they didn’t stop George. The next day, Susan packed up some snacksfor George, and he began the long walk to Neosho.[../image/GWCarver23.jpg]By the time George made it to Neosho, the snacks were long gone. It was gettingdark fast. George didn’t know anybody in the town, and he didn’t have any money.He was tired, and he was hungry.George spotted a barn. He’d grown up on a farm, so a barn was a friendly place.There was no one inside. He set down his belongings, and soon was fast asleep.[../image/GWCarver24.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3School Days[../image/GWCarver25.jpg]When George woke up the next morning, he stepped outside. The owner of the barn,Mariah Watkins, saw him. She figured he was hungry, so she fixed him somebreakfast in the main house.[../image/GWCarver26.jpg]“What’s your name?” Mariah asked him.“I’m Carver’s George,” he said.That sounded as if Carver owned George. Mrs. Watkins, who was black, didn’t likethat. Slavery had ended more than ten years earlier, and nobody owned anyoneelse. So Mrs. Watkins called him “George Carver.”George told Mrs. Watkins that he was in Neosho to go to school. He didn’t have aplace to live yet, but he’d figure something out.Mrs. Watkins was a kind woman, so she told George he could stay with her and herhusband, Andrew. But she also was a strict, no-nonsense woman. If George wasgoing to live there and go to the nearby Lincoln School—named after AbrahamLincoln—he’d have to do his share of the chores. George was delighted with thatdeal. He already could clean house and do laundry.[../image/GWCarver27.jpg]Moses Carver had taught George not to waste anything. Now Mrs. Watkins taughthim not to waste any time. She expected him to go to school during the day, butto come home at recess and do laundry. After school, he would clean the houseand maybe help cook dinner.George and Mr. and Mrs. Watkins read the Bible during the week, and they went tochurch on Sundays. Sometimes, George walked back to Diamond Grove to visit Mosesand Susan and Jim on the weekends.[../image/GWCarver28.jpg]Neosho was different than Diamond Grove. There were about 3,300 people livingthere—almost three times as many people as in Diamond Grove. And about one ofevery eight residents in Neosho was black. Diamond Grove had only sixteen blackpeople living in the whole town when George grew up there.George stayed in Neosho for a year or so, and learned just about all he could atthe one-room Lincoln School. “This simply sharpened my appetite for moreknowledge,” he wrote. He found that if he wanted more schooling, he’d have tomove again . . . and again . . . and again.[../image/GWCarver29.jpg][../image/GWCarver30.jpg]At the time, many former slaves were moving from the South into Kansas and otherNorthern states in search of a better life. In 1878, George hitched a ride withone such family on the way to Fort Scott, Kansas. George rode in the back of awagon for part of the eighty-mile trip and walked the rest of the way.In 1879, he moved to Olathe, Kansas. In 1880, he moved to Minneapolis, Kansas,and then to Paola, Kansas.[../image/Revision_-3a1.jpg][../image/GWCarver32.jpg]At each stop, George’s agreeable personality and willingness to work hard madeit easy for him to find a family to take him in. In Fort Scott, he moved in withFelix and Mattie Payne and their family. Felix was a blacksmith. In Olathe,George moved in with C.C. and Lucy Seymour. George helped Mrs. Seymour with herlaundry business. (In time, he moved with their family to Minneapolis.) InPaola, he moved in with Willis and Delilah Moore. These were all black familieswho lived in mostly white towns.In this period, “sunshine and shadow were profusely intermingled,” George wrote.In other words, there were both good times and bad times. The good timesincluded finding schools in every town he lived. He never wanted to stoplearning. One classmate remembered that George, who had grown to be six feettall and thin, would rather collect plants and leaves at recess than play games.[../image/GWCarver33.jpg]The bad times, however, included cruel encounters with racism. The worst of itcame in Fort Scott, where George witnessed a lynching—a black man being murderedby a group of white men. “As young as I was, the horror haunted me,” he said.George left Fort Scott shortly after.Other instances involved George personally. In one town, he and a white friendwent out to breakfast. When they sat down, the waiter told them he would servethe white man, but not George. This kind of racism was legal in those days under“Jim Crow” laws.In 1883, George got word that his brother, Jim, had died from smallpox. Jim wastwenty-three years old. He had left the Carver farm a few years earlier andmoved to Arkansas to find work. Although George had not seen his brother muchafter leaving home, he wrote that he felt “as never before that I was leftalone.”JIM CROW LAWSIN 1865, THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT OFFICIALLY ENDED SLAVERY. BUT BLACKS IN THEUNITED STATES, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH, STILL SUFFERED UNDER JIM CROW LAWS. THELAWS WERE NAMED AFTER AN OFFENSIVE BLACK CHARACTER FROM A SONG IN THE 1800S.THESE LAWS KEPT BLACKS FROM USING THE SAME RESTAURANTS AND HOTELS AS WHITES DID.AND THEY ALLOWED FOR “SEPARATE-BUT-EQUAL” FACILITIES, SUCH AS RESTROOMS ORDRINKING FOUNTAINS, FOR BLACKS AND WHITES. IN REALITY, WHILE FACILITIES WERESEPARATE, THEY USUALLY WEREN’T EQUAL. PLACES RESERVED FOR BLACKS WERE OFTEN MUCHWORSE THAN THOSE FOR WHITES.SOME JIM CROW LAWS LASTED UNTIL ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE AMERICANCIVIL WAR. IN 1954, THE US SUPREME COURT ENDED SEPARATE SCHOOLS FOR BLACKS ANDWHITES. IN 1965, CIVIL-RIGHTS LAWS FINALLY PUT AN END TO “SEPARATE-BUT-EQUAL.”[../image/GWCarver34.jpg] George found comfort, though, in friends who cared about him. He moved back inwith the Seymour family in Minneapolis. This is where George took his middlename. When he began getting mail intended for a different George Carver in town,he added the initial W to his name so the postman could tell the two men apart.A friend asked if the W stood for Washington. George thought that sounded good,so he became known from then on as George Washington Carver.[../image/GWCarver35.jpg]George opened a laundry business—washing and drying clothes for other people—inMinneapolis, and bought a small plot of land. Then he sold the land for a profitand moved to the larger town of Kansas City. He entered a school to learnshorthand and typewriting. He thought he might want to work for a telegraphoffice. But he decided business school wasn’t enough. George wanted to go tocollege. So he began writing to colleges he might attend.[../image/GWCarver36.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4College ManIn 1884, an envelope addressed to George Washington Carver arrived from HighlandCollege in Highland, Kansas. George ripped open the envelope. The school hadaccepted George as a student. He was going to college![../image/GWCarver37.jpg]George was thrilled. He packed his bags, said good-bye to his friends, and tookthe train to Highland, about seventy-five miles away. But when he arrived oncampus, school administrators told him he couldn’t attend after all. He wasblack, and the school didn’t accept nonwhites. Highland didn’t know George wasblack when he applied by mail.[../image/GWCarver38.jpg]George was crushed. He was twenty years old, and he had no idea what to do next.He stayed in Highland about a year, cleaning and doing laundry for the Beelerfamily there. When the Beelers’ son moved to Ness County, Kansas, in themid-1880s to become a homesteader, George went with him. In Ness County, Georgeworked for another settler named George Steeley, then claimed his own homestead.Frontier life was difficult. In western Kansas, George built a small house madeof sod. Sod is made of pads of grass, its roots, and the dirt the roots areclinging to. The house was fourteen feet on each side. He kept it “neat, clean,and decorated with flowers and objects of interest,” according to one neighbor.George planted vegetables and raised hens. Summers were hot, winters were cold,and water was sometimes hard to find. Communities of homesteaders were oftenclose-knit groups regardless of color. George, one of the few black people inthe area, was well-liked. He painted and sketched, played his accordion, and washelpful to neighbors. George planted trees and collected hundreds of plants. Hewatched carefully to see which plants grew best under what conditions.[../image/GWCarver40.jpg]HOMESTEADING[../image/GWCarver39.jpg]WITH PLENTY OF LAND AVAILABLE FOR SETTLING ON THE US FRONTIER, PRESIDENT ABRAHAMLINCOLN SIGNED INTO LAW THE HOMESTEAD ACT OF 1862. IT ALLOWED SETTLERS, CALLEDHOMESTEADERS, TO FILE A CLAIM FOR 160 ACRES OF PUBLIC LAND. THE HOMESTEADERSAGREED TO LIVE ON THE LAND, IMPROVE IT, AND FARM IT FOR FIVE YEARS. AT THE ENDOF FIVE YEARS, THEY HAD TO PAY ONLY A SMALL FEE—IT WAS $24 WHEN GEORGEWASHINGTON CARVER WAS A HOMESTEADER—TO BECOME THE LANDOWNERS. IF THEY DIDN’TWANT TO WAIT FIVE YEARS, HOMESTEADERS COULD PURCHASE THE LAND FOR $1.25 AN ACREAFTER ONLY SIX MONTHS.MOST HOMESTEADING TOOK PLACE IN THE LAND WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. MORETHAN 1.6 MILLION PEOPLE MADE HOMESTEAD CLAIMS. IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FARMERSAND FREED SLAVES TO OWN THEIR OWN LAND AND TO BUILD BETTER LIVES FOR THEMSELVES.BUT THE HOMESTEAD ACT WAS POSSIBLE ONLY BECAUSE THE US GOVERNMENT HAD FORCED SOMANY NATIVE AMERICANS OFF THEIR LAND. [../image/GWCarver41.jpg]Before his five years were up, George bought the homestead with the help of abank loan. But he couldn’t make a living as a farmer. The soil was poor, andKansas suffered a terrible drought. So in 1888, George moved to Iowa.Eventually, he turned over his homestead to the bank.In Iowa, George lived in Winterset, a mostly white town where he found a job asa cook in a hotel. In church one Sunday, a woman in the choir named HelenMilholland noticed George. She enjoyed his high-pitched singing voice. The nextday, she sent her husband, Dr. John Milholland, to talk to George at the hoteland to invite him to their home.[../image/GWCarver42.jpg]George made weekly visits to the Milholland home and attended church with them.They became great friends. The Milhollands soon discovered George’s interest inart, and they encouraged him to go to college to study it.[../image/GWCarver43.jpg][../image/3870.jpg]There was a good school, called Simpson College, in nearby Indianola. George hadbeen upset by the incident at Highland College and didn’t want to go throughthat again. The Milhollands assured George that Simpson had no rule againstblacks attending. They would even help with the application. So George applied,was accepted, and saved up his money for a year. He enrolled at Simpson in thefall of 1890.George was only the second black student in the history of Simpson College,which had opened its doors thirty years earlier in 1860. He studied music andart, and he ran a laundry business to help pay tuition. But after he paid forhis classes, he had almost nothing left over. “For quite one month I lived onprayer, beef suet [chunks of beef fat], and corn meal,” he said, “and quiteoften without the suet and meal.”George was popular at Simpson with both his fellow students and his teachers.When they saw he was struggling to make ends meet, they snuck furniture, food,or other items into his room. “They all seemed to take pride in seeing if he orshe might not do more for me than someone else,” George said.[../image/GWCarver45.jpg][../image/GWCarver46.jpg]In art class, sometimes George painted plants. Other times, he brought in hisplants to show the teacher, Miss Budd. She was impressed with how much he knewabout horticulture, the science of fruits, vegetables, and flowering plants. Shesuggested that he consider attending Iowa State Agricultural School in Ames,Iowa. One reason was that her father taught science there. Another was that eventhough George was a very talented artist, she figured it would be difficult foranyone—especially a black man in the 1890s—to earn a living at it.George knew Miss Budd was right. He also knew that even though his art mighthelp bring people enjoyment, his knowledge of agriculture might help bring foodto their dinner tables.So after only one semester at Simpson, George enrolled at Iowa State in 1891. Hestudied chemistry, geology, botany, and zoology. In 1894, he became the firstblack person to graduate from Iowa State. When the school hired him as anassistant in botany (the science of plant life), George became the first blackperson to join the faculty there.[../image/GWCarver47.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5The Greatest Good[../image/GWCarver48.jpg]George had no plans to leave Iowa State. He liked the faculty and the studentsthere, and they liked him. He was studying for a graduate degree in agricultureand was teaching young men and women, too. It looked as if George was set for along career at the school. But in April 1896, he received a letter that changedhis life. It was from educator and orator Booker T. Washington.[../image/GWCarver49.jpg]Washington was perhaps the most famous black man in America in the late 1800s.In 1895, he gave a speech at the Cotton States and International Exposition inAtlanta, Georgia. The speech has come to be called the “Atlanta Compromise.”Washington essentially urged blacks to accept the idea of separate-but-equal inexchange for education, job training, and fairness in the court system. Hewanted blacks to work with whites, not against them, to fight racism.Not everyone agreed with Booker T. Washington. Some of his critics in thecivil-rights movement felt that accepting separate-but-equal meant whites wouldalways think blacks were not as good as they were. Booker T. Washington, ofcourse, didn’t believe that. But he believed that if blacks ever were to achievetrue equality in the United States, they would need better education.That was why Booker jumped at the chance to start an all-black school inTuskegee, Alabama, in 1881. The Tuskegee Institute opened in a run-down,one-room building that year with just $2,000 from the state of Alabama. The nextyear, the school purchased one hundred acres of land, and the campus began todevelop.BOOKER T. WASHINGTON (1856–1915)[../image/GWCarver50.jpg]BOOKER TALIAFERRO WASHINGTON WAS BORN INTO SLAVERY. HE GREW UP TO BECOME ANEDUCATOR, AN AUTHOR, AND A WELL-KNOWN SPEAKER. IN 1881, HE ESTABLISHED THETUSKEGEE INSTITUTE IN TUSKEGEE, ALABAMA, BECAUSE HE FELT THAT EDUCATION WAS THEBEST PATH FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE TRUE EQUALITY.IN HIS TIME, WASHINGTON WAS THE MOST FAMOUS LEADER OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. IN1901, HE BECAME THE FIRST BLACK PERSON TO BE OFFICIALLY INVITED TO THE WHITEHOUSE WHEN PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT ASKED HIM TO DINNER. [../image/12779.jpg]Tuskegee wasn’t a traditional college, like Iowa State, that accepted onlyhigh-school graduates. Instead, some Tuskegee students had as little as afifth-grade education. Many of their parents and grandparents had been slaves.They were there for hands-on learning they could use in their day-to-day lives.As part of their classes, some early Tuskegee students actually built theclassrooms that rose on the new campus.[../image/GWCarver52.jpg]Booker was still the president of the Tuskegee Institute when he wrote to Georgein 1896. The school was growing, Booker explained. He wanted to add a departmentof agriculture, and he wanted George to be in charge of it.George had read about Booker’s big Atlanta speech in the newspapers. George’sbeliefs about race relations were much the same as Booker’s. George had livedamong and worked with whites all his life. He believed that working with whiteswas the best path to equality. And, of course, George recognized the value of aneducation.So that was why George, even though he was perfectly happy at Iowa State,thought long and hard about Booker’s offer. Tuskegee couldn’t pay George as muchmoney and didn’t have the modern buildings or equipment. He would be leaving thecomfort and security of one job for the uncertainty of another. But “the onegreat ideal of my life [is] to be of the greatest good to the greatest number of‘my people,’” George wrote to Booker. So he accepted the job, finished up hisgraduate degree at Iowa State, and arrived in Tuskegee in October 1896.[../image/GWCarver53.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6TuskegeeThe city of Tuskegee and the surrounding area turned out to be an amazing place.George found many new plants and flowers to study. The school itself, however,wasn’t so amazing. When George arrived, he had no rooms in which to store hiscollections, and not even a laboratory in which to work.But George didn’t worry about what he didn’t have. “Use what you find aroundyou,” he told his first students. He took them to a junkyard. They dug up oldpots and pans, saucers and spoons, boxes and string—whatever they could find—andmade their own laboratory.It was all part of hands-on learning for George’s students. He didn’t want tojust stand in front of a classroom and give lectures. He wanted his students totouch and feel nature—and to think.[../image/GWCarver54.jpg][../image/GWCarver55.jpg]On early morning walks, George collected samples of soil or flowers or insectsthat he shared in his classroom. Outside the classroom, he set up a practicefarm on ten acres of land. It was an experiment station. One acre was fortesting the soil, another was for growing sweet potatoes, another for studyingfertilizers, and so on.With the experiment station, George took his wish to be “the greatest good tothe greatest number” seriously. He invited local farmers to come to the schoolonce a month to learn about the soil.[../image/GWCarver56.jpg]During their monthly meetings, George analyzed the farmers’ soil and gave themsamples of his. Then he started encouraging them to come in between the monthlymeetings, whenever they needed some help. Then he invited the wives to comealong, too. He showed them ways to plan meals and prepare food, and he discussedthe value of different foods. George didn’t have the money for fancy equipmentat Tuskegee, so his advice was helpful to the farmers who didn’t have the moneyfor fancy equipment, either.[../image/GWCarver57.jpg]George wanted farmers to pay attention to nature and all it had to offer. Hewrote different booklets that taught how to grow tomatoes or raise hogs orpreserve meat. The more farmers could do on their own, the less they had tospend at the market—and the less they had to go without. “Anything that fillsthe dinner pail is valuable,” he said.He wrote other booklets that helped farmers improve the appearance of their landand their homes. He knew they couldn’t afford to buy paint, but he also knewthere were plenty of natural resources. Different types of natural clay, forinstance, could be mixed to make different colors for paint. With a little gluemixed in, it would stick to cabin walls. George also taught farmers how to carefor native plants, flowers, and grasses, and how to fix up their homes.[../image/GWCarver58.jpg]Such a work schedule, though, was exhausting. George liked to get up by fouro’clock in the morning and walk in the woods. Then he taught four or fiveclasses each day. He also ran the experiment station and worked in the homemadelaboratory. He continued to paint and draw, too, and he often wrote letters toMoses and Susan Carver and to the other families he had lived with. He alsoorganized a Bible study class once a week.His intense workload and many interests left George little time for fun.Sometimes, his friends set him up on dates, but he never married.[../image/GWCarver59.jpg]In 1906, George designed the Jesup Agricultural Wagon. It was a movableclassroom and portable laboratory. The Jesup Wagon was named for a New Yorkbanker, Morris K. Jesup, who helped pay for it. A former student of George’s wasin charge of taking the wagon to faraway farmers who couldn’t make it toTuskegee. The wagon was loaded with soil, seeds, booklets, and other studymaterials.[../image/GWCarver60.jpg]In 1908, George had the chance to visit Moses, who had moved to Kansas afterSusan’s death several years earlier. It would be the last time George saw hisfoster father. Moses Carver died in his late nineties in 1910.Five years after losing his father, George also lost his friend Booker T.Washington. Booker was fifty-nine when he died of heart failure in 1915. Georgeand Booker didn’t always agree on how things should be run at Tuskegee, but theywere close friends. “I am sure Mr. Washington never knew how much I loved him,and the cause for which he gave his life,” George wrote another friend.[../image/4820.jpg]Booker T. Washington had been the face of the Tuskegee Institute since theschool opened its doors. After his death, Robert Russa Moton became president ofTuskegee. But it was George who became the most famous person at the school."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7Peanuts!While at Tuskegee, George liked to tell a story about a talk he had once hadwith God.“Mr. Creator, why did you make the universe?” George asked.“Little man, that question is too big for you,” God answered. “Try another!”So George asked, “Mr. Creator, why did you make man?”God answered: “Little man, that question is still too big for you. Try another!”This time George asked, “Mr. Creator, why did you make the peanut?”And God said: “Little man, that question is just your size. You listen and Iwill teach you.”Apparently, George was a good listener, because while experimenting at Tuskegee,he began to develop more than three hundred products that could be made from thepeanut. They included everything from peanut milk to peanut punch, plastics,glue, soaps, and dyes.[../image/GWCarver62.jpg]Peanuts were considered so lowly that before George began to study them, theywere mostly used for animal food. Farmers couldn’t make much money from peanutsand had little reason to grow them.[../image/GWCarver63.jpg][../image/GWCarver64.jpg]Cotton had been the main crop in the American South. But in the early 1900s, itcost some farmers more to grow cotton than they could sell it for. The bollweevil—a type of beetle that feeds on cotton buds and can destroy entirecrops—came to the United States from Mexico in the late 1800s. By 1910, it hadarrived in Alabama.After many years of studying soil, George knew that planting cotton over andover again sucked the nutrients—substances plants need to grow—out of the soil.He wanted farmers to rotate their crops. That meant growing cotton one season,but switching to a different crop the next. Then they could replant cotton theseason after that. [../image/GWCarver65.jpg]One of the crops George recommended for cotton growers was the sweet potato.Sweet potato plants were easy to grow, and crops could be stored during thewinter months. They were good for the soil, and they could be eaten manydifferent ways. Some of George’s earliest bulletins were on the sweet potato.George also experimented with cowpeas, sugar beets, rice, soybeans, alfalfa, andmore. His experiments helped him understand the best ways to grow these crops sothat they would yield the most food. He learned what kinds of soil and growingconditions they needed.In 1910, Tuskegee built George a modern laboratory to replace his homemade one.And by 1915, his experiments were taking so much of his time that he began togive up teaching.[../image/GWCarver66.jpg][../image/GWCarver67.jpg]In 1916, George wrote his most famous booklet: “How to Grow the Peanut, and 105Ways of Preparing It for Human Consumption.” Recipes included items such aspeanut soup, peanut bread, and peanut pudding. Several recipes included peanutbutter in them: Peanut butter was number fifty-one, peanut butter candy wasnumber seventy, and peanut butter fudge was number eighty! In fact, George wroteso much about peanuts that he is sometimes mistakenly credited with inventingpeanut butter.The same year George produced his famous peanut booklet, he was honored by theRoyal Society of Arts in London. The Royal Society honors people in science andart who find practical solutions to problems. That summed up George perfectly!At the time, it was rare for an American to be honored—let alone one who hadbeen born into slavery.[../image/5243.jpg]PEANUT BUTTERMOST HISTORIANS BELIEVE PEANUT BUTTER HAS BEEN AROUND FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.BOTH THE INCA CIVILIZATION IN SOUTH AMERICA AND THE AZTECS OF ANCIENT MEXICOGROUND PEANUTS INTO PASTE.[../image/GWCarver68.jpg]IN THE UNITED STATES, DR. JOHN HENRY KELLOGG—FAMOUS FOR KELLOGG’SCEREALS—BELIEVED THAT PEANUT BUTTER WAS A VERY HEALTHY FOOD. HE MADE HIS OWNTYPE OF PEANUT BUTTER IN 1895. PEANUT BUTTER REALLY BECAME POPULAR AMONG THEAMERICAN PUBLIC AT THE ST. LOUIS WORLD’S FAIR IN 1904, ALONG WITH THE ICE-CREAMCONE AND COTTON CANDY. Around this same time, George was reportedly offered a job to work for Americaninventor Thomas Edison in his New Jersey laboratory. George could have becomerich working for Edison, but he was devoted to helping the farmers in the South.So he stayed at Tuskegee.The Peanut Journal wrote that George Washington Carver “is to the peanutindustry what [Thomas] Edison is to electricity.” One biographer even calledGeorge “the patron saint” of the peanut industry.THOMAS EDISON (1847–1931)[../image/GWCarver70.jpg]THOMAS ALVA EDISON WAS AN INVENTOR WHO CHANGED THE WORLD. HE INVENTED HUNDREDSOF ITEMS, INCLUDING SOME THAT HAD A GREAT INFLUENCE ON EVERYDAY LIFE, SUCH ASTHE FIRST PRACTICAL LIGHTBULB, THE PHONOGRAPH, AND THE MOTION-PICTURE CAMERA.EDISON WAS KNOWN FOR WORKING TIRELESSLY AT HIS LABORATORIES IN MENLO PARK, NEWJERSEY. (HIS NICKNAME WAS “THE WIZARD OF MENLO PARK.”) HE FAMOUSLY SAID, “GENIUSIS ONE PERCENT INSPIRATION AND NINETY-NINE PERCENT PERSPIRATION.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8Lasting ImpactGeorge was never interested in personal glory, but his work with peanuts madehim famous. In 1921, he took a train to Washington, DC, to talk to Congressabout the peanut industry. George was supposed to give a ten-minute talk. Butwhen his ten minutes were up, the politicians gave him another ten minutes. Andwhen those ten minutes were up, they told him to talk for as long as he needed!George pulled samples out of a box to show different ways peanuts could be used:in milk, breakfast foods, oils, and more. Texas congressman John N. Garner, wholater became vice president of the United States, called it “a most wonderfulexhibition.” Congress passed a law that helped the peanut industry. After that,George wrote newspaper and magazine articles about the peanut industry, and headvised companies that produced peanuts.[../image/Revision-6.jpg][../image/GWCarver72.jpg]He also continued working at Tuskegee. He no longer taught classes, but focusedon his work in the laboratory instead. He came to be known as a “creativechemist”—a scientist who remakes a product, such as peanuts in George’s case,for different uses. He received awards from organizations such as the NationalAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He also began workingwith the United States Department of Agriculture to help identify and preventplant diseases in the South.[../image/GWCarver73.jpg]Though he discovered hundreds of nonfood uses for the peanut, and many for thesweet potato, too, none of George’s products were sold to the public. George’sgoal was never to get rich, though. He rarely spent the money he did make,unless it was to help a former student who needed a loan. He was known forwearing the same old clothes day after day.Even after he began receiving awards and honors for his work, George wanted tofind ways to help people. He still taught his weekly Bible study class, and healways was willing to help any student in need. He was like a second father tomany of them and offered sound words of advice.[../image/GWCarver74.jpg]THE WISDOM OF GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER“HOW FAR YOU GO IN LIFE DEPENDS ON YOUR BEING TENDER WITH THE YOUNG,COMPASSIONATE WITH THE AGED, SYMPATHETIC WITH THE STRIVING, AND TOLERANT OF THEWEAK AND STRONG. BECAUSE SOMEDAY IN YOUR LIFE YOU WILL HAVE BEEN ALL OF THESE.”“WHEN YOU CAN DO THE COMMON THINGS OF LIFE IN AN UNCOMMON WAY, YOU WILL COMMANDTHE ATTENTION OF THE WORLD.”“START WHERE YOU ARE WITH WHAT YOU HAVE. MAKE SOMETHING OF IT AND NEVER BESATISFIED.”“EDUCATION IS THE KEY TO UNLOCK THE GOLDEN DOOR OF FREEDOM.”“READING ABOUT NATURE IS FINE, BUT IF A PERSON WALKS IN THE WOODS AND LISTENSCAREFULLY, HE CAN LEARN MORE THAN WHAT IS IN BOOKS.”“NINETY-NINE PERCENT OF THE FAILURES COME FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE HABIT OFMAKING EXCUSES.” [../image/GWCarver75.jpg]In 1937, to celebrate George’s forty years at the Tuskegee Institute, the schoolunveiled a bronze bust of him on campus. A press release and notices in thePeanut Journal asked for $1 donations to pay for the artwork. People—both blackand white—who admired George sent in their donations from all over the country.Two years later, the George Washington Carver Museum opened in Tuskegee. Itincluded parts of George’s original homemade laboratory, samples of the peanutproducts he created, educational exhibits, and much more. Dozens of George’spaintings hung on the walls. In 1940, George donated his entire lifesavings—about $60,000—to start the George Washington Carver Foundation at theTuskegee Institute for agricultural research. He wanted others to continue hiswork at Tuskegee even after he was gone.[../image/GWCarver76.jpg][../image/GWCarver77.jpg][../image/GWCarver78.jpg]In his later years, George’s health began to fail him, but he didn’t stopworking. In December 1942, he hurt himself when he fell down some stairs at themuseum. He never fully recovered, and he died in January 1943. It is believed hewas seventy-eight years old. He was buried next to his friend Booker T.Washington on the Tuskegee campus.Five years after George’s death, he became only the second black American to bedepicted on a postage stamp. Booker T. Washington had been the first. In 1953,in Diamond Grove, Missouri, he became the first black American to have anational monument dedicated to him. Hundreds of schools across the United Statesare now named for this great scientist.[../image/GWCarver80.jpg]Critics say that most of George’s work did not produce amazing breakthroughs ordiscoveries. Instead, he found practical ways for science to make people’s livesbetter.[../image/12718.jpg]In many ways, George was ahead of his time. He understood the importance ofnutrition and a balanced diet long before many others did. He saw value incaring for the environment and growing fruits and vegetables naturally. Herecycled items that had been discarded and found new uses for them. Georgehelped the economy in the American South. He helped farmers move away from theirdependency on growing cotton. And he helped poor farmers find ways to take careof themselves. He did all that while never losing the passion for nature that hefirst showed in his youth.As George’s tombstone at Tuskegee reads: “He could have added fortune to fame,but caring for neither, he found happiness and honor in being helpful to theworld.”"},{"pageContent":"TIMELINE OF GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER’S LIFEC. 1864 George is born in Diamond Grove, Missouri1877 Begins formal schooling in Neosho, Missouri1885 Is accepted to Highland College, but is denied admission whenadministrators there see that he is black1886 Works as a homesteader in Ness County, Kansas, and begins performingagricultural experiments on the farm1894 Graduates from Iowa State and joins the faculty there1896 Earns a master’s degree in agriculture from Iowa State and joins famededucator Booker T.
