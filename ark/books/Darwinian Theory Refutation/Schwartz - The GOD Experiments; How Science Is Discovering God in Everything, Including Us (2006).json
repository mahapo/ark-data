Imaginea world without mystics, prophets, shamans, or medicine men. And what if therewere no Old Testament, no New Testament, no Koran—just contemporary,twenty-first-century science? In such a world, would scientists feel the need tocome up with a theory that some kind of invisible organizing process—that is, aGod—exists in the universe and in our daily lives? A rumor would leak to themedia, stirring a high level of skeptical coverage, on the offbeat notion thatscience had proposed the existence of a universal intelligence, a source ofcosmic energy, that explained the origin and evolution of order in the universe.Let’s face it: not in that fictional world but in today’s real world, where someversion of the God concept is accepted by a majority of the planet’s 6 billionpeople, God is a subject traditionally shunned by scientists. And for goodreason: a sure way for federally funded scientists to lose their governmentsupport from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation,or NASA is for them to start conducting experiments documenting the existence ofGod.But is the belief in God—a universal intelligence, source and energy of all thatis—something we must accept only on faith? Or is there compelling scientificreasoning, supported by incontrovertible experimental evidence? If this essenceis actually at work in the scientist’s lab as well as in our daily lives, it’stime for us to take notice. My experiences in the laboratory and in lifedemonstrate convincingly, I believe, that science can lead us to the God who isnow making himself/ herself/itself known in physics, statistics, computerscience, and even in, of all places, parapsychology experiments. We no longerneed to accept God on faith alone. This news won’t rock the boat of people forwhom faith has been and always will be sufficient. But even the committed will,I think, find the support for their beliefs persuasive. And for everyone else,the results of the experiments and research presented in these pages open aworld of new possibilities and new understanding.GOD AND G.O.D.The everyday word “God,” and associated terms like “Lord,” “King of theUniverse,” “the Ultimate,” “the Source,” “the Great Spirit,” and “Allah,” havedifferent meanings for different religions as well as for different peoplewithin a given religion.For some, God is a demanding older white male who sports a Santa-like beard andleans upon a gnarled and weathered staff. For others, a nurturing female deitywho plays a sitarlike instrument … or a spirit that animates everything fromelementary particles to galaxies … or a cosmic consciousness that exists beyondspace and time. These widely diverse images of God—from the highly specific tothe extraordinarily broad—have through the ages created confusion andantagonism, suspicion, hatred, and bloodshed. Little wonder that most scientistsavoid discussing God in the context of their work. Little wonder that any socialdiscussion of God, except among fellow-believers, is considered as unacceptableas bragging about the accomplishments of one’s favorite sports team.To avoid all the emotional baggage that too often comes into play when somebodytries to tell you about his or her notion of God, in these pages you’ll find,instead, the term “G.O.D.,” which I use to suggest a Guiding, Organizing,Designing process. Where you find “G.O.D” or “the G.O.D. process,” you candecide to accept it as referring to your own idea of God, or as specificallyrepresenting a Guiding-Organizing-Designing process (the precise meaning in thisbook). I use the term “G.O.D.” as a specific concept that everyone can focus onand discuss—even scientists.How the concept of G.O.D. relates to your personal idea of “God” will becomeclear to you as you read this book. In a confusing and troubling world, now morethan ever a meaningful question for all of us to consider is whether a G.O.D.process plays an invisible role in the evolution of our planet, in the unfoldingof our universe, and in our personal lives. This is a central question you’llfind addressed in these pages—the question of intelligent evolution.I BECOME INVOLVEDI was educated to be an open-minded skeptic. As a Harvard Ph.D. student I wastaught how to raise questions about mind and health, convert them into stablehypotheses, design experiments to critically evaluate these hypotheses, and thenfollow the findings where they took me. I was not trained to consider the natureof God from a scientific point of view.For twenty years I was a mainstream academic psychophysiologist who conductedresearch and applications in the field of mind-body medicine. I am ascientist—originally on the faculty at Harvard, later on the faculty at Yale asa tenured professor at the age of thirty-two. My work has been funded by theNational Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, and I’mcurrently a professor of psychology, surgery, medicine, neurology, andpsychiatry at the University of Arizona.My training never taught me to ask questions that would lead me to think aboutGod, and I became involved with the G.O.D. hypothesis only because my researchsimply led me there. Ultimately I couldn’t be true to my professionalresponsibilities as a scientist and educator—or be true to myself—if I did notpublish what I had discovered in my research and laboratory work about G.O.D.’sexistence in our daily lives.Though Darwinian evolutionists may wish to paint this book as serving theChristian right, and creationists may choose to embrace it as supporting theirliteralist theist views, the truth is that this book was written by anagnostically raised scientist with an open and inquisitive mind who is followingthe data where it takes him.CAN SCIENCE TAKE US TO G.O.D?Imagine that science can actually take us to G.O.D.—not merely theoretically butexperimentally. Imagine that science can help us discover how a G.O.D. processoperates not only in the creation and evolution of molecules, organisms,planets, stars, and galaxies, but in the manifestation of our most significantpersonal relationships. Imagine that this science-based G.O.D. is with you asyou read this book, playing a behind-the-scenes role in your most intimatethoughts and feelings. Imagine that this G.O.D. is literally inside you rightnow, patiently waiting for you to wake up to this inner, ultimate reality. Areyou ready to wake up?"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00004.gif]THE SCIENCE OF PROPHECYWhat experiments with a British psychic who claims to see the future in hisdreams reveal about the existence of G.O.D.CARL SAGANExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00005.gif]FORESEEING GOD IN THE LABORATORYHOW EVIDENCE FOR DESIGN SHOWS UP IN PROPHETIC DREAMSOne April day in 2001, the phone in my home office rang. The caller was a manwith a charming British accent and a sparkling manner alive with animation andhumor, who introduced himself as Chris Robinson. He had read about my lab at theUniversity of Arizona, he said, and was calling to announce that he wanted me totest his abilities to see if I could conclude that he was, indeed, getting tipsfrom some otherworldly source.After a near-death experience thirteen years earlier, weird messages had begunarriving in his sleep—dreams that foretold the future, especially about murdersand terrorism.Over the years, he said, evidence obtained through his dreams had helped putmany criminals behind bars. Because of Robinson’s information, murderers whothought they had escaped were caught, IRA bombers were captured, and corruptmembers of the police force were uncovered and sent to prison. Fingering corruptcops and detectives didn’t make Christopher popular with British lawenforcement, he said. Although they had continued to listen to his informationand act on it, he said, he had been kept at arm’s length and mistrusted.I had no reason to think anyone could really do what Christopher was claiming. Ilistened patiently as he shared stories that were amazing and outrageous. Ifound most of what he said virtually impossible to believe. He claimed that abook called Dream Detective had been published in England about many of hiscases and that he would send me a copy. The book actually arrived, and I foundit supported his claims, apparently substantiating his uncanny skill.I was about to start on a journey on which this total stranger from Englandwould ultimately propel me to reconsider the entire history of my scientificcareer, and in the process come to new and meaningful conclusions.We had a series of phone calls after that. Trained in clinical psychology, Ilistened closely for signs of psychosis or thought disorder. He not only soundedsane but was insisting that he fly over from England if I would conduct tests toverify his claims of dreams that foretold the future. This blue-collar workerwith marginal income was offering to buy his own airline ticket and pay for hisown hotel and meals if I was willing to try to help him find out, once and forall, what his power really represented.Over the next weeks Christopher and I discussed a highly controlled yetseemingly impossible (to me, not to Christopher) experiment that begged to beconducted. I realized that if Christopher was neither a delusional schizophrenicnor a pathological liar—these were two big ifs—and the findings were positive,the experiment held the possibility of becoming one of the more remarkableinvestigations in the history of contemporary parapsychology, and perhaps evenof science in general. I subsequently learned that Christopher could beunreasonably suspicious at times—no doubt because of his dangerous work as anundercover agent and his extraordinary sensitivity as a psychic.Four months later, in early August 2001, Christopher arrived from England andset up temporary residence in a Tucson hotel. I had by then selected twentypossible locations in southern Arizona—from Nogales, a Mexican border town, toSummerhaven, a ski resort on the top of Mount Lemmon. Of these twenty locationsknown only to me, ten would be selected at random for us to visit on tensuccessive days.I printed out the name of each site on a sheet of paper, placed each sheet in aseparate envelope, sealed the envelopes, and shuffled them, then shipped themovernight to my friend and coauthor Bill Simon, who had agreed to help in theexperiment. He acted as an intermediary, receiving the package and turning itover to a third party whose identity was unknown to me.The third party was instructed to open the package, shuffle the envelopes,number them, and store them in a safe place; all of this was to be done in frontof a video camera.For thirteen years Chris Robinson had been recording his nightly dreams andpremonitions in a diary—his “dream diary.” Since the previous May, anticipatingthe experiment that he and I had been discussing, Chris recorded his dreams forten nights about what he thought he would do and see on each day in Tucson. Herepeated this ten-night pre-experimental dream sequence in June and again inJuly. When he arrived in Tucson in early August, he brought the three sets often-day dream diaries with him. I read the diary with its predictions, stillbelieving this part of the experiment to be preposterous and fully expectingthat nothing would come of it. Even by my adventurous standards, it simplyseemed impossible that he could have guessed locations anything like the ones wewould visit on each day of the experiment.THE “TEN DAYS IN ARIZONA” EXPERIMENTIn his hotel across the street from the University of Arizona, Christopher gotready for bed on the night before the first day of our experiment. Beforefalling asleep, he would ask the universe, in his head, to be shown in hisdreams where he would be taken the next day.As was his ritual, when he awoke, he wrote careful notes in his diary about thedreams he’d had, often including sketches or diagrams. On the firstmorning—Thursday, August 2, 2001—the experiment officially began when I arrived,about 9 A.M. As we said our good mornings, I set up my digital video camera andvideotaped the pages Christopher had written, while he read the raw informationout loud onto the audio track. On camera, he then summarized the key informationfrom the three pre-experiment dreams for that day. After that, he described theprevious night’s dreams. And then, the key part, he concluded by summarizingfrom the dreams his description of things he believed we would see or experienceduring that one day.On the first day, Robinson focused on “holes, lots of holes,” along with “abasin empty of water.” With the camera still running, I then placed a call toBill Simon in southern California to tell him we were ready to learn thelocation for the day. Bill then contacted the third party. (He didn’t have to gofar; I would learn after the experiment that this mysterious third party wasBill’s wife, Dr. Arynne Simon.) With her video camera running, she opened theenvelope that was at the top of the stack after her shuffle, which she hadmarked as Envelope #1. She read out loud what was written on the paper: “DesertMuseum/Animals.” She showed the paper to the camera and to Bill, who then calledme back and told me the location.I did not tell Christopher where we would be going, nor did I tell Bill whatChristopher had dreamed. But I knew the desert museum well: a place with a hugevariety of holes, ranging from human caves and large animal cages in the groundto prairie dog tunnels in every direction. Even before Christopher and I packedour assorted video and still cameras and began to drive out of Tucson in thedirection that would take us to the museum, I knew that his prediction of“holes, lots of holes” was a remarkably apt description of the landscape of themuseum. Also, the museum was located in a basin that millions of years ago hadbeen an ocean.Christopher’s dreams for each day included information not just about the sitebut also about objects and events on the journey to the location. Hence wecarefully monitored the journeys as well as the sites.For example, on Day 2, Christopher said that the primary themes of his dreamswere “shops and workshops … fabricating things … metal.” The secret message inthe envelope for that day sent us to Tubac, an artists’ colony, to a specificshop displaying metal sculptures, and with a workshop in the back. On Day 4,Christopher said that the primary themes of his dreams were “suns, mirrors,LCDs, telescopes, Mount Olympus [after his 35 mm camera], airplanes, hangars, apitched propeller.” The site for the day was Kitt Peak National Observatory,situated on a mountaintop and housing the world’s largest solar telescope.Returning, we stopped for lunch at one of the only places available on thatmountain road—a general aviation airport, where we of course saw hangars; asdecoration, the airport restaurant featured prominently out front a largepitched propeller!The post-location information was extra—not part of the main experiment.However, it turned out that the “extra” information was also extra in the senseof being truly “extra-ordinary.” The late Carl Sagan was fond of saying,“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” Sagan’s slogan, which hasbecome one of the mantras of my Human Energy Systems Laboratory, occurred to meoften during those ten days.It turned out that there were degrees of extra-ordinariness in the findings fromthis ten-day experiment. The results every day proved extraordinary, but somedays proved to be beyond extraordinary; I want to share with you two inparticular—chosen partly because they are typical, partly because they areprofound, and partly because some of the story is playful.A REPRESENTATIVE DAY—FROM THE BORDER TO THE “SPIRIT OF GOD”Day 5 started with Christopher listing the highlights from his previous night’sdreams, informed by observations from his prior Day 5 dreams collected at hishome in May, June, and July.He had dreamed of men holding up traffic. This scene was set somewhere near aborder, he said, taking for granted it was the Mexican border, not far fromTucson. He also saw a large water or gas tank. He had dreamed of boats, manyboats, and of a car with four flat tires. He had written in his dream journalthat the car had no “oil” and then he added “mineral oil.” He also saw anembassy in London.He dreamed of tires piled high along a chain-link fence, and had drawn a pictureof the tires and fence in his diary. He dreamed of my needing to use a creditcard to get into a store or building. He also saw loads of umbrellas. Andsomething about the “Spirit of God.”As I listened to this jumbled laundry list of items, I wondered: would theenvelope, when it was opened, reveal that we were going to the Mexican town ofNogales—one of the twenty locations I had provided? It would fit many of thefundamentals in the dreams—men holding up traffic, border, water tanks, boats(people haul boats back and forth to Mexican beach towns), cars with flat tires,old tires along fences, umbrellas.After all the information was recorded, I called to say I was ready to know thelocation. Bill called back a few minutes later to announce, “Gary, you’re goingto ‘the old gem and mineral store.’”From the first, I had not expected Christopher to get anything right beyond afew lucky guesses. The previous four days had been eye openers—his predictionshad been remarkably on target. But it was too much to expect that winning streakto continue, and when I heard the location, it was clear that this fifth day wasgoing to break his string of home runs. I reviewed in my mind the thingsChristopher had described, and couldn’t come up with a single thing that wemight see at the gem and mineral store, or that we might see on the way there orback.Of course, I didn’t tell Christopher what I was thinking. Moreover, followingthe experimental protocol, I did not tell Christopher where we were going.Off we went. After about ten miles, as we passed an area of homes and a shoppingmall surrounded by multiarmed cacti reaching twenty or more feet in the air,Christopher called my attention to some men on a side street, holding uptraffic. He asked, “Are we near the Mexican border?”“No,” I told him. “We’re more than forty miles from the border.”“Are you sure?” he asked. “My dream was very specific that men would be holdingup cars near a border.”I said, “Christopher, trust me—the Mexican border is far from here.” But tohumor him, I maneuvered to see what was causing the tie-up. Workmen holding uptraffic are commonplace enough; I simply assumed that this was not evidential. Iwas wrong.We discovered there was construction work being done on the road. Beyond thework crew, I spotted a large water tank. And much to my amazement, the tank borea painted sign that read “Borderland.”Borderland! We were not near an actual border, but we had encountered the word,in large, hard-to-miss lettering. Was I stretching the evidence to make thedreams fit the circumstances? Quite possibly, I reminded myself.A bit farther on, a pickup truck went by us, pulling a boat on a trailer.Moments later we passed a boat storage yard. As I made a turn onto the street ofthe gem and mineral store, we saw eight more boats stored near the roadway.That’s a lot of boats in the desert, I thought to myself.We reached the gem and mineral store, and sitting on the right side of theparking lot, I am almost too embarrassed to admit, was a car with four flattires! I couldn’t believe it.Christopher got all excited. He screamed, “Gary, this is just like how I dreamtit. In my dream I was able to walk right up to the tires and touch them.” I tookpictures of Christopher touching the flat tires.Christopher had dreamed of some connection between the car and an embassy. Thecar with the flat tires turned out to be an old Rambler Ambassador. Embassy,ambassador. Another stretch? The car, obviously not driven for years, clearlyhad no oil—and obviously no “mineral” oil (though it was parked in front of agem and mineral store).But none of Christopher’s other items connected. We did not see tires piledalong a chain-link fence. I did not need a credit card to enter the store. Therewere no umbrellas at the location. And I did not see anything that suggested a“Spirit of God” connection.We returned to Christopher’s hotel and checked off what information in his dreamwas related to the journey and the location, and what was not. My expectationthat the gem and mineral store would not connect with any of his dream clues wasclearly wrong—he did much better than I expected. However, he obviously had notbeen perfect. The experiment was officially over for the day. But now is whenthe story gets even weirder. Yet it’s all true—it really happened, and it’srecorded on videotape.FINDING THE “SPIRIT OF GOD” AT COSTCO?I discovered that I was running out of videotapes for my mini DV camera, andChristopher was running out of them for his camera as well. I had one hour offree time before I was due at the laboratory, and suggested to Christopher thatI take him to a store where we could purchase videotapes in bulk. Ever flexible,Christopher said, “Sure, let’s go.”I took him to Costco, a huge discount store that typically sells products inlarge volume. To get in, I had to show my Costco membership card. Christophertried to claim another hit: “Look, Gary, just like my dream predicted—you need acredit card to get into a store!” I thought to myself, This is probably becausehe already mentioned that I would be using a credit card for this purpose, andit unconsciously affected my choice of where we would come to buy the tapes. Idismissed the observation as mere suggestion.As we were ready to leave, Christopher said, “Gary, I’m hungry. Can we getsomething to eat?” I explained that I had to get to an appointment at the lab,and we would have time only if we grabbed something quickly. Christopher said,“Sure, let’s eat here.” At the Costco fast food counter, I bought him a chickenand cheese sandwich, and I sat down with him to wait while he ate. And my worldturned upside down. Christopher pointed off to his right and said, “Look, Gary…” There, clear as day, were piles of tires placed along a chain-link fence,just as he had drawn them in his dream journal.I was wide-eyed. But there was more. He smiled and gestured all around us.Seemingly everywhere were large umbrellas. There we were, sitting inside a hugebuilding around plastic outdoor tables with huge shade umbrellas, at leastfifteen of them. I stared at these umbrellas in disbelief.And then I noticed that there was writing on the umbrellas. A company had seenfit to decorate them with advertising. What I read on those umbrellas that day Iwill remember for the rest of my life. The advertising was the slogan for HebrewNational hot dogs: “We answer to a Higher Authority.” And Christopher hadpredicted we would encounter something about the “Spirit of God.”Christopher’s dreams had told him not only that we would be visiting a placethat would have a car with four flat tires (an obviously highly specific andunique piece of information) and no oil, but that I would be taking us to astore requiring my (credit) card to enter. And that store had finally brought usface-to-face with “We answer to a Higher Authority.”Give me a break! My mind boggled in confusion and conflict; from theobservations, I began to understand what spiritual people mean when they say,“There are no coincidences.” How could Christopher know these things?A skeptic once said to the distinguished anthropologist Margaret Mead, “Theseare the kind of data I wouldn’t believe even if they were true!” I recalled thisphrase as I wondered what else could possibly happen in the remaining five daysof this experiment. What actually happened was beyond anything I could havepredicted.SUSY SMITHIt’s too coincidental to be accidental."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00006.gif]DISCOVERING INTELLIGENT DESIGN IN OUR LIVESA STUNNING CONCLUSION TO AN EXTRAORDINARY PSYCHIC EXPERIMENTThe question arises, was there convincing evidence for extraordinary“intelligent design” not only in conducting this unique precognitive experiment,but also in carefully arranging the seemingly random order of the locations tofit the detailed personal schedules of our complex lives? In other words, did a“higher authority” invisibly arrange the selection of the sites to fitChristopher’s personal schedule as well as Bill Simon’s and my professionalschedules?Was there a sophisticated yet discernable pattern to the arrangement of theentire experiment that somehow managed to coordinate our three respectiveschedules, even though the locations had been supposedly randomly arranged,first when I shuffled the envelopes, and again when Dr. Arynne Simon did?JUMPING TO DAY 9—OUR SCHEDULE FITS TOO WELLBill Simon wanted to meet Christopher, to see with his own eyes how theexperiment was being conducted. He wanted to make sure that there was nohanky-panky in the procedure—no deliberate or unintentional fraud beingperformed by Christopher or (even though he knows me and vows that he trusts myscientific integrity) by me. Since earlier in life he trained and worked brieflyas a magician, he might see something I had been missing. Bill decided to fly toTucson to witness Day 10 of the experiment firsthand.When I went to San Diego to work on a book with him, Bill or his wife, Arynne,picked me up at the airport. He asked me if I would be able to do the same forhim.I explained that it depended upon which location was revealed in the envelope tobe opened that day. If the location turned out to be close to the airport, Icould probably meet his flight. But if the location was far from the airport, Iwouldn’t have time.Only I knew what the twelve remaining locations were, and a number of them weretoo far away.On the morning of Day 9, I was with Christopher in his hotel, videotaping theinformation for the day. Christopher saw parking meters in his dreams. He saw alarge number of satellite dishes. He saw a woman being murdered later in theday, not far from where we were going. He also saw three people driving from anairport. He saw planes like “arrowheads” taking off and landing.As I heard this information, I was aware that parking meters, satellite dishes,and a woman being murdered could fit the town of Nogales, one of the remaininglocations. If so, then the three people he saw driving from the airport, and thearrowhead planes he saw landing (Tucson has a large Air Force base where small,dark, arrow-shaped fighter jets regularly take off and land), could notrepresent Christopher and me after we had picked up Bill at the Tucson airport:Nogales would be too far away.When the Day 9 envelope was opened, I learned that Christopher and I were notgoing to downtown Nogales, we were going to downtown Tucson—in fact, quite closeto Christopher’s hotel, and also not far from the airport. Hmm.We packed up our cameras. I drove Christopher to the edge of downtown Tucson. Iput money in a parking meter. Day 9 was the only day that had taken us to alocation with parking meters, and the only day that Christopher had dreamed of aparking meter. We walked about a block, and Christopher noticed a huge towerwith numerous satellite dishes. This was the only day where we saw an obviousand unavoidable array of satellite dishes, and the only day that Christopher haddreamed of multiple satellite dishes.We walked some more, and Christopher began to get frightened. He said he wantedto leave. I asked him why. He reminded me of his dream that later in the day, awoman would be killed not far from where we were walking. I asked, “Shouldn’t wecheck the newspapers to see if the murder has already occurred?” Christophersaid, “No. My dreams are quite specific on this point. Let’s get out of here.”We returned to Christopher’s hotel and, later, drove to the airport, watchedsome fighter jets land and take off, met Bill, and drove off—three peopledriving away from an airport, just as predicted.Next morning, which was Day 10, on the front page of the Tucson Citizen was astory of the tragic murder of a seventy-four-year-old woman that occurred lessthan two miles from where we had been walking. During the ten-day experiment,this was the only day that a murder had been reported on the front page of theTucson paper—and it was the only day for which Christopher had dreamed of amurder related to the experiment. Hmm.THE AHA MOMENT—THE CRITICAL TEST OF THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN/HIGHER AUTHORITYHYPOTHESISIf I recall correctly, it was on the way to the Tucson airport for Bill that Irealized the deep significance of the unfolding evidence from the ten-dayexperiment.Christopher had insisted from the first that this experiment involved more thanjust foreseeing the future, but held the potential of revealing the existence ofan extraordinary invisible intelligence and power in the universe that played afundamental role in the conduct of our lives.If so, then we should be able to discover that the experiment was invisibly andexquisitely designed from Day 1 through Day 10. It should be the case that theshuffling of the envelopes, first by me and then by the secret third person, wasactually orchestrated in a way that allowed for exquisite coordination ofmultiple people’s schedules—Christopher’s, Bill’s, and mine—over the course ofthe entire experiment.Then it hit me hard, and I literally could not breathe.I had not told Christopher that Day 10 turned out to be a special problem forme. In fact, there was no way that I could have known, ahead of time, that therewas a potential scheduling problem. It just so happened that Day 10 fell on aSaturday. On this particular Saturday I was scheduled to speak at a conferenceat the university’s medical school. I had to be at the medical school aroundnoon.I told Christopher this, and said, “If, as you believe, this whole experiment isintelligently designed and orchestrated by a higher authority, then tomorrow’slocation must be very close to the medical school for me to go with you to thelocation. However, if you are wrong, and the location turns out to be distant,Bill will have to take you to the site.”(Okay, there are also other alternatives: The hypothesized higher authoritymight have orchestrated that I would miss the lecture altogether. Or my missingthe lecture could have been caused by the fact that I was now worrying aboutwhether God was playing a mediating role in the experiment, and my worryingmight, for example, have led me to have a car accident. But an alternativeoutcome, if it happened, would not serve as convincing evidence that intelligentdesign was intimately involved in the orchestration of our schedules.)Christopher’s answer shook me to my core—and it still gives me goose bumpstoday. He said, with his charming British accent, “Gary, no problem. My dream inJune says that Day 10 will be over very quickly, and that I will spend most ofthe day by a swimming pool.”I challenged him because I found it hard to believe. In June, almost two monthsbefore I selected the locations or the start date of the experiment, his dreamsinformed him that Day 10 would be over quickly, and he would spend the day by apool? Christopher’s response was a simple, emphatic “Yes.” His dreams at timeswere fuzzy, symbolic, and suggestive; other times they were clear, literal, anddefinitive. According to Christopher, this particular June dream was crystalclear, absolutely literal, and completely definitive.I said, “If your June dream is correct, and the location is truly close to theuniversity, this will provide extraordinary evidence in support of theintelligent design/higher authority hypothesis.” Christopher said, “Gary, don’tworry. You’ll get to your lecture on time. My June dream says so.”I was not worried about getting to the medical school on time. I would be there,one way or another. What I was seriously worried about was the possibility thatChristopher might be right, and that the experiment would reveal compellingevidence for the existence of an awesome higher intelligence in the research,and by logical extension, in our personal lives.I did not sleep well that night. If Christopher’s dream, recorded in June, wascorrect, then scientific integrity would require that I interpret the totalityof the data from the experiment, conducted two months later in August, assupporting more than just precognition. The evidence would inexorably point tothe active existence of some kind of a higher power orchestration, in a researcheffort in which I myself was one of the leading actors in an unfolding play.DAY 10—ARRIVAL OF D DAYBill and I arrived at Christopher’s hotel at 9 A.M. He reviewed his Day 10dreams collected from May, June, and July, as well as from the previous night.The information was simple, straightforward, yet surprisingly confusing.He had seen trees, tall trees, and green grass, as in a London park.He had seen us crossing over a small stream. He had seen an Army ROTC-likebuilding. He repeated what he told me earlier—that this day would end veryearly, and that he would spend most of the time by the pool.I heard him say tall trees, green grass like a London Park. I heard him saystepping over a small stream. I heard him say an Army ROTC-like building. I cameto the comforting conclusion that only one of the twenty sites fit thisdescription. It was the Summerhaven area at the top of Mount Lemmon. And if thatwas the location, there was no way that I could take this journey and also be atthe medical school on time. The “Guiding-Organizing-Designing” hypothesis wouldnot be supported by the data. I assumed that Christopher must be wrong. Iexperienced momentary relief.The Day 10 envelope was finally opened. And I could not believe what I washearing: the location was not Summer haven but the Arizona State Museum—on thecampus of the University of Arizona. The museum was no more than six blocks fromChristopher’s hotel, and approximately six blocks from the medical school!I took a slow and deep breath. The proximity of the location fit the intelligentdesign/higher power hypothesis after all. But I could already tell that for thefirst time in the ten days, finally, we would find no connection betweenChristopher’s clues and the details of the location.We packed our cameras. I recalled that the west entrance to the university, theclosest entrance to the museum, was under construction. I decided to drive alongSixth Avenue, on the south side of the campus, and pulled into a parking lot acouple of blocks from the museum.At 9:30 A.M. the three of us were walking behind a row of buildings, includingthe Social and Behavioral Sciences Building, Centennial Hall, and ultimately themuseum. This is the oldest part of the university. As we walked along, I pointedout to the other two something I had never consciously paid attention to before:very tall trees.Christopher said, “Yes, they are tall, but they are not my trees. These are notthe trees I saw in my dreams.” We walked some more. I saw more tall trees, andagain pointed them out. “Yes,” Christopher said. “There are more tall trees herethan we have seen at the other nine locations. But these are not my trees, thetrees in my dreams.”One of the wonderful things about Christopher is that he is often veryconservative about “owning evidence.” Having worked with police and intelligenceagencies, he knows how important it is to be precise and conservative aboutthis. If the trees don’t fit, they don’t fit. It’s that simple.Finally, we got close to the back of the museum, and we entered an area that Ihad forgotten. Here, on a campus in the heart of the Arizona desert, is an areafilled with dense trees and green grass. (A conservative estimate is that maybeone one-thousandth of the land area in Tucson has extensive shade trees combinedwith thick grass, as here.)Christopher shouted in his exuberant, loose-cannon style, “These are my trees.This looks like a park in London.” It turned out this parklike setting wassituated next to a Tucson street called Park Avenue; another coincidence?We continued walking. We reached the construction area, where workmen werehosing down the street. There was a two-foot-wide stream of running water thathad to be crossed in order for us to approach the museum. We duly noted thepresence of the stream and the need to jump over it. Then we walked up the longset of steps to the museum.I simply had not thought of the possibility of what happened next: we found thatthe front door wouldn’t open. It was locked. Saturday—because of theconstruction, the museum was not keeping its usual Saturday hours.Our destination for the day was the museum; we were here but couldn’t go in. Itwas a little before 10 A.M., and Day 10 was over. Just like that. Finished. Thetruth is that, scientist or not, I was now shaken.I said to myself, This can’t be true. This can’t be happening. Bill wasperplexed. Christopher was euphoric. He would spend the rest of Day 10 by thepool, just as his June dream predicted.But it wasn’t over. As we walked back to my car, just before we entered theparking lot, the pièce de résistance occurred. Christopher pointed off to theright and said, “Gary, look at this building.” I looked up and saw anArmy/Navy/Air Force ROTC building. I shook some more.We returned to the hotel and reviewed the experimental observations in front ofa recording video camera, just as we had for the previous nine days. Therecording session ended at 11 A.M. Christopher had not only predicted ten out often locations correctly, but his dreams had included detailed information thatwent beyond the specific locations, addressing the complex coordination of ourpersonal schedules that seemingly defied all conventional reason and logic. Idrove to the medical school with plenty of time to ponder what these profoundfindings meant.How do we explain these data? Is it possible that an “invisible hand” wasplaying an incomprehensibly complex role in the orchestration of life—includingour personal lives?In fact, the evidence strongly implied that this superintelligent process wasplaying a deliberate guiding role in the design and conduct of the ten-dayexperiment itself.ARE THESE FINDINGS POSSIBLE?The truth is, as I review these events today, I still find them hard to believe.However, not only did all these events happen in front of me, they happened tome, as well. I was not only an open-minded observer of a complex, carefullydesigned experiment; I was an unsuspecting participant in a much largerunfolding play—an experimental play involving real science integrated with reallife.It’s worth remembering that just because something seems impossible it isn’tnecessarily so. Sometimes science provides compelling evidence that leads us tochange our beliefs about what we think is possible.There was a time, not too long ago, when most of the world’s population believedthat a round earth was impossible. Scientific evidence now says they were wrong.There was a time, also not too long ago, when most people believed that a roundearth revolving around the sun was impossible. Scientific evidence now says theywere wrong.There was a time in recent history when scientists believed that a masslessparticle or quantum of organized energy—contemporary physics’ concept of thephoton—was impossible. Again, scientific evidence now says they were wrong.Today, we live in a time when many people (particularly in science) believe thatan intelligently designed, evolving universe—one reflecting intelligenttrial-and-error learning as implied by findings from contemporary evolution—isimpossible. However, is new scientific evidence suggesting that we are wrongabout this, too?The late Susy Smith had a phrase for this. The author of thirty books onextraordinary phenomena—including precognitive dreams, survival ofconsciousness, and the existence of God—she asked me on many occasions whetherfindings such as these are “too coincidental to be accidental.”Science is a process of discovery, of learning through intelligent trial anderror, and of being open for surprises. The fact is, if I hadn’t believed in thepossibility that Christopher might be right, I would not have been open toseeing the surprising evidence that supported his stunning hypothesis. As YogiBerra quipped, “If I hadn’t believed it, I wouldn’t have seen it.”Let’s presume, just for the moment, that the findings from this parapsychologyexperiment, and the subsequent tests I have conducted with Christopher, arevalid. Let’s presume, just for the moment, that Christopher is a William James“white crow” who disproves the law that “all crows are black.” Follow me throughsome further experiments.Does the evidence point to the existence of an intelligent, experimenting G.O.D.process and intelligent evolution?The story continues."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00007.gif]SIMPLE G.O.D.

Some of the experiments about which you willread may make you laugh. A few are admittedly far out, but I assure you they alladdress the existence of a larger spiritual reality—a G.O.D., orGuiding-Organizing-Designing, field—in the universe as well as in our personallives. Scientists are typically “show me” people who thrive on conductingexperiments in order to observe results for themselves. I go beyond that: I am afirm advocate of the K.I.S.S. principle—Keep It Simple Science.People who have known me over many years will tell you I am a “show me” kind ofperson who, even as a youngster, had to see it to believe it. Though I was bornand raised in the New York area, I somehow identify with the state ofMissouri—the “Show Me” state—and I require being shown things in order tobelieve; my “beliefs” are evidence-based.There are two “show me” chapters in this book, which include descriptions of anumber of very simple yet definitive experiments in connection with the creationand evolution of the universe and of life. These experiments were designed toanswer the question of chance versus intelligent design and higher power. Youmight be motivated to perform these simple experiments yourself, or—evenbetter—with your children. In this complicated world, it’s wise to raisechildren to be skeptical of information tossed at them. We must rememberEinstein’s wisdom that “the important thing is not to stop questioning.”And so if you are skeptical about any of the information I put forward, Iencourage you to perform the experiments yourself. The findings generated inthese experiments changed me from the resistant skeptic I once was. In manyareas of science, business, law, and everyday life, most evidence allows us toreach conclusions that are “beyond a reasonable doubt.” However, the evidencefrom some of the experiments described in this book, including one seeminglyfrivolous yet serious experiment I hope you will perform yourself, allows us todraw conclusions that are virtually “beyond any doubt.”As you read, I suggest you keep in mind one important question. How can aseemingly frivolous question offer compelling evidence on a subject that hashaunted mankind from the earliest days?THE G.O.D. CONTAINER EXPERIMENTThe story begins almost forty years ago. I was a junior psychology major,chemistry minor, premedical student at Cornell University, on summer vacation inNew York City, and I was taken to a small shop in Greenwich Village thatspecialized in Native American and Eskimo art. It was the first time I sawcaptivating Native American sand paintings, and I fell in love with them.I purchased my first exquisite two-foot-by-two-foot sand painting from thisshop, and then began to collect others. When I eventually became a professor atYale, one wall in my study in Guilford, Connecticut, was covered with more thanten sand paintings. My first one still hangs in my Tucson study.Historically, medicine women and men drew secret sand paintings on the desertfloor. The sacred paintings revealed their fundamental spiritual beliefs, andthe carefully crafted sacred images were treated with care and awe. Originallysand paintings were made of multicolored grains that were carefully placed onthe desert ground. The sands were never glued to the ground—they were intendedto disappear with the wind. The images in the paintings available for purchaseare intentionally incomplete and inaccurate replicas of the ancient spiritualvisions. Obviously, the artworks available for purchase are glued to boards tosustain their fixed patterns.One day, while I was pondering the origin and evolution of order in theuniverse, I wondered: if the completely-chance-universe explanation is true,shouldn’t it be possible, at least in theory, to create organized, complex sandpaintings by simply throwing colored sand in the air?So I designed and conducted a K.I.S.S.—Keep It Simple Science—sand paintingexperiment.I took some white sand, placed it on the bottom of a pot, and then made a simplesand painting with various colored grains of sand. One of the images sometimespainted by Native Americans is frogs. Frogs make me smile. I carefully drippedgreen and yellow grains of sand and created a mediocre cartoonlike Kermit theFrog sand painting.I originally used a round metal spaghetti pot with a cover—a square cardboardbox with a cover works just as well. Even better is a clear plastic container soyou can see the evolving process as it occurs. After my crude sand painting wascompleted, I covered the pot, and shook it once, opened it, and looked at whathad happened to my cartoonlike Kermit. Then I re-covered the pot, shook itagain, and took another look. I did this over and over, recording what I sawwith each successive shaking. What do you think happened, over and over?To many people, experiments like my sand painting/shaking experiment might beviewed as a waste since any nincompoop knows in advance what the results willbe. So why would a credentialed scientist bother?The answer is that it is the very nature of science, just as we explain to thechildren that they are not to accept any conclusion just because it seemsobvious. To be accepted, an experiment must be repeatedly performed by reputablescientists who all reach the same conclusion, and that conclusion must becomeaccepted by the community of scientists. If that has not been done, then youperform the experiment yourself. I advise adults of all ages not to acceptexperimental results on faith despite the frequent temptations to do so. Iconduct research, not armchair speculation or wishful thinking. I encourage youto do a few experiments yourself.What I witnessed that day in the kitchen with my spaghetti pot was trulyelementary, and it happened every time. What transpired was that each time Ishook the pan, the sand mixed and the frog was no longer.The more I shook the pan, the more the sand mixed. In the absence of constraintsto maintain my original frog design, and in the absence of some sort of aGuiding, Organizing Designer taking a hand, the sand participated in a mostremarkable and beautiful process. The process is simple and completelyreplicable. The sand mixed. Blacks and whites, yellows and greens, whatevercolors of sand were present, they were all brought together. They became ablended mixture, a family of colors, so to speak. They became a complex yetfairly uniform (more on this later) mixture of different colors.Being a “show me” scientist, I insisted on replicating this experiment manytimes. Sometimes I began by creating an image of a frog, sometimes I began bywriting the word “frog.” Sometimes I drew a picture of a heart, sometimes Ibegan by writing the word “heart”—it didn’t matter. When I went through thesuccessive shaking of the pot, the result was always a blended mixture. Always.The sand always mixed, period. The conclusion is inexorable and unstoppable.In the absence of some sort of Guiding-Organizing-Designing process, sand mixes.It mixes every single time. Chance by itself does not create sand paintings.When given a shake, sand mixes. When mixed by wind, the sand images disappearand blow away.Though this outcome may seem obvious to you, I want to illustrate thesignificant take-home message of this experiment through my direct personalexperience.In my childhood and adolescence, over a time period of more than ten years, Iwalked upon thousands of miles of beaches. Growing up on the south shore of LongIsland, I loved the ocean. In all that time I never came upon a frog-shaped sandpainting, or any other Native American painting made of sand. I have lookedcarefully at thousands of pictures of beaches from around the world; I neverdiscovered a single sand painting. I have walked upon thousands of miles ofdesert, and never observed a single sand painting.In my university lectures, I have asked my undergraduate students at Harvard,Yale, and the University of Arizona if they have ever chanced upon a sandpainting, either on beaches or in the desert. Once again, not one ever reportedhaving seen spontaneous sand paintings.If “randomness” could indeed create sand paintings on beaches or on deserts—asthe completely-chance-universe hypothesis predicts—how come no one has everreported seeing a spontaneously created sand painting? Where are the sandpaintings?If chance cannot create simple sand paintings, then how can chance create anentire universe that is organized and evolving? It isn’t logical to attributeprofound organizing power to chance in the absence of any positive evidence. Theconclusion of the sand painting experiment for me is quite forthright and evensimple—and it is definitely one worth teaching to our children. It is no moreprobable that sand paintings will spontaneously, by chance, appear on a beach orin a desert than that they will spontaneously, by chance, appear in my spaghettipot—or in yours.This is a fact. Sand paintings never spontaneously occur, either in pots andpans or on beaches and in deserts. Again, if you are of a highly skepticalnature and unwilling to accept the logic of this, do the pots and pansexperiment yourself.If you happen to come upon a detailed, multicolored sand painting similar to theintricate two-foot-by-two-foot sand painting I purchased so many years ago inthat little Village shop, you will know for certain that some highly intelligentGuiding, Organizing Designer—or intelligence of another sort, such as a NativeAmerican artist—carefully put it there. When you fully understand the sandpainting experiment and its conclusions, you can know without any doubt that itwas not created by chance.FROM SAND PAINTINGS TO COMPLEX COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND DNAIf sand cannot arrange itself by chance, what do you think the probability is ofgetting the current complex version of the Windows operating system tospontaneously appear, by chance, in a PC, or a hugely more complex DNA moleculeto spontaneously form, by chance, in a cell?If, in the absence of a highly intelligent Guiding-Organizing-Designing process,what nature does is mix things, then what do you think will happen if we use thenumbers generated by carefully measuring the mixing of black and white grains ofsand, and use these resulting patterns of numbers to organize bits of 0’s and1’s in your PC? Or if we use these patterns of numbers to organize the fourbases that make up DNA molecules in your cells? Will we ever get a workingcomputer operating system, or a functioning human being?If the completely-chance-created-universe hypothesis predicts that workingoperating systems or organisms will appear by accident, yet simple experimentsdesigned to test the hypothesis reveal that, like sand paintings, real-lifeworking operating systems or organisms never spontaneously appear by chance,then something is seriously wrong with any current explanation of how chanceworks.Chance is not a highly efficient way to create useful computer programs or fornature to create living organisms. In truth, it’s an impossible way.SEARCHING FOR THE CORRECT EXPLANATIONSo is there an explanation for the fact that millions or billions of monkeys,given millions or billions of years, could not create your computer’s operatingsystems or your personal DNA, let alone create a sand painting by throwing sandin the air?When chance alone cannot even write the word “chance” in the sand, how can asmall group of vocal scientists and skeptics, like Richard Dawkins, Ph.D., andMichael Shermer, Ph.D., claim that the profound organization and complexityobserved in the universe can occur by chance? These people claim that chanceplayed a critical role in creating everything from subatomic microstructures tosuperclusters of galaxies, and all things in between, including humans. Why?Simply assuming that after trillions and trillions of random trials, order inthe universe can occur by chance does not fit with the obvious experimentalevidence indicating that carefully created sand paintings, when allowed to doso, mix 100 percent of the time and are never replaced by new sand paintings.In fairness to mainstream scientists, the generally accepted conceptual modelthey employ to explain the origin and evolution of order in the universe is abit more complex: the model assumes that chance is combined with physical lawsand chemical laws that limit and guide the ordering process. For example,Dawkins writes in his book The Blind Watchmaker that evolution is a gradual,step-by-step process of transformation “from simple beginnings, from primordialentities sufficiently simple to have come into existence by chance.” He furtherconcludes that the subsequent evolution of biological organisms is presumed tobe guided by “natural selection” and “self-organization,” combined with “randommutations and variations” of DNA. However, their bottom line is still that thefoundation of the evolution of the universe implies the operation of chance,since it presumes intelligence was not involved in the creation and organizationof the fundamental physical and chemical laws that supposedly limit and guidethe creation and organization of “primordial entities” as well as complexmaterial systems—both nonliving and living.I do not wish to criticize either my former teachers or my contemporarycolleagues. And I certainly do not intend to be mean-spirited. Until I saw thelesson of the sand painting experiments, I perceived things just as Dawkins andShermer did. I was one of them.I was once a young scientist who learned the well-accepted explanations andpredictions regarding the primacy of chance and randomness from my distinguishedIvy League professors, and then passed along their seemingly logical conclusionsto my students. Honestly and with integrity, I gave my students the explanationsmy professors gave to me. When I began teaching at Harvard, I did not know thatsome of these fundamental explanations were seriously in error, and that I wasinnocently and inadvertently promoting mistakenly accepted knowledge.However, after my sand painting experiments at Yale, I realized that there wassomething seriously wrong with the foundation of the underlying logic of thechance-universe explanation—because the logic I was taught simply didn’t matchthe experimental evidence. The theory didn’t fit the facts. The reasoning didnot fit the observations. I came to realize that something somewhere was clearlyin error. And I again began to question the conclusions of the scientists whohad been my wonderful mentors.IS THE WATCHMAKER BLIND, OR IS IT WE WHO ARE BLIND TO THE WATCHMAKER?Does unbridled chance really occur in the universe? Can the evolving universe aswe experience it at this moment in history, including the laws of physics andchemistry, really have occurred by chance?Or is it necessary for us to logically deduce the existence of some sort ofsuperintelligent Guiding-Organizing-Designing process at every level of nature,from the micro to the macro? Do separate Guiding-Organizing-Designing processesexist in nature, or are they all an expression of one universal G.O.D. process?Is this what is implicitly meant by the Great Spirit, the Living Source, orsimply, “God”? Is this what we mean by higher purpose, higher intelligence, andhigher power? Is this what a larger spiritual reality means?When I met Christopher Robinson and saw how far the “too coincidental to beaccidental” process could be taken—literally, all the way to the orchestratedcoordination of our personal lives, and beyond—I was shaken to my core.As you will read in Part Four of this book, the explanation for the existence ofsome sort of an intelligent G.O.D. process is actually easier to grasp than itis to learn how to make a complex Native American sand painting, or for thatmatter to even learn how to fold your shirts.As everyone knows, throwing ten shirts in the air never results in the shirtsspontaneously coming down neatly folded, one shirt on top of the other. Iunderscore “never.” If you doubt this, do the experiment. Being a “show me”scientist, I tested the hypothesis and actually threw my shirts in the air. Whatcame down, every time, was more or less a mess. Actually it was always a mess, abig one.If you still doubt the generality of this conclusion, take Lincoln Logs andthrow them in the air. Do they ever spontaneously make a log cabin? The answeris: never. Try throwing the pieces of a Lego set in the air. Do they ever comedown and spontaneously make a dump truck, or a robot? The answer is: never. Takethe pieces of a mechanical watch—the gears and springs and screws and hands—andthrow the pieces in the air. Do they ever come down assembled as a workingtimepiece? The answer is: never.If the intelligent G.O.D. process explanation is correct, then Dawkins’suniversal watchmaker—from his book The Blind Watchmaker—is not blind at all. Inhis book Dawkins, who is Oxford-based, describes evolution as a blind,nonintelligent, yet creative (as in unpredictable) process where predefineddesigns are found. The subtitle of his book sets forth his “nonintelligent”theory: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design.But despite being winner of a Los Angeles Times Book Prize and receiving theRoyal Society of Literature’s Heinemann Prize, Dawkins got it wrong; hisconclusions, though beautifully written, are backwards. It is we who are blindto the watchmaker.It’s time for those who adhere to the chance theory to remove their blinders,open their eyes, and celebrate the exquisite ability of humans to observepurpose, intelligence, power, order, and evolution in the universe.And if you are wondering about so-called natural selection and self-organizationin nature, I encourage you to keep reading—and be prepared for aparadigm-changing surprise.HEINZ PAGELSThe final story of randomness—utter chaos—has not yet been told to us by themathematicians. It seems remarkable that something so fundamental forprobability theory has not been defined and even more remarkable that we can goso far in mathematics lacking a definition. By simply assuming randomnessexists, mathematicians assign elementary probabilities to events, and that istheir starting point. But they have not captured chaos and looked it in the eye."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00009.gif]G.O.D. IN THE COMPUTERHOW YOUR PERSONAL COMPUTER CAN TEACH YOU ABOUT GODHome computers operating at gigahertz processing speeds are performing billionsof calculations per second. It is possible to conduct complex mathematicalexperiments on personal computers and process the data more rapidly than everbefore. Sometimes the evidence from these modeling experiments is so replicablethat a researcher can draw conclusions that are virtually beyond any doubt.And now I will share with you how your personal computer can be used to supportthe discovery that chance is not a plausible explanation for the origin andevolution of complex orders in the universe. By complex orders I mean, forexample, the patterns of billions of chemicals called bases organized in DNA, orthe patterns of billions of stars organized in spiral galaxies.As you will soon see, you can use a home computer to conclude definitively thateven randomness itself does not occur by chance. And if randomness does notoccur by chance, then it’s time for us to understand these three things: (1) whyrandomness is incorrectly described as “disorder” or “completeunpredictability,” (2) how randomness really functions, and (3) what role itplays in the intelligent G.O.D. process universe.In the following pages, we will be looking randomness “in the eye,” as thedistinguished physicist Heinz Pagels put it. Perhaps, if I am convincing enough,you will have the courage to see randomness and chance from an entirely newvantage point. The computer experiments I will describe use simplearithmetic—nothing more than addition and division—and are very easy tounderstand. I promise you will be able to follow the reasoning even if you areshy of math or science.People turn to the computer to take the drudgery out of calculating the millionsof simple additions and divisions that until the middle of the twentieth centuryhad to be done slowly and painstakingly with pencil and paper. Contemporarydigital calculators and computers perform arithmetic operations with absoluteaccuracy and in less time than it takes for a heart to beat.I am about to show you that when numbers are arranged with the conditionsnecessary for “randomness” to occur, we see a predictable order every singletime. The order—actually termed a random order—is absolutely normal and is notrandom at all.In other words, when the precise conditions for producing randomness are createdin a computer, a completely normal and 100 percent replicable order emerges thatcan be seen with the naked eye.Now is the time to see randomness “with new eyes,” as Marcel Proust would say,and have fun in the process. (But if you are still, despite my reassurances, putoff by computers and arithmetic, you can decide to accept this conclusion astrue, skip this section, and jump ahead to Part Three.)HOW RANDOMNESS CREATES NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONSThere are many computer operations in which we need to have a number—or manynumbers—selected at random. One leading example is encryption programs,including the kind that protect your credit card number as it speeds along theWeb to the online merchant you’re buying from. Computers can select numbersrandomly using so-called random number generators. The computer can selectnumbers in a seemingly unpredictable manner.For example, if we instruct the computer to pick a number between 1 and 100,there is no way to predict ahead of time the precise number it will pick. Thecomputer is just as likely to pick 1, 2, 3, or 4 as it is to pick 97, 98, 99, or100.If the computer happens to pick the number 1, for example, and then we ask thecomputer to pick a number from 1 to 100 again, it is just as likely to pick thenumber 1 again as it is to pick any of the other ninety-nine possible numbers.This is because each calculation is set up to be independent of the previouscalculation. The process of selecting any number from 1 to 100 can be performedhundreds, thousands, or millions of times—almost completely independently andunpredictably.I say “almost” because digital computers only approximate true randomness.Theoretically, true randomness—more precisely, what is termed randomsampling—requires complete independence from calculation to calculation. If eachand every calculation is not performed completely independently, true randomnesscannot occur.Suspend belief for the moment to consider that the computer approximatescomplete independence and say that you can program the computer to select arange of possible numbers completely randomly. Let’s say you ask the computer toselect a number from 1 to 100 randomly, and to do that a hundred times in a row.The computer can be programmed to calculate the average of these randomlyselected numbers (add the hundred selections together and divide the sum by100), and to save the resulting average. And you can program the computer torepeat this process over and over.It’s important to understand why we are calculating the average of the randomlyselected numbers in order to discover the true order in randomness. Since thecomputer in this experiment is programmed to select the numbers from 1 to 100randomly, it is extremely improbable that it will select, by chance, any singlenumber 100 percent of the time. Instead, out of a hundred numbers selected,approximately half the time it will select numbers that are less than 50, andthe other half of the time it will select numbers that are greater than 50. Thismeans that the average of the hundred selections should tend to be around 50. Ifyou have any background in math or the sciences, you’re still with me. And evenif you don’t, I hope you’ll make the effort to follow the reasoning.Now, since the selection process is random, sometimes there will be more numbersselected that are above 50. This will tend to push the average of the hundredselections above 50. Sometimes there will be more numbers selected that arebelow 50. This will tend to push the average of the hundred selections below 50.However, we can expect, by chance, that the average of a hundred randomselections will most frequently be around 50.An average in any one run of, say, 45 or 49, or 51 or 55, isn’t particularlyunusual. But as you move further away from 50 in either direction, there is lessand less chance of that average number occurring. In the two experimentsperformed and graphed below, none of the averages reached below 40 or above 60.Notice that the average of a hundred randomly selected numbers will almost neverbe 1, because this would mean that the computer had selected the number 1 everysingle time. Conversely, the average of a hundred randomly selected numbers willalmost never be 100, because this would mean that the computer had selected thenumber 100 every single time.In the two experiments I present below, I asked the computer to (1) selectrandomly any number from 1 to 100, (2) repeat the selection a hundred times, (3)calculate the average of these hundred selections, (4) save the average, (5)repeat these four steps a hundred times, and (6) plot the results.Image [../images/00010.gif]Chart 1. Bell-shaped, “normal” distribution of a hundred averages of sets of onehundred numbers randomly selected from 1 to 100.Chart 1 plots the distribution of the one hundred averages that were calculatedand saved by the computer. These are real averages. The possible averages,ranging from 1 to 100 in steps of 2, are indicated on the horizontal axis. Thenumber of averages that were actually calculated between 48 and 50, 50 and 52,52 and 54, and so forth (termed “number of observations”), is plotted as bars.When the computer generated the one hundred separate averages, and thencalculated the grand average of the averages—in other words, the average of allof them—the grand average turned out to be 49.9898, which is virtually 50.The lowest single average was 44.5512, and the highest single average was57.0632. The distribution of averages approximates what is called a bellcurve—with a bell shape that mathematicians and scientists refer to as a“normal” curve.Notice that the actual distribution is not a perfect bell-shaped curve, butapproximates a bell-shaped curve. If instead of performing only a hundredaverages, we had performed five hundred averages, the resulting curve would havelooked more perfect.For comparison, I had the computer repeat the experiment and plot the findingsfrom a replication experiment; see Chart 2.The new graph is virtually the same as the previous one. The precisedistribution of the bars has changed somewhat (the tallest peak is at 54 forChart 1, and 46 for Chart 2), but the pattern is very similar. When the computergenerated the average of the averages for this experiment, the grand average ofall of them was 49.8558—again virtually 50. The lowest single average this timewas 42.9938, and the highest single average was 56.4059. The distribution againapproximates the bell-shaped curve.Consider: If we have the computer repeat this process, again and again, what doyou think we will observe? Will we ever see a pattern of bars that averages 30,with a range from 20 to 60? Or will we ever see a pattern of bars that averages70, with a range from 50 to 90? As you probably guess or assume, the answer tothat question turns out to be no. What we will see, more or less precisely, iswhat I have twice graphed here. The average turns out to be virtually 50, with arange from 42 to 58. Numbers selected entirely at random, if you select enoughof them, always have an average that is exactly in the middle of the range.Image [../images/00011.gif]Chart 2. Results of a second test of a hundred averages of sets of one hundrednumbers randomly selected from 1 to 100.Here again, you need not take what I’m saying on faith. I certainly did not cometo this conclusion on faith. I insisted upon seeing experimental evidence withmy own eyes. You’re welcome to do the same. Only after repeating this experimenthundreds of times did I come to evidence-based faith in the completereplicability of randomness.I originally did this experiment as a professor at Yale University over twentyyears ago, using an Apple II computer with a miniscule (by today’s standards)64,000 bytes of memory. I programmed the arithmetic using an elementary computerlanguage called BASIC. I had the computer automatically plot the resultingdistribution of bars all day long, and print the results to my Epson dot matrixcomputer. Graphs 1 and 2 were generated at the University of Arizona a few yearsago on a Hewlett-Packard Pentium III PC with 128 million bytes of memory. I usedStatistica for Windows software to perform the arithmetic. The computer took buta few seconds to perform all the calculations for a given experiment and plotthe graph on a high-speed laser printer. Were I to repeat the calculations now,I would be using my current office machine, a Dell Pentium IV PC with 512million bytes of memory. The calculations for a given experiment would take buta fraction of a second.However, whether I performed the calculations for a given experiment by hand(which would take many hundreds of hours), or with my old Apple II computer(which took approximately ten minutes), or using my blazingly fast new desktopcomputer (which would calculate almost as fast as I can hit the Enter key), thepattern of results wouldn’t change—because the findings are 100 percentreplicable: The average of the bars per experiment will be approximately 50.Every single time. In other words, since randomness was generatedmathematically, and the experimental conditions allow randomness to occur everytime, an overall normal distribution was obtained every time. Moreover, thepattern of the bars was always bell-shaped. The pattern was never square, oroval, or inverted, or a straight line. The pattern was a bell-shaped order,period.So what does this mean?When one purposely sets up the precise conditions that allow randomness tooccur, in the absence of a specific Guiding-Organizing-Designing process—forexample, if there is no intervention by the invisible hand of a G.O.D.process—what we observe is a completely replicated random order which isexpressed as a bell-shaped curve. The appearance of a bell-shaped curve by arandom-number-generating computer is as replicable as throwing your laundry upin the air and having it come down in a messy, unfolded pile.Notice that this computer program never generates an average of the averagesthat would indicate that the same few numbers were picked again and again, orthat the same number was picked every single time. An average of 5 would requirethat most of the numbers selected were below 10; an average of 95 would requirethat most of the numbers selected were above 90. An average of 1, for example,or an average of 100 would require every single number selected to be a 1 in theformer case or 100 in the latter.So if the circumstances are set up so that numbers are selected completelyrandomly, the resulting pattern always averages out to the bell-shaped curve.And the more observations that we make, the more perfect the bell-shaped curvebecomes.If we accept the evidence, the conclusion is obvious. In the absence of aGuiding-Organizing-Designing process, the material world mixes (Chapter 3) andthe mathematical world creates a normal distribution, as we have just seen.In a word, there is something profoundly orderly about randomness. When wedesign the computer modeling experiments properly, we can even see this orderwith the naked eye.DEEP QUESTION: HOW DO WE KNOW IF A SEQUENCE IS RANDOM?In Heinz Pagels’s brilliant book The Cosmic Code: Quantum Physics as theLanguage of Nature, the chapter titled “Randomness” led me to realize somethingprofoundly disturbing about our arrogant tendency to label sequences of numberswe cannot understand as random or disordered.Pagels, a gifted physicist, was trained at Princeton University and served as aprofessor at Rockefeller University. In his chapter on randomness, he explainshow randomness is an interpretation that seems to be true but may in fact notbe. In one place, he writes:This example illustrates that what we may think is a random number reallyisn’t—it is related to other numbers which are specified by a simple rule. Howcan you be sure a number is truly random? You can’t—the most you can do isestablish the number is not random if it fails one test for randomness.And elsewhere, equally wise and empirically correct:A remarkable feature of “random” numbers—numbers that pass all the tests—is thattwo such numbers may be related to one another in a nonrandom way.What this means is that even though the complete series of numbers may appear topass all known mathematical tests for randomness, subsets of the numbers in thecomplete series can be easily discovered to be nonrandom.How do we know for sure, then, if the series of numbers is random?Let’s consider something we are all familiar with—music—and see what we canlearn about whether music is random.SING A SONG OF ORDER AND RANDOMNESSWhile still in high school and college, I worked as a professional musician andconsidered a career in music. So it may be natural for me to identify aconnection between music and the question of randomness.We begin with a question: how is it determined if a given sequence of numbers israndom?Chart 3 shows a combination of numbers from 1 to 6 that are plotted as asequence of bars over time. I remember feeling delighted when the insightunderlying this curve first came to me.Image [../images/00012.gif]Chart 3. Numbers from 1 to 6 arranged in a particular sequence.When I teach this principle to students, I usually plot this sequence on theblackboard and ask the students what it looks like. Some say it looks like theNew York City skyline. Some say it’s shaped like a mountain outside Tucson. Myphysiology colleagues say it’s shaped like a sweat-gland response. Peoplesometimes say that, tilted on its side, it looks like a nose or a female breast.It is certainly a familiar shape. But where precisely did the sequence ofnumbers 1155665044332210 come from? Is it random?The answer is, this is the actual sequence of numbers that specifies the tune ofthe children’s song “Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are.”Everyone knows that the “Twinkle, twinkle” melody is a simple, ordered set ofnotes. Its temporal sequence—that is, the order looked at on a time basis, onenote following another—is obviously not disordered. It would fail very simpletests of randomness.Now, imagine what would happen if we changed the order of the notes? Would the“Twinkle, twinkle” melody disappear? Of course. However, would it become anothermelody? Depends upon what you consider to be melody.Let’s take the “Twinkle, twinkle” numbers and analyze them as we did the randomselection of numbers at the beginning of this chapter. When I place the1155665044332210 sequence of numbers into my statistics package, and display thenumbers in terms of their average and histogram (distribution of numbers), Chart4 shows what I get.First, when we mix the sequence of numbers and calculate the average, wecompletely lose the melody. When we calculate an average and plot thedistribution, we lose the temporal pattern—the melody, the order over time—thatdefines “Twinkle, twinkle.”What we learn is that “Twinkle, twinkle” has a mean of 3.0000 whose lowest valueis 0 and whose highest value is 6. There are two 0’s, three 1’s, two 3’s, two4’s, three 5’s, and two 6’s. If the distribution were normal, the curve wouldlook bell-shaped, as the expected normal shows. Obviously this distribution ofnumbers does not look normal.Now, what happens if we change the order of the “Twinkle, twinkle” numbers?Instead of allowing it to be 1155665044332210, we allow it to be5136040521623541. This sequence looks random. And it certainly does not soundlike music to our ears—at least as we define music. The plot is shown in Chart5. When you look at the pattern, it’s obviously very different from “Twinkle,twinkle.” Remember, this graph contains the identical number of integers; onlythe arrangement of the sequence of the integers over time is different.Image [../images/00013.gif]Chart 4. Distribution of? Twinkle, twinkle? numbers.Now, what happens when we obtain the average and distribution of these numbers?What do we see?What we see, obviously, is the identical average and distribution as before—asin Chart 4. This is because when we calculate the average and the distributionof the integers, the result is not influenced by the temporal order that may bein the data.In other words, just because the mean of two distributions may be precisely3.0000 and have the same shape, this does not mean that the temporal order ofthe actual numbers comprising the sequence is identical. In fact, temporal ordergets lost when we analyze the data this way.For the record, I do not want to lose the music—I want to discover the melodiesand harmonies and celebrate them. I still think of myself as a musician, andtherefore I am very sensitive to sequences of notes/numbers over time. If themusic is there, I want to hear it. I want to hum the melody. And even dance toit if possible.Image [../images/00014.gif]Chart 5. Numbers 1 to 6 from Chart 3, arranged as a different sequence overtime.TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE PI?—IS PI TRULY RANDOM?One of the great unsolved mysteries in contemporary mathematics is the sequenceof digits of the famous (and some say sacred) number pi.Pi is a remarkable number. It is, on the one hand, so simple—it is thecircumference of a circle divided by its radius. One might think that it shouldbe easy to calculate the number pi, but in reality this is not true.Supercomputers have been used to calculate the division of the circumference ofa circle by its radius to hundreds of thousands of digits, and no one has beenable to discover what the precise order is. No one has discovered a replicablepattern to the sequence. The pattern of integers appears random to the moststringent mathematical tests.And yet, the precise sequence of pi’s numbers is 100 percent replicable. Eachand every time a mathematician computes the division comprising pi (using agiven calculation procedure), the sequence of numbers comes out to be identical.The sequence is replicated, over and over.Of course, the sequence of numbers when 7 is divided by 4, or 11 is divided by3, is also 100 percent replicable. However, with these ratios, it is possiblefor mathematicians to discover that the pattern or sequence of the resultingintegers is not random. What is special about ratios such as pi is that itspattern or sequence of resulting integers has defied the brightestmathematicians and supercomputers from discovering any apparent order to thesequence.When scientists observe a pattern of data that replicates over and over, theycome to the conclusion that the probability of obtaining such data by chance isvirtually impossible. How can such a random order occur by chance if the orderemerges the same way every time and therefore defies chance?There are two choices facing us—we can conclude that patterns can be random eventhough they are replicable, or we can conclude that what we typically label asrandomness can sometimes reflect a level of organized complexity that is beyondour current ability to describe mathematically.When patterns in nature are discovered that replicate over and over, scientistsslowly but surely persist until they come to understand the rules that governthe order. For example, when Newton observed that little apples and big applesfall to the ground at the same rate, he persisted until he could arrive at aconclusion about the nature of gravity.SUMMING UPWhat has been revealed about randomness in this chapter?That randomness does not occur by chance. And that randomness produced by randomsampling requires events to be completely independent of one another. We havelearned that when events are independent—as modeled by random number generatorsin modern computers—the resulting distributions of averaged numbers are anythingbut random. We also learned that the selection process creates a preciselyorganized distribution of averages that is considered to be the normal,bell-shaped curve.The evidence of a replicated bell-shaped curve demonstrates that all potentialorders do not spontaneously occur when randomness is allowed to operate blindly.Simply stated, the empirical evidence from experimental computer modeling isinconsistent with the commonsense prediction.By inferring randomness from the temporal (time-based) sequence—as illustratedby “Twinkle, twinkle, little star”—it became clear that sequences of numbers canreflect intelligently created patterns. I believe it’s vital that scientistslearn humility when patterns and sequences appear too complex for them to bespecified mathematically.We also learned in this chapter that statistical methods used to calculateaverages and distributions, though helpful, pay a severe price when it comes torevealing ordered patterns of numbers over time. In particular, the mysteriousnumber pi is especially telling because its complex sequence of numbers defiesdescription (and is therefore labeled as random or disordered) even though thepattern of digits (the order) is completely replicated each time it iscalculated.So weve seen in the previous chapter that sand does not spontaneously make sandpaintings—it mixes—and in this chapter that randomness does not make multiplemelodies: it makes bell-shaped curves.WHAT THIS MEANSOrder does not occur by chance—but neither does randomness. The logic becomesinexorable. The conclusion becomes inescapable. If complex orders do not occurby chance—the clear take-home message from this chapter—and we discoverreplicable evidence of complex orders (be they in sand paintings or in sequencesof numbers we experience as melodies and harmonies), then we can’t logicallydraw the conclusion that the replicated orders could have occurred by chancealone. Chance per se is no longer a plausible explanation for the existence oforder. It’s that simple.Since we have ruled out the “chance” explanation, we therefore must consider analternative. When I learned what you now know, I proposed that the mostplausible alternative explanation for the incontrovertible evidence of theexistence of complex and evolving orders in nature and the universe—whether theprocess is small or large, visible or invisible—is the presence of what I havecome to call the Guiding-Organizing-Designing process. In the language ofphysics, this implies the existence of a universal “field”—includinggravitational and magnetic fields—that functions as a formative process andprovides intelligent guidance, organization, and creative design.Given this logic, I wondered what would happen if I allowed myself to accept thefact that some sort of universal G.O.D. process exists in the universe?What would happen if I suspended my doubt and requested information from theG.O.D. process? What if I asked the G.O.D. process from the bottom of my heartas I ask for help from my closest friends?Could I contact G.O.D.?Could we communicate?Could I understand the communication?And could I ultimately build a relationship? The experiments now become highlypersonal."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00015.gif]CAN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH G.O.D.?A reluctant scientist asks the universe a seemingly trivial question andreceives a superficially silly but ultimately profound answer that shakes him tohis core.

Since I am personally part of the process—as are you—is itpossible that I can personally discover what this intelligent process is, atleast to some degree?I can’t know unless I ask. And you can’t know until you ask, either. We musteach be willing to ask if we are to receive.A WORD OF CAUTIONThe problem is, it’s easy to fool ourselves. In fact, as a species we aremasters at this. Psychologists are trained to understand the many tricks thehuman mind can play on itself, including the creation of:Illusory correlates—when we imagine relationships that do not existSelf-deceptions—when we deceive ourselves and ignore evidence that contradictsour beliefsConfirmation biases—when we mistakenly find support for the things we believemust be trueFalse memories—when we inaccurately remember details of something that happened,or think we remember something that did not actually happenThe list of what psychologists call “cognitive distortions” is extensive and theresearch literature keeps expanding within the areas of cognitive and socialpsychology.Not surprisingly, psychologists are among the most conservative of scientistswhen it comes to openness about what might be termed “anomalous”communication—meaning communication that deviates from what is believed to bepossible or what is expected. This is especially true of purported communicationwith spirits—precisely because scientists know how easy it is to be fooled byone’s own mind.And the same holds true for the highly skeptical attitude of many psychologiststoward the G.O.D. process.I was fortunate to have received excellent training in cognitive biases anddistortions in my graduate education as a research psychologist, including anespecially valuable graduate course in psychopathology with Professor LorenChapman. It was Chapman who, while at the University of Wisconsin, discoveredand coined the term “illusory correlate phenomenon.” And I was blessed to haveProfessor Robert Rosenthal, the father of research on “experimenter effects”(inadvertent experimenter errors), on my dissertation committee at Harvard.For these reasons, I’m vastly more mindful than the average person, and evenconsiderably more aware than the average scientist, when it comes tounderstanding the need to be extremely cautious about collecting andinterpreting psychological data, especially data provided from one’s own mindand from one’s own subjective experience.I was also proficiently trained as a clinical psychologist at Harvard. I learnedabout schizophrenia and hallucinations, mania and delusions,multiple-personality disorder, and dissociation. I deeply respect the pressingneed to be vigilant for the possibility of psychopathology, especially when itcomes to the claim that someone, including myself, is having “conversations withthe universe.”So why am I about to commit to print some of my initial personal experiments inattempting to communicate with the hypothesized G.O.D. process?There are three reasons:Reason 1. As indicated in places earlier in this book, there is good scientificreason for predicting that communicating with a G.O.D. process is plausible. Ifit is theoretically plausible, and if it is supported by experimental evidence,it is important to acknowledge these facts.Reason 2. As long as the information obtained is received with caution andhumility—with full awareness of the limitations of my mind, including myinherent capacity to fool myself—it is possible, in principle, to obtainmeaningful and even accurate information.Reason 3. Evidence for a genuine spiritual reality is currently being observedand documented by contemporary research on survival of consciousness. Some ofthese findings are covered in my previous books, The Afterlife Experiments andThe Truth about “Medium.” So, in principle it seems, all people have thepotential to explore a larger spiritual reality. Therefore as a professionalscientist I am obliged to be among the pioneers and the explorers. It is alwaysvaluable for a scientist to be a subject in his own research. Ultimately thereis no substitute for direct experience.Before describing my efforts, I first want to review the plausibility ofcommunicating with “the Source,” and to show the way systems science predictsnot only that this is plausible but that it is probable.IS THE “ALL” WITHIN THE “SMALL”?—AN INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEMS SCIENCEThe branch of science known as systems science teaches that there is a universalprinciple of the micro (the little) being contained within the macro (the big).This is because systems are composed of smaller parts (termed subsystems) andare simultaneously components of larger units (suprasystems).For example, in multicelled organisms (which are one type of a system),individual cells (tiny subsystems) are contained within the body (which comparedin size to individual cells can be huge, especially when the body containstrillions of cells). And individual organisms are part of larger suprasystems,from families to ecosystems and beyond.The subsystem/system/suprasystem organizational structure extends from subatomicparticles to the universe as a whole. Stated simply, the Small is in the All.However, systems science also teaches us the less obvious fact that the reversecan also be true—the All is in the Small. This is not only semantically true—theword “all” is literally in “small”—but it is organizationally and empiricallytrue, too.In the case of the body, for example, every cell is nourished by the blood; theenergy, and all the chemicals and other materials within the body, are mixedwithin this living liquid to various degrees. And this goes further; it’s notjust materials and energy that are carried by the blood. Bioelectromagneticinformation and energy signals—generated by every cell and carried bybioelectromagnetic fields—also circulate in the bloodstream, by means of what istermed “volume conduction.” The resulting info-energy-material mixture, the“whole” of the blood—which contains the All of the body—is continuouslycirculated back to every cell within the body. This realization is similar tothe concept of the hologram, where the All (the holo) is optically embeddedwithin the Small.The word “mixture” here may remind you of our earlier discussion in Part II.Recall what happens when a selective organizing process is not operative, andthings simply mix. In physics this is called the Second Law of Thermodynamics.Systems science suggests the possibility that a higher purpose exists for thesecond law in an intelligently designed, evolving universe: that it has thepurpose of fostering a universal mixing process which operates at every level.And the reasoning is straightforward. Universal mixing insures that sharing,interconnecting, and creating of wholes occurs at all levels in the universe.Simply stated, universal mixing insures not only that the All will continue toexist (in the Small) at all levels, but that it will continue to evolve at alllevels as well.“AS BELOW, SO ABOVE”Another well-known phrase, “As above, so below,” proposes that patterns existingat macro levels can also be observed at more micro levels. In religious termsthis is usually interpreted to mean that what happens in “heaven” can happen onearth, a supposed phenomenon sometimes called “heaven on earth.”What systems science teaches is that the reverse can also be true: “As below, soabove.” When I first read James G. Miller’s book Living Systems, I was led toponder the intimate relationship between life on earth (the Small and below) andthe universe as a whole (the All and above).However, even after my first attempt to conduct a personal exploratoryexperiment testing the All-in-the-Small hypothesis by attempting to communicatewith the universe (confessed in the next chapter), I didn’t allow my mind toexplore this possibility seriously until I moved to the University of Arizona.There I would soon meet a courageous undergraduate student, Sabrina Geoffrion,who saw a significant connection between my explanation of systems science andher personal vision of an evolving Source in an evolving spiritual universe.Sabrina had been encouraged to think big. At that time both her parents workedat the University of Arizona—her mother as professor and head of the artdepartment, her father as associate vice president for research. Though hermother and father were academically conservative, they were intellectually openand loving people. They encouraged Sabrina to fearlessly and openly explore herown mind and they inspired her to dream.As a result, Sabrina put forth the possibilities based on this starting point:Assume systems science predicts that what we are calling the G.O.D. process isthe macro system. Then according to contemporary physics, all people would beintimately connected with the macro system (that is, “God”) to varying degrees.The logic comes from basic physics. All physical objects—from atoms andchemicals, through organisms and planets, including solar systems andgalaxies—are interconnected in various degrees by electromagnetic fields (aswell as gravitational fields). Since all this information—interconnected andcommunicated by invisible fields—is circulating throughout the universe, we areall to some extent sharing the same information. This is a simple way tounderstand what is sometimes called the holographic universe.Sabrina proposed that our challenge as individuals, and as a species, was tolearn how to receive and interpret this wealth of circulating information andassociated energy. Physics tells us that the info-energy field connections areall there, waiting to be processed and actualized.I found her logic convincing and compelling.ON NOT BEING AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS WITH HUMILITY: THE BLACK BOX STORYSoon I would become brave enough to ask the universe a deeply personal andmeaningful question. My mind needed courage. Then I remembered my days as ayoung graduate student when I had been told a visionary story that had remainedin the shadows of my mind.The story was told to me in 1967 by Stephen Krietzman, now a Ph.D., but then ayoung graduate student in nutritional biochemistry at MIT, in a discussion wewere having about the philosophy of science.I have recalled Stephen’s story many times and it has often sparked wonderfulconversations. Over the years there were times I told it to students andcolleagues; this is the first time I have put my memory of it into print.STEPHEN’S STORYA black box fell out of the sky and landed somewhere in the Southwest of theUnited States. It produced a crater of enormous proportions. The governmentimmediately dispatched investigators to the scene. They fenced off the craterand kept everyone away, save the military and some key scientists andpoliticians.Headlines screamed, “What Could the Black Box Be?” Leading researchers wereasked to examine it.First came the physicists, and they did what physicists do: they measured thetemperature of the box, bombarded it with subatomic particles, and attempted toreach a conclusion by studying its physical structure.But try as they might, they could make no sense out of the data they retrieved.The box remained a complete mystery.Next came the chemists. They did what chemists do. They measured its chemicalcomposition and poured various liquids on it, including strong acids and bases.But try as they might, they could make no sense of the box, which had a chemicalstructure unlike any they had ever encountered. They left the site withoutgiving any answer.Along came the biologists, and they did what biologists do. They searched forsigns of biological life, attaching surface electrodes and measuring oxygenconsumption, and recording electromagnetic fields, a process similar torecording electrocardiograms and brain waves. But try as they might, they couldmake no sense of the signals they observed. The box, they said, did not appearto have anything measurable that looked like DNA or cells.Finally, as a last resort, the officials in charge of the investigationreluctantly allowed a psychologist—we shall call her Dr. Smith—to see the box.She pulled up a chair, sat down, took out a pencil and paper, and then addressedthe box in a warm and friendly manner.She said, “Hi. My name is Dr. Smith, and I would very much like to speak withyou.”She paused, and then gently said, “What’s your name?”And the box replied, “Harry.”When I first heard this story, more than thirty-five years ago, it brought asmile to my lips. I remember being clear at the time about the deep lesson thissimple story offered: that scientists and laymen alike—all of us—must be open toasking all kinds of questions, even seemingly silly and obvious ones, if we aregoing to learn and grow.I believe that people must stay gutsy enough to ask questions that some mightjudge stupid or frivolous. My personal view is that there are no stupidquestions, only uninformed ones—which is the reason we ask questions in thefirst place: to become informed.I have tried over the years to apply the black box philosophy to my laboratoryresearch. However, it’s one thing to ask questions as a scientist in alaboratory at the university and quite another to do it in the laboratory ofone’s own mind.A few years ago, an even more profound lesson from the black box story came tome. I realized that the behavior and communication skills of Dr. Smith weredifferent from those of the other scientists. She asked her questions aspsychologists are taught to do—without judgment and in a warm and friendlymanner. She put the box “at ease.” And she shared something of herself beforeshe asked the box to share in turn. In other words, she gave first, and then sheasked to be given. And she implicitly invited the box to answer. In fact,clinical psychologists are often taught to use—especially with shy or frightenedchildren—phrases such as “Would you like to tell me your name?”So, like Dr. Smith, I decided to treat the universe as a black box in a crater,and invite it to give me an answer to my questions. As a clinical psychologistthis is what I automatically did when I decided to ask the universe a question.And this may be part of the reason that the universe responded.ANONYMOUSBe careful what you ask for."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00017.gif]I ASKED THE UNIVERSE A QUESTIONG.O.D. IS REVEALED IN THE HIDDEN DETAILSSometimes things are better left unsaid.The exploratory experiment I am about to relate is frankly risky to share—riskynot simply because I was open to asking the universe a question, but because thedetails of the answer I received put pressure on us all to take the idea ofactually communicating with a G.O.D. process seriously.And since it is my personal conviction that scientists are no different fromother folks, then I have a responsibility to walk the talk. If scientists take aparticular idea seriously, they are obligated to consider exploring it not onlyin the laboratory but, whenever possible and appropriate, in their personallives as well. And if I obtain evidence that supports a controversialconclusion, I have the responsibility to share the evidence and my laboratoryconclusions in such a way that people can reach their own decision about whatthe objective findings mean. As a media pundit would say, “Give them the factswithout a spin.”I HATED THE WORD “GOD”Having already learned the lesson of sand paintings and the mathematics ofcomputerized randomized distributions, it was clear to me that there was more tothe universe than the science of the day seemed to allow.I mentioned my interest in a Guiding-Organizing-Designing process to anundergraduate student at Yale who suggested that I might benefit from reading abook about the history of religions. I had no formal training in religion. As achild I had spent some time attending Jewish services but not understanding theHebrew, and with friends attending Catholic services but not understanding theLatin. Although I traveled extensively, the Bibles in hotel rooms were neveropened by me. I did not allow my curiosity to extend to things that I didn’tknow how to prove, and so I knew less than most of my friends about the originor evolution of religious thought and practice. But I would learn, and althoughI forget now the name of my student who recommended religious studies to me, Iam beholden to whoever she was.This same undergraduate recommended that I read Huston Smith’s classic TheReligions of Man. As I always try to follow suggestions—from teachers andfrequently from students (who often are my best teachers)—I soon purchased acopy of Dr. Smith’s book (no relation to the Dr. Smith of the black box andcrater story) and stoically read every word. Reading this book not onlytransformed my consciousness, but prodded me to do something that I consideredto be quite unexpected—at least at the time.It’s difficult to read Smith’s book and not walk away with a profound sense ofawe and wonderment for the men and women throughout recorded history who haveattempted to understand and experience the greater universe in which we live.These so-called prophets, seers, and mystics were friendly to the idea ofreceiving information from the universe.If they could receive purportedly meaningful information from the Great Spirit,Yahweh, God, Allah, I wondered, should I try, too? Should I try this great“thought experiment”?I knew that Einstein had taken a ride in his mind with a light beam, and thisexperience led him on the path to discover the theory of relativity. Inspired bymy hero, I had taken a ride in my mind with an electron, and this experience ledme on the path to discover the theory of systemic memory described in mycoauthored book The Living Energy Universe.I wondered, should I try a personal experiment with the Source? What if I askedthe universe a personally meaningful question? Would I receive an answer thatwas significant? Would it be evidential?It was approximately 3 A.M. in Guilford, Connecticut. The year was 1986, theseason was winter, and it felt as cold as Connecticut winters ever get. Mybedroom was as black as I imagined a coal mine would be. If the moon was out Icould not see even a sliver of light. It was too dark for shadows and too coldto ponder the mysteries of life. I huddled deeper under the blankets.Though by day I lived the scheduled life of a tweed-jacketed Yaleprofessor—teaching my courses, directing the Yale Psychophysiology Center, andcodirecting the Yale Behavioral Medicine Clinic—at night I would stare at thestars and crave understanding of the organizing process of the All.What happened that one dark, shivering night, plainly and simply, was that Igave up all pretenses of being critical—meaning judgmental. I, so to speak,surrendered to the All and genuinely asked the universe for help.Raised as an orthodox agnostic (not meaning one who finds it impossible to knowGod but rather meaning questioning or wondering about everything, includingGod), I had never prayed, and this was the first time that I consciously choseto communicate with the universe. What I did that night was an adventure, and Ithought of it as taking a ride in my mind.I remembered the black box and decided to treat the universe in the same waythat the fictional psychologist Dr. Smith had treated the black box. I wasprepared to be open, honest, and kind.MY AMUSING CONVERSATION WITH THE UNIVERSECompletely still in bed, I silently in my head introduced myself to theuniverse. I shared my name and offered a brief history of who I was.I then in my mind reviewed with the universe my experiments with sand paintingsand computer modeling, and my deep awareness of the need to acknowledge theexistence of some sort of Guiding-Organizing-Designing process in the universe(which at the time I called a Grand Organizing Designing process). I explainedthat I was a systems scientist who appreciated that “the All was in the small.”And I confessed that I knew, theoretically, that it was possible to receiveinformation and energy from the universe in the form of communication.However, I confessed that it was difficult for me to imagine communicating witha universal organizing process because I hated the word “God.” I said in mymind: Universe—I have this problem. I hate the word “God.” I explained that Iwas conditioned from the time I was a young boy to think that God was a man witha long white beard and a cane who killed people with germs and bugs (which theBible renamed as plagues).I explained that my conditioned response was of “God” not only havingthreatened, cajoled, and punished people, but even having allowed Jesus to beverbally and physically tortured, and ultimately executed. (As an adult, I hadcome to understand that there were many other ancient as well as contemporaryvisions of the Source that seemed to me more mature and enlightened—but that’sanother story.)The problem was that I had been well conditioned—like Pavlov’s dog salivating tothe bell—so that the word “God” evoked a negative emotional reflex. I explainedas effectively as I could that these perceptions were preventing me fromaccepting and exploring a more enlightened vision of universal creative andcaring intelligence.Having now confessed my spiritual problem to the universe, I then asked it forhelp. I humbly said in my mind, Universe, can you help me? Can you give meanother name for God?Be careful what you ask for …Immediately—and I mean immediately—a name literally popped into my head. Thename was not at all what I expected. What I heard was the name “Sam.”Sam! I said to myself, and started to laugh. I knew this was foolish, and triedto reassure myself.I thought, I finally build up the courage to ask the universe for another namefor God. What happens instead is that I end up like a character in a Woody Allenmovie.However, for reasons I did not understand then (but do now), I was moved to getout of bed, to go to my study, and pull out my favorite dictionary, the huge oldunabridged version of Webster’s second edition. I was compelled to look up themeaning of the word “Sam.” It is, of course, short for “Samuel.” Sam wasn’tlisted except as a cross-reference to Samuel. I vaguely recalled that Samuel wasone of the books of the Bible, but I had no idea what the name meant, or even ifit had a meaning. To say I was shocked is putting it mildly. For a “show me”person, what I was shown that dark night shocked me to my core; I was not evenaware of the cold floor or the fact that it had been snowing. The origin of theword “Samuel” was beyond my imagination, my intellectual smarts—beyond belief.Before I read that dictionary, I had no idea. Moreover, my informal questioningof hundreds of individuals over more than fifteen years since then is that mostpeople have no idea, either; not even many religious Jews know what the nameSamuel means or where it comes from.According to the dictionary, the name Samuel originally comes from the HebrewShemuel, which means literally “name of God.”Think about this. I asked the universe for another name for God, and I hadreceived a seemingly innocent, common name—Sam. But it was a word that actuallymeans “name of God.”Being the incorrigible skeptical scientific person that I am, I considered everypossible alternative hypothesis I could imagine. And I came up with elevenpossible explanations for my hearing the name Sam.HYPOTHESIS 1—AS A JEWISH BOY I LEARNED THE MEANING AND HEARD THE NAME SAMUEL INCONNECTION WITH GOD.Had I heard this information about Sam previously when I went to synagogues forservices as a Jewish child?At age thirteen, I was bar mitzvahed in a determinedly Reform temple. What thismeant was that I was required to learn by rote and memorize the sounds ofHebrew. However, I was not taught what the sounds meant. So I never understoodHebrew, nor did I have Bible studies to memorize. I did not know the meaning ofSamuel though I was born Jewish.HYPOTHESIS 2—I LEARNED IT IN CATHOLIC CHURCH.Had I learned this information when I went to Catholic Church with friends as ateenager? I was raised in a Christian community on Long Island, and when I wentwith my Italian friends to Catholic services, the services were mostly in Latin.Though I studied Latin for two years in high school, I was never much of alanguage student. I had no idea what was being said in those church services,and save for Lux et Veritas (“Light and Truth,” Yale’s motto), I know virtuallyno Latin today. It seemed unlikely that I learned the meaning of the Hebrew wordshemuel while listening to a Catholic mass in Latin. None of the Christianpeople I’ve asked over the years has known the answer to the question “What isthe root meaning of the name Sam?”HYPOTHESIS 3—I LEARNED IT IN THE RELIGIONS OF MAN.Had I learned the meaning of Samuel while reading The Religions of Man?Fortunately Smith’s book had a good index, so I carefully searched under bothSamuel and shemuel. Samuel was in the index, referring to that portion of theBible. However, there was no mention of shemuel nor any mention of Samuel being“name of God” in the index or anywhere else in this great book.HYPOTHESIS 4—IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE.Is the root meaning of the word “Sam” common knowledge? To address thishypothesis initially, I went around the Yale campus and asked students, faculty,and staff, “Do you know the meaning of the word ‘Sam’”? Only one student out ofhundreds knew, and his father happened to be an Orthodox rabbi. I concluded thatthe origin and meaning of Sam is not common knowledge.HYPOTHESIS 5—IT IS A COMMON ASSOCIATION.Had I guessed the name because it is a common association for God?In principle, this could be the case. However, when I asked Yale students,faculty, and staff whether they could they give me another name for God, do youthink even one person came up with the name Sam? Yale had started as a divinityschool; perhaps someone I might have encountered in the early days would haveknown. But not at that time. “Sam” is definitely not a commonly used substitutefor “God.”HYPOTHESIS 6—IT IS A FAVORITE NAME OF MINE.Did I have a favorite cousin named Sam, a close friend named Sam, a pet namedSam, or a deep affection for Uncle Sam of the United States? None of these werepart of my favorites. Nor was I afraid of being drafted.HYPOTHESIS 7—IT IS A FAVORITE SONG OF MINE.Having been a professional musician for ten years, I had played and performedmany hundreds of songs. I racked my brain trying to find a song that had thename Sam in it. The only song that I could remember that contained the name was“I’m Henry the Eighth, I am.” One line said, “And every one was aHenry—Henry—she never had a Willie or a Sam.” No, the favorite song hypothesiswas not highly probable.HYPOTHESIS 8—I HAD READ IT IN THE DICTIONARY BEFORE.Could I have come across the meaning of the word “Sam” while thumbing throughthe dictionary some forgotten day in the recent past? In theory this waspossible, but highly improbable. I do, on occasion, notice a nearby word whenlooking up something else in the dictionary, but I had never looked up orstopped to notice the meaning of a common name before, or since. This was ruledout, too.HYPOTHESIS 9—IT WAS JUST A LUCKY GUESS.Was this just a lucky guess? A fluke? Something that happened by chance alone?The answer is, “As an abstract possibility, of course.” However, what is theprobability that I would guess this by chance alone? The probability isobviously extraordinarily small.HYPOTHESIS 10—I READ SOMEONE’S MIND TELEPATHICALLY.Had I somehow unconsciously read the mind of an Orthodox rabbi or Jewishscholar, living or deceased? Had I somehow read from what Jung termed the mindof the collective unconscious? Had I somehow retrieved the memory frommorphologic fields in the quantum vacuum of space, as posited by RupertSheldrake in his book The Presence of the Past? If the evidence fromcontemporary parapsychological research is to be taken seriously, then we mustentertain some version of a mind-reading hypothesis. However, as far as I haveever been aware, I have little skill for reading people’s minds, of this worldor the next.HYPOTHESIS 11—BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ASK FOR.Had I received a specific answer to my question from the universe? Had “small”me received a specific communication from the “All,” either outside of me orinside of me, or both? I realized that what happened to me on that fateful nightwas potentially significant not simply because I had received an answer to mystrange question, but that the meaning of the specific answer I received couldbe verified.It is sometimes said that “God is in the details” (though you may have heard itas “the devil is in the details”). Had I not been moved to get up and go pullout my unabridged dictionary, I would never have discovered the potentiallyevidential nature of what I had received.I was now faced with a series of questions to answer. Was there more going onhere than simple information retrieval? Was the G.O.D. process (aka Sam)listening to one conflicted scientist (me) who was genuinely searching for a newname for “God”? Did the G.O.D. process understand that I required verifiableevidence if I was going to take the information seriously? Did the G.O.D.process appreciate my experimental nature, and did it have an experimentalnature too? Did the G.O.D. process play some role in prodding me to get out ofbed in the middle of the night and look up the meaning of “Sam” in thedictionary? Did the G.O.D. process recognize that I had an active (and at timessilly) sense of humor and would appreciate receiving this particular historicname for “God”?Needless to say, there is no way from this single self-experiment to determinewhat the correct explanation is. The obvious solution was for me to conduct moreresearch—to replicate the conditions, first with me as a subject, and then withothers.Do you think I was about to conduct a second experiment? The truth was, I wasafraid, and you may wonder what I was afraid of. Was I afraid I was going crazy?Frankly, this thought did cross my mind. But I was well aware that this excusewould be an easy way out.I was fortunate to know personally some of the best psychiatrists in the countryat the time, and I even consulted a few of them about my secret exploratoryexperiment. I explained the circumstances and what I experienced. The generalconsensus was that although I was quite stressed by the experience, myexploratory experiment and attempts to understand it did not mean that Irequired any psychological help.But I was more afraid that the G.O.D. process might be true. If a G.O.D. processreally existed, then I would not only have to change my agnostic approach tolife (meaning questioning everything, especially the reality of God) but wouldalso have to face the consternation of my strong atheist colleagues (whorepresented the majority of the psychology and science faculty).However, the greatest fear of all was the possibility that I might actually becommunicating with some sort of intelligent G.O.D. process, one from whichspecific information could be obtained that was evidential. This would meanthat, in principle, it might be possible for me not only to demonstrate theexistence of a universal intelligent Guiding-Organizing-Designing process, butthat it might be possible—might even be likely—that I would be able todemonstrate scientifically that the G.O.D. process could personally interactwith people on earth—including you.Such a conclusion would go beyond Einstein’s impersonal God that “does not playdice with the universe.” This “Experimenting G.O.D.” process not only waspersonal and intelligent, but appeared to have a clever sense of humor!I would like to state again that the year was 1986 and I was director of theYale Psychophysiology Center and had research grants from the National ScienceFoundation and the National Institute of Mental Health. I was codirector of theYale Behavioral Medicine Clinic and saw psychiatric patients one day a week. Ifaced an anxiety-ridden dilemma: could I fill out an application to theuniversity’s Human Subjects Committee to request permission to conductexperimental research on communicating with “God”?A WISE DECISIONMy decision was simple. I would not touch this question at this time with aten-foot pole—nor with a hundred-and-ten-foot pole. In fact, I was not going toask another question of the universe, period. My career would not be put into atailspin by a Sam or Harry or Professor Huston Smith. Case closed. I even trieddrugs for a while.However, that was then; this is now. And the motto of my laboratory at theUniversity of Arizona is “If it is real, it will be revealed; if it is fake,we’ll find the mistake.” Time is on my side and the time is right for realinformation. After all, we’re living in the Information Age—it’s 2006 and theworld is genuinely open to receiving information. And coincidentally Atria Books(my publisher) has published Tomorrow’s God: Our Greatest Spiritual Challenge byNeale Donald Walsch. If the G.O.D. process or Sam is within reach, then it is upto me and to all of us—including you—to be brave enough, and humble enough, toask questions and receive information.It’s been said that if we are not part of the solution, then we are part of theproblem. This principle may extend systematically, from the Small to the All.FROM JAMES TAYLOR, “UP ER MEI,” ON THE ALBUM HOURGLASSWe were walking in paradise,Never did notice.Blind in the Buddha land,Looking for solace.We had been told of a place,Far beyond this vale of tears.We could never have guessed,We were already blessed.There we were, where we are,In the garden."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00018.gif]I ASKED THE UNIVERSE MORE QUESTIONSTHE ANSWER SPARKLES LIKE A DIAMONDI have quietly and privately conducted numerous exploratory experiments on thistopic in the privacy of my home, on mountaintops, in hotel rooms at scientificmeetings, at spas and resorts, but I have yet to initiate a formal universityresearch program on the topic of “asking the universe questions.” This willrequire human consent forms and Internal Review Board endorsement. But the timewill soon come.It was almost a decade after my original Sam conversation at Yale when I feltthe need to initiate asking the universe some questions again. And to myastonishment, again I received answers. (Incidentally, I sometimes refer to theuniverse as “universe,” sometimes as “Samuel,” and sometimes affectionately as“Sam,” which is non-gender-specific, since it could mean “Samantha.” It doesn’tseem to make a difference. Answers come to me so long as I am genuine, Isurrender, I am open, I am humble and nonjudgmental.)There was always the possibility that my experience with hearing the “Sam” was aonetime occurrence, and therefore was coincidental, as in unrepeatable. Thatturned out not to be the case. Recently it has become essential to me to revealthe truth. But that doesn’t mean it’s my responsibility to share every shred ofevidence I have received over the years. Between the constraints of space and,sometimes, in respect for people’s privacy, I include in these pages only what Ideem to be appropriate. As Professor William James put it, there is wisdom inknowing what to overlook.Late one afternoon while writing this book, I reminded myself that shortly afterChristopher Robinson and I had completed the “Ten Days in Arizona” experiment,he confessed to me that he personally saw the greater purpose of our experimentas a “search for God.” I wondered at the time if Sam had sent Christopher to mein answer to my continued quest for tangible evidence of G.O.D.THE MEANING OF THE DIAMONDAlongside my OfficeJet printer in my home office as I write these words sits aspecial piece of Tiffany cut glass that is the size of an apple but shaped likea diamond. It’s one of those paperweights that is impossible to miss and brings“ah’s” from visitors. When the OfficeJet prints, my Tiffany “diamond” wigglesand its facets reflect light in various directions. While waiting for words tocome to mind I sometimes gaze at this fine glass object, and often, when thelight comes in at sharp angles, I see many colors in each of the facets. Andoften the rainbow of light within my paperweight takes my thoughts back to thatastounding conversation I had with Sam and the remarkable confirmation thatoccurred the next morning. Now I need only look at my Tiffany glass diamond toget a feeling of being in touch with the universe.I purchased my Tiffany glass diamond a few months after I received a surprisingand special answer to my unanticipated question of the universe. It was April2001 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I had been invited to give two addresses ata conference on the science of consciousness. One of my talks was to be on TheLiving Energy Universe; the other would be on The Afterlife Experiments.When I finished the Living Energy Universe talk, to an enthusiasticstanding-room-only crowd, a rush of people wanted my personal attention; theyhad come to the podium to probe more deeply into the topics of my talks. A tallblond woman, whose sharp bone structure was matched in beauty by her intense andvital energy, raised her voice to be heard. “Do you really believe what you’vetold us? Are you saying there’s really a living energy universe? And do youreally believe in survival of consciousness after death?”I told the woman that as a scientist, what I would be willing to say at thatpoint in time was that “when all of the data are considered, the simplest—andmost parsimonious—explanation that accounts for the largest amount of the datais the one I gave in my talk.” Then I told her in an equally clear and loudvoice that I did agree with survival of consciousness after death as a viablehypothesis.She was not yet satisfied, and pressed on. “But do you believe? What do youpersonally feel?”Believe? Feel? Scientists are not supposed to believe or feel our way toconclusions. What science is supposed to do is question, investigate, andevaluate alternative hypotheses. Scientists are taught to base conclusions onfacts and research but not on feelings or belief systems, which should not bebrought into the laboratory.I suggested to her that we put off the conversation to another time, so I couldanswer other questions. But I was troubled by her challenge and the fact that Ihad set her curiosity aside.AN ANSWER FROM SAMI realized that I had been haunted by the mystery woman’s question of whetheranyone can know scientifically that information and energy truly exist asinvisible fields in the “vacuum” of space, as well as the “vacuum” thatcomprises matter. Quantum field physics tells us, in no uncertain terms, thatmatter is mostly empty space that is organized by invisible fields.Returning from the speech I carried back with a responsible weight twoheavy-duty questions. Does science know that informational and energetic fieldsplay a fundamental role in shaping all things, great and small? And is acreative, intelligently organizing field process involved in the manifestationof all things? These were questions I had been pondering the previous night.So, in the privacy of my hotel room, I decided to raise these questions with theuniverse. In a state of complete surrender and openness, prepared to hearwhatever popped into my head, I asked Sam one question.“How do I know, and how can I prove, that external organizing forces, mediatedby invisible fields, play a role in the creation of all things, includingphysical matter?” In everyday language this means “How do I know that you(G.O.D.) are real?”Scientists don’t typically seek proof but depend on collected data and thendetermine whether the data are consistent or inconsistent with the hypotheses.But I wanted more. I wanted to know what to believe, and I wanted to know how toreach a decision.What I heard from the universe, as before, came as a stunning surprise. In fact,it shook me to my core. I heard, “Remember the diamond.” Three simple words—buta serious answer that was another mystery to be solved.For the record, I didn’t own a diamond ring and had no intention at that time ofbuying one, not for myself, not for any lady friend. The idea of diamonds couldnot have been further from my conscious mind when I asked the universe thequestion. So I repeated the words, a reply that was a question. “Remember thediamond?”As I spoke those words, three sets of visionary images flashed through my mind.The first was the fact that diamonds do not simply appear out of nowhere. Thecreation of one of these precious stones requires (1) extensive pressure (2)from the outside (3) for long periods of time (4) to collapse carbon into thesupersolid state called a diamond. In my mind I experienced the carbon beingorganized through the external forces upon it. I felt myself, so to speak,becoming a diamond in the rough.Take-Home-Message One: Patterns of outside force are required to give birth tothe diamond in the first place.The second image that came to me was of a diamond cutter planning to sculpt theraw diamond into a sparkling gem. The diamond’s potential to reflect lightdeserves the term “awesome.” However, a visionary and skilled diamond cuttertakes a rough diamond and reveals its inherent potential for beauty. Diamondsstand alone in their combined magnificence and resilience. Mentally Iexperienced three things simultaneously—the rough diamond, from its ownperspective, being turned into something spectacular … the diamond cutter, fromhis perspective, seeing his vision manifest through his hands … and an invisibleoutside intelligence smiling at this remarkable creative process (from Sam’sperspective?).Take-Home-Message Two: Humans, using external force, continue the organizingprocess through deliberate planning and design. Moreover, this planning anddesign process is potentially co-creative with an invisible intelligence.The third image that came to me was of a scientific satellite, the CosmicBackground Explorer (COBE) telescope, floating in space, taking pictures of thebackground radiation—infrared patterns of light at very low temperature, presenteverywhere in the universe. The COBE telescope was a stupendous humanachievement of innovation, planning, design, and implementation.What the COBE telescope revealed was that the background radiation of theuniverse is not random. The background radiation, purportedly 12 billion or moreyears old, was supposedly created shortly after the birth of the universe—theevent that has been playfully termed the Big Bang. The background radiation isactually composed of photons—massless particles of light that are invisible tothe naked eye but are detectable and ultimately displayable by means of moderntechnology. These ancient photons were clearly organized, expressing a patternthat is more than 12 billion years old (the exact age is debated). Do you knowwhat the detector is made of that reveals these 12-billion-year-old organizedphotons? The answer is, the diamond.In my mind I literally experienced myself in space. I was both inside the COBEtelescope, inside the diamond detectors, and outside the telescope as well,witnessing the map of the background radiation present throughout the universe.Take-Home-Message Three: The diamond reveals patterns of organized creation—inthe “vacuum of space”—that go back to the beginning of time as we know it.I trust you can sense the depth of awe and wonder I experienced when those threesets of images flashed through my mind: first the formation of the roughdiamond, then the diamond being carved, and finally the use of the diamond toreveal the invisible order of the background radiation some 12 or more billionyears old. The combined process literally took my breath away.I said to myself, I must remember the diamond. I was struck by the thought thatthe diamond could serve as a symbol for an intelligentGuiding-Organizing-Designing process that potentially existed since thebeginning of time. Let me not forget to include here what I later learned—thatancient religions viewed the diamond as a fundamental expression of “God.”I decided that night that someday I would purchase a real diamond to remind meof my special symbol as well as this momentous experience.I reasoned: if I can believe in the reality of diamonds, and what they reveal,then I can believe in the existence of an organizing universe that containsintelligent, dynamic, evolving fields of energy. And in the process, I realizedthat I had an answer to the blond woman’s question. Yes, even as a scientist,the time had come when I could believe and say so without apology.The next morning, on the way to another of the conference presentations, Iencountered the same woman, and once again she challenged me: “Well, Dr.Schwartz, do you believe?” But the answer I gave was not one I had planned orexpected. My answer was one I would never have predicted. I looked furtivelyaround, like a character on Law and Order, and determined that we could not beoverheard. I was about to give her an answer that I had received to a question Ihad asked of Sam the previous evening.THE UNBELIEVABLE IDENTITY OF THE MYSTERY WOMANThough I was not prepared to meet her so soon (if ever), I was ready with ananswer to her question.Needless to say, I was not about to tell her how the answer came to me, norwould I share the phrase “Remember the diamond” and how I was given it as asymbol for my answer.I again explained to her that scientists are not supposed to believe. We aresupposed to experiment, to investigate. However, I did admit that there mustcome a point in time when even a scientist has enough logic, data, and directpersonal experience—the holy trinity of learning—be able to reach a firmconclusion.Knowledge is like a three-legged stool—one leg is logic and reasoning, one legis data and experimentation, and one leg is intuition and experience. When allthree legs are present, science can stand on a knowledge stool that is wellbalanced and firm.She listened carefully to my explanation that from this vantage point, I couldhonestly say that I believed in a living energy universe (from the title of mybook that describes how energy and information express the fundamentalproperties of life). I was now prepared to definitively conclude that someversion of the theory was true—including survival of consciousness after deathand a G.O.D. process.She smiled. And then she told me that her name was Barbara, that she lived inNew York with her husband, and that he had come with her to the conference.While we were talking, the woman’s husband joined us. She introduced him to meas Bruce Winston and I said, “Hello.” The Winston name did not sparkle in mymind—not yet.She said, “You’re aware that Bruce is very well known, but he doesn’t like totalk about it.”I confessed that I did not recognize the name.Barbara said, “Bruce is Harry Winston’s son.”I admitted that I was still in the dark.Barbara looked at me with amazement. She said, “You don’t know that name? HarryWinston was one of the largest and most successful diamond dealers in the world.In fact, he was the man who donated the Hope diamond to the Smithsonian.”Diamonds, again!In the back of my mind was the memory that Sam had said I should “Remember thediamond.” And also that I had just decided to purchase a small diamond ringsomeday to wear as a reminder. Now I had met the son of one of the mostsuccessful diamond designers and dealers in the world. At that moment I didn’tclassify these events as a coincidence. I felt as if I had been assaulted by theevents and the experience—of Sam, diamond, and Winston. And, as well, by my openexpression of my belief.I did not say anything immediately to the Winstons about the remarkablesynchronicity of all this. However, after Bruce left, I decided that maybe Ishould confess the “Remember the diamond” secret to Barbara. I explained how herpersistent questioning the day before had challenged me. I described theunplanned conversation with the universe that night (but did not tell her aboutSam). And I shared the three images that came to me when I heard the phrase“Remember the diamond.” Barbara was touched. She told me that when I was readyto purchase a diamond ring, I should purchase it through Bruce.But as you already know, I subsequently did purchase a diamond—albeit acut-glass one at Tiffany’s rather than a pricey, pure white cut diamond in apinky ring. My “hope” diamond paperweight reminds me not only to “Remember thediamond.” It reminds me of the larger meaning and context preceding andfollowing my surprise conversation with the universe: that the evidence for theexistence of an experimenting G.O.D. process exists everywhere—not only in sandpaintings and clothing, but in diamonds and the intertwining of people’s lives.REMEMBERING TO BE CAUTIOUS AND OPEN TO ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONSFor the record, we cannot conclude from this incident that the phrase “Rememberthe diamond” necessarily came from Sam, aka the universe.The superskeptic could speculate that somehow I had learned that the Winstonswere staying at the hotel before I asked the universe my question (andfurthermore that I actually knew who Harry Winston was but had forgotten thisinformation). He could speculate that it was just a fluke that the woman whoasked the question happened to be connected to diamonds. The more adventurousskeptic could speculate that I had somehow read Barbara’s mind telepathicallyand unconsciously learned of her association with diamonds. The truly courageousskeptic could even speculate that maybe I received the information from thedeceased Harry Winston, who knew that his son and daughter-in-law were at theconference, and had witnessed Barbara asking me her important question!At that time, all I could say with certainty was that I had innocently posed aquestion in my mind to Sam and that I immediately heard or experienced threewords that caused me to have deeply meaningful images of diamonds—from theearth, through the gemstone designer, to outer space.A very spiritual friend of mine had e-mailed me a quote that she thought I wouldenjoy: “There are no coincidences. They are miracles for which God doesn’t wantto take credit.”Consider the combination of (1) receiving surprising and meaningful informationabout diamonds (2) in response to a fundamental question from an unknown woman(3) who subsequently turned out to be the wife of one of the heirs to the HarryWinston diamond heritage. This pattern certainly leads one to wonder, Where isthe information coming from that Dr. Gary Schwartz is receiving?IS EVERYTHING, METAPHORICALLY, A DIAMOND?When we see a diamond, are we being shown, metaphorically, the face of theG.O.D. process?Contemporary science suggests that when we look at anything, we are potentiallyseeing examples of an infinite number of faces of what I have named theGuiding-Organizing-Designing process. This creative unfolding process, thisseeing beyond the mere physical presence of the object, is flexible, complex,and sophisticated. And so for me, a diamond has become a master metaphor—amaterial symbol of the existence of universal intelligent organization expressedas exquisite beauty and sensitivity, in nature and in the cosmos.It is true that nonrandom natural forces create the diamond in the rough. But itis humans who first saw the potential beauty of the diamond that is cut andshaped and perhaps set as a Winston might perceive it. It is a human who put apattern of sparkles into a raw diamond by shaping it. And it is a humanscientist who can use the diamond to potentially reveal the living history ofthe very creation and organization of the universe.Is this potential ultimately a reflection of the mind of the G.O.D. process,expressing itself through the mind of human beings? Did the G.O.D. processcreate the diamond partly as proof of his existence? So that, in contemplatingit, people like me would find ourselves contemplating the G.O.D. process?Perhaps the same is also true of a tree, a flower, a horse, an amoeba? Arehumans as a species diamonds in the rough, readying to be transformed into gemsof indescribable brilliance? Is the human race beginning to awaken to a divinegarden that is already here? Sir Isaac Newton supposedly said, “I don’t knowwhat ‘synchronicity’ means—but it’s the third time I’ve heard it this week.”Paraphrasing James Taylor, I can honestly say that the following applies to me.And maybe to you, too?I could never have guessed,I was already blessed.There I was, where we are,In the garden.A garden of flowering diamonds …ALBERT EINSTEINThere are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is amiracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00019.gif]INTERESTING AND AMUSING THEORIESA PHYSICIST CONCLUDES, “IT’S ABSOLUTELY WORTH THINKING ABOUT.”Imagine that you are interested in the fundamental question “Is there evidencefor an Experimenting G.O.D. process—an intelligent Guiding-Organizing-Designingprocess—in the universe?” and the related question “Can we communicate with it?”You have just received another seemingly impossible answer from Sam. You areconvinced that a miracle has occurred. As a scientist you have finally receivedmajor funding for your visionary and daring “Experimenting G.O.D. Field”project. The donors who will fund the project accept the fact that fields existeverywhere, including in the “vacuum of space.” These backers further accept thefact that fields are forces that carry information and serve the purpose ofcommunication in everything—from individual atoms to superclusters of galaxies,and everything in between (including us).They further agree with you that a “field,” as physicists use the term, has thepotential to integrate the primary universal processes attributed to“God”—purpose, intelligence, and power. And they agree that if there is a G.O.D.process in nature and the universe as a whole, then that G.O.D. process mustsomehow involve invisible fields—since everything that is material emits fieldsand responds to fields.Your scientific goal is to integrate these two major ideas and conductsystematic research that addresses the question “Is there a measurableG.O.D.-field process in the universe?” Your task is to determine whether or notsome kind of purposeful, creative, and caring field process is playing a guidingrole in the design and evolution of the cosmos—an intelligent trial-and-errorprocess we humans call “experimenting.”What kind of evidence will you decide to gather? What kind of experiments willyou run? And as you gather the evidence, how will you know if your ExperimentingG.O.D.-field process interpretation of the evidence is correct?Even though we have already considered evidence that points inexorably to theexistence of some kind of Experimenting G.O.D. field process in the universe asa whole, it’s instructive to step back and take a deep breath. A few morequestions of a general nature are necessary. How do we search for evidencescientifically? And how will we interpret what we find? What criteria will theteam choose to use to conclude that a given explanation of evidence isreasonable and credible?To understand how even the most conservative scientific investigators sometimesarrive at bold and far-reaching conclusions, it’s meaningful to consider howresponsible science goes about the process of entertaining, rejecting, andaccepting hypotheses, especially extraordinary ones.Partly for entertainment, and partly for clarity, I’d like for a moment toexplore with you the science of hoofbeats, horses, zebras, and the ExperimentingG.O.D.-field process.ZEBRAS IN CENTRAL PARK?—A LESSON REGARDING EVIDENCE VERSUS EXPLANATIONSEmergency room doctors have a saying that has apparently been passed downthrough generations: “When you hear hoofbeats, don’t think zebras.” Physicians,especially ER doctors—who often must play God to save their patients—appreciatethe deep wisdom of these words. But what do they mean?Imagine that you are in New York City, near Central Park, and suddenly you hearhoofbeats. What’s the most probable explanation for this sound? The answer, ofcourse, is horses—not zebras. Horse-drawn carriages are a possibility, as aremounted police; both are part of the city scene. Except at the zoo, or if acircus is in town, you are not likely to see zebras in Central Park. Now, if youhear hoofbeats but don’t see any horses, you would then consider other lessprobable but still likely possible explanations, such as ponies, donkeys, ormules. However, if you can’t find any ponies, donkeys, or mules, then you mightconsider the possibility that what you actually heard was a zebra—perhaps onethat escaped from the Central Park zoo or the circus.Detectives following in the footsteps of Sherlock Holmes appreciate theimportance of considering all possible explanations for a given observation orphenomenon, and then systematically ruling them in or out through the carefulscrutiny of the clues and evidence. In other words, a conservative approach tosearching for evidence, as well as drawing conclusions from the evidence, is toconsider the history of what is known about a phenomenon in a given context, andbegin your search with the most probable explanation.Imagine that you are an emergency room physician facing a lifeordeath situation,and you must make your decisions quickly. What rules should you follow tooptimize saving a patient’s life? The answer is simple. Pick the most probableexplanation or cause for the symptom based upon years of accumulated clinicaland experimental evidence, and check to see if this specific cause is theexplanation. If the most probable explanation turns out not to be correct, youwill rule out that explanation and move on to the next most probable one.The hoofbeat lesson works in science, too. It’s prudent to examine the mostprobable and accepted explanations, and only after ruling them out, consider theless probable and more controversial explanations of the phenomenon.FROM ZEBRAS TO THE EXPERIMENTING G.O.D.Consider the Experimenting G.O.D. process question. Atheists as well asconservative scientists might say, “When you see evidence for the existence andevolution of order in the universe, don’t think ‘God.’” Another way they mightsay this is, “When you see evidence for the existence and evolution of order inthe universe, don’t think universal intelligent design.”However, there’s an important distinction between atheists and conservativescientists in how they qualify this phrase. Atheists simply assume that there isno “God”—that universal intelligent design in the universe is impossible—hencethey dismiss the G.O.D. process possibility out of hand. For them, there are nozebras; only horses exist. For atheists the statement would read: “When you seeevidence for the existence and evolution of order in the universe, think chance.Period.”Conservative scientists take a different tack. They propose that the chanceexplanation is the most probable, and therefore the existing evidence must ruleout the chance explanation before they will have much interest in consideringother possible explanations. For the conservative scientist, it’s possible thatthe hoofbeat sounds are being made by a zebra, but in order to consider zebras,they must first rule out horses. Hence, for conservative scientists thestatement should read, “When you see evidence for the existence and evolution oforder in the universe, think chance first.”As a conservative scientist, I agreed with the approach “Think chance first”when I asked the question “How do we explain the evidence of order and evolvingorder in the universe?” In fact, I originally did what most skeptical scientistsdo: I presumed that the chance explanation was the most plausible and probableexplanation.One of the greatest surprises revealed to me was that the chance explanationturns out to be neither plausible nor probable. What I discovered, quiteunexpectedly, is that this explanation simply doesn’t work.Recall that when you actually do experiments to test the chance hypothesis—forexample, to see whether sand paintings will create themselves by chance, whethercomputers generating random numbers will create shapes other then a bell-shapedcurve (described in Part Two)—they always fail to produce an evolving order. Theexperiments fail to produce an evolving order 100 percent of the time. Allthings being equal, in the absence of a Guiding-Organizing-Designing process,the experiments confirm that most things mix and become less ordered, not moreordered (in physics this is called the Second Law of Thermodynamics).To return to our metaphor, for centuries science has assumed that the chanceexplanation was a “horse” but the horse surprisingly turns out to be a Trojanhorse. Chance is not what we have assumed it to be.The history of science reminds us that we should always strive to be cautious,proceed with humility, and maintain an open mind. Hence, when I offerextraordinary evidence, inexorable logic, and highly supportive personalexploratory experiments in this book, I do so fully aware of the possibilitythat the seeming stampede of hoofbeats we seem to be hearing may eventually turnout to be from something other than a herd of zebras. In principle, it’stheoretically possible that the conclusions in this book may turn out to bemerely amusing or, better, not just amusing but actually true. However, weshould always be prepared for the possibility that new evidence may come alongin the future that indicates that it was a horse after all, or that it wasneither a horse nor a zebra, but was a camel, or even a unicorn, instead.EMOTION AND THE G.O.D. QUESTIONThe question of the existence of an Experimenting G.O.D., a creativeGuiding-Organizing-Designing process, may be the most emotional of all questionshumans think about. Some people experience joy, wonder, and peace when theyponder God. Others experience anger, fear, and disgust. Some are fearful of theidea that an invisible power may be guiding their lives; others depend on theidea; still others label the God idea as superstitious if not outright foolish.Finally, there are those who literally hate the idea of a G.O.D.: someconservative scientists who will remain nameless have told me of their strongdistaste for the existence of a G.O.D. process.Depending upon your current religious or philosophical beliefs about“God”—complete acceptance, openness to questioning, or total rejection—you maybe experiencing feelings ranging from inspired to infuriated as you ponder theevidence.If you already believe in “God,” you may be finding the evidence comforting andvalidating. If you are currently agnostic and don’t know what you believe, youmay be finding the evidence helpful if not transforming. If you are an assuredatheist, you may be finding the evidence challenging and even, I’m sad to say,potentially threatening. This is unavoidable—it comes with the territory of thisresearch. In fact, if you consciously (or unconsciously) dislike theExperimenting G.O.D. explanation, you may be engaging in selective use of logicaccompanied by actual blocks in your understanding.A dear friend who will remain nameless once said to me, “When I dislikesomething, it stops me from understanding it.” Another dear friend who will alsoremain nameless said to me in one breath, “Gary, everyone knows that clothingdoes not fold by itself,” and then, in the next breath, he said, “But if we waittwo billions years or so, maybe the clothing will fold by itself.” A thirdfriend was annoyed that I would even search for evidence, saying that her beliefdepended on an absence of evidence. “Finding evidence would be like whathappened when a man walked on the moon; I never looked at the moon romanticallyagain.”Your assumptions are never based solely on evidence or reasoning; they are basedon emotion and wishing as well.“I FIND YOUR THEORY MOST AMUSING”In 1982, while I was preparing to give my presidential address to the HealthPsychology Division of the American Psychological Association, I wonderedwhether to share my burgeoning interest in how quantum field physics andrelativity theory could be applied to health psychology and the psychophysiologyof healing; I knew that even to suggest the application of quantum physics toproving anything about health or healing would be highly controversial at thetime.I referenced a book I had read years earlier; The Cosmic Code, a book Imentioned in Chapter 4, pursues the history of quantum physics. I had been takenwith the description of how Einstein had developed his field theory ofrelativity. The author, Heinz Pagels, was, as pointed out earlier, adistinguished physicist and professor at Rockefeller University.Following the model provided by Pagels, I put myself in Einstein’s shoes, so tospeak, and extended Einstein’s logic to physiology, personality, and psychology.This resulted in what I termed the general relativity/ general relaxationhypothesis. But I was not sure about my logic and my predictions and wanted totest them.The details of the controversial theory and the significant evidence I collectedthat supported my theory were later published in a 1987 book titled TheEmergence of Personality. What is most important is what happened when I decidedto call Dr. Pagels, who was at that time still alive, to ask him if he agreedwith my logical extension of what he had written. I wanted his verification andso I contacted him to discuss the theory.He spent an hour on the phone with me. In the first thirty minutes, I explainedto him that this speech was an important one to me and to the AmericanPsychological Association. I needed his advice as to whether I should share thisoriginal theory with my colleagues since I knew that some of them would behighly critical of me for doing so. I then went through the theory in detail,step by step.When I was finished, Pagels merely said, “I find your theory most amusing.”There I was asking a distinguished physicist I held in high esteem for hisscientific advice and personal wisdom about whether I should share my thesis ina major address. His response of “most amusing” was both shocking anddisheartening.But Pagels continued, to be sure I understood. He said, “Gary, you don’t knowwhat I mean by the word ‘amusing.’”He explained that as a graduate student at Princeton University, studying withthe Nobel Prize-winning physicist Eugene Wigner, he learned that Wigner was fondof telling his students that there were two kinds of theories in the world, oneof which he described as “interesting” and the other “amusing.” Wigner wouldexplain with a twinkle in his eye that “interesting theories, though often true,are typically not worth remembering, whereas amusing theories, though often nottrue, are absolutely worth thinking about.”Hearing that story, I breathed a sigh of relief. This great man had used thephrase “most amusing” as a compliment! So I decided to share with my colleaguesmy intention to amuse them by applying quantum physics and relativity theory tohealth psychology. As I had anticipated, some of my colleagues were excited andinspired; others were quite angry and dismissive.So, dear readers, using the same terminology, this book is meant to be amusingin Pagels’s definition of the word. The evidence, logic, personal experiences,and implications, I hope you’ll agree, are absolutely worth thinking about.Can the minds that created multigigahertz portable computers, crystal clearglobal satellite cell phones, ultrahigh resolution pocket digital cameras, andwireless personal digital assistants connected to the World Wide Web have thepotential to discover the origin and meaning of our own intelligence? Is itpossible to uncover the apparent intelligence and power of the cosmos as awhole?"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00020.gif]THE GREAT G.O.D.

DEBATE, AND HOW CAN IT BE RESOLVED?Okay—up to now I’ve presented exemplary evidence as well as compelling theorypointing to the conclusion that some sort of a Guiding-Organizing-Designingprocess is playing a fundamental role in the origin and evolution of theuniverse—as well as in you and me. At this point I want to step back andconsider the question of chance versus intelligent design in more detail. I askyou to follow this in the spirit of the distinguished neuroscientist WarrenMcCulloch, who said with great fondness, “Do not bite my finger, look where I ampointing.”There are basically two schools of thought—what scientists label as twofoundational hypotheses—about the origin of the universe. One can be called the“chance universe”; the other, the “intelligent design universe.” Though thereare many variations and possible combinations of these two broad classes oftheories, the complexities boil down to two simple hypotheses.The chance universe is the current interpretation generally accepted bymainstream science in the fields of statistics, quantum physics, andevolutionary biology. It suggests that the growth and evolution of all things,from the subatomic to the galactic—and everything in between—reflects a versionof natural selection and survival of the fittest as elegantly proposed byCharles Darwin. At its core, the idea of survival of the fittest is presumed tobe possible due to the existence of random mutation and chance in biologicalsystems, driven by physical laws, as they interact with the environment.Highly regarded twentieth-century scientists—ranging from the late RichardFeynman and Carl Sagan in physics and astrophysics to Stephen Dawkins and thelate Stephen J. Gould in evolution and biology—are often associated with someversion of this randomness interpretation of the origin of order, life, andevolution in the universe.It is important to pay close attention to the wording here—we are speaking aboutthe origin of order, life, and evolution in the universe. Generally speaking,mainstream scientists tend to ignore the “origins” question because they cannotaddress it. Explaining the evolution of biological life in terms of existinglaws of physics, chemistry, and biochemistry ignores the fundamental question:what explains the origin and organization of the laws that are presumed to bethe building blocks of higher-order biological systems, including the appearanceand evolution of intelligence in life? If the explanation for the origin andorganization of natural laws is not chance and randomness, then what is it?Other distinguished twentieth-century scientists—ranging from the late AlbertEinstein and David Bohm in physics to Rupert Sheldrake and the late WillisHarman in evolution and biology—are often associated with some version of anintelligent design interpretation. A more apt term, one that is consistent withthe evidence from evolution as well as from statistics, is “creative intelligentdesign.” This intelligent trial and error or “experimenting intelligence”integrates intelligence as expressed in both art and science.The proponents of the chance universe hypothesis cite veritable mountains ofdata that seem to be consistent with the existence of randomness in theevolution of the universe. I emphasize the word “seem” because to accept thechance hypothesis requires that one assume that if something appears random—likethe sequence of numbers in pi—then the order must be random (a very shakyassumption). It also requires the assumption that the overabundance of orderseen in the universe (for example, spiraling galaxies) can be explained asrandom combinations of laws and processes—yet this is inconsistent with everydayexperience revealed through sand paintings or watchmaking.The most vocal advocates claim—with complete conviction—that randomnessessentially rules the universe. They presume that the universe began in a stateof true chaos (disorder), and that it is basically running down (again, this isthe Second Law of Thermodynamics). The seeming exception to this overall pictureof increasing entropy and disorder in the universe is the existence of smallpockets or areas of evolving order—such as witnessed on the planet Earth.To the chance advocates, if such a thing as “God” exists, there would be noquestion that such a God plays dice with the universe. In fact, according tosome interpretations of probability theory, you can literally bet your life thatthe chance universe hypothesis is true.However, before we can address the playing dice explanation, we must considerthe distinction between observation and interpretation, between the facts andour stories about them. Remember we observe that pi produces a precise sequenceof numbers that defies our current understanding, and yet this sequence isreplicated 100 percent of the time. What is our interpretation of theseobservations? Randomness? Complex order? Expression of intelligent design? Howdo we decide among these potential interpretations?HOW LOOKING AT THE SUN HELPS US UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION BETWEENOBSERVATION AND INTERPRETATIONJust because an observation is replicable does not mean that our interpretationof the observation is correct. And this deserves repeating because if there isone lesson we should all learn from the history of science, it is this: The factthat an observation is replicable does not mean that our interpretation of theobservation is correct.Unfortunately, even the best-trained scientists sometimes forget this coredistinction. One of my favorite examples of the “interpretation is not theobservation” principle involves commonplace observations of the sun that lead usto say the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.For almost two decades I have lived in a beautiful desert where the sun shinesalmost every day. I have personally witnessed, and can easily document overthree hundred times in a given year, the sun’s apparent rising and settingbehavior. Just like flipping a coin or throwing dice, no expensive andcomplicated scientific devices are needed to make observations of the sun’strustworthy behavior.These completely replicable solar observations long ago led humans to theseemingly commonsense interpretation that the sun revolves around the earth. Sothe distinction between observation and interpretation is critical. Early humanswitnessed the sun’s rising here and setting there, and inferred—that is,formulated the conclusion—that the sun “revolves” around us.History teaches that for many thousands of years, this is exactly what humankinddid. Early man confused the distinction between observation and interpretationand accepted the interpretation that the sun revolves around the earth as if itwere an observed fact. We still retain that notion when we talk about the sunrising and setting, as if it were moving and the earth were still.But the interpretation is not the observation. The conclusion is not the data.The map is not the territory. The explanation is not the evidence.We now understand and accept that the most obvious interpretation of the sun’srising and setting behavior turns out have an alternative explanation. But it’swell worth remembering that this interpretation not only challenged commonsense, it challenged long-held religious beliefs based on the commonsenseinterpretation, as well.We now understand that because the earth revolves on its axis, and because theearth revolves around the sun, it therefore appears to us on the earth as if thesun is revolving around the earth, when in fact something quite different ishappening.It’s also worth considering that any “alternative” interpretation was onceextremely dangerous for the scientists who proposed it, because theestablishment—in this case, the orthodox church—was committed to a differentinterpretation. In fact, in the course of human history, scientists havesometimes been silenced, tortured, and even executed for proposinginterpretations that conflicted with accepted foundational interpretations of“the establishment.”Informed people have come to know what the “alternative” interpretation is ofthe sun and earth. The names Copernicus and Galileo are connected to one of thegreatest paradigm shifts in the history of science, a shift often referred to asthe Copernican Revolution. And just for the record I will state what is obviousto most twenty-first-century adults, something contemporary science hasconvinced us to take for granted: that there is a logical, plausible, andconvincing alternative explanation for our earthbound observations of the sun.Note that the basic observations of the sun’s behavior—seen by our eyes when onearth—have not changed. What has changed is our intellectual interpretation ofour earthbound, and hence earth-limited, observations of the sun. Unfortunately,when specific interpretations of observation become accepted dogma, the humanmind typically closes shut, and creativity atrophies. Einstein put it this way:“Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.”A NEW, ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION OF RANDOMNESSWhat you are about to read is an alternative interpretation of coin flips, dice,and so-called randomness that is parallel to the alternative interpretation ofthe sun revolving around the earth.In a fundamental sense, our long-held interpretation of the observations of coinflips—as chance—is as primitive as man’s early interpretation of theobservations of the sun. I’m volunteering to lead the charge and to put newinterpretations onto old observations.The alternative interpretation revealed in the next chapter resolves theapparent paradox between a young child seemingly throwing random dice and theDream Detective (in Part One) seeing a clearly nonrandom future.Can a simple change of concept that takes place in the mind transform ourperception of virtually everything? The history of science says yes.ALBERT EINSTEINMy religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spiritwho reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frailand feeble minds. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superiorreasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms myidea of God."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00022.gif]CAN G.O.D. PLAY DICE WITH THE UNIVERSE?EINSTEIN WAS RIGHT: THE ANSWER IS “NO”You now have the background knowledge for understanding a new interpretation ofrandomness, and for understanding how this interpretation is consistent with theG.O.D. process explanation. In this chapter I follow the logical progression byshowing how G.O.D. could have designed into the very fabric of the universe thecapacity for apparent randomness. And I will show how this apparent randomnessmay bring relative freedom, discovery, and creativity.When Einstein said, “God does not play dice with the universe,” he expressed a“deeply emotional conviction.” However, there were “slight details” thatrevealed God’s presence to Einstein. The logic to him was inexorable. But therest of us were not able to follow the logic with what might be called our“frail and feeble minds.”I want to consider two such details that empower us to correct the long-standingmistake in our conception of how randomness works, as well as to further explainwhy randomness cannot be used to explain the existence of order and evolution inthe universe. The answer takes us to the hypothesis of intelligent evolution.TWO ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF APPARENT RANDOMNESSEvery student of statistics is taught that there are two keys—two fundamentalconditions—that must be present in order to create a normal, or bell-shaped,curve of numbers. These two conditions are so well accepted that they are takento be assumptions—we simply accept that they are true.Using coin flips as an example, the two keys that statistics teaches are asfollows:As discussed earlier, each coin flip must be independent of every other coinflip. Each time the coin is flipped, the flip must be independent of all theflips that have happened previously. The fact that the last flip was heads mustnot influence the way you produce the next flip. Complete independence isrequired to obtain a normal distribution of coin flips. If the events are notindependent, every possible combination of coin flips will not have the“freedom” to potentially occur, and this freedom is an established requirementin statistics.Both the coin and the coin flipper must be unchanging over time. The same coincannot continue to be used if it is wearing out, for example. Moreover, the datagathering becomes invalid if the coin flipper begins to develop a skill inflipping coins. Absolutely nothing can change over time.Stated another way, the coin and the coin flipper must be independent of time.If the events are not unchanging (that is, if they are not independent of time),then every possible combination of coin flips will not have the freedom topotentially occur. This too is an accepted premise in statistics.These two slight details of statistics are by themselves not controversial. Theyare accepted as being factually true. As we demonstrated earlier in the computerexperiments chapter, when we model these two conditions on a PC, and run theexperiment over and over, we obtain the same result, the same shape ofdistribution curve, every single time.The resulting curve—a histogram of the averages of the binomials (heads/tails,yes/no coin flips)—is bell-shaped. Always.When these two conditions are met, the existence of a bell-shaped curve centeredat 50 percent is as dependable as the existence of objects falling to theground. All statistics programs that model the two conditions of independenceand unchanging over time produce completely replicated random distributions ofnumbers—that is, distributions that always have the same bell shape.If everyone who uses statistics knows that this is true, then isn’t the questionanswered? Isn’t the case closed? The answer, plain and simple, is no. Somehow wekeep forgetting to ask the following foundational questions:Do physics and nature meet these two key conditions?Are real events in the physical world completely independent, and are theyunchanging over time?Think about this: What if nothing is actually independent in nature? What if,instead, all things in nature are interdependent to various degrees? In otherwords, what if nature does not meet the first condition to achieve a randomdistribution? What if the first key is not present?Moreover, what if “no things” in nature are actually unchanging? What if,instead, all things in nature are changing in various degrees over time?In other words, what if nature does not meet the second condition to achieve arandom distribution as well? What if the second key is not present?The reasoning is straightforward, the logic inexorable. If nature does not meetthe two key conditions to achieve randomness, then randomness cannot occur innature. Consequently, if nature does not meet the two key conditions to achieverandomness, then we cannot use the random sampling explanation for the existenceand evolution of order in the universe.It is worth repeating that if nature does not meet both key conditions toachieve randomness, then logic dictates that science must search for anexplanation other than random sampling to understand the origin and evolution oforder in the universe.UNDERSTANDING INVISIBLE FIELDS—GRAVITY, INTERDEPENDENCE, AND THE EXISTENCE OFTHE G.O.D.-PROCESS FOR SIR ISAAC NEWTONLet’s consider invisible gravitational fields. It is an accepted fact thatgravity exists. Even very young children play games based on their acceptance ofgravity. And gravity per se definitively establishes that everything isinterconnected to various degrees. Yes, definitively.Sir Isaac Newton was the first scientist to specify, both experimentally andmathematically, that gravity is the “invisible glue” holding the universetogether. His famous mathematical formulas describe how everything—that is,every thing that has mass—has an associated gravitational pull that extends outinto space in all directions. And this is true of all objects. An apple fallingfrom a tree is not simply pulled down toward the earth. The apple pulls theearth toward it, and it pulls up toward the tree, and up higher still toward themoon, the sun, and beyond.The apple is no different in exerting these pulls than the earth, moon, or sun;it is simply smaller and less compact. A physicist would say the apple has lessmass and therefore has a less intense gravitational field. The earth pulls onthe moon, and the moon pulls on the earth. Both the earth and the moon pull onthe sun, and the sun pulls on both. In turn, the earth, moon, and sun pull onthe apple, and the apple pulls back. The force the apple exerts is miniscule incomparison.Newton was not only a mathematician and a scientist; he was also a sophisticatedmystic and a firm believer in an intelligent G.O.D. process. In his time, todemean him, it was said that Newton held a simple clockwork or machine/mechanismvision of the universe. That myth has filtered down and follows Newton’sreputation even in our world.But the facts are quite different. Newton’s integrative vision was deeplyspiritual as well as experimental, but the scientific community was unwilling toacknowledge the fundamental parallel between Newton’s idea of gravity and hisvision of “God.” It is important to understand that during Newton’s era, sciencewas being separated from religion. A successful separation was essential ifscience was to evolve. However, in the process, the scientists who championedthe separation distorted some fundamental truths. I believe it is time tocorrect these distortions.Newton reasoned that all objects or things, by definition, have mass, and allmasses have gravitational fields that function as invisible attracting forcesthat extend out into space, in all directions, connecting everything that existswith everything else, to various degrees. These invisible attracting forces arecompletely replicable and trustworthy—they are always present.Try to imagine these invisible fields extending out into space in alldirections. Ponder how they interconnect millions or billions of stars in aswirling spiral galaxy, and further how they interconnect millions or billionsof galaxies in a swirling, expanding universe. The thought is positivelydaunting. Physicists have a terrible time trying to model what is called the“three-body problem”—can you conceive what the interconnecting network of fieldsmust be to model a “trillion-body problem”?The gravitation field is completely unconditional—it pulls on any and allobjects that have mass, and it makes no judgments. It does not matter whetherthe given object is large or small, black or white, good or bad. What matters isthat the object has mass. If it has a mass, it has a gravitational field, and itwill pull on everything else in the universe in varying degrees. To summarize,the invisible gravitation field functions as a mutually attractive,unconditional, nonprejudicial, and completely dependable force. Gravity is theuniversal force that literally holds the universe together and enables it toexist as a single, unified system—a “universe” or “one-story.”What does it sound like to you when we envision the existence of a fundamentalforce that is universal, powerful, attractive, unconditional, andnonprejudicial? What does it imply to you when science discovers the existenceof an infinitely interconnecting invisible field that unifies and holds theentire universe together? Newton viewed the integrating force of the universalgravitational field as being a physical expression of the existence of a “God”who was not only unifying but was universally loving, too. Is there scientificjustification for Newton’s vision that the existence of a universal and unifyinggravitation field points to the existence of what I am now calling a G.O.D.process?As we’ve seen earlier, if everything is interconnected to various degrees by theuniversal gravitation field, so that nothing is completely independent of everyother thing, then the first key condition for random sampling—that it becompletely independent of other influences—is not met. Once this is understood,it follows that the distribution of planets, suns, galaxies, and networks ofgalaxies cannot be bell-shaped and will therefore not appear random. If objectsdid not have gravitational fields, there would be no galaxies and nosuperclusters of galaxies. There would simply be a random distribution of starsand planets throughout the vacuum of space.If you digest this one concept and incorporate into your very being, it willenable you to see everything with new eyes.The conclusion that follows is that it is possible to observe complex andreplicable orders in the cosmos because the universe is highly interconnected,by the gravitational field as well as by other invisible fields. This conclusionis abundantly confirmed; it fits exactly what we see. Astrophysics documentsthat galaxies are typically spiral shaped, for example. They are not randomlyshaped. We now know that even the distribution of galaxies in the universe isnot random, but reflects a complex arrangement or network of macro structuresthat look surprising similar to the network of cells in the human brain.According to astrophysicist Sten Odenwald, Ph.D., author of Patterns in theVoid: Why Nothing Is Important, even the seeming “vacuum” in space is teamingwith fields of energy that are patterned or structured—that is, nonrandom. Andthe take-home message is that the gravitation field does more than hold theuniverse together. It contributes to the creation of macro orders in theuniverse. The existence of gravitational fields removes from nature the firstkey condition that is essential for permitting any randomness to exist in theuniverse. Importantly, the gravitation field is not alone; the universe isteaming with interconnecting fields operating from the quantum level, throughthe electromagnetic level, to the gravitational level.THE QUANTUM FIELD AND SUPERINTERDEPENDENCEEinstein’s disagreement with the early quantum physicists in the 1920s and 1930sstemmed in part from his opinion that something was fundamentally wrong with howquantum physicists were interpreting Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. WhereasHeisenberg interpreted the observations of “unpredictability” as meaning“uncaused” and “unplanned,” Einstein interpreted the observations as reflectingan as yet hidden set of complex organizing processes.Einstein accepted the existence of some degree of freedom and choice in theuniverse. He recognized that some events in nature might be too complex forhumans to predict precisely, but he was intuitively (as well as emotionally andintellectually) opposed to the conclusion that events at the quantum level hadto be totally random (as produced by random sampling) and completely independentof one another.Einstein’s intuition and reasoning turn out to be accurate. Quantum physicists,as a rule, make an assumption that is fundamentally inconsistent with the veryfoundation of quantum physics itself. On the one hand, most physicists recognizea level of connectedness—and interdependence—at the quantum level that defiesboth the speed of light as well as common experience. Replicated physicsexperiments have documented that under certain conditions, two photons—oncetogether and now traveling in opposite directions at the speed of light—continueto behave as if they were one. They behave as if there were no distance betweenthem—a surprising conclusion that defies common sense (to put it mildly!).The mathematics predicts that when two such photons begin together and thensimultaneously travel even to opposite ends of the universe, what happens to onephoton can be precisely and instantly observed in the other. This is calledBell’s Theorem (no relation to the bell-shaped curve). The phenomenon is calledentanglement.This law isn’t just theoretical; it has been confirmed in the lab. If anexperimenter changes the spin of one of a pair of previously connected photons,the other photon will react seemingly instantly in the same way. Thisobservation is termed “nonlocality,” which means that distance or space does notmatter when photons are completely connected—assuming the speed of light isfixed, as Einstein hypothesized. Despite the incomprehensible distances thatseparate them, they appear to react synchronously. Talk aboutinterconnectedness!Yet, on the other hand, many quantum physicists assume that randomness (implyingrandom sampling) must be the explanation for why they are unable to predictsimultaneously both the speed and momentum of quantum events—a phenomenonpredicted by Heisenberg’s uncertainly principle. Quantum physicists assume thatthese events are random because they have not integrated the logic ofprobability statistics with the observations of quantum physics. Yet logicallythere is a deep disconnect between the reasoning used by physicists tounderstand quantum physics and the logic used to apply statistics to data. Whenwe repair this disconnect, the implications touch virtually every discipline ofscience and life.I well understand this profound conceptual disconnect. As a scientist, I too waseducated to reason this way. However, the experiments and logic reviewed in thisbook strongly suggest that it behooves science to revisit this conceptualdisconnect if our true understanding of the universe is to evolve.Interdependence is the rule and not the exception in nature, especially at thequantum level.The message is clear. The macro world of gravitational fields and the microworld of quantum fields both lead to the same conclusion: everything in natureis interconnected and interdependent to various degrees. And it follows thatsince there is no independence, then there is no support of a randomness theory,at least in its purest sense, as posited by random sampling. This conclusion isunavoidable.SYSTEMS, FEEDBACK LOOPS, NETWORKS, AND COMPLEXITYBecause everything is interconnected to various degrees, everything is changingover time to various degrees.A system is a set of components that mutually affect one another. In the processof components joining together, interacting, and sharing information and energy,the system changes over time. The inherent property of systems to change istermed “dynamical.” Dynamical systems develop novel properties that are termed“emergents”; the novel properties “emerge” because the components interact andaffect one another. Anything that exists in a dynamical system is constantlychanging over time through interdependence and feedback. This fact has profoundimplications for the existence and evolution of complex orders in the universe.Emergent interactions happen at every level of nature. For example, protons,neutrons, and electrons come together to make atoms. Both hydrogen and oxygenhave the same components—protons, neutrons, and electrons—but when they becomeatoms, their emergent properties are unique. Moreover, the properties of bothhydrogen and oxygen are different from the individual properties of protons,neutrons, and electrons examined separately. Hydrogen and oxygen come togetherand make a molecule called water. Water is remarkably different in itscharacteristics from the individual properties of hydrogen and oxygen. Fromsubatomic particles to molecules, to biochemicals, to cells, to organisms, toecologies, to solar systems, to galaxies, to superclusters of galaxies andbeyond, novel emergent properties appear—at every level, and everywhere.There is nothing random about the emergent property process. Though it is highlycomplex, it is highly replicable. When hydrogen and oxygen join together theymake water, not gasoline or maple syrup. When human eggs and sperm join togetherthey make people, not plants or protozoa. In the process of becoming a system,the components must interact—the components therefore become interdependent andconstrain one another. Moreover, they constantly interact with systems outsidethemselves as well. Water interacts with temperature, for example, and it alsointeracts with the container that holds it. If the temperature is decreasedbelow zero degrees centigrade, and the water is sitting in a heart-shaped dish,the water will solidify into the shape of a heart.Feedback plays an essential universal role in these processes. The neuralnetworks of the brain learn through neural feedback. People learn socialbehavior through social feedback. If we take away the neural feedback from aneural network, the neurons will not learn. Similarly, if we take away socialfeedback from people, people will not learn social behavior. Feedback is whatenables learning to take place in systems, regardless of their level. And allsystems, at all levels, have feedback.All systems store information and energy to various degrees. The logic isstraightforward—if a system has feedback, it will change dynamically over timeto various degrees. Feedback loops constrain systems—the output of the systemfeeds back to the input of the system and controls the system accordingly.Feedback provides guidance in systems. What is termed positive feedbackestablishes the capacity for increasing complexity in systems, and in theprocess, it removes the potential for randomness to operate.TURNING RANDOMNESS ON ITS HEADLet’s review the essentials. When a scientist accepts the reality of fields inphysics and quantum physics, and integrates this information with systemsscience and complexity theory, it is possible to discover that there is nolonger a valid reason to assume that (1) events function independently in nature(the first key condition for random sampling to occur) and (2) events do notchange over time (the second key condition). In a word, nature does not meet thetwo key conditions for randomness—as predicted by random sampling—to occur.Yet even a youngster can flip coins and get an average of 50 percent heads andtails. And we can create computer programs that can generate bell-shaped curves100 percent of the time. Something is missing if they can appear random. Whathappens when we create the two conditions that approximate randomness? I havealready demonstrated that when the two conditions that approximate randomnessare created, what happens on the average is actually completely predictable. Wedo not observe the origin and evolution of complex orders—we observe the sameaverage order every time.So, how can Einstein’s statement be true? What did he mean? I suggest that wereframe Einstein’s famous phrase slightly to say that the G.O.D. process canmake it possible, within limits, to play dice in the universe—where “dice”allows some degree of creativity and freedom to express itself in nature.Remember, the origin and evolution of the complex orders we witness in the realuniverse cannot be created by random sampling pre se. Throwing dice can neithercreate a universe nor sustain it any more than throwing sand in the air cancreate a sand painting or sustain it.As we have said, in a field-interconnected universe—from quantum fields togravitational fields—the conditions to create random sampling are for the mostpart not met. Therefore, it is not valid to use random sampling as a theory toexplain the origin and evolution of complex orders in the universe.There are, however, certain select circumstances of relative independence in theuniverse, and they can serve a very intelligent purpose. If a higherintelligence—some sort of Guiding-Organizing-Designing process—is required toproduce the amazing complexity of evolving orders witnessed in the universe, wemust ask why this superintelligence would make it possible to flip coins orgenerate numbers seemingly unpredictably? What higher purpose would theexistence of seeming flexibility provide for the universe, and for us? Is thisan expression of intelligent evolution?The answer is simple. Creativity and individuality require relativeindependence. In order to have relative flexibility—and for systems to haverelative degrees of freedom and choice—there must be relative independence.Simply stated, relative independence does not create novel orders per se bychance; what relative independence does is give novel orders the chance tooccur.That’s important enough to repeat: What relative independence does is give novelorders the chance to occur.What chance means in this case is opportunity. The fact that we cannot decode agiven pattern of events or predict how the events will unfold over time does notnecessarily mean that there is no pattern to the events or that the events areunpredictable. Einstein experienced aspects of the universe as being“incomprehensible.” His opinion was that certain superorganized patterns weremerely “incomprehensibly complex.” And this book comes to the same conclusion.It takes a superintelligent process to create the kind of apparent intelligentevolution we observe in the universe.Hidden in what is currently perceived to be randomness are supercomplex patternsthat are waiting to be appreciated and ultimately discovered by man’s evolvingexperimenting minds. Humans have discovered whole numbers, prime numbers,irrational numbers, calculus, Boolean algebra, matrix algebra, nonlineardifferential equations, and infinity mathematics. It is worth remembering thateverything is evolving, including mathematics.Could the capacity for relative randomness be part of G.O.D.’s plan—a gift ofgifts that enables us, and everything else, to evolve with relative creativity,semiautonomy, and sacred responsibility? Is G.O.D. a universal mathematician andsacred scientist? The journey continues.MAY SARTONI see a certain order in the universe and Math is one way of making it visible."},{"pageContent":"INTERLUDE Image [../images/00023.gif]THE “DIVINE PROPORTION”WHY G.O.D. IS A MATHEMATICIANProbably the most remarkable and revered number—which happens to be termed anirrational number by mathematicians—is also the most ubiquitous number innature. The number is termed phi, and like its brother pi, the order of itsdigits is mysteriously unending and seemingly nonrepeating.Here is how the astrophysicist Mario Livio, author of The Golden Ratio,introduced his readers to “the world’s most astonishing number.”What do the delightful petal arrangements in a red rose, Salvador Dali’s famouspainting “Sacrament of the Last Supper,” the magnificent spiral shells ofmollusk, and the breeding of rabbits all have in common? Hard to believe, butthese very disparate examples do have in common a certain number or geometricalproportion known since antiquity, a number that in the nineteenth century wasgiven the honorifics “Golden Number,” Golden Ratio,” and “Golden Section.” Abook published in Italy at the beginning of the sixteenth century went so far asto call this ratio the “Divine Proportion.”For most people the explanation of the phi ratio is easy to follow butimpossible to understand. Consider the easy part first. Imagine you have a linethat extends from A to C. Approximately two-thirds of the way along the line, wepick a point and call it B. We now have two segments—A to B (the longersegment), and B to C (the shorter segment)—that together equal the total linelength, A to C.Now, it’s possible to adjust the position of B in such a way that the ratio ofthe longer segment (AB) to the total length of the line (AC) equals the ratio ofthe shorter segment (BC) to the longer segment (AB). (You may want to read thatsentence again!) In other words, we can adjust the position of B so that ABdivided by AC equals BC divided by AB (for those of you who like formulas, it isAB/AC=BC/AB). This is the simplest way to describe the golden ratiomathematically.The phi ratio, like the well-known pi ratio (the circumference of a circledivided by its diameter), cannot be calculated precisely. No matter how farmathematicians carry out the division, the numbers keep appearing in a seeminglynonrepeating and unpredictable fashion. They appear to be random, save for thefact that every time the ratio is calculated, the identical sequence of numbersappears. What’s truly astonishing about the phi ratio is that it fits diverseshapes and dynamics spanning art and architecture, botany and biology, physicsand mathematics, and even economics and astrophysics. The golden ratio is foundto occur in the dynamics of the stock market as well as the arrangement ofbillions of stars in a spiraling galaxy. How can a ratio that produces anirrational number containing a seemingly infinite series of never-repeatingdigits be the basis of a universal shaping process that extends from the Smallto the All?Here is how Dr. Livio asks the question: “Is the universe by its very naturemathematical?” Another way to frame this is in the famous words of the Britishphysicist Sir James Jeans (1847-1946): “Is God a mathematician?”A superintelligent G.O.D. process is guaranteed to be supermathematically giftedas well. As people evolve in their mathematical skills and understandings—andlearn to see beyond apparent randomness—it is possible to take a quantum leap incomprehending the universal nature of the Experimenting G.O.D. mind. If that’spossible, we will all reach Einstein’s dream of coming to know the mind of God.WERNHER VON BRAUN, ROCKET SCIENTISTThere is certainly no scientific reason why God cannot retain the same relevancein our modern world that He held before we began probing His creation withtelescopes, cyclotrons, and space vehicles."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00024.gif]WHY SCIENCE SHAVES WITH OCKHAM’S RAZORSIMPLE PREDICTIONS THAT RADICALLY TRANSFORM OUR MINDSDoes the fact that chance, by itself, cannot explain the origin and evolution oforder in the universe require that people accept some kind of superintelligentdesigning process to explain everything that exists in the evolving universe?The key word here is “everything,” and the commonsense answer is “Of coursenot.” Even if you accept the fact that sand paintings never paint themselves, orthat watches never assemble themselves, you surely recognize that many phenomenain nature seem to organize themselves quite well.Commonplace experience reminds us that clouds appear to emerge spontaneously,raindrops appear to liquefy and fall naturally, and tornados appear to swirl andcreate destruction, all seemingly by themselves. Oak seeds appear to grow intooak trees, and fertilized human eggs appear to grow into newborn babies, againall seemingly by themselves. Phenomena that apparently invent and evolvethemselves are scientifically termed “self-organizing systems.” Nature isreplete with systems that show apparent self-organizing properties.To show you how to see the seemingly obvious alternative explanation to anintelligent, invisible Guiding-Organizing-Designing process with clarity andunderstanding—and I emphasize the words “seemingly obvious”—has been the goal ofthe book to this point.Let’s now pull together the three core principles previously discussed, torecognize the important implications that emerge from the totality of both theevidence and the reasoning presented so far.PRINCIPLE 1: INTERPRETATION DOES NOT EQUAL OBSERVATIONIn Chapter 9 I noted that the sun appears to revolve around the earth because weimplicitly interpret our earthbound observations of the sun as if the sun wererevolving around us.It is, indeed, possible to make mistakes when interpreting one’s observations.But sometimes a mistake is colossal, as when it was taken for granted that thesun revolved around the earth, whereas the opposite is actually the case. Afundamental lesson from the history of science is that things are notnecessarily as they appear to the untrained, uninformed eye.Yes, raindrops seem to form by themselves. And oak trees seem to grow bythemselves. This is how it seems. But the earth also seems to be flat. And thesun appears to revolve around the earth. The underlying message must berespected—a commonplace interpretation of an observation, even a completelyreplicated observation, cannot be assumed to be necessarily accurate or correct.This principle applies to all relationships in all systems, including therelationship between the mind and the brain. Since this book is ultimately aboutintelligence, including intelligent trial-and-error learning and evolution, itis instructive to discover how the observation/ interpretation principleprovides clarity and understanding to the fundamental question “Does the braincreate the mind, or does the brain serve as a receiver for the mind?” Did thehardware create the software, or is it the other way around?If an interpretation is consistent with the evidence—a subject we’ll come toshortly—then the question arises, “Was the brain (the hardware) created by asuperintelligent mind (the ultimate software) to serve as a tool of the humanmind?” Neuroscientists interpret three kinds of evidence to support theinterpretation that the brain creates the mind. The evidence seems compelling.But is the interpretation correct?The three kinds of evidence are:Evidence from Recordings. Scientists can record brain waves (EEGs), usingsensitive electronic devices. For example, researchers have discovered thatalpha waves over the occipital cortex in the back of the head decrease whenpeople see visual objects with their eyes and, as well, when people imaginevisual objects with their minds.Evidence from Stimulation. Scientists can stimulate various areas of the brain,using electrodes placed inside the head or magnetic coils placed outside thehead. For example, experiments have shown that stimulating the occipital cortextypically causes people to experience visual sensations and images.Evidence from Ablation. Observation of people and animals whose brains have beendamaged through injury or disease, or who have had various areas of the brainsurgically removed, have revealed that when areas of the occipital cortex aredestroyed, people, dogs, cats, rats, and mice lose aspects of vision.The commonsense—and generally accepted—interpretation of this set of findings isthat visual experience is created by the brain.However, the critical question is whether this is the necessary and onlyinterpretation of the findings. The correct response is, certainly not. I firstlearned this lesson in logic as a young child when I took television sets apart.I then learned the lesson formally when I was an electrical engineering studentat Cornell.How do television sets receive their images? Televisions function as receiversfor information carried by certain external electromagnetic fields. As we allunderstand, the sets do not create the visual information—they detect it,amplify it, and display it.What most neuroscientists seem to forget is that the three kinds of experimentsthey conduct are the same three kinds of experiments that television repairmenconduct!Evidence from Recordings. TV repairmen can record the television signals byusing sensitive electronic devices (sensitive probes attached to digitaloscilloscopes). For example, they can place the probe on particular componentsin the circuit and correlate the signals or readings shown on the digitaloscilloscope with the visual images seen on the TV screen.Evidence from Stimulation. TV repairmen can stimulate various components of thetelevision, connecting electrodes from a device at appropriate points inside thetelevision. For example, they can stimulate particular circuits with specificpatterns of information and see replicable patterns on the TV screen.Evidence from Ablation. TV repairmen can remove various components from thetelevision (or areas can be damaged or wear out). For example, they can removekey components, and the visual images on the screen will disappear.Do these three sets of evidence necessarily imply that the origin of the TVsignals is inside the television? Of course not. They tell us that both brainsand televisions play a role in visual experience—they do not tell us what typeof role. The three kinds of evidence, by themselves, do not tell us whetherbrains or televisions are (1) self-creating the information or (2) serving ascomplex antennas-receivers of the information (which comes from outside thesystems).In other words, the three kinds of evidence do not allow us to determine whetherthe signals—the fields—are created inside the system (the interpretation appliedto brains) or are coming from outside the system (the interpretation applied totelevisions). Clearly, additional kinds of experiments—for example,signal-blocking experiments, using electrical and magnetic shields placed aroundthe television set or the entire person—are required to determine whether thesystem in question (a brain or a television set) justifies a creatorinterpretation of the observations or an antenna-receiver interpretation ofthem.In the case of brains, the fact that they seem to be involved with consciousexperience does not necessarily mean that they are creating consciousness.Consciousness may require invisible external fields. Similarly, in the case ofself-organization, the fact that objects appear to self-organize does not meanthat they are actually organizing themselves. Organization may require invisibleexternal fields as well.Finally, in the case of evolution, just because growth and increases incomplexity appear to occur naturally does not mean that evolution isnon-intelligent. Evolution—and what scientists term natural evolution—mayrequire invisible external fields modulated by intelligence, that is,intelligent evolution.PRINCIPLE 2: INVISIBLE ORGANIZING FIELDS ARE REAL, AND THEY ARE THE RULE INPHYSICSPhysics tells us, in no uncertain terms, that invisible fields—includinggravitational, electromagnetic, and quantum fields—are the rule, not theexception, in nature and the universe. We live in a veritable sea of invisiblefields. This infinite sea of fields permeates the vacuum of space withincomprehensively complex networks of structures and organizations. Asastronomer Sten Odenwald writes in Patterns in the Void: Why Nothing IsImportant, “We are forced to confront the fact that something hidden in the Voidis controlling not just the subtle properties of matter but the destiny of theuniverse.”As Einstein said it, “The field is the only reality.” All materialthings—including living systems—are organized by fields, as well as generatingthem. In light of this compelling evidence, logic requires that we entertain thehypothesis that invisible fields play a fundamental role in all physicalphenomena observed in nature and the universe.PRINCIPLE 3: WHY USE TWO EXPLANATIONS WHEN ONE WILL DO?The fourteenth-century teacher and logician William of Ockham is remembered fora principle he set down that we know as Ockham’s Razor; it was made popular inCarl Sagan’s novel and movie Contact. Sagan provides a valid statement of theprinciple when he has his central character, Dr. Ellie Arroway (played in thefilm by Jodie Foster), make the remark, “All things being equal, the simplestexplanation that accounts for the largest amount of the evidence is usually thecorrect one.”As Ockham originally stated his principle, Frustra fit per plura, quod fieripotest per pauciora, which means, “It is vain to do with more what can be donewith less,” and Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem, which means,“Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily.” Scientists as a group tend tobe conservative; they seek “parsimonious” explanations in an effort to beconceptually frugal. I tend to be this way too. Here’s how one could applyOckham’s Razor to the two sets of evidence that need explaining:Evidence Set 1: Certain phenomena have never been observed to organizespontaneously (for example, sand paintings, watches); the evidence is clear thatthey require some sort of an intelligent Guiding-Organizing-Designing mechanismfor them to come into existence, assemble, and evolve.Evidence Set 2: Other phenomena have been observed to organize seemingly bythemselves (for example, tornadoes, oak trees); they appear to self-organizewhen the right conditions are present.One approach—the single interpretation approach—is to posit that a commoninvisible intelligent organizing field process is involved in both sets ofevidence. (An organizing field process can operate externally orinternally—since fields exist both inside and outside individual materialsystems.)A second approach—the double interpretation approach—is to posit that anexternal organizing process (for example, a visible or invisibleGuiding-Organizing-Designing field) is required for Evidence Set 1, and thatsome sort of internal organizing process (termed “self-organization,” which inbiological systems is governed by an internal plan/code called DNA) is requiredfor Evidence Set 2. In other words, it’s possible to employ two differentexplanations to account for observations.However, to apply Ockham’s Razor honestly, it would be best to search for thesimplest explanation that accounts for the largest amount of the data. Bydefinition, this would be the single interpretation approach. The G.O.D.-fieldinterpretation can explain both sets of evidence, whereas the self-organizationinterpretation can explain only one set.Which is your preference—one explanation, or two? If you prefer economy andadhere to intellectual integrity, then it follows that there are bothphilosophical and practical reasons for seriously entertaining a singleinvisible G.O.D. process in nature. Still, what ultimately matters is not whichis the most economical (the G.O.D.-process interpretation), but rather which oneis true. Ockham’s Razor doesn’t always lead to the the right answer; sometimesthe less economical, more complex interpretation actually reflects the truth.Only with additional research can theories that make new predictions eventuallybe confirmed or refuted.But it turns out that Ockham’s Razor is sharper than might be expected. It ispossible to put the invisible G.O.D. universal field process to some novel andrevealing experimental tests and, in the process, discover some potentiallyhidden mechanisms underlying the “destiny of the universe.”AN ANCIENT VISION OF THE SUN AS BEING AN ORGANIZING EVOLVING SYSTEMWould you be willing to consider doing a simple thought experiment with me? Ifso, then imagine that a huge meteor hit the earth, creating a cloud of dust thathas blocked the suns energy for many years. Imagine that the temperature dropsglobally to the point where all water freezes into a solid mass. Would wecontinue to observe rainstorms? Would we continue to see oak seeds grow? Whenwater is frozen, water-related self-organizing processes would be observed tostop self-organizing. And now what do you conclude from this observation?An obvious conclusion is that the many so-called self-organizing systems are notcompletely self-organizing and actually require the presence of other factors,including external fields of energy provided by the sun. A relatively narrowrange of temperature is required for water to exist in a liquid state, which isnecessary for rain to fall and for oak seeds to sprout and become trees.But some more subtle and amusing interpretations of the sun’s potential role inapparent self-organization should be mentioned.The sun is a complex dynamical system that emits a wide spectrum of energies andinformation—from micro and radio waves, through infrared waves, light waves inthe visible spectrum, and ultraviolet waves, to X rays and gamma rays. And allof these bands of photons carry dynamically fluctuating patterns of energy andinformation that can be thought of as being nonrandom quantum codes (as HeinzPagels called them). These complex electromagnetic and quantum codes can play acommunication role in modulating physical systems on the earth and all of itsinhabitants, including us. We are all highly interconnected with the sun’s bandsof energy and information.The sun’s energies can be imaginatively described as a Beethoven symphony playedby a world-class orchestra. The complete spectrum of dynamically changinginformation of the sun, from the lower subvisible frequencies, through theintermediary visible frequencies, to the higher supravisible frequencies, can bethought of as ranging from contrabasses (containing subaural frequencies),through violins, to piccolos (containing supra-aural frequencies), playingtogether full-time in a 24/7 orchestra.The similarity between the sun and a symphonic orchestra in terms of generatingorganizing field information and energy can be shown experimentally. Forexample, it has been demonstrated that if a thin layer of sand is placed in asquare pan and the pan is placed on top of a speaker, sounds of differentfrequencies will vibrate the pan, creating replicable patterns of hills andvalleys in the sand—which can be described as simple sand sculptures.A number of questions may come to mind: Many people wonder if it’s possible thatessential codes for life are carried on the dynamical spectrums coming from thesun. Others ask if it’s possible that what we see as self-organization on theearth is made possible, at least in part, by the dynamic formative fields thatare continuously emitted by the sun. And does the sun create morphologicalfields that help guide, organize, and design what we experience as dynamicphysical life? Moreover, is the sun itself a giganticantenna-receiver-transmitter of invisible intelligent G.O.D.-field signals?If you favor Ockham’s Razor and the search for integrative-unifying explanationsand interpretations, then you can see how the G.O.D.-field processinterpretation not only integrates diverse information but makes new predictionsthat can be confirmed, or disconfirmed, in future research.I repeat: Ockham’s Razor in this case not only integrates information in ahighly parsimonious way, but makes new predictions that can be confirmed, ordisconfirmed, in future research. This is one of the important reasons whyProfessor Wigner would likely label my G.O.D.-field process theory as “mostamusing.”DO WE TRUST OCKHAM’S RAZOR? CAN WE “S.O.S.” AND “SAVE OUR SOULS”?We will never discover whether a G.O.D.-field process is actually interactingand communicating with us unless we are prepared to listen for it. Whether it isacting through nature, through the sun, or ultimately through the complexdynamic network of organizing fields that comprise everything in theuniverse—including the “void” or “vacuum” of space that is teaming withorganizing energy and information—we’ll never find out unless we go looking. Andunless we learn how to interpret these dynamical information codes, we willnever know what the codes actually mean.Consider the following example: “Dit dit dit—daa daa daa—dit dit dit” may soundlike a collection of ordered sounds with no meaning until we learn that, to theold telegraphers and ham radio operators using Morse code, the pattern “dit ditdit” stood for the letter S and “daa daa daa” stood for the letter O. A memoryaid for the emergency signal “S.O.S.” was “Save Our Ship.” According to thisbook, perhaps that should be revived and revised to stand for “Save Our Souls.”If we are going to heal and transform ourselves and the world, then perhaps thetime has come for us to open our minds to the possibility that the answers toour most pressing questions are all around us. It’s possible that the answers tothese questions are being broadcast, like gravitational fields, in alldirections—ready to be received and adopted by intelligent and motivatedindividuals. This help in the form of universal fields of dynamic informationavailable to each of us may be waiting to be received and interpreted.To help you remember this hypothesis, you can think of this S.O.S. signal ascoming from the S.E.L.F.—the Supreme-Eternal-Living-Field—which is a universalexpression of the G.O.D. process. From this perspective, the S.E.L.F. isinvolved in the creation of all organized systems; hence, what we see asself-organization is a special case of S.E.L.F. organization. This is theG.O.D.S.E.L.F.Ockham’s Razor and its favoring of the intelligent-evolution explanation helpsopen our minds to this seemingly incomprehensible yet comforting possibility."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00025.gif]IMPLICATIONS OF G.O.D.

The capacity of the human mind to envision itsapparent infinite potential is as vast as the universe itself. Moreover, themind is ultimately beyond anything we have yet witnessed in the physicaluniverse. The mind’s inherent potential not only goes beyond anything it hasseen to date in the physical world; its potential goes beyond anything it cancurrently imagine. It can even be demonstrated through simple experiments thatyour mind’s potential is bigger—in fact, much bigger—than the universe itself.The human mind, along with its brain, has the ability to discover an infinitecreative and organizing force in the evolving universe—that is, a G.O.D.process—because we are ultimately made of the same stuff and have the sameinfinite potential as “it.” Unfortunately neither you nor I can appreciate whowe really are, and discover why we are here, until we come to recognize thisfundamental truth.Again, this wisdom is captured in that aphorism “The All is in the Small.”I chose with a clear purpose the words “infinite potential” to describe thehuman mind. The history of philosophy and science reveals the human mind asbeing able to envision the infinite and furthermore as being able to develop aformal mathematics of multiple infinities even though humans cannot preciselypicture what a single infinity actually is, much less a plurality of them. Justbecause we precisely picture something doesn’t mean we can envision it.Envisioning includes the capacity for metaphor and symbols—a power that scienceis just beginning to understand.It turns out that it’s quite simple for science to demonstrate the capacity ofthe human mind to envision the concept of infinite, and then to go beyond it. AsI take you through this purposely playful yet profoundly meaningful mentaldemonstration, I want you to imagine yourself performing this thought experimentwith me. There is no substitute for having the direct experience yourself. Inthe process of experiencing this fundamental truth, you will realize that youcan share this demonstration with your children, and help them celebrate theinfinite power of their growing minds.HOW OUR MINDS CAN EXTEND FROM THE “INFINITELY SMALL” TO “BEYOND THE INFINITEALL”Please take a quarter or other coin and place it in your hand.We are about to take an unprecedented mental journey in eleven discretesteps—the size of the first nine steps ranging in scale from the infinitelySmall to beyond the infinite All. We will jump from subatomic physics andchemistry, through biology and psychology, to ecology and cosmology, and beyond.The tenth and eleventh steps contain two surprising take-home messages.STEP 1. A MASSLESS AND SIZELESS PARTICLE IN YOUR HANDImagine that the coin you are holding is a single photon of light. What does itlook like to you? Is it bright? Is it pulsating? Is it changing colors? Is itheavy? Physics tells us that a photon is presumed to be a massless or “virtual”particle (it doesn’t have any weight at all) and it is infinitely small (itdoesn’t have any size at all, either). Whatever you can imagine is okay for now.Just realize that you can imagine what a photon might be, and that physicsexperiments can be conducted to explore what part of your guesses might becorrect. But not now. Remember, infinitely small photons are presumed to reflectthe building blocks of everything in the known physical universe. As the Biblesays and contemporary physics supports, the universe began with light.STEP 2. A SINGLE ATOM IN YOUR HANDNow, imagine that the coin you are holding represents something much, muchbigger. The quarter has become a single atom of hydrogen; for the sake of time,we are skipping the intermediate steps of subatomic particles such as quarks orelectrons and protons.What does the atom look like to you? Is it solid? Is it pulsating? Is itemitting photons you can experience as colors? Can you see the nucleus in thecenter of the hydrogen atom? Try to see the electron cloud surrounding thenucleus. Again, whatever you can imagine is okay. The important thing is torealize that you can imagine what hydrogen might be, and that chemical researchcan be conducted to explore and confirm or contradict your images.STEP 3. A COMPLEX BIOCHEMICAL IN YOUR HANDNow, let’s imagine that the coin you’re holding represents something that isagain much, much bigger. Once more skipping many levels, imagine that you arenow holding human DNA in your hand. What does it look like to you? Does it havetwo strands? Is it shaped like a helix? Can you see the billions of bases thatcompose this essential biochemical molecule of life? Whatever you can imagine isokay. What’s important is that you appreciate that you can imagine what DNAmight be, and we can conduct biochemical experiments to explore it.STEP 4. A SINGLE CELL IN YOUR HANDThe coin you are holding is about to get much bigger again, jumping many levelsof size. This time imagine that you are holding a cell, a human neuron, a singlecell of the nervous system. What does it look like to you? Can you see thedendrites? Can you see the synapses? Can you imagine the neuron firing? Whateveryou can imagine, the key is that you can try to picture the neuron.STEP 5. A LARGE ORGAN IN YOUR HANDThe coin is now about to make a jump in size that will be particularly dramatic.Imagine that you are now holding approximately 100 billion cells in your hand,in the form of a human brain. What does it look like to you? Can you see itsshape? Can you see the ripples in its surface that look like valleys? Can yousee the brain pulsating? Can you imagine electrical brain waves flowing acrossthe surface?STEP 6. A WHOLE ORGANISM IN YOUR HANDThe coin is about to increase in size again. Imagine that you are now holding anentire person in your hand. What does it look like to you? Is she a child, or anadult? Can you see her hair color? Is she smiling at you? What is she trying totell you? The key is that you imagine this person.STEP 7. A ROTATING PLANET IN YOUR HANDOnce again, a huge jump in size is about to take place in your hand. Imaginethat the coin you are holding represents the entire planet earth. What does itlook like to you? Can you see which areas are cloudy and which are clear? Canyou see the deserts and the oceans? Is the earth spinning on its axis? How heavydoes it feel? We can conduct ecology experiments to discover the nature of thisplanet.STEP 8. A SWIRLING GALAXY IN YOUR HANDThe jump in scale for the coin you are holding in your hand will now become evenmore extraordinary. Imagine that you are holding an entire galaxy in your hand!Can you see the billions of stars that are like tiny cells in its structure? Canyou see its spiral shape? Is the galaxy spinning in your hand? How heavy does itfeel? Imagine the galaxy, and we can conduct astronomy experiments to discoverthe nature of this almost comprehensively large system of stars that you areholding.STEP 9. THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IN YOUR HANDAll these steps of imagination—from photons and biochemicals, through cells andpeople, to planets and galaxies, are but training for what you are about to do.You are about to go beyond what anyone has ever seen—beyond what the mostsensitive telescope has witnessed. What I want you to do is to imagine that thecoin in your hand has become the entire universe! You are literally holdingeverything that exists in the entire universe in the palm of your hand. Whatdoes it look like to you? Can you see the billions of galaxies cupped in yourpalm? Is the universe itself pulsating? Can you see it expanding? Is it spiralshaped, or is it like a ball? Is it evolving, becoming more complex as youobserve it? Whatever you can imagine is okay. However, it’s not possible to testscientifically what you are experiencing, because what you are holding in yourhand—imagined through the power of your mind—extends beyond the most sensitiveof astrophysical devices yet conceived of by the human mind.STEP 10. YOUR MIND HOLDING THE UNIVERSE IN YOUR HANDAs you have seen, the coin can be imagined as a photon, infinitely small, or asthe universe, infinitely large. There is nothing to stop you from imagining thatthe coin even contains an infinite number of universes, each having an infinitesize. The fact is, whatever you can envision and imagine, you then have thepotential to go beyond. Theoretical mathematicians do this all the time.And next—this amazing step; along with a powerful question. Who is it who isaware that his or her hand is holding the universe? Who are you who can imagineholding an evolving universe or universe of universes in your hand? Clearly, the“I” that is “you” can look beyond virtually everything—and I mean everything.Your mind can witness all of this, and more.The potential of your mind is so vast that it is beyond comprehension—but now,as a result of this innocent visualization exercise, you have some sense of itsvastness. Over these ten steps, you have used your mind to hold every level ofeverything that has ever existed in the universe in the palm of your hand. Thequestion is, where does all this mind power come from? Did the mind just happenby chance? Or is your mind part of something else? Can you imaging holding yourmind in your hand?STEP 11. THE UNIVERSAL MIND OF GOD IN YOUR HANDHowever powerful our individual minds are, we can raise the question “Is there aUniversal Mind that is beyond ours?” Are our individual minds—our “small”minds—part of a much greater mind, the Universal Mind of the All? And does theUniversal Mind of the All exist within our small minds? As we have askedthroughout this book, is the All within the Small?Can you imagine, as you hold the universe in the palm of your hand, and “you”have this experience, that a mind even greater than yours is witnessing you dothis? This may be a new idea for you, but if you try, you can imagine thispossibility, too. In fact, you have the inherent capability with your mind toimagine holding the Universal Mind in your hand.So, even as you imagine beyond the All of the universe, you can imaginesomething even greater that is enabling you to do this. That is how gigantic thepower of your mind is. You can actually imagine having the power of “God”—evenholding the entire universe in your hand—while, simultaneously, you can imaginethat you are a living expression of an infinite G.O.D. process.AN ESSENTIAL CAVEATThose of us formally trained in clinical psychology, psychiatry, or social workhave had experience treating mental madness. We know well that just because it’spossible to imagine something does not mean that the something is real. Andalthough science fiction frequently precedes science discovery, some sciencefiction is precisely that—fiction. However, these criticisms are obvious, andthey do not undercut the essential message of the exercise you’ve just beenthrough.Which is greater in scope: the currently known physical universe, or the humanmind that contemplates it? “Who can hold what in one’s hand?” Yes, the universeis outrageously larger than our material body. This is an obvious physical fact.However, the scope of our mind is extraordinarily larger than the known physicaluniverse. This is a less obvious psychological fact but a fact worthremembering, and celebrating. It is the key to awakening to the power of ourminds and their role in the cosmos.APPRECIATING THE EVOLVING MIND IN AN EVOLVING UNIVERSEThe truth is, no one knows what the actual potential of the mind is—becausewhatever greatness we have already achieved as a species suggests that there isno apparent limitation to the mind’s ultimate potential.Facing reality in the twenty-first century causes one to ponder the scope ofcontemporary evolution as we witness it. When I use my word processing programon my laptop computer, in the righthand corner of my screen sits a little wizardwho turns his head, blinks his eyes, raises his hands, and every now and againnods his head in approval. Sometimes he even raises a tiny wand in his hand. Hereminds me of the amazing imagination of the human mind and the remarkableevolution of computer software over the past thirty years.I can switch to my Internet browser with the click of a mouse, and immediatelyreceive vast amounts of information about virtually everything—from superstringsand photons, through cells and people, to astrophysics, metaphysics, and sciencefiction. All this knowledge and information is a manifestation of theever-evolving human mind.Over thirty years ago at Harvard, I purchased a PDP11/GT40 computer system thatcame with 16K (16,000 bytes) of memory and cost $40,000. The computer took up awhole room. I purchased an additional 8K of memory that was the size of a largesuitcase, at the cost of $5,000. This large machine did not have calendar, phoneand address book, word processor, or spreadsheet software. I had to program thecomputer using Fortran, BASIC, or FOCAL to draw a graph or put text on thescreen.My PDP11/GT40 computer, though it cost a great deal of money, didn’t have alittle blue and gold Merlin with a big nose, mustache, and beard. The littleMerlin reminds me of the stupendous power of the human mind to both understandand shape the world, and in the process, understand and shape itself.Today I carry a pocket digital assistant with 64 megabytes—64 million bytes ofmemory. It remembers my schedule, phone numbers, addresses, favorite quotes,ideas, writing plans, questions to ponder, expenses. It is a genuine mindassistant and was designed by human minds. I paid $500 for it in 2002.What technology will exist thirty years from now? Will the jump be as great asover the last thirty years? What do you think?The desk I had been using when I wrote this chapter was near a window that facedthe entrance of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Hanging fromthe upper ledge of the museum was a two-story green banner, probably twenty feetwide and thirty-five feet long, imprinted in huge white letters with the wordGODDESS; it was meant to attract New Yorkers to the current art show. Thepotential of the human mind is certainly showcased by the work of great artistswho, through recorded history, have envisioned goddesses and gods.I began to wonder, is the need to visualize goddesses and gods simply areflection of human ignorance and superstition combined with a heavy dose ofarrogance and wishful thinking? Or does our need to imagine some sort of aG.O.D. process actually reflect our implicit understanding that our truepotential genius as an emerging species expresses the infinite genius of aconscious intelligent evolving universe?Are we humans like little Merlins—tiny goddesses and gods—gifted not only withpersonal and family responsibilities, but planetary and cosmic responsibilitiesas well?As you now have learned, chance will never create a Michelangelo painting, letalone a simple sand painting or a little painting of Merlin. People createpaintings. What is painted is a reflection not merely of what already exists butof what can exist in the future.THE EVOLUTION OF DESIGN AND OUR EVOLVING UNDERSTANDING OF DESIGNERSAlthough this book offers evidence that leads inexorably to the conclusion thatsome sort of cosmic Guiding-Organizing-Designing process exists in the universe,I want to step back for a moment to consider different ways of envisioning whata designing process is. Clarity of thought is necessary in order to appreciatehow this book’s conclusion is dependent on the scientific evidence. If we are toever conceive and understand intelligent evolution, we must become intelligentabout evolution, and therefore become intelligent about the process of design.There are at least five different ways of envisioning how design operates on theearth and may operate in the universe as a whole.The first and simplest way is to posit that each designer functionsindependently of every other. Independent design creativity is viewed here ascompletely individual, reflecting the unique propensity and personality of thedesigner. Most thoughtful people recognize that this simple perspective, byitself, is incomplete. Humans do not exist or learn in a vacuum—we learn fromone another, as well as from nature.This leads to the second and third ways of envisioning the designing process.Here we assume that designing is governed partly by shared genetics(gene-mediated design) and partly by shared experience (environment-mediateddesign). In other words, our capacity to design—as well as the particulars ofwhat we design—reflects our common genetic heritage plus our commonenvironmental heritage. Whatever we design—automobiles, buildings, computers,drugs, games, jewelry, music, poetry, software, trains, weapons—reflects acombination of our DNA code plus our respective experiences and education.These three ways of envisioning the designing process—independent,gene-mediated, and environment-mediated—though obviously true to variousdegrees, reflect only part of the designing process. A fourth way of envisioningdesign can be termed “interdependence.” The fact is, typically we do not designas individuals; we design as groups, teams, or systems. From software toautomobiles to weapons, teams of tens, hundreds, or thousands of individualminds are brought together to design things that work. “The whole is greaterthan the sum of its parts” applies to the designing process and the evolution ofdesigns over time.Those who are open to the existence of a larger spiritual reality—as describedby the evidence reported in my book with Bill Simon, The AfterlifeExperiments—will be able to envision the possibility of a designing process thatincludes team members “from the other side.” While serious investigative work inthis controversial area has only just begun, scientific integrity andresponsibility still require that we include the possibility that a designer ordesign team could be influenced from this other side source as a fourth way ofunderstanding design. However, the question arises, are these four ways ofenvisioning design sufficient to account for all aspects of design—not just byus, but as it is expressed all around us? The evidence from Parts Two throughFour says “No.”Based on the evidence I have presented, it is beyond reasonable doubt toconclude that all things existing—from subatomic particles, through humans, togalaxies and beyond—have not occurred by chance. Therefore there is some sort ofa fifth evolving creative design process, which I term G.O.D. It is also beyondreasonable doubt to conclude that humankind’s capacity to design things, as wellas the particulars of what we design, reflect a purposeful manifestation of thisuniversal designing process.HOW DOES THE G.O.D. PROCESS CONTRIBUTE TO OUR INTELLIGENT DESIGNS?What is the reasoning that leads us to conclude that our personal efforts atdesigning are guided, at least in part, by a higher if not universal designingprocess? There are many reasons why I include a fifth way of envisioning humandesigning, as reflecting the expression of a universal, macro, or meta-designingprocess in the universe. Here are a few of them.First, as you now appreciate, complex orders in the universe cannot come aboutsimply by chance—they require some sort of an intelligent designing process.Hence, the premise that some sort of universal Guiding-Organizing-Designingprocess exists everywhere in the universe is a required logical deduction.Second, if everything that exists in the universe is a reflection of thisuniversal creative designing process, then by definition the “everything”includes you and me and all of us. It logically follows that if universal designis the rule and not the exception, then humans are an integral expression ofthis designing process. We apparently carry the latest evolution of thedesigning process, at least in terms of what is known on the planet at thistime. Simply stated, if any evolved organism on this planet has the capacity toserve as an antenna-receiver for the universal G.O.D. process, it is the humanorganism.Third, it’s well known that most of the energy and information that science hasdocumented as existing in the universe cannot be directly experienced throughour five senses. What we see with our eyes—as exquisitely complex and beautifulas it is experienced through vision—reflects only a tiny number of all photonsin the universe. The visible frequency spectrum of light is but a tiny slice ofthe entire electromagnetic/photonic frequency spectrum of energy discovered andaccepted by current science.Invisible fields affect the functioning of every cell in our body to variousdegrees. By definition, the All of energy includes the complete set of knownenergies in the universe, as well as those yet to be discovered. We shouldresist the temptation to be arrogant and conclude that current science hasuncovered everything there is to discover about potential energies and evolvingfields in the universe. The existence of dynamic invisible fields provides oneplausible means by which a universal designing process could potentiallyorchestrate infinitely complex unfolding plans and designs.The evolution of cell phones reminds me of the vast potential for invisiblecommunication and guidance in the universe. I recently attended a University ofPennsylvania graduation ceremony and witnessed something I could never haveimagined forty years ago when I was an undergraduate at Cornell. There wereapproximately three thousand graduating seniors sitting in chairs in FranklinField, and there were probably more than fifteen thousand family and friends inthe stands.While the faculty was marching in, everywhere I looked on the field I sawundergraduates speaking into cell phones, and everywhere I looked in the standsI saw family and friends speaking into cell phones. There were probably morethan a thousand simultaneous cell phone conversations taking place between thefield and the stands at that very moment. The radio waves were of courseinvisible to the naked eye. There were no wires connecting the students to theirparents and loved ones. The calls were interconnected via the invisible radiofrequencies. Most remarkably, each of them could hold a separateconversation—they did not experience one massive jumble of frequencies andwords!It’s valuable to remember that humans did not create radio waves; the universedid. However, humans have learned how to use radio waves for long distancecommunication and control. Is the existence of radio waves, and their remarkableproperties, merely an accident of nature that humans have harnessed for specialpurposes? Or do radio waves exist for one or more purposes provided by aGuiding-Organizing-Designing process? Could radio waves be a manifestation ofintelligent evolution?ARE PHOTONS PURPOSELY DESIGNED TO BE “WEIRD”?Sir James Clerk Maxwell, the distinguished nineteenth-century scientist—whobelieved deeply in God—was the first researcher to provide an explanation andset of mathematical formulas that integrated the entire electromagneticspectrum. His formulas led the way for scientists in the twentieth century todiscover how all electromagnetic waves, including radio waves, could function asphotons. And, as mentioned before, most photons vibrate at frequencies that areinvisible to our physical senses.Yet there is a curious property of photons—including the visible ones—that foryears struck me as particularly odd until I asked myself the question, Ifphotons were designed this way, what was the purpose of the design? The word“odd” is a modest term for this truly amazing fact of photons. A more honestterm is “beyond extraordinary.” Many people who learn this fact will make apoint of never forgetting it. Moreover, if one were looking for a phenomenonthat deserved the label “miracle,” it would be this property of photons.If in a vacuum we take one laser beam, and then cross it with a second laserbeam, an astounding phenomenon occurs. When the second laser beam is turned onand it reaches the first laser beam, if the two beams are completely in sync,the streams of photons will summate when they cross. If the two beams arecompletely out of sync, the streams of photons will cancel each other out whenthey cross. But after they cross, the beams continue as if nothing had happenedat all. The two beams cross, they combine or cancel, and then after they cross,they return to their prior state as if nothing had happened.Simply stated, visible light is “invisible” to light. Though the statement issimple, the explanation remains a mystery. While the totality of thelight—termed “interference”—is momentarily altered when the light beams cross,the individual beams are completely transparent to each other: they do not losetheir individuality once they have crossed.This phenomenal property of photon action raises a fundamental question.Answering this question requires that we go beyond the current comprehension ofscience. How can one beam of light have its energy add or subtract from anotherbeam of light, and then continue as if nothing has happened? How is thisphysically possible?The interpretation provided by contemporary physics leaves one’s head spinningin disbelief—yet may be correct. We are told to accept the idea that photons aremassless “no things” that are “spaceless” and function metaphorically as“ghostlike somethings.” Photons are described as “infinitely small,” and we aretold they vibrate with utter accuracy, and because they are massless, they areinvisible to one another. And this is what physics asks us to accept withoutproof.Why does light behave in this curious way? Why would the universe createinvisible massless and spaceless quanta of energy with this bizarre property?I conclude that the reason for the bizarre quality of light iscommunication—communication of both existing and potential orders and designs!A simple way to picture this is as follows. Imagine that you have twochildren—Skott and Kim (the names of my godchildren)—and they are standing a fewfeet apart from each other. The light that reflects off Skott reaches both ofyour eyes. The light that reflects off Kim also reaches both of your eyes. Ifyou doubt this, try closing each of your eyes in turn as you look at twochildren in a row. You can see both children with either eye. The light fromSkott and Kim must therefore cross in complex ways as they reach each of youreyes. If photons were like billiard balls—objects with mass—then as the objectsbumped into one another, they would change their direction and behavior. By thetime the billiard photons reached your eyes, you would see a mess—a mixture ofthe two children.However, photons do not function like billiard balls—they function like virtualparticles. Because they are completely invisible to one another, they can conveythe individual shapes and behaviors that capture the individual structures andfunctions of Skott and Kim. So we can see two people at the same time asdistinct beings because of the extraordinary properties of light. Is itreasonable to speculate that this extraordinary property of photons happened bychance alone?When I look at the sky at night—especially at the big sky over Tucson—I can seethousands of stars with my naked eye. Through powerful telescopes at the KittPeak National Observatory outside of Tucson, I could see millions of galaxies,each containing billions of stars. And with the Hubble telescope located inspace, I would be able to see billions of galaxies. All this light crosses inthe vacuum of space. The light from billions of billions of stars crosses in thevacuum of space, yet each and every star maintains its individuality. It cancommunicate its uniqueness. Try to imagine this fact!Photons not only have a kind of immortality—which is how we can see light thathas traveled for millions if not billions of years, but they also provideinformation with such precision and accuracy that incomprehensibly huge amountsof information can be contained in incomprehensibly small spaces.If mere humans can design future space telescopes to look into the farthestreaches of the universe, isn’t it possible that the universe—so to speak, acosmic astrophysical G.O.D.—could have designed the nature of light itself insuch a way that would make it possible for us to look into the farthest reachesof the universe? Remember, for the light from the edge of the universe to reachour eyes, and for us to see the images clearly, the light would have to functionin such a way that it preserved the information carried over billions of yearsof time. Is it possible that “God’s codes,” as in Pagels’s “cosmic codes,” areexpressed as information in invisible light beams? For example, could there bean infinitely complex code of information carried by cosmic superrays thatpenetrate all objects to various degrees?Perhaps the universe acts like one huge cosmic cell phone. Perhaps theGuiding-Organizing-Designer messages are being broadcast throughout the entireuniverse. If so, perhaps everything that exists in the universe picks up thissignal to various degrees.Is the world awakening to this profound cosmic communication process? Are humanson earth meant to discover this process just as we discovered radio waves? Arewe, as the philosopher Spinoza wondered, germinating intelligent cells in theevolving body of God?The word “science” comes from the Latin scire, which means “to know.” I believethat if such questions are not asked, answers may never be found.Remember, you—and your children—have the potential, with your individual minds,to conceive of holding individual photons in one hand and simultaneously holdingthe whole universe in your other hand. You are meant to wonder and to know.It has been said, “As above, so below.” Systems science teaches that the reverseis also true. “As below, so above.” The Small is in the All, and the All is inthe Small. The implications—for science, education, business, politics, law,religion, and all of human society—are staggering.ALBERT EINSTEINNot everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can becounted."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00027.gif]EVIDENCE-BASED FAITHA NEW WAY OF MARRYING SCIENCE AND SPIRITBelief is profoundly important in everything we do. Belief is what guides ourattention. Belief is what leads people to seek in particular directions, andtherefore to discover. Belief also plays a powerful role in motivation. It’s onething to know how to fly an airplane; it’s another to believe that you can doit. For whatever reason, knowledge is not enough. So it is my belief thatscience might provide definitive answers to fundamental questions such as “Doesthe soul continue after physical death?” and “Is the universe the result of acreative and intelligent designing process?” Belief in possibilities is whatmotivated me to conduct the research presented in The Afterlife Experiments andto proceed with research and analysis for this book.What we choose to believe, what we ultimately come to accept on faith, comesfrom five possible sources. So that science and faith can become two sides ofthe same coin, I will now describe how it is possible for you to take ascientific approach and extend your belief to faith. I propose that if peoplecould develop the capacity to practice evidence-based faith, we could have thepotential to globally resolve our conflicting beliefs and faiths, and in theprocess discover the means to live in peace, balance, and harmony.FIVE WAYS OF FORMING BELIEFSIn the following section, I use the term “belief.” Once you understand how thefive-part structure is applied to the word “belief,” you will be able to reapplythe structure to the word “faith.” The potential transformation from belief tofaith is important because to have faith one must have trust. When we witnessthings happening 100 percent of the time, such as apples falling from trees,implying the existence of invisible gravitational fields, or sand paintingsmixing in a box, implying that something more than chance is required to createsand paintings, we can put our faith or trust in this evidence.Evidence-based faith is far different from blind trust; it is open-mindeddiscerning trust. And it is intelligent trust. Similarly, evidence-based beliefis not blind belief; it is open-minded discerning belief. And it is intelligentbelief.How many of these five ways do you use in forming your beliefs?1. EDUCATION-BASED BELIEFSThe first way we form our beliefs is to absorb what we are taught by ourparents, community leaders, teachers, and clergy. Individually and asrepresentatives of their institutions, these people instruct us about what weshould believe. The beliefs we are taught may be true, partly true, or not trueat all; they may accurately represent quality values and reality, or they may bequite removed from them. The extreme education-based believer says, “If myparents/president/teachers/clergyman taught me this is true, then it must betrue.”2. EMOTION-BASED BELIEFSHowever, many beliefs are formed by factors other than education and culture. Weoften develop personal preferences for specific beliefs: our emotions lead theway. Our beliefs may be wish-based rather than education-based—or they may be acombination of the two. Sometimes our beliefs are shaped by unconscious needsand desires, including anger and fear. The emotion-based believer says, “What Ibelieve is what feels right to me. If it feels good, it’s real.”3. EXPERIENCE-BASED BELIEFSPersonal experiences and associated intuitions can powerfully shape our beliefs.When our experiences match what we have been taught and even what we want tobelieve, the resulting belief is more firmly embedded. When our experiences donot match what we have been taught, or what we want to believe, we can becomeseriously confused. But the committed experience-based believer says, “I believewhat I see and experience, regardless of whether you see it or not.”4. REASON-BASED BELIEFSLogic can also be a powerful factor that shapes our beliefs, especially if weprefer the rational over the intuitive. It is curious that logic often leads toconclusions that are inconsistent with education, wishes, or experiences. Thisis especially the case among thoughtful superskeptics. They fully understand howlogic is leading them to form new conclusions that are inconsistent with whatthey were taught, what they want to believe, or what they have personallyexperienced, and they will become anxious and angry even as they are convinced.They prefer not to be convinced; it hurts too much.The extreme reason-based believer says, “If there is no flaw in the logic, thenit must be true.” The extreme reason-based believer would reject any new logicthat doesn’t match his or her own.5. EVIDENCE-BASED BELIEFSThis is the empirical, “show me” approach to believing. It is the approach ofthe genuine scientist, the open-minded explorer who looks not only to personalexperiments for evidence, but to experiments conducted by others that areconvincing.In the deepest sense, all children are natural scientists. Through intelligenttrial and error, they discover what is safe and what is not, what works and whatdoesn’t, what gets them scolded and what gets them praised. They compare theirexperiences with others, and grow accordingly. Learning about reality is firstand foremost an evidence-based process. The extreme evidence-based believersays, in essence, “I ultimately don’t care what I have been taught, what Ipersonally want or experience, or even what logic tells me. What matters most iswhat replicable experiments in my life and the laboratory reveal.”IGNORING LOGIC AND EVIDENCEPeople whose beliefs are based primarily on education, emotion, and experiencetend to dismiss or ignore logic and evidence. This is a prescription for bias,prejudice, torture, war in the name of God, and even worse. However, the greatprophets, seers, and mystics combined personal experience with evidence; theylooked for replication and verification before they drew their conclusions. Theywere “experimenters” in the truest meaning of the term.Unfortunately, just because one uses the term “scientist” or even“evidence-based” does not mean that one is doing so with integrity. Too oftenscientists choose the evidence they prefer—what fits their education, emotion,personal experiences, or preferred reasoning—and discard the evidence they donot like. This, of course, is completely unacceptable. If a person is going topractice evidence-based medicine, create evidence-based theories, or evenestablish evidence-based religions, then all the evidence must be fairlyrepresented whether one likes the evidence or not.EVIDENCE-BASED FAITHThe term “evidence-based faith” may seem a contradiction in terms—an oxymoron.Most people keep one bucket for everything supported by evidence, and acompletely separate one for everything based on faith.But there are others like me who regularly practice evidence-based faith, evenin the conduct of science. This applies to drawing conclusions that are not onlybeyond reasonable doubt but virtually beyond any doubt.When I take a day away from the university campus to teach the concepts ofenergy and force to high school students or to medical researchers, I perform asimple demonstration. I take an eraser, a book, a set of keys—whatever objectsare handy—and holding out my arm, I release the object from my hand.Every time I’ve released an object in this way, it has fallen to the ground.Even though I know, in principle, that this will not happen in the space shuttlewhen it is orbiting the earth, and even though I can imagine, in principle, thatsomeone might one day be able with their mind alone to slow the object’s fall oreven suspend the object in midair, what happens when I release objects on theearth is that they fall to the ground with a thump, a plink, or a splat.Releasing objects is as reliable as taking a sand painting and shaking it in apot. The object falls every time. The sand painting mixes always. Can we put ourfaith in something that happens 100 percent of the time? I would say “virtuallyyes.” What I mean by this is that even though the object has fallen 100 percentof the time, and the sand has mixed 100 percent of the time, this does notabsolutely guarantee that it will happen this way in the future. Something mightchange.Hence, in order to continue to be virtually 100 percent sure that the event willhappen in the future, it is necessary to continue repeating the experiment everynow and again. The experiment must continue.This is why I am attentive when I drop things. It never hurts to check. Myessential belief is that it is adaptive to live an evidence-based life, and toput one’s faith in evidence-based conclusions—which by definition always leaveus with a little room for doubt.However, if the evidence says that something has happened 100 percent of thetime in the past, then we have reason to believe, not with absolute certaintybut at least with virtual certainty, that it will likely happen this way in thefuture. This is the strongest form of evidence-based faith.If something happens approximately 45 percent of the time—which is about theaverage of shooting baskets from the floor for great basketball players—we canput our faith in the fact that in the foreseeable future, it will continue toaverage around 45 percent of the time. We can expect the great basketballplayers to average 45 percent shooting—some games will be less, and some will bemore. However, we will continue to gather evidence in order to keep our faith ina given player’s performance. He could get depressed, or begin to lose hisskill, or suffer from a debilitating infection. Or, over time, dazzling youngplayers might come along who would manage higher averages.Evidence-based faith is reality-based faith. It is open-minded faith. It isflexible faith. It is discerning faith. It is intelligent faith. Comprehensiveevidence-based faith takes evidence from a variety of disciplines such asphysics, mathematics, psychology, and parapsychology, and when the observationsall lead to the same conclusion, accepts the resulting conclusion asevidence-based faith.In this book I have taken evidence from physics (sand mixing 100 percent of thetime), from mathematics (the normal curve appearing bell-shaped 100 percent ofthe time), from psychology (the mind’s capability to extend its understandingfrom the infinitely small to beyond the universe itself ), and fromparapsychology (certain individuals being able to dream about future months’events in advance) as together providing evidence of orchestration of complexpersonal lives. I have considered the implications of this combination ofevidence honestly and forthrightly.This is not a book to promote taking on faith what our parents, professors,politicians, or priests tell us to take; or taking on faith what our emotionstell us; or taking on faith what our personal experience tells us; or eventaking on faith straightforward logic.Rather, I am suggesting that we should put our trust—and therefore our faith—inreplicable evidence. Then if and when the evidence changes, we can change ourminds accordingly.MY PERSONAL EVIDENCE-BASED FAITHI have come, slowly but surely, to develop an evidence-based faith concerningthe existence of a Guiding-Organizing-Designing process in the universe as awhole. I have come to develop an evidence-based faith in intelligent evolution.I did not come to this faith from my parents (they were agnostics, at best) nordid I come to this conclusion from my education (in fact, many of mydistinguished professors were atheists).I did not come to this faith from my emotions (they were conflicted at best).Like most scientists, I wanted to be accepted by my peers, and I was frightenedto entertain intelligent-evolution hypotheses that were viewed as mistaken ifnot outright taboo by many of my colleagues. But for the sake of humankind andlife in general, I wished there was meaning and purpose to life and a way toexplain it.My faith is first and foremost evidence-based faith. I did not initially come tothis faith from my personal experience. I never saw an apparition of a man witha flowing white beard, or had mystical experiences I could label with confidenceas coming from the divine.But once I began to be open to the possibility of a universal G.O.D. processwhile I was at Yale, and I began asking the universe for information, I hadexperiences that were strikingly consistent with the idea of a universal G.O.D.process that, with time and logic, led me to accept the conclusion about theexistence of God.The set of logical principles that brought me to that conclusion came especiallyfrom contemporary systems science—the logic that leads to the idea of the All inthe Small.However, it is the weight of the evidence, spread over multiple disciplines andcontexts, that together brings me to a conclusion I can trust: that some sort ofuniversal, creative, and intelligent designing process is part of the veryessence of the evolving universe itself.EVIDENCE-BASED FAITH—IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR LIVESHow might we live our lives differently if we were to accept the evidencebasedconclusion of the G.O.D. process as true?If evidence-based faith were adopted, how might we evolve not only our personallives, but the institutions we create—from science and education, throughbusiness and law, to politics and religion?First, let’s consider our personal lives. Since we would now be open to a largerplan and purpose in our individual lives as well as the lives of people weinteract with, we would begin to become ever more aware of the coincidences andsynchronicities that exist in our lives. By pondering these matters andsearching for their meaning, we would search within ourselves, as well. And thissearch would also include our relationships with others. We would continuallyask questions like: “What might this coincidence mean? What is the lesson I ammeant to learn from this situation? How can I take advantage of this learning,this gift, or this disappointment, to benefit myself, my friends and family, andthe world? We would learn to listen to the G.O.D. process and perhaps we wouldlearn to hear, as well.Over the years I have become ever more aware of the obvious as well as subtleindications of coincidence and synchronicity in my personal life. Also, I havereconsidered major and novel events that have happened whose properties I laterlearned had profound meaning.I am planning to write a book that will be devoted to describing how all peoplecan discover connections to the G.O.D. process in their daily lives, using mypersonal journey as a playful example of how this can be successfullyaccomplished in an evidence-based faith. However, to offer one example here, Iwill briefly share an event that happened in my life and the spiritual meaningthat occurred to me only thirty years after the event happened.It was late May 1966, two days before I was to graduate from Cornell. I wasdriving on the East River Drive in New York City with Jeanne, my wife of oneyear. I was twenty-one, she was twenty. It began to rain heavily; she grewnervous and asked me if I would pull off at the nearest exit. Sensing heranxiety, I took the next exit. The exit was flooded. In front of us, a stalledJaguar blocked the lane. I stopped. Our 1965 white Opel—a tiny car with no frameto speak of—promptly stalled too. I then did something strange. In my head Iheard a voice that said, “Put on your seat belts, now.” I had never worn a seatbelt, and I had never asked Jeanne to wear hers either. I didn’t even know howto put it on. However, I had never heard that voice in my head before, and I wasnot about to argue. I started struggling with my belt while asking Jeanne toplease put on hers, as well. She was surprised by the request but did what I hadasked. About a minute later, a Mustang came barreling off the freeway at aboutfifty miles an hour and smashed into the rear of our car. We were literallysandwiched between the Jaguar and the Mustang. Our car was totally demolished.Jeanne’s seat was ripped from the floor. I was later told that if she had notbeen wearing her seat belt, she would have been thrown through the window andkilled, or at least have been paralyzed from the waist down. I received a brainconcussion and suffered temporary memory loss. Later I was told that in theambulance, semiunconscious, I kept screaming, “I have retrograde amnesia.” Itwas a correct diagnosis. The next morning I awoke and was told that my wife wasin a room down the hall with a severe broken back.Meanwhile, not only did I have no memory of the car accident, I had no memory ofbeing married! I knew who Jeanne was—we had met each other as freshmen—but I hadlost memory for about three years of my life. To this day, I have almost nomemory from a couple of hours before the accident to twenty-four hours after it.Within a week after the accident, much of my memory had returned, including avivid recollection of hearing that protective voice in my head. The car accidentnot only dramatically changed Jeanne’s life and mine, but affected the lives ofour parents as well. It contributed to suffering that extended beyond physicalpain. Jeanne’s mother, Rose, committed suicide a few months later, in part overthe mental anguish about her daughter’s condition, and I made up my mind to goto Harvard, which would put Jeanne near her father and sister. I always wonderedwhat my life would have been like if the car accident hadn’t occurred. Jeanne’smother might have lived. I probably wouldn’t have gone to Harvard. If it werenot for Jeanne’s severe back pain, which lasted for more than twenty years andprevented her from lifting weights, she and I would probably have had children.But even more interesting is the insight that came to me just a few years ago. Ihad never considered the profound implications of an obvious yet inexplicablefact of this accident that I had overlooked. Our car was completely destroyed.The trunk was protruding through the backseat; the engine was protruding throughthe front floor. Jeanne’s car seat was held in the vehicle by her seat belt. AndI had received only a small bump on the back of my head, erasing my memory ofthe accident. I had no broken ribs, no significant bruises, no cuts from theglass. Nothing. Ordinarily an accident like this would have buried the steeringwheel in my chest. Ordinarily an accident like this would have badly mangled oreven buried me.So how and why was I spared? Was the accident simply that, an accident? Or was Isomehow protected? Was this part of my life’s lesson—to come to ponder theexistence of possible invisible guidance and protection in our lives? The factis, when the accident happened, I never entertained such thoughts. I originallyinterpreted the voice in my head to be my own voice—Jeanne was anxious, I gotanxious, and I simply made a wise choice. Case closed.However, as I finally began to ponder the physical reality that something quiteanomalous had happened—first I had heard a voice, then I did something I hadnever done before: put on the seat belt. Yes, I suffered temporary memory loss,but I had been completely spared from total devastation.No one had taught me to be open to the possibility that there is more to lifethan meets the eye. No one had suggested to me that the amazing properties oflight I had learned in physics might portend the existence of a truly amazinguniverse whose potential is greater than any of us have yet imagined. It took meover thirty years to develop evidence-based belief in a G.O.D. process and theimplications of intelligent evolution. Now that I believe in the possibility, Iam able to understand things I didn’t even ponder before. This exampleillustrates more than just seeing meaning, purpose, and patterns in our lives,or learning how to go with the flow. It also suggests that we should not beafraid to ask for advice and guidance. In short, I suggest that we would all bewise to stay open to receiving helpful information from a higherintelligence—even if you don’t know or aren’t yet convinced of the actualsource.Another remarkable example of extraordinary coincidence and guidance supportedby hard evidence in physical reality is included in Appendix C. The experiencesreported there will truly challenge your ability to see novel information withopen and discerning eyes.When a thought pops into your head, the fact is you really don’t know where ithas come from. There are many possibilities that can be considered. The thoughtcould have come from your conscious mind, your unconscious mind, the mind ofsomeone else who is physically alive (telepathy), the mind of someone else whois deceased (mediumship), a higher intelligent entity (perhaps angels), or eventhe G.O.D. process.Regardless of the source, if you don’t ask for information, you may not receiveit. If you are not open to receiving information, you will likely not hear it.However, if you are open to hearing from the G.O.D. itself, you have anincreased chance of hearing. Remember, in this part of the book we are dealingwith operating from the perspective of evidence-based faith. We are concludingthat “the All is in the Small”—that an intelligent G.O.D. is in everything,including us.In the personal information front page of my PDA, I sometimes have the phrase“Ask God First.” I do this to remind me to develop a new habit—to regularly askthe universe for assistance, and see what pops into my head. Of course, whatpops into my head could be just my imagination—it could be inaccurate if notcrazy. I won’t know until I ask the question and see what I receive. Neitherwill you.For the record, I am not suggesting that we blindly accept whatever pops intoour heads and act on this information indiscriminately. Discernment is aprerequisite to intelligent, wise, and reality-based decision making.We must learn not to blindly reject information that comes to us intuitively. IfG.O.D. is inside each and every one of us, we are foolish to ignore this clearand deep well of wisdom.Seeing evidence of a higher purpose and plan, and seeking guidance about thiscreatively unfolding plan, are two concrete changes worth making in our personallives. Furthermore, we can all become more open-minded about this invisibleinfinite potential, and in the process we can become humble servants of thepotential goodness and healing that exists. Becoming more open-minded and humbleis fundamental to growing and evolving. Systems science teaches that emergentproperties—unpredicted, unexpected events—are the rule, and not the exception,in systems.My fondest example is the one I gave earlier: how hydrogen and oxygen, twoinvisible gases at room temperature, can join forces and become the watermolecule, taking on a set of unprecedented and completely unpredicted emergentproperties that are unlike any other liquid in the universe. Just looking at theproperties of hydrogen and oxygen as gases alone could not predict that theycould create a liquid which when frozen, would create an infinite number ofcomplex crystalline structures termed snowflakes.At every level in nature, when new systems emerge, “the whole is greater thanthe sum of its parts”—the pattern of properties is unique. The potential fornovelty in the universe is incalculable.Every now and again a great mind is able to make a prediction about potential.Probably the most famous is Einstein’s realization of E=mc2 , which led to theinception of the atomic age. Very few physicists would have guessed that so muchpower could be held within such a little space. These days physicists arepredicting that there will be more potential energy in a single cubic inch ofthe vacuum of space than represented by all the matter in the universe. How’sthat for a spectacular prediction!In the same way that objects fall and sand mixes, it is a logical and evidentialfact that the universe has infinite intelligence and infinite potential, so Iuse the terms “infinite intelligence” and “infinite potential” with clearpurpose and much care. With evidence-based belief in the existence of a creativedesigning process in the universe, a person becomes more open-minded,discerning, and humble. And in the process, a person becomes ever more thankfulto have been given a mind capable of appreciating all that the universe has tooffer. We become more appreciative and joyful as we are able to experienceblessings on a daily basis.WERNHER VON BRAUNI find it as difficult to understand a scientist who does not acknowledge thepresence of a superior rationality behind the existence of the universe as it isto comprehend a theologian who would deny the advances of science."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00028.gif]IMPLICATIONS OF INTELLIGENT EVOLUTION FOR SOCIETYBRINGING G.O.D. TO SCIENCE, EDUCATION, MEDICINE, BUSINESS, LAW, POLITICS, ANDRELIGIONWhen I was a child, we started each day in school saying the pledge ofallegiance to the flag. I remember the line “One nation, under God, with libertyand justice for all.” Some of my more mature friends said, “one nation, withliberty and justice for all.”As I look back at my early education, I realize that I began each day pledgingsomething I did not understand. What did it mean to say, “One nation, underGod”? Was I to take this literally? Now I wonder if we could expand this greatthought to say, “One species, under God.” Or, “One world, under God.” Or even“One universe, under God.”Raised to be an agnostic, I did not know whether or not there was a God but Idid not mind saying the word in the pledge. Then when I was older, saying thewords “under God” seemed unscientific to me, if not downright superstitious.However, I later learned that the founding fathers of the United States were notonly great leaders and visionaries but were deeply religious and spiritual aswell. On the back left side of a dollar bill is a pyramid that is topped by ashining eye. Most people—including Americans—have no idea what the religious andspiritual significance of this symbol is. Some claim that the symbol comes fromthe Freemasons and the Rosicrucians, that Benjamin Franklin was both a masterMason as well as a Rosicrucian, and that Thomas Jefferson also was aRosicrucian. This was certainly never mentioned when I went to school.Another claim is that it is derived from a secret society called the Illuminati(a sect that some believe Galileo may have belonged to). Supposedly they calledit their “shining delta.” The eye purportedly signifies the Illuminati’s abilityto infiltrate and watch all things. The shining triangle representsenlightenment. The triangle is also the Greek letter delta, which is themathematical symbol for change, transition, transformation.Curiously, the words underneath the pyramid say Novus Ordo Seclorum, which canbe translated to mean “New World Order” or “New Secular Order.”In fact, “secular” could also describe this book. I have not discussed anyspecific religious beliefs or practices—Hindu, Jewish, Christian, Islamic,Rosicrucian, Illuminati, or other. This is not a book about religion orreligious orders—it is about scientific evidence for the existence of God andwhat this could mean to our future evolution. I mention the United States dollarbill and the phrase “In God We Trust” to remind the reader that the idea of Godwas central to the formation of this country—and it was connected to theconcepts of “liberty and justice for all.”But that subject has been discussed often enough by the media, by scholars, andby politicians in Washington, D.C. Let me rather consider some of theimplications of an evidence-based-faith approach to God for some of the majorinstitutions that define human culture. Given the scope of the G.O.D. idea, itshould not be surprising to discover that the concept has implications for everyhuman activity.RESURRECTING INTELLIGENCE AND G.O.D. IN SCIENCEIf science has the potential to solve the mystery of mysteries as well as servethe mystery of mysteries—as stated in the Prologue—then it has a sacredresponsibility to do so. If some of science’s current theories need to beamended or eliminated in light of new evidence, then this should happen. Sciencehas the obligation to amend or eliminate a theory if it turns out to beincorrect. Unlike classical religions, which are faith-based and can sustaintheir beliefs regardless of evidence to the contrary, science is supposed to beevidence-based and must change its beliefs in the light of new evidence.The fact that certain scientists defend their favorite theories and theorists isunderstandable, and in certain contexts is even lovable. Scientists areprotectors of ideas, and they have their heroes. However, every scientist whohas ever lived has been human, and humans make mistakes. Not one of us isperfect. For science to have integrity, it must acknowledge not only that ourunderstanding as humans may be limited, but that the universe itself may beevolving, and therefore our understandings may have to evolve as well.It is my view that scientists need to develop and extend their capacity foropen-mindedness with humility. But the training of these traits is notemphasized in contemporary scientific education; I will work for changing thisunfortunate reality.There are various levels of implications of evidence-based faith in God forscience. The simplest level is to reconsider the role of random sampling andrandomness not only in the universe, but in whatever discipline the scientist isstudying. If everything is interconnected to various degrees, and trueindependence is present only in very unique and limited situations (for example,photons crossing in the vacuum of space), then we need to spend time gatheringnewer statistics that account for the massive interconnecting networks of energyand information. Though nature will be seen as ever more complex, containingintricate implicit purposes and plans, the resulting new discoveries about theorganizing nature of nature itself will reward future scientists beyondimagination. It will no longer be acceptable to blindly apply random samplingtechniques to interconnected phenomena; statistical techniques derived fromchaos and complexity theory will need to be developed.Beyond this, scientists face a challenge on an even more complex level: to buildbridges between disciplines—to create integrative disciplines that look forparallels across domains. This book, for example, integrates examples ofevidence from physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, psychology, andparapsychology. The evolution of integrative science will discoverinterconnections that can allow for the revelation of creative intelligentdesign in all levels of science. If scientists and religious leaders cantogether agree to adopt an evidence-based approach to belief and faith, thecapacity for each to inform the other will be manifest. Einstein put it thisway: “Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.”For the record, I should state what is hopefully obvious by now. If you asked methe question “Are you trying to use science to prove the existence of God?” myresponse would be, “Absolutely not. What I am attempting to do is to use thescientific method in an open-minded manner to enable God—if he/she/it/theyexist—to prove his existence himself.”I am not a God thesis advocate; I am a Veritas advocate—Harvard’s motto, theLatin word for “Truth.” And I am attempting to use science to provide the “Lightand Truth” called for by Yale. If G.O.D. exists, then I will honor the evidence,and be its faithful advocate. I am neither an evolutionist, creationist, orintelligent designist. If I am anything, I am a “truthist”—following theevidence wherever it goes.As we’ve seen, the evidence to date overwhelmingly rejects chance alone as aplausible explanation of order and evolution in the universe, and stronglysupports the conclusion that some sort of an intelligent G.O.D. process existsin the universe. Intellectual honesty and integrity require that science finallyhonor this evidence and recognize the probable reality of intelligent evolution.Even systems science—which leads to G.O.D. through its focus on interconnection,interdependence, complexity, and emergence—can evolve when G.O.D. becomes partof the equation. Systems scientists like to say that the relationship betweentwo components (be they two particles, two people, two planets, or two galaxies)is a two-way street.However, maybe the relationship is actually a three-way street—with G.O.D. asthe center lane. Moreover, maybe secular science (which assumes that nothingexists until proven otherwise—technically called the “null” hypothesis instatistics) needs to be balanced by “sacred” science (which assumes that G.O.D.exists unless proven otherwise). This leads to the creation of a balanced,integrative science that combines the advantages of both perspectives forlearning and evolving.RETURNING INTELLIGENCE AND G.O.D. TO EDUCATIONThere is no bigger or more important idea than an intelligentGuiding-Organizing-Designing process. If this thesis is true, then it should bea foundation of future education. Children hunger to be taught that theexistence of some sort of G.O.D. process is as fundamental as the existence ofgravity. Since education will be improved when fearless children face theteacher, G.O.D. is best incorporated, when appropriate, into education. Thiswill add a solid base to the rapidly expanding, ever changing, mysterious worldof knowledge.“When appropriate” means to suggest that science teachers need not have theirstudents pray to God for laboratory experiments to come out right, or thatschools should encourage language teachers to have their students pray to Godthat the right meanings and grammars pop into their heads when they make atranslation. I am also not suggesting that science or history be reinterpretedfrom any particular religious point of view. What I am suggesting is thatstudents learn about the existence of God with the same thoroughness that theylearn about their society or history. If universal intelligent, trial-and-errordesigning is essential for understanding the origin and nature of life, love,and liberty, then these ideas should be taught to students.The new G.O.D. education I am proposing is not the limited faith-based Godinterpretation promoted by any single religious group—Jewish, Christian,Islamic, whatever. As also proposed in Tomorrow’s God, it includes core aspectsof each but does not include the whole of any. Though it is wise for theeducation community to be moderately religion-phobic, it need no longer beG.O.D.-phobic.BRINGING G.O.D. TO MEDICINE AND HEALINGThere was a time when priests and shamans were scientists as well as healers.They communed with God (or the Great Spirit), retained and transmitted theirwisdom and traditions, made fundamental discoveries about nature and health, andserved in the roles of doctors and counselors. They practiced rituals,meditated, and ingested special plants and herbs to enhance their communicationwith the larger spiritual reality so as to achieve the noble goal of servingtheir communities.When we accept the evidence for the existence of a ubiquitous G.O.D. process ineverything, including us, this provides an increased rationale for contemporaryhealth care providers—be they hi-tech surgeons or low-tech energy healers—topray for their patients as well as to become open to receiving guidance andassistance from above (sometimes referred to as intuition from within). Does thehealth care provider who believes in G.O.D. and prays for his or her patientshave more successful treatment outcomes? The healing process becomes viewed as athree-way street between the patient, the healer, and G.O.D.Perhaps we can look forward to a time when the G.O.D. process becomes an activeand accepted component of the healing process. We would look to G.O.D. to assistus in discovering new uses for herbs and plants as well as help in creatingcombinations of compounds whose emergent properties are greater than theproperties of the individual components (from simple synergisms to completelynew properties). We would use conscious intention and prayer in the creation ofnew compounds to enhance their potential effectiveness. Though suggestions suchas these may sound far-reaching (if not far-fetched), we must consider suchpossibilities with an open and discerning mind if we are to discover how far theG.O.D. process hypothesis may extend into our daily lives.CONSIDERING ESSENTIAL FEEDBACK FROM G.O.D. IN BUSINESS DECISIONSThe business community is not particularly known for its lofty ethics andvalues. Business—particularly big business—is viewed by some as an institutionthat is motivated by greed, self-interest, and profit focus, with little concernfor the future of our species or the planet. The United States governmentimplicitly encourages its business women and men to push the limits ofregulation so as to earn as much money as possible.The argument can be made that the more money companies earn, the greater will bethe number of people who have jobs, the greater our collective affluence, andthe greater the influence and power our country will have in the world.Moreover, the thesis is that if problems arise for people and the planet, thepublic will raise its voice, and both business and government will respondreasonably. In principle this philosophy is fine, and our nation has grownfinancially strong from this approach. However, compelling evidence exists allaround us that the philosophy may not be working very well, especiallyconcerning the health of our planet, and by extension, the health ofindividuals.Consider the following visionary possibility. What do you think might happen ifbusiness leaders were to reexamine their principles and consider receivingguidance and direction from the universe? If we are an evolving product of aninfinite intelligence—and I emphasize “if”—the evidence indicates that we havebeen curiously given substantial freedom to believe what we want to believeregardless of whether or not our particular beliefs match reality. We even havethe freedom to believe or not to believe in the existence of an infiniteintelligence that potentially provided this gift of freedom in the first place.Freedom to believe, for better or worse, appears to be a purposeful part ofintelligent evolution.We have a choice not to believe in G.O.D. And we can run our businesses withoutthinking about G.O.D. in the context of what we do, which is of course the waymost businesses function. However, we also have the choice to believe in G.O.D.and express it. We can, if we so choose, take G.O.D. into account in the designand execution of how we conduct our business lives. Should we “ask G.O.D. first”when we make business decisions? Should we place this information on theboardroom table, and see how it fits with what we want to do? Are CEOsultimately under the invisible guidance of G.O.D.? What if corporate CEOs wereto ask for more overt guidance from G.O.D.? Would our world become healthier,joyful, more peaceful and fulfilling?INTELLIGENCE AND G.O.D. IN THE COURTROOMWe have designed our legal system, and our laws, based upon our collectiveexperiences as a species. Save for the Ten Commandments that the Old Testamentdescribes being given to Moses on Mount Sinai, humans have made their own socialrules and designed their own legal systems. At least that is how we tend tothink about these things. Of course, if we entertain the idea that everythingthat exists reflects some direction from an invisible G.O.D. who functions frombehind the scenes, we can look to the structure and evolution of our laws andlegal systems and potentially see evidence of invisible guidance in the evolvingprocess.The United States’ legal system, the one I am familiar with, is currently insomething of a crisis. The strategy of opposing advocacy—prosecutor versusdefender—too often places more emphasis on winning than on discovering truth andrendering justice. The stresses in the system are symbolized by the process ofthe O. J. Simpson trial and the Supreme Court’s handling of the Bush-GoreFlorida voting crisis.What would happen to the legal system if G.O.D. was brought into the courtroom?What would happen if ideas for improving how the legal system works, as well asspecific decisions themselves, included some input from G.O.D.?I’m not suggesting that we go to the local oracle and simply follow what she orhe says. What I am offering as a possibility is that in the future, teams of“evidence-based oracles” will be able to obtain replicable information undercontrolled conditions that can be verified—and that the information these teamsgather would be willingly taken into account as an integral part of a legaldecision-making process.If all this information, this guidance and wisdom, is available, waiting to bereceived under the right conditions, then it seems prudent for us to considerattempting to discover if this prediction is correct. Wouldn’t it be wonderfulif our evolution as a bio-psycho-spiritual species includes our awakening tothis infinite wealth of virtually free information?ONE EARTH, UNDER GOD, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALLIf evidence-based faith is justified, and evidence-based oracles can bedeveloped in the future, the potential exists to evolve our world to the pointwhere politics is world politics rather than national politics—where world peacewith prosperity can prevail.Throughout recorded history, tribes have attempted to control other tribes, andnations have attempted to control other nations. The warring nature of peoplehas resulted in more injustice and tragedy than probably any other aspect of ourbehavior. The fact is, children can be raised to love like Mother Teresa or hatelike Saddam Hussein. Humans are gifted with the potential to revere nature orrape her. We have the capacity to be tender to others or torture them. Like thesurgical knife that is neither good nor evil—it can be used to save a life or totake it—humans, too, are neither good nor evil. We can teach each nextgeneration to promote love and compassion, or to foster hatred and terror.Humans have the potential to heal or hurt.The question is, what potential behaviors do we wish to nurture? What kinds ofhumans do we wish to become? What is to be our destiny and our species’ legacy?In a free society, politicians ultimately serve the people—the power is in thepeople. And in societies that are not free, time and time again the people haverisen up against oppressors and insisted that their needs and dreams be met.However, with power comes responsibility and accountability. What is ourresponsibility, and for what are we each accountable?Imagine that the answers we need to these vital questions already exist. Imaginethat the information is available if we are willing to ask. And imagine that thekey to opening this door to wisdom and greatness simply requires that we adoptevidence-based faith. Can politics evolve from disinformation and excessive egoto integrity and humble leadership? Can we think beyond our states and nationsto become one people living on one world, with one G.O.D.? As the deeplyspiritual film Dragonfly states so succinctly, “Belief is what gets us there.”In the process of writing this book, I have come to believe that the best ispossible. If it is real, it will be revealed, if we are willing and ready toreceive it.THE RESURRECTION OF HONEST AND COMPASSIONATE RELIGION?Though I will probably regret writing the following words, I must share them forthe sake of integrity. If we look honestly at the history of humankind, theevidence overwhelmingly shows that religion has played both the most grand andthe most horrific roles in our evolution. In the name of God and brotherly love,we have killed and maimed our human, animal, and plant families. On the onehand, we have built the most magnificent cathedrals, and we have written themost haunting words and music. But on the other we have tortured or killedmillions of people, or in milder circumstances treated those who did not agreewith us with disrespect and injustice.My personal opinion is that religion has been humankind’s greatest socialsuccess and its most miserable failure. Religion has supported the very highestideals and also practiced the very lowest. Religions have splintered intocompeting factions of all shapes, sizes, and colors. There is no unifiedBuddhism, Judaism, Christianity, or Islam. Each contains hundreds of factions(depending upon how you count them). And the factions get along with one anotherabout as well as the major religions get along with one another—which is notvery well at all.Religions, essentially faith-based and not evidence-based, if they wish to beconcerned with truth, must ultimately include scientific evidence to help shapetheir beliefs and ideals. To repeat the words of Wernher von Braun that appearat the beginning of this chapter, “I find it as difficult to understand ascientist who does not acknowledge the presence of a superior rationality behindthe existence of the universe as it is to comprehend a theologian who would denythe advances of science.”Religion needs to become evidence-based if it is to survive as a viable systemfor helping humans reach their potential, individually and collectively. As theDalai Lama writes in his book The Universe in a Single Atom: The Convergence ofScience and Spirituality, “If scientific analysis were conclusively todemonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept thefindings of science and abandon those claims.” He goes on to say that no one whowants to understand the world “can ignore the basic insights of theories as keyas evolution, relativity and quantum mechanics.”I am not proposing that the world must have one religion any more than I amproposing that the world must have one culture. I have come to the conclusionthat the G.O.D. process actively stimulates and celebrates diversity. But we canbecome one family, and live in harmony on one planet, without having to eat thesame food, listen to the same music, wear the same clothing, or even speak thesame language. Our capacity to be different—to be individuals—is part of ourspecial gift and is consistent with an experimenting G.O.D. process that hascontributed to the creation of nature that contains both ladybugs and scorpions,angelfish and tiger sharks, cardinals and vultures, tabby cats and cougars. Innature, diversity is the rule, not the exception. The same rule applies tohumans.However, behind virtually all religions are certain fundamental spiritual ideasand values that ultimately connect us to our common source—a G.O.D. Canreligions come together, accept the mistakes of their past, correct the mistakesof the present, and evolve accordingly into the future without dragging theirpast differences along like Marley’s chain?All religions have their shadow side; the question is, can they acknowledge itand grow from it? (I do not mean to stereotype when I raise the followingquestions; not all religiously conservative persons hold these views.) Canfundamentalist Jews admit that some of their priests misbehaved badly during thetime of Jesus and some of their present rabbis are engaged in economic behaviorsthat are inconsistent with universal love and compassion? Can orthodoxChristians admit that some of their priests behaved inhumanely during the timeof the Inquisition, and that too many of their priests have recently engaged insexual behaviors that are inconsistent with universal love and compassion? Is itpossible for conservative Islamists to admit that hatred and revenge drove manyof their religious leaders to support the horror of 9/11, and that, even now,some of their leaders engage in terrorist behaviors that are inconsistent withuniversal love and compassion? As mentioned earlier in this book, what isrequired is courage and humility combined in balance—the eagerness to learn, tocelebrate contributions and virtues, while at the same time admitting tomistakes. The fact is, none of us is perfect, nor are our institutions.As for the future—can people create an evidence-based-oracles association thatincludes oracles from all the major religions? Can we conduct sacred scienceresearch in the future that honors different traditions united by a commonagreement to let the data speak?It is not enough simply to believe in a God that fosters love and compassion forall; we know that blind belief is insufficient.What seems necessary is to bring science to God and God to science, andestablish the living reality of a ubiquitous G.O.D. process. We must learn toaccept the limitations of our past histories and raise them to a new level. Allpeople must see what we can become, and decide that this is how we prefer tolive and believe.Billions of people are currently searching for purpose and meaning in theirlives and the life of the universe, even as the evidence clearly indicates thatthe choice is ours to make. Science no longer is taking God away; science isdiscovering God in every place it looks and bolstering our beliefs. Science needno longer be seen as an enemy of God; science is becoming his/her/its/theirultimate servant. Contemporary science is becoming the universal tool by whichwe can know God and reveal the great potential—the spiritual genius—that existswithin and around us.Science is enabling people not only to see the power of our individual minds; itis enabling us to discover the Universal Mind that provides the spark thatignites us all.A CALL TO EVOLVE EVIDENCE-BASED FAITHJust as it is possible to conceive, in principle, of an infinite series ofinfinite numbers, we can conceive, in principle, of an infinite intelligenceallowing infinite potential.What we do with this stupendous power of mind—this penultimate gift—is up to us.Will we become servants of universal goodness, beauty, opportunity, and justice?Will we evolve into a bio-psycho-spiritual species of which we can be proud?Will we develop our ultimate gift, the capacity for infinite love (discussed inthe Epilogue)? The evidence is all around us—the choice is ultimately ours. Andfrom the perspective of evidence-based faith, this potential—this grandchoice—is within our grasp.How do we change our minds about mind and G.O.D.? Can science help us with thisseemingly impossible task?GERALD L. SCHROEDER, PH.D.Changing one’s paradigm is not easy. Millennia passed before humankinddiscovered that energy is the basis of matter. It may take a few more yearsbefore we prove that wisdom and knowledge are the basis of—and can actuallycreate—energy, which in turn creates matter."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00029.gif]THE ORGANIZING MINDNEW DISCOVERIES SHOW HOW THE MIND ORGANIZES MATTERAs I was writing this chapter, Lonnie Nelson, now a Ph.D. but then a brilliantgraduate student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Arizona,was completing his fifth and final experiment for his master’s thesis. When Ilooked at the results of this experiment, my reaction was, “Okay, I give up.” Heappeared to have demonstrated that a person’s state of mind leads electrons in aspecial electronic device to become more organized, even at a distance. Thatconscious intention can increase the organization of electrons flowing in aresistor shielded from both electrical and magnetic influence is a conceptworthy of courageous thought.The device he had been using, a random event generator, or REG, detects electron“noise” in a resistor, which is assumed to be random. A computer counts andplots the distribution of this electron noise over time. The REG used in ourlaboratory was designed and built by the Princeton Engineering AnomaliesResearch laboratory (known as PEAR) in the Department of Electrical Engineeringat Princeton University. The pioneering work from PEAR, described in ProfessorRobert Jahn’s and Brenda Dunne’s book Margins of Reality, requires that werevise our understanding about how the universe works.An elegant series of studies conducted over two decades has shown conclusivelythat the human mind can influence the seemingly random behavior of balls andelectrons, not only from a few feet away but from a distance of thousands ofmiles away as well; in these tests, the human subjects demonstrated theirinfluence when working with mechanical machines such as pinball-like devices,and with electronic machines such as REGs. They are also called RNGs, whichstands for random number generators.For most subjects, the effects are very small, but they are highly reliable andreplicable. If the average number of hits and misses detecting an electron inthe REG averages 50 percent, people can shift the average up and down byintention alone approximately 2 percent.In Paul Pearsall’s Wishing Well, current research on the organizing mind isreviewed, and the implications for human life and health are illustrated. When Iread Paul’s book, I remember feeling (and resisting) the Margaret Mead statementquoted earlier, “These are the kind of data I wouldn’t believe, even if theywere true.” But these data are valid. The data are real, and truth is supportedby evidence. Moreover, the data are predicted by contemporary physics andsystems science.It was Lonnie’s fifth and final experiment that convinced me he had discoveredsomething wonderful in our laboratory. One of the members of Lonnie’s master’scommittee wanted to make sure that the effects he was observing were not due tosubtle hand movements. To address this valid question, Lonnie and I designed thefollowing experiment.The subject was requested on some trials to move his hands up and down a fewinches directly above the REG device. Though the device was electrically andmagnetically shielded, and therefore should not respond to simple electrostaticbody-motion field effects, we ran the hand movement trials nonetheless. On othertrials, the subject moved his hands up and down four feet away from the device.It is known that electrostatic body-motion field effects decrease dramaticallywith distance; hence, if moving hands did have an electromagnetic effect on theREG, the effect would be larger when the hand movement trials were close to thedevice. The order of trials was counterbalanced as required by controlledexperimental design. After each one-minute trial, the subject rated how absorbedhe was (that is, how well he had managed to concentrate on the task), and alsothe degree to which he lost track of time (a measure of “trance” or “daydream”state).The data spoke for themselves. Distance per se had no measurable influence onthe average number of hits and misses of the electron’s behavior detected andtracked precisely on the computer. In other words, the electromagnetic shieldingworked as designed by the electrical engineers at Princeton. However, the trialswhere the subject reported being in a deeper trance or daydream state,regardless of distance, were associated with statistically significant increasesin the organization of the electrons’ behavior. Just as Lonnie had found in hisprevious four experiments, high states of trance or daydreaming were associatedwith increased organization of electrons in the REG.It is important to understand that in this research, the subject was notattempting to influence the device per se with his mind. The person was simplymoving his hands, or playing a computer game, or deliberately daydreaming, ordoing different kinds of meditation. Regardless of the task, when the subjectwas more absorbed, the REG responded with increased order. In other words, in asystem where electrons have relative freedom to change their behavior (that is,they have relative independence—recall that contemporary physics tells us thatnothing is completely independent), the electrons spontaneously became moreorganized in the presence of an absorbed, organized mind. Remarkably, theorganization of the subject’s mind was paralleled to some degree by theorganization of electrons in the REG. Mind and electrons, connected overdistance, spontaneously resonating together. A new form of the synchronizationdescribed in Steven Strogatz’s book Sync.FROM ONE MIND TO MANY MINDS ABSORBED IN SYNCHRONYIf you follow the reasoning, you are led to the prediction that groups of minds,joined by a common cause and absorbed together, might have an even greatereffect on REGs. Research by Roger Nelson and colleagues from Princeton and byDean Radin, currently at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, as well as by DickBeirman, a professor at a university in Germany, have separately andcollaboratively documented many examples of group consciousness effects on REGs,even over thousands of miles of distance. I know that this sounds hard tobelieve, but when we let the data speak, sometimes the data say very strangethings; in quantum physics, there is actually a term for such things: they’recalled “quantum weirdness”!My colleagues and I conducted an experiment that truly challenges thecommonsense belief that randomness can exist in nature. We collected REG datatwenty-four hours a day from Friday through Sunday over three consecutiveweekends, with a pre-test weekend baseline in Arizona, an experimental weekendin New York, and a post-test weekend baseline in Florida.The experimental weekend was at an international Qigong conference in New YorkCity, where approximately twenty-five hundred practitioners of Yan Xin Qigong, aparticular form of Chinese meditation, met for a conference. I brought a laptopcomputer and the REG device to the meetings, and recorded the REG data both inthe meetings and during the evenings back in the hotel. The meetings includedgroup meditation practices, watching dancing, hearing meditative music, andlistening to Qigong lectures.There were three possible predictions.Prediction 1: There would be no REG organizing effects during the conferenceperiods. The conference periods would look like non-conference periods recordedas baselines in Tucson and Boca Raton.Prediction 2: There would be REG organizing effects observed during theconference periods, but the effects would disappear during the night and alsoduring periods when the conference broke up into groups. This was the predictionmy Western U.S. collaborators made.Prediction 3: There would be REG organizing effects observed during theconference periods, and these effects would carry over and continue, even whenthe device was moved back to the hotel. This was the prediction made by myEastern Chinese collaborators. They claimed that the group qi continues evenduring the evenings, since they meditate and interact virtually nonstop for theentire weekend.The Evidence: What did the data say? The Western scientists were wrong: the datasupported Prediction 3. Much to my surprise, the REG continued to deviate fromchance throughout the entire weekend. Was this just a New York City effect? Ordid this have something to do with the Qigong conference? (The questions aretantalizing, and I look forward to conducting follow-up studies.)However, whether the effect was due to group Qigong, group process per se, NewYork City group consciousness, or other possible sources of synchrony is notimportant here. What’s important is that reliable deviations in REGs could beobserved, even in group contexts, and that the behavior of electrons inelectromagnetically shielded devices is not immune from the organizing influenceof the human mind—individually or collectively.Mind may be able to organize matter in ways that the mind has yet to evenimagine. As Paul Pearsall describes in Wishing Well, and Larry Dossey inReinventing Medicine, the mind is more than amazing—it may be an expression ofthe ultimate organizing process, a Universal Organizing Consciousness.In a most remarkable series of recent studies, William Tiller, professoremeritus from Stanford University, and his colleagues have been documenting howmental intentions can be imprinted in an electronic device that then alters thestructure of systems, even when the devices are shipped and tested thousands ofmiles from where they were imprinted. In my favorite example, Tiller andcolleagues have the devices imprinted with the intention that the pH of waterwill be increased. They then ship the devices, along with control devices notimprinted with intention, across the country for blind testing in a laboratory.The imprinted devices, when placed near water, produce an alteration in the pHof water as recorded by a computer. The control devices do not.Tiller proposes that the mind is the original and ultimate organizing process.This parallels what the physicist Gerald L. Schroeder, Ph.D., author of TheScience of God, proposes in the quote that introduces this chapter.These are indeed paradigm-shaking experiments whose implications change ourvisions of everything. The general predictions follow directly from theintegration of contemporary physics with systems science, and they point to theexistence of a G.O.D. process in the universe as a whole.IS THE AGE OF PERCEIVED INDEPENDENCE COMING TO AN END?—IMPLICATIONS OF UNIFIEDFIELD THEORY FOR THE INTEGRATION OF SCIENCE AND SPIRITUALITYThe age of independence may be coming to an end. As Einstein said it, “Ourexperience of separation may be an illusion of consciousness.”The new science of dynamic interconnectedness, as expressed in Ervin Laszlo’sThe Whispering Pond: A Personal Guide to the Emerging Vision of Science, leadsus slowly but surely to an alternative vision of a creative unfolding,Guiding-Organizing-Designing universe, and therefore the end of randomness as weonce thought we knew it.In the process, this emerging vision provides us with “a reason to hope” (thetitle of R. Wayne Kraft’s visionary book). Everything may ultimately matter,including our wishes and even our prayers.The great question becomes the origin of intention in all things everywhere.Even what we see as disease may be revised by the emerging vision. Here is whatI wrote in my 1983 master lecture to the American Psychological Association; the“third perspective” referred to is a special kind of complex order that inlayman’s terms we think of as dis order.The implications of this third perspective for viewing health suggests that whatare typically called diseases are not random disorders. Rather it is proposedthat disease serves some ordering function for the evolution of the humanspecies and nature in general. This ordering perspective encourages researchersto attempt to create a “periodic table of diseases” just as others have createda periodic table of the elements….This analysis implies that there may well be a wisdom [intelligent evolution] todisease, and that people may need disease in order to help them be healthy. Inother words, the existence of disease provides people with essential feedbackthat informs them of the fundamental rules for survival and evolution. If theylisten to this feedback, they have the potential to evolve to the extent thatthey recognize how these fundamental limits and regulations are essential forsurvival and growth.However, it is now the twenty-first century, and biology can guide us only sofar. Our capacity to evolve our mind and consciousness is key, in addition toacademic knowledge. With knowledge comes the need for the emergence of wisdomand taking personal responsibility.It may be time that we start taking personal responsibility for the organizingpotential of our minds, and learn how to become a wise species. Though it hasbeen wise historically to separate Church (religion) and State (government), itmay be time scientifically to connect G.O.D. (universal spirituality) withState; for example, “In G.O.D. We Trust.”SAMImagine that you have stepped outside the whole universe, And you are seeing itas a Gigantic Caterpillar of Living Galaxies, Slowly but surely readying totransform into a Rainbow Colored Butterfly universe of indescribable beauty …"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00030.gif]WISDOM IN THE STARSIS THE UNIVERSE NOT ONLY INTELLIGENT BUT WISE?Many women and men throughout recorded history have dreamed of the possibilityof homo sapiens evolving into something grander. Evidence of this potentialevolution can be witnessed by examining our species history with integrity. Ifwe focus on the positive, we can see how religion, science, technology,politics, education, medicine, law, business, and so forth have all evolved intoever more complex systems capable of great power and goodness.For example, as Dr. Jonas Salk proposed in his prophetic book The Anatomy ofReality: Merging of Intuition and Reason, evolution, especially human evolution,has progressed from being survival of the fittest through survival of thesmartest to survival of the wisest. In a word, Salk is proposing that evolutionis evolving. Yes, evolution itself is evolving.In medicine, there was a time when surgery was conducted with nonsterilized,relatively dull knives on patients who were awake. Surgery has evolvedprocedurally and technologically. The tools are becoming ever smaller andgentler—knives can now be directed by fiber optics, even by computers, and otherforms of “knives” such as tiny lasers are becoming available. Anesthetics haveevolved as well, and through contemporary versions of ancient techniques such aselectroacupuncture and guided-imagery hypnosis, pain is being lessened. Clearly,our bodies must be fit for us to survive biophysically. And visionaryindividuals like Dr. Andrew Weil, on the faculty at the University of Arizona,are leading that parade of integrative medicine toward wellness.But the time has come for people to be smart and intelligent in addition tobeing fit, healthy, and strong in order to survive. And it is becoming clearthat our planet will not survive, and therefore we won’t either, if we do notlearn how to use the evolving knowledge wisely—and that means with courage,integrity, caution, responsibility, kindness, and humility. Humans have thecapability to become an evolving wisdom species that can transform itself beyondits caterpillar past history and become its butterfly future.It appears that as a species we have the intellectual potential not only todestroy or disintegrate everything (our destructive side), but to integrateeverything (our constructive side) as well. If all things are indeedinterconnected and interdependent, then we are all part of the Almighty One. Infact, according to contemporary field physics, we are never alone—rather we are“all-one.” We need to learn to experience atonement, which is “at-one-ment.”Can we envision our inherent evolutionary potential? Is it time to changedirection and see with new eyes? Is the answer simply more technology, or mustwe see the universe in an alternative or new way?The Buddha said: “If we do not change directions we will end up where we aregoing.”As a young assistant professor of psychology and social relations at HarvardUniversity, more than thirty years ago, I accidentally followed a train of logicthat frankly terrified me. I ultimately published a scientific description ofthe logic as a scholarly chapter in an academic book in 1977, but my colleaguesin psychology and medicine were clearly not interested in the vision.The logic, though compelling, was too unifying and covered too many disciplinesand levels of nature to hold their attention. In addition, the argument wouldforce all who followed it to reevaluate the underlying logic of doing what wewere doing (and going where we were going). At that point in time most of mycolleagues were opposed to any professional and personal soul-searching. Theyneeded to focus on their careers and success. My vision was distracting andtherefore not to be considered.The vision came to me in a way that was both humorous and humbling.THE LESSON OF THE SUPERSTOMACH—HOW EVERYTHING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GO OUT OFCONTROLIn the spring of 1972, I had recently completed my Ph.D. at Harvard, and I wasteaching my first large undergraduate lecture course. It was a course that I hadnever taught before, and to the best of my knowledge, it had never been taughtbefore by anyone else. This new course bridged biology, personality,consciousness, and health. It had the unusual title Biopersonality and the Mindof Man.Since there was still carryover from the sixties, the topic attracted hundredsof students, who were to attend a single two-hour lecture on Wednesdayafternoons along with weekly class discussions in small groups that were taughtby my team of graduate teaching fellows. Since there were no existing textbooks,I pulled together diverse references from many sources to comprise the uniquereading list.I began each week with a rising anxiety as I had to read the upcoming materialsto prepare for the two-hour lecture. Like clockwork, Wednesday morning was asuperstressful time for me, and I regularly had a stomachache. I would spendsignificant time reading and organizing the materials and trying to quiet thediscomfort of my stomach. The pain was severe at times, but I could see no wayout. I had created this unusual course in the first place, and I was determinedto give the students the best lecture possible. I had promised a lot and wantedto deliver even more.Three quarters of the way into the semester, on one of those Wednesday mornings,I was preparing to give a lecture on biofeedback and psychosomatic diseases thatwould address the interrelated topics of stress, feedback, self-regulation, andhealth. My body was fighting me and I was hurting and feeling sorry for myself.I wondered why I, with the iron stomach, had to have this digestive ache.For the afternoon lecture I was preparing to talk about Dr. Walter Cannon’s bookThe Wisdom of the Body. So I paused to examine the concept of pain as being afeedback process between my body, brain, and mind and I asked myself thequestion, Is my pain serving a purpose? And I immediately realized that mydigestive pain was telling me that I was living my life in a manner that was toostressful and unhealthy. My stomach growled at me in a private language that Inot only could hear, but could listen to. The pain was trying to slow me down,to focus my attention on what I ate and how I was living. My body was telling methat it desperately needed help, and that I must cooperate. Pain was pointing mein a better direction, whether I wanted to listen or not.However, what came to me was that our society, then, was not teaching us thatpain was actually friendly feedback helping us to choose to live healthier andwiser lives. Quite the contrary, the commercials on television were blasting adifferent message, and even scientists like me were buying the message that painwas my enemy. For example, my mind leapt to the award-winning Alka-Seltzercommercials of the time. One showed grossly obese men at a pie eating contest,stuffing their faces with apple pies to win a prize. In the middle of thecontest, one of the men got a stomachache. The message of the commercial was not“Stop eating too much food quickly.” The advertisers were reassuring as theysaid, “Eat! Eat! Don’t listen to your stomach—pig out and take Alka-Seltzerafterward.”Well, what about the wisdom of the body? This was a case of feedback,particularly what is termed in systems theory “negative” feedback (which in thiscase means subtraction). Negative feedback causes the system to changedirections mathematically so as to maintain its stability. For example, when aroom gets cold, the furnace turns on, because the thermostat is connected as anegative feedback device, signaling the furnace to create heat and return theroom to the selected temperature. While feedback serves a fundamentalself-regulating function, negative feedback helps control the behavior of asystem and changes its direction. Imagine what would happen if the pain negativefeedback loop—this “change of direction” feedback loop—was artificiallydisconnected?I called Stephen Krietzman, Ph.D., the person who taught me the black box storywhen we were both graduate students. I had been amusing myself to help withstandthe pain by indulging myself with design ideas for a high-tech superstomach thatwould never experience pain, would not be subject to obesity, and would notrequire conventional food, so it would not contribute to depleting the foodresources of planet earth.As an expert in nutritional biochemistry, and a friend who understood my senseof humor, Stephen said, “Gary, no problem. We can design your superstomach sothat people can eat the leaves on the trees. The reason why humans cannot eatleaves is because their stomachs cannot digest them. What your superstomach cando is make it possible for people to digest leaves. Then, through the evolvingmiracle of modern nutritional biochemistry, we can learn how to cook with leavesto make them tasty—even taste like meat and vegetables.”I was delighted with Stephen’s input. Not only would my fantasy superstomacheliminate pain and solve obesity and make me my first million, it wouldeliminate world hunger, too! But the humorous adventures of my creative braindid not stop the pain I was suffering.I had still to learn the implicit universal lesson of pain—my creativity andactive mind were taking me further away rather than helping me to understand thefundamental message I was getting from the feedback called pain. The fact is,the whole earth could potentially go out of balance if the stomach feedbackloops are disconnected. As we eat more, we deplete more; even carbon dioxidecould go out of control as the remaining leaves on the trees were consumed byhumans.Norbert Weiner—the great mathematician at MIT who happened to be a postdoctoralfellow of Cannon—discovered that no system can exist without feedback. Feedbackis universal. Feedback appears to be the foundation of life, memory, andevolution. Feedback appears to be what enables everything to communicate, share,connect, and grow. Feedback is the greatest gift any system has been given. Nofeedback, no survival. No feedback, no intelligent evolution. Feedback is theE=mc2 of survival and evolution. It’s that simple.The fault is not with our technology per se. Nor is the fault in ourtemperament. The fault is in our relative ignorance in understanding how systemswork, live, thrive, and evolve. People are slowly learning the ground rules ofthe game of life, and some of these rules are neither easy nor likable. However,these essential rules, apparently established by an intelligent G.O.D. process,reflect the fundamental scaffolds required for both existence and evolution. Ifwe can come to understand and honor these protective and organizing feedbackfields of guidance, our potential to unfold should be enhanced.It’s worth remembering Pagels’s comment about how randomness is presumed tooccur only in the absence of rules. Weiner’s universal feedback (or“field-back”) may be the rule of rules. Appreciating this grand rule is nowwithin our grasp.ROLE MODELS OF EMERGING HUMAN “BUTTERFLIES” THAT INTEGRATE SCIENCE ANDSPIRITUALITYHistory is replete with potential role models who have envisioned a grandorganizing universe and the great potential for humanity within it.These women and men have come from all walks of life, including science andreligion. In this book, I can only briefly acknowledge the existence of theirvisions. There have been many human butterflies that point the way to ourcapacity to evolve and soar.Since this is an evidence-based faith book, I wish to mention twoscientists—Rustum Roy, Ph.D., and William Tiller, Ph.D., both of whom I havecome to know personally, whose academic careers and writings point to theremarkable potential for human evolution. Roy has spent his career primarily asa distinguished professor at Penn State University, not only publishingcutting-edge science in mainstream journals, but also attempting to inspirescience to build bridges within its own community, and even more between its owncommunity and the community of religion.Roy’s book Experimenting with Truth: The Fusion of Religion with TechnologyNeeded for Humanity’s Survival, published in 1981, based on the distinguishedHibbert Lectures he gave in 1979, was clearly ahead of its time. I believe thisbook should be required reading for anyone interested in the evolution ofscience and religion as they move toward a common synthesis and understanding.Roy presents readers with an evolving vision of reality; as he explains, hisbook “has explored the areas where the insights of science and religion may feedeach other for the benefit of humanity.” It’s time for the mutual feeding ofthese two great paths of human evolution.Similarly, Tiller has spent his academic career as a pioneering professor atStanford University, not only publishing in mainstream scientific journals, butalso attempting to inspire science to build bridges between itself andspirituality. In his book Science and Human Transformation: Subtle Energies,Intentionality, and Consciousness, published in 1997, Tiller reviews hiscontroversial research in frontier physics that challenges us to think beyondtoday’s accepted theory to a new vision of physics and consciousness. Though noteasy reading because it requires processing mathematics and information frommany disciplines, the science chapters are mixed with chapters like “InnerSelfManagement,” “Training Wheels for Humanity,” and “Stewardship of the Earth”that all of us can understand.Of the two, Roy is the more conservative, remaining in the mainstream andbecoming a member of the National Academy of Engineering. Tiller made thedecision to address the most controversial topic of all—the physics of spiritualreality—not only theoretically but experimentally. Both have received criticismfrom some of their peers for going “too far too fast.”The question arises, have these two visionary scientists lost their minds, astheir harshest critics suggest? Or have they actually found their souls? Theevidence strongly points to the latter as being the correct interpretation. Isuggest that metaphorically Roy and Tiller are examples of scientistbutterflies, illustrating what is possible for all of us. As Tiller recentlysaid in a lecture I attended, “If one person can do this, then everyone can.”EVOLVING MEANINGS OF GOD, SPIRIT, AND SOULTerms like “God,” “spirit,” and “soul” can evolve in meaning as ourunderstanding of reality evolves. Science and religion will come together whenthey are each willing to accept the fact that history is a process of learningand growing, and that knowledge is continuing to unfold. Our past stories arejust that—stories—and they should evolve as our knowledge does.Can we envision spirit and soul as wearing contemporary scientific clothing? Iwrote the following poem, revised slightly for this book, to explore thispotentially unifying vision. SOUL AS INFORMATION, SPIRIT AS ENERGY: MANIFESTINGTHE EVOLVING FIELDS OF WISDOM AND LOVEWhat, pray tell, are Spirit and Soul?Are they one and the same?Are Soul and Spirit a functional Whole,Derived from a common Name?Or is it the case that Soul and SpiritReflect two sides of a coin,Where Soul expresses the Information that fits,And Spirit, the Energy that joins?Is Soul the story, the Plan of Life,The music we play, our score?Is Spirit the passion, the Fire of Life?Our motive to learn, to soar?Soul directs the paths we take,The guidance that structures our flow.Spirit feels very alive, awake,The force that moves us to grow.If Soul is Plan and Spirit is Flame,Then fields are alive, you see.Nature may play a majestic game,Of Information and Energy.I’d love to believe that wisdom and joyReflect God’s plans and dreams,That Soul and Spirit are more than toys,And both are more than they seem.Could it be that the Soul of GodIs the wisest of plans, so grand,And the Spirit of God is the lightning rodThat inspires God’s loving hand?Could Soul be Wisdom, and Spirit be Love, Together, a divine partnership,Purpose and passion, a Duet from Above, The ultimate relationship?The relationship of Spirit to Soul,So simple, profound this team.For Spirit and Soul the ultimate goal,To understand this scheme.Soul as Wisdom, Spirit as Love—Information and Energy, Awakened compassion,the Flight of the Dove, Someday,pray tell, we’ll see.Are human beings a core expression of this invisible organizing G.O.D. process?Do we have the potential to discover scientifically the existence of aninvisible organizing reality, a universal organizing consciousness? And can weevolve with it? Can we become homo spiritualis?This book concludes “Yes.” The story, and the evidence, must continue.EPICTETUSWhen you close your doors, and make darkness within, remember never to say youare alone, for you are not alone; God is within, your genius is within."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00031.gif]THE GENIUS WITHIN EVERYONEWHY UNIVERSAL ORGANIZING CONSCIOUSNESS EXISTS IN EVERYTHINGIn this book, in which G.O.D. is a universal Guiding-OrganizingDesigningprocess, I am also implicitly saying that G.O.D. can be thought of as some sortof omnipresent, superintelligent “genius-optimizing developer” of the universeand everything within it. Given that science is leading us to some sort of agenius G.O.D. process, can science take us further and reveal more preciselywhat kind of G.O.D. process is God? To that question I also answer yes.But I use the term “believe” in the same sense that, as mentioned earlier, therelated word is used in the last line of the movie Dragonfly: “Belief is whatgets us there.” And this meaning is important.Again, it is not enough to know that crafting a sand painting and building askyscraper are possible; you must believe that you can do them. It is not enoughto know how to do these things; you must have the motivation to achieve them.In a deep and accurate sense, belief is what ultimately leads people to createand to evolve. It is in this sense that I believe in science. In this bookyou’ve learned that I have come to believe science can provide definitiveanswers to fundamental questions about the nature of reality. My belief in thepower of science is evidence-based. The history of science contains abundantevidence of its potential for discovery, understanding, and application. Andbecause I believe in science, I am motivated to apply the methods of science toquestions that are seminal, regardless of how controversial they may seem.You’ve discovered in these pages my efforts to create the optimal experimentalconditions for the chance explanation—the conventional, presumably correctexplanation for the origin and evolution of the universe and its laws—to proveitself. My work has given the chance explanation every chance to prove itself.The bottom line is that when chance is given the chance to prove its assumedfundamental role in the creation of order in the universe, it ends updisqualifying itself.My belief is that if chance were the correct answer, it would be revealed inexperiments, and if chance were false, we would find the mistake in ourinterpretation. The fundamental mistake is explained in Chapter 10—that orderdoes not occur by chance (it requires precise conditions); instead, chance givesthe opportunity for creative orders to occur. So, returning to the G.O.D.question and the genius within, can science slowly but surely reveal the precisenature of the G.O.D. process? Can science someday answer Einstein’s questionabout the detailed “thoughts of God”? Again, based upon already existingevidence combined with straightforward reasoning, my answer is a qualified yes.Cognitive neuroscience and computer science have made tremendous progress inexploring and understanding the nature of intelligence in both natural andman-made systems. Natural intelligence and artificial intelligence—the latter,of course, implemented by human intelligence—are both evolving at breathtakingspeed. The process suggests to me the way the individual atoms of hydrogen andoxygen come together, and are modulated by outside fields (such as informationand energy conveyed at room temperature—recall Chapter 11) to make the emergentliquid molecule called water, which under the right conditions can becomesnowflakes of many shapes.In the same way, individual components (be they physical, biological, social, orinformational, as in computer software code) can come together, be modulated byoutside fields, and make emergent feedback systems termed networks—with uniquelynew emergent properties that are inherently intelligent. The more complex thefeedback network and its interconnections, the more complex and unique are theintelligence and the associated learning capacities.Amazingly, we now take the existence of man-made intelligent feedback networksystems for granted. The level of intelligence programmed into our contemporarycell phones is extraordinary and is growing in each generation of digitalphones. These evolving intelligence-driven cell phones interconnect us and thuscreate ever more complex feedback loops between many of us on the planet.Intelligence begets intelligence. Feedback loops are a universal phenomenon atevery level of nature, and their expression is evolving via intelligence.One might wonder if consciousness is a universal phenomenon like feedback. Andthen we can wonder: Does consciousness exist only in humans? Does consciousnessextend to dolphins, dogs, and African grey parrots? Does consciousness extend tobutterflies, protozoa, and E. coli bacteria? Does consciousness extend to trees,cacti, and pollen? Does consciousness extend to mountains, rocks, and raindrops?Does consciousness extend to atoms of hydrogen and oxygen, or even mass-lessphotons that are infinitely small? Does consciousness extend to the earth, moon,and sun? Does consciousness extend to solar systems, galaxies, and superclustersof galaxies? Does consciousness extend to the universe and beyond? And doesconsciousness exist in all feedback network systems at every level of nature andthe universe?You must ask how you personally draw the line for consciousness. Is your opinionbased upon your education and culture, emotion and wishes, personal experience,logic and reasoning, or experimental evidence? Philosophers hold vastlydifferent opinions on consciousness, ranging from “There is no such thing asconsciousness” to “Consciousness is the fundamental building block of everythingin the universe, from nonphysical intention and information to physical energyand matter.” On the other hand, a nearly unanimous opinion is held by thefounders of the great religions that an omnipresent and omniscient God has aninfinite mind with Universal Consciousness.Throughout recorded history, philosophers have viewed God as purportedly“Conscious” with a capital C. Their God is Consciousness. If God isConsciousness, and if God has omni-awareness, then everything that exists in theuniverse has God or divine consciousness within it. Because if “the All is inthe Small” and the G.O.D. process (that is, the All) equals consciousness, thenconsciousness is in the Small and everything has consciousness expressed tovarious degrees.If consciousness is the foundation of all that there is, then part of ourawakening as an evolving species is our capacity to discover this potentialfundamental truth about nature and the universe. However, the question must beasked if science can determine whether this logic actually matches reality. Doesany existing scientific evidence lead to the conclusion that the G.O.D. processreflects a universal organizing consciousness whose omniscient genius is beyondanything we can imagine?APPRECIATING ANOMALIES IN SCIENCEA growing body of scientific evidence, dismissed by many contemporary scientistsas being anomalous if not impossible, is slowly but surely emerging to supportsuch a G.O.D. presence. Because this body of scientific evidence inherentlyintegrates science and spirituality, it is resisted if not rejected by manyauthorities in our contemporary educational and religious institutions.Fortunately, this era of denial and rejection is coming to an end.Professor William James, M.D., deeply appreciated the importance of anomalousand “irregular” phenomena that may seem to be impossible and “unimaginable.” Hewrote at Harvard almost a century ago in the English of his era:“The great field for new discoveries,” said a scientific friend to me the otherday, “is always the unclassified residuum.” By that curious term, he meant thataround the accredited and orderly facts of every science, there ever floats asort of dust-cloud of exceptional observations, of occurrences minute andirregular and seldom met with, which it always proves more easy to ignore thanto attend to.The passage goes on to argue that “each one of our various -ologies seems tooffer a definite head of classification for every possible phenomenon of thesort which it professes to cover.” And he found most men “so far from free …that, when a consistent and organized scheme … has once been comprehended andassimilated, a different scheme is unimaginable. No alternative … can any longerbe conceived as possible.” Anything that didn’t fit would be seen as“paradoxical absurdities, and must be held untrue.”When exceptions are demonstrated, they are “neglected or denied with the best ofscientific consciences.” Only the born geniuses, James wrote, would become“worried and fascinated by these outstanding exceptions, and get no peace untilthey are brought within the fold.” And he pointed to scientists like Galileo andDarwin, who, he maintained, were “always confounded and troubled byinsignificant things.”Instead of being stuck with old ideas and unwilling to accept anything new,James wanted to see a scientist be able to “renovate his science.” He would wantall of us to be willing to renovate our ideas, as well.EVIDENCE THAT POINTS TO A CONSCIOUS UNIVERSEDean Radin, Ph.D., wrote a pathbreaking book titled The Conscious Universe. Thisbook provides a readable and careful review of a large body of scientificresearch in what is often termed parapsychology. Radin reviewed hundreds ofcarefully conducted experiments documenting the existence of what others havecalled the extended mind or the nonlocal mind, and Radin calls the entangledmind. This research not only demonstrates the capacity of one person to sensethe thoughts and feelings of others—even if they are separated by hundreds orthousands of miles—but it documents the capacity of one person’s mind toinfluence the behavior of quantum events such as electrons in electronically andmagnetically shielded devices.Research my colleagues and I have conducted on the organizing mind, presented inChapter 15, replicates and extends this body of knowledge in an importantmanner. It is possible to demonstrate that either individual minds, or groups ofminds working together, can have unintentional and unconscious effects on thequantum behavior of electromagnetically shielded electrons. In a word, our mindscan organize the physical world at the quantum level. Now, if consciousness isindeed universal and omnipresent (in other words, is not limited to humans), andis primary (in other words, universally creates information, energy, andmatter), it follows that everything that exists in the universe may ultimatelybe interconnected and organized via consciousness.Certain states of consciousness may invite resonance if not unity betweenindividual systems in the same way that musicians can play together in anorchestra or singers sing together in a choir. When people enter differentstates of consciousness, trillions of electrons in our brains synchronize indefinable ways; we can measure this synchrony as brain (EEG) waves or fields.Apparently, electrons that are electromagnetically isolated in a shielded devicecan nonetheless resonate with our brain’s synchronized electrons under certainconditions of consciousness. But does consciousness itself show emergent networkproperties? Does consciousness show novel properties that emerge from individualelectrons to individual brains to groups of brains to a global brain? Is theresuch a thing as emerging global consciousness? Does the earth haveconsciousness, and are we—both individually and collectively—components of thisconsciousness?Roger Nelson, Ph.D., and colleagues from the Department of Engineering atPrinceton have been conducting research termed the Global Consciousness Project(see http://noosphere.princeton.edu [http://noosphere.princeton.edu]). Here ishow Nelson et al. describe the nature of global consciousness:Research on human consciousness suggests that we may have direct communicationlinks with each other, and that our intentions can have effects in the worlddespite physical barriers and separations. We are compelled by good evidence toaccept correlations that we cannot yet explain.Princeton’s Global Consciousness Project speculates that fields generated byindividual consciousness would interact and combine, and ultimately have aglobal presence. Occasionally, the Nelson team explains, “global-scale events …bring great numbers of us to a common focus and an unusual coherence of thoughtand feeling.” To study the effects of a possible global consciousness, thePrinceton group has “created a world-spanning network of devices” and believesthe data they have collected so far appear to correlate with events “that mayevoke a world-wide consciousness.” The events they list “include both peacefulgatherings and disasters: a few minutes around midnight on any New Year’s Eve,the first hour of NATO bombing in Yugoslavia, the Papal visit to Israel, avariety of global meditations, several major earthquakes, and September 11,2001.”When science combines this evolving body of experimental research withcontemporary laboratory research on the topic of survival of consciousness afterphysical death, we discover compelling evidence that leads to a notableconclusion: that the brain is not required for conscious experience, intention,and intelligence (recall our discussion of the mind-brain relationship questionin Chapter 11). Furthermore, as summarized in the last chapter of The AfterlifeExperiments, the totality of the evidence leads inexorably to the conclusionthat the answer to the question “Which comes first, brain or mind?” is “Mindfirst, then brain.” Brain becomes a physical tool of the mind, not the other wayaround.William James was a proponent of the “mind first” thesis. Probably the mostforceful contemporary proponents of this position are Stanford professoremeritus William Tiller and his colleagues. In their book Conscious Acts ofCreation, they begin by saying: “This book marks a sharp dividing line betweenold ways of scientific thought and old experimental protocols, wherein humanqualities of consciousness, intention, emotion, mind and spirit cannotsignificantly affect physical reality, and a new paradigm wherein they canrobustly do so!”I admire the use of that term “robustly.” Their book gives evidence not only forthe organizing power of the human mind, but for the intimate interconnectednessof all things via universal organizing consciousness. And support of thisconcept is assembling from many sources.FROM THE CONSCIOUS UNIVERSE TO INTELLIGENT EVOLUTION AND G.O.D., THE ULTIMATEEXPERIMENTERMost scientific researchers never mention the G-word in the context of theirscience. Unfortunately it is even more taboo in the research laboratory than itis at most dinner parties. Nor is the G-word listed in the index of books likeConscious Acts of Creation or The Field, or mentioned, except briefly inpassing, in books like The Genius Within or The Conscious Universe. However, theavoidance of the G-word reflects the politics of science, not its essence. Forwhen the emerging body of consciousness research is “seen with new eyes,” itportends a spectacular paradigm change.Professor Rustum Roy describes the work of Tiller and his colleagues as follows:“For the first time, in the language of physics, very solid and very extensivedata on ‘Spirit>Mind>Physical Matter’ interactions have been provided.” Scienceand spirituality are becoming two sides of the same coin. Science is not onlyhelping to solve the mystery of mysteries, it is serving the mystery ofmysteries. In fact, we are beginning to see the G.O.D. process as the UltimateExperimenter, an intelligent, creative, and caring intellect that we can come toknow and serve—if we are willing to ask.QUESTIONS UNANSWEREDMy evidence-based faith is that if we stay willing to continue askingchallenging questions with an open and discerning mind, and then we creativelyapply the evolving tools of science to address these questions, definitiveanswers will be revealed in time. It is the nature of science that when onequestion is answered, more questions present themselves.And so, as the end of this book approaches, you are left with many unansweredquestions, such as: Is what we term the G.O.D. process an expression of aUniversal Organizing Consciousness—an awareness and intelligence in everything?Is the G.O.D. process perhaps conducting a great experiment? Is the ultimateoutcome of this grand experiment already known (and is it possible that theG.O.D. process has a bag of cosmic tricks up the sleeve)? Or is G.O.D., theUltimate Experimenter, continually discovering new things just as we are? And isthe G.O.D. process itself evolving along with the evolving universe?And a question we all share: Is there a universal co-creative process of whichwe, individually and collectively, are a part?Hopefully we’ll receive the answer. I am sure it will be provided if we becomemature enough and wise enough to apply our knowledge and science in a way thatis even more compassionate, healing, and transformative. I personally amcommitted to continuing this work for our species and our precious planet. Thefuture is in the hands of all of us.ALBERT EINSTEINThe intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant.We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00032.gif]SUMMING UP THE G.O.D. EXPERIMENTS—THE EMERGING CASE FOR INTELLIGENT EVOLUTIONSEEING THE BIG PICTURE, AND NEVER FORGETTING ITEinstein calls on us to use not just our rational mind but our intuition. As wereview the evidence presented in these pages, that’s a worthwhile admonition tokeep in mind: remember not only to honor your rational mind as a “faithfulservant” but to also envision your intuitive mind as a “sacred gift” from theSource—even if you see the Source simply as your own mind. Tap into yourintuitive side as well as your rational side.THE BIG QUESTIONIs there something fundamental that needs to be explained in nature and theuniverse? The answer is clearly yes. The far-reaching question has to do withthe overabundant evidence of evolving orders in the universe. Everywhere welook, from photons and chemicals, through flowers and people, to galaxies andsuperclusters, we witness dynamically unfolding orders. And the majority ofthese evolving orders are indescribably complex as well as breathtakinglybeautiful.Order appears to be the rule, and not the exception, in nature. Some of theorders have been termed by Tyler Volk, Ph.D., “metapatterns”; these replicatethemselves at every level in the universe. They are universal.One of the most ubiquitous metapatterns in nature—a pattern that follows the“Golden Ratio” called phi—is the universal spiral shape that appears in thetrails made by subatomic particles, in the double-helix molecule DNA, inseashells, in the movement pattern of the heart, in tornadoes, in galaxies.Over the past two centuries science has catalogued a dizzying array of exquisiteorders. Scientists have created optical microscopes and telescopes that enableresearchers to witness orders that are too small or are too far away to be seenunaided. Electrical engineers have created supersensitive sensors that measureelectromagnetic fields vibrating at frequencies other than the restricted bandof frequencies visible by the human eye. Researchers can now examine a myriad ofinvisible orders—using microwaves, infrared waves, ultraviolet waves, radiowaves, X rays, gamma rays—manifesting from subatomic particles to superclustersof galaxies.It is also possible to witness the evolution of complex orders that are createdby humans. Scientists of the twenty-first century function in a veritable sea ofintelligently guided experimental designs expressed in architecture, art, music,science, and technology. The evidence from history convincingly demonstratesthat it is possible for us to function brilliantly in the human role of being anextraordinary Guiding-Organizing-Designing species.Science can be described as a formal process of discovering—through intelligenttrial-and-error experimentation—the existence of order where previously wethought there was no order. Science discovers new patterns and then attempts toexplain them.The question is, does the ubiquitous existence of these evolving orders reflectthe expression of a random evolutionary process, or an intelligent evolutionaryone?ORCHESTRATED ORDERS IN OUR PERSONAL LIVESHow wide and how deep does order extend in the universe? Does it extend all theway to the orchestration of our daily lives? If order is the rule in theuniverse, and not the exception, does complex ordering apply to our personallives as well? You have already encountered in these pages a few detailedexamples of extraordinary synchronicities in human life that illustrate the kindof amazing evidence that can be obtained on this profound question.The unanticipated findings from the Chris Robinson experiment illustrate howcontemporary precognitive parapsychology research can uncover uncanny patternsin the coordination and sequencing of our daily lives that seem utterlyincomprehensible to most of us. The unanticipated synchronicities orcoincidences revealed in the “Remember the diamond” story provide compellingevidence of everyday orchestration that can be observed not only in controlledparapsychology experiments (Part Two) but in our personal lives as well (PartThree). And a truly exceptional avalanche of synchronicities is revealed inAppendix C.However, we will never discover such synchronicities in the laboratory or in ourlives unless our minds are open to seeing them and we are willing tosystematically record the observations. This is a case where belief in thepossibility of order is a prerequisite for seeing evidence of order in scienceas well as daily life.THE UBIQUITOUS NATURE OF ORDERIf we accept the evidence not only from physics, chemistry, biology, ecology,and astrophysics, but from controlled parapsychology experiments as well aspersonal exploratory experiments, that order is the rule, not the exception, innature, then how do we explain it? Where does all this order come from?As we have discussed, the simplest explanation is to suggest that orders canoccur and evolve by chance alone. Sometimes called blind chance, this is thegenerally accepted explanation from conventional science. It is generallyassumed that randomness allows for all possible orders to occur, and by chance,evolution—including natural selection—will unfold.It is further generally assumed that the universe is becoming more disorderedover time, as described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Science generallyassumes that the emergence and evolution of pockets of order existing in theuniversal sea of increasing disorder are due to the operation of chance combinedwith what is termed “self-organization.” Self-organization is presumed to be thecapacity of certain systems to self-assemble without the aid of an externalorganizing force. Darwin’s natural selection explanation combines chancemutation with self-organization. But is the blind chance explanation necessarilythe correct explanation? No, not necessarily.The alternative explanation involves some sort of creative intelligent,trial-and-error ordering process—what I term an ExperimentingGuiding-Organizing-Designing (G.O.D.) process. This explanation proposes thatwhat Darwin termed “natural selection” is an intelligently guided experimentingprocess—the G.O.D. process—that promotes the creative expression and evolutionof ever more complex and interconnected systems. What Darwin termed “naturalselection” may actually reflect the operation of “intelligent selection.”Why would I propose that people consider entertaining an alternative hypothesisto the blind chance explanation? Remember, the question being asked is: canscientific evidence combined with careful reasoning lead us to conclude thatsome sort of an Experimenting G.O.D. process exists in the evolving universe?There are three primary reasons for seriously questioning whether theconventional, generally accepted chance explanation is correct. As notedearlier, Reasons 2 and 3 are provided for the first time in this book.REASON 1: THERE IS TOO MUCH PRECISE ORDER IN THE UNIVERSE TO HAVE OCCURRED BYCHANCE.The combined evidence spanning physics and chemistry to ecology and astrophysicssuggests that there is too much order in the universe. Recall how microscopesand telescopes reveal a previously unseen wealth of order. This wealth of orderis organized in too precise a manner to plausibly be explained as occurring bychance. The balance of forces necessary to sustain the universe and ultimatelysustain biological life is too precarious and precise to have come intoexistence simply by chance alone. The evidence and the reasoning for thisposition are provided in a number of recent books, such as The AnthropicPrinciple. The interested reader is encouraged to review this emerging abundanceof evidence. (Recommended readings are included at the end of this book.)REASON 2: THE CHANCE EXPLANATION IS NOT SUPPORTED BY EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE.When experiments are conducted that actually test predictions made by the chancehypothesis, compelling evidence is discovered to indicate that the chanceexplanation does not work in practice. The simple physics experiments presentedin Part Two of this book—focusing on a simple sand paintingexperiment—convincingly demonstrate that chance by itself cannot explain all ofthe order that is observed in the universe as well as in everyday life.But the skeptic may wonder whether sand paintings (or clothes folding) mighthappen given enough time—say, billions of years. When you examine the data fromthe experiments carefully, you find no evidence whatsoever to support such aspeculation. In the same way, watches, buildings, symphonies, computers do notcome about by chance. These things require a sophisticated planning andimplementing ordering process—that is, human designers and builders—to come intoexistence.Such obvious simple physical observations are complemented by more complex buteasily understood computer modeling experiments. Recall that when conditions forproducing random sampling are in place, in the absence of a specific orderingprocess, numbers always create what is termed a “normal” distribution, abell-shaped curve. And the more numbers used in the calculations, the moreperfectly formed becomes the bell-shaped curve.The combination of evidence in Part Two from the simple physics experiments,plus the more complex computer modeling experiments, conclusively disproves thekey prediction. Contrary to well-accepted popular belief, when we actuallyconduct the experiments, we discover that replicated organizations do not emergeby chance. It is sometimes said that only a donkey makes “ass-umptions.” I tooonce ass-umed that the chance explanation must be true; I never tested whetherit actually worked in the real world.REASON 3: THE CONDITIONS FOR CREATING CHANCE DO NOT EXIST IN THE UNIVERSE.Do the conditions necessary to produce random sampling exist in the universe?The answer to this fundamental question is never, and I emphasize the word“never.” When we carefully consider the conditions necessary to produce randomorders in the first place, we are reminded that a prerequisite for randomsampling is independence of events.If events are not independent, random distributions of events are neverobserved. Again: never. This is a well-accepted fact in science. Computerprograms have been designed that intelligently model the creation of complexorders requiring the use of feedback loops. The loops in the program carefullyconnect the output of a given equation to the input of another equation. Theequations are therefore interconnected; they are not independent. One equationfeeds the other, and depending upon the program, this can happen hundreds oftimes or millions of times. Then, and only then, can replicable evolving ordersbe observed. So this does not meet the test for randomness. No ifs, ands, orbuts.Even what is termed “self-organization” only occurs when feedback loops existand function in an organized fashion. Organization can create organization;however, randomization does not in and of itself create organization. So-calledartificial-life programs require intelligence to program them and intelligentoperating systems to carry out the instructions.Does independence exist in real life? When we carefully look for the existenceof independence in the universe, what we find instead is interdependence andinterconnectedness. Contemporary physics tells us that everything that exists inthe material universe is interconnected with everything, to various degrees, byinvisible force fields of information and energy. These invisible physicalfields include gravitation and electromagnetism. In other words, interconnection(like order) is the rule, not the exception, in nature.What physics calls the “vacuum” or “void” is actually filled withincomprehensibly complex dynamic networks of highly organized—andorganizing—fields of force. Though physicists do not understand the origin andorganization of these invisible force fields, they are convinced that theseinvisible fields definitely exist and play a regulating or guiding role in allphysical systems. Wireless communication by cell phones is one example thatillustrates this. In the chapter titled “Can G.O.D. Play Dice with theUniverse?” I discussed the typically ignored discrepancy between what statisticsand physics tell us (randomness requires independence, but everything is in factinterdependent) and how we therefore erroneously apply the randomnessexplanation to the origin and evolution of order in the universe.When we accept this fact, there is no longer a justifiable reason to expectthat, given enough time, chance alone could create something as simple andbeautiful as a Native American sand painting, let alone a single living cell, ora V-shaped formation of flying geese each composed of billions of organizedcells.In fact, the combination of evidence and logic leads to the paradigm-shiftingconclusion that there is no such thing as pure randomness in the universe.What we perceive as randomness may instead reflect a degree of complexity oforder that we have yet to decode (and in some cases, as proved mathematically byGödel—mentioned below—we may never be able to decode).IF CHANCE IS NOT THE EXPLANATION FOR ORDER, THEN WHAT IS?Once you fully accept Reasons 1 through 3 above—that the existence of ubiquitousorder in the universe (Reason 1) does not (Reason 2) and cannot (Reason 3) occurby chance—you are led inexorably to consider the possible existence of some sortof universal, invisible, intelligent Guiding-Organizing-Designing field processin the universe.It follows that what I am calling an invisible Experimenting G.O.D.-fieldprocess (or simply the G.O.D. process) must somehow, to some degree, be playinga fundamental Guiding-Organizing-Designing role in everything that expressesorder—from subatomic superstrings, through personal coincidences that are toounexpected to be by chance, to superclusters of galaxies.Moreover, it follows that even when we observe apparently self-organizingsystems—such as the formation of individual raindrops containing billions ofatoms, or spiraling galaxies containing billions of stars—they too must involve,to various degrees, an invisible Experimenting G.O.D.-field process. This leadsto the conclusion that all evolution, from the micro to the macro, must involvean expression of some sort of intelligent evolution.Why do I say “must involve”? I choose these words using the identical reasoningthat leads us to conclude that the spontaneous falling of apples to the groundmust involve some sort of invisible guiding field, the one we call gravity.Remember, no one has ever seen a gravitational field or ever measured one(except indirectly). We cannot hear, smell, taste, or touch gravity. What we dois logically infer the existence of a gravitational field from the behavior ofapples falling to the ground, from planets revolving around suns, and lightbending around the sun.In the same way, no one has ever seen an Experimenting G.O.D.field or measuredone (except indirectly). We cannot hear, smell, taste, or touch an ExperimentingG.O.D.-field. What we can do is logically infer its existence from everydayexperiences such as the making of a sand painting or the folding of clothes(which we can prove requires an external, purposeful, intelligent process thatcan be seen by the naked eye) and, at another extreme, from the spiraling ofgalaxies and the creation of superclusters (which to the uninformed eye seemfolded into spirals as if by magic). This leads to the conclusion that allevolution, from the micro to the macro, must involve an expression of some sortof intelligent evolution.ASSUMPTIONS OF CONVENTIONAL SCIENCE AND OF THE SKEPTICSThe well-educated conventional scientist will be quick to retort thatcontemporary science operates on the premise that the evolution of orderobserved in the universe reflects a combination of (1) the operation of naturallaws, plus (2) randomness, and therefore they see no need to hypothesize theexistence of an invisible intelligence guiding the entire process. Suchscientists will typically treat the sand painting and computer program examplesdescribed in Part Two as trivial (and will ignore them, since the examplesclearly require the presence of intelligent Guiding-Organizing-Designingprocesses, human or other-wise). Instead they will focus their attention on theapparent “self” (species) evolution of plants and animals.However, these scientists must assume that the discovered collection ofso-called natural laws somehow came into being “by chance” (a presumption thatis not based on any evidence—it is based on an implicit bias againstintelligence rather than a careful analysis of intelligence) and thatrandomness, as in “inherently unpredictable,” can somehow magically occur evenin the absence of independence as is required for random sampling. I use theword “magically” only partly tongue-in-cheek, because such scientists simplyassume that “inherent unpredictability” can occur; they do not say how it canoccur.If you are such a scientist (or a skeptic), we encourage you to remember that asexplained earlier, the observation of “unpredictable” as in “I can’t discover apattern in these numbers” does not automatically justify your interpretation ofthe existence of an “unpredictable process” creating order out of “randomness.”Humility about our assumptions, especially about randomness, is in order. Theimportant lesson of the number pi is that it can remind all of us—skeptic,agnostic, and believer alike—that a seemingly “unpredictable” number cannonetheless be 100 percent replicable and reflect a complex, yet-to-bedeciphered pattern of universal importance and application.FROM INTEGRATION TO PREDICTION—CAN WE COMMUNICATE WITH AN INVISIBLEEXPERIMENTING G.O.D. PROCESS?For an alternative theory to be valid it should first of all integrate diverseevidence, including evidence that seems anomalous to the conventional theory(for example, how the mind can literally organize seeming random electron flow,discussed in Chapter 15). The alternative theory should also make newpredictions that can be confirmed or disproven (scientists prefer the term“disconfirmed”) through future research.When we integrate the concept of organizing fields from physics with theconcepts of hierarchy and interconnections from systems science—what I haveplayfully termed “the All in the Small”—we come to the novel prediction that itis theoretically possible to receive information from a G.O.D. process, sincethe universal G.O.D. process is inside everything. In straightforward language,what this means is that both evidence and reasoning lead to the prediction thatpeople can, to various degrees, receive information from “God.” This includesyou and me.To the best of my knowledge, no credible researcher in the history of sciencehas been brave enough to conduct a formal research program testing thisprediction. The closest anyone has come, as far as I’m aware, was EmanuelSwedenborg, arguably Sweden’s most successful and celebrated scientist. At agefifty-six he shifted his focus from the physical sciences to the spiritualsciences. The series of books he wrote in the 1600s were based upon theextensive personal exploratory experiments he conducted in his mind as heexplored realms that could be experienced by human consciousness.Swedenborg’s personal exploratory experiments, shared through his numerouswritings, have had a major influence on a select group of distinguishedscientists and writers in the twentieth century, including William James andHelen Keller. However, no scientist has formally accepted the challenge oftrying to test this prediction in the laboratory.Swedenborg conducted theological experiments in his head for almost two decades.Einstein conducted thought experiments in his head beginning as early as hischildhood. My personal exploratory experiments testing whether it is possible,in principle, to receive information from the universe that can be independentlyverified integrates Swedenborg’s and Einstein’s model of being open to exploringnature and the universe in one’s mind.The findings are not in and of themselves definitive, since by definition theyare clearly exploratory. However, they are, as the Nobel Prize-winning physicistWigner used to say, certainly “amusing” and “absolutely worth thinking about.”These preliminary findings provide proof-in-principle evidence—they demonstratethat it is possible to design controlled experiments in the laboratory testingthe G.O.D. communication prediction. That is, if someone is brave enough toperform them. In part, the reason for writing this book is to provide thegroundwork for bringing the Experimenting G.O.D. field process explanation intomainstream science so that an academic discipline that we might call“experimental theology” can be launched.OTHER KINDS OF EVIDENCE—APPRECIATING THE EXTRAORDINARY SCOPE OF THE HUMAN MINDThere is a mathematical proof known as Gödel’s Theorem that says, in essence,that certain mathematical assumptions can never be formally proven because oftheir complexity. Using the language of complexity theory, Gödel’s Theoremconcludes that to fully understand a complex system requires an even morecomplex system. A corollary of this idea from systems theory, as any youngstermight say, is “It takes one to know one.”If human beings are composed of the very stuff of the Experimenting G.O.D.process itself—and therefore, if in principle we have its infinite potential tolearn and evolve—then we should be able to find evidence in psychology andconsciousness studies documenting that the human mind is at least as big inscope as the universe itself. (It is amusing that probably the most importantmathematical proof of relevance to the Experimenting G.O.D. process is by Gödel,whose name happens to contain the word “God.”)In Chapter 12, I took you through a simple psychology experiment thatconvincingly demonstrates how even the mind of a young child can envisionholding objects that vary in size from the infinitely small (a photon of light)to beyond the All (the entire universe) in the palm of their hand. The humanmind has the power to learn how to invent technologies that can enable us to seethe paths made by subatomic particles, on the one hand, and superclusters ofgalaxies, on the other hand. The human mind has the power to conceive ofimaginary numbers and even infinities of numbers.The history of science and technology reminds us that the potential of the humanimagination goes beyond anything we can currently imagine. Thus far, no one hasexplained the origin of human consciousness in physical terms. Moreover, asdescribed in Part Four, the experiments that purportedly support the thesis thatthe brain creates consciousness equally support the thesis that the brain is areceiver for consciousness. Experiments that distinguish between these twocompeting explanations—the brain as the creator of consciousness versus thebrain as created by consciousness—are coming curiously from areas such asparapsychology and afterlife science that up to now have not been part ofmainstream science.It doesn’t take a Nobel laureate physicist to reason that just as a raindrop iscomposed of billions of water molecules, and a lake is composed of billions ofdrops of water, and a galaxy is composed of billions of stars, and a universe iscomposed of billions of galaxies, so the universal Experimenting G.O.D. mind—ifit exists as this book says it does—would be composed of billions of littleexperimenting Guiding-Organizing-Designing minds (little g.o.d.s) using humanbrains.Part Five reviews evidence leading to the conclusion that just as invisiblefields are universal, consciousness itself is universal. Moreover, askingquestions of the universe may be a universal process of intelligenttrial-and-error questioning that exists at every level of the universe.Evolution at all scales, from superstrings to superclusters of galaxies, andeverything in between, including us, may not simply be “bottom up.” It may wellbe “top down”—an example of “All in the Small” intentional and intelligentevolution of infinite scope and creative potential.G.O.D. AND MATHEMATICSPhysicists have a passion, if not reverence, for mathematics. So, too, do deeplyspiritual people, especially those who happen to have an affinity for math.Einstein had a deep appreciation for the beauty and power of mathematics, aswell as its limitations and his own limitations in dealing with it. He’s quotedas saying “I don’t believe in mathematics,” as well as “Don’t worry about yourproblems in mathematics; I assure you mine are greater.”On the other hand, there’s some suggestion that Darwin may not have been a fanof mathematics. He has been quoted as saying, “A mathematician is a blind man ina dark room looking for a black cat that isn’t there.” As someone who has twocats, I appreciate both the utility and limitations of formulas and numbers—Iappreciate both Einstein’s and Darwin’s complex opinions about math.I love logic and mathematics, and I seem to have some degree of aptitude forboth (despite receiving math awards in grade school, getting near perfect scoresin new math when I was in high school, performing in the ninety-ninth percentileon the mathematics graduate record examination, and getting a hundred in agraduate course in complex analyses of variance, my strongest critics afterreading this book would question whether I have a few mathematical screwsloose—and I sometimes wonder this myself).Some of my mathematically inclined colleagues, after reading early drafts ofthis work, have asked, “Where’s the math?” They have argued, in various ways,that in order to believe that intelligence truly operates in physics, chemistry,and biology, they want to see the formulas. For them, words are ultimatelyfuzzy, whereas formulas are precise. When you transform an idea into anequation, the fuzzy speculation becomes a potentially testable premise.(I will never forget when my agent, William Gladstone, who as an undergraduateat Yale was a math wizard, told me that what convinced him my theory of systemicmemory had validity was not the three hundred pages of logic and data presentedin The Living Energy Universe, but a single formula I included.)So I offer a summary formula that speaks to the creation and evolution offeedback memory in systems—from superstrings to super-clusters of galaxies, andeverything in between, including us. It also speaks to the existence ofintelligence and evolution in systems, since memory is a fundamental componentof intelligence.If you are not mathematically inclined, you can skip this formal equation andmove on to a more verbal, poetic one; the abstract equation is included forthose who are mathematically inclined. In the oversimplified formula describedbelow:• A and B stand for two parts of any system• t stands for time (t+ stands for the time it takes information to travel frompart A of the system to reach part B, or B to reach A)• r stands for recurrence (repeating in a circular fashion, from A to B and backto A, over and over)• “aba …” represents the evolving systemic (interactive) memory (a1b2a3, etc.).The existence of nonlinear information circulating within a system allows forintelligence and creative emergence to operate within recurrent feedbackprocesses.Using these terms, the formula is: (At + Bt+)r = (at+bt++at+++ … )rTo those who seek additional mathematical support (for example, how concepts ofintention and purpose can be modeled as well), rather than offer it here in abook intended for the general reader, my colleagues and I will present thedetails in appropriate scientific publications, in the form of some novelequations and associated research.A BIT OF POETRYFor those who prefer to skip the mathematics, I’d like to offer a related ideaas a poetic formula, “a poetry of logical ideas”—a playful equation thatexpresses, in everyday language, the essence of the conclusion of this book. AsEinstein said, “Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas.”Physicists are often playful and poetic; the term “Big Bang” is a case in point.In that vein, my playful expression of these concepts is:Evolution = motivation • creativity Infinitely recurringThe take-home message of the intelligent evolution hypothesis is that motivation(another term for intention) and creativity (a component of infiniteintelligence) together function as universal natural recurrent feedbackprocesses that propel the origin and evolution of the order of everything—be itphysical, chemical, biological, psychological, social, ecological,astrophysical, or whatever.I’m not proposing that universal intention (motivation) and infiniteintelligence (creativity) are human-like. I am not anthropomorphizing. What I’mproposing is that human intention and intelligence are universal-like, in thesense that our minds reflect the implicit infinite mind and feedback-guidingpotential of the cosmos. Intention and intelligence may be as ubiquitous anduniversal as feedback. As stated previously, my proposition does not representbottom-up logic (as below, so above) but rather top-down (as above, so below—a“meta” analysis).As we’ve seen, order does not occur by chance; ordering mechanisms are presumedto manifest the replicable patterns we observe in the universe. Moreover, theapparent underlying complex order that defines the precise pattern of laws wehave discovered in the universe implies the existence of a “meta-ordering” or“macro-ordering” process—what we have termed G.O.D.—that reflects a degree ofextraordinary creativity and sense of purpose.For the intelligent evolution hypothesis to be true, it must be sufficientlyinclusive to (1) handle both the currently explainable as well as seeminglyinexplicable observations (often termed anomalies) in nature and the laboratory,and (2) make new predictions that can be confirmed in future research.As Einstein reminds us, there is more to reality than described by formulas: “Asfar as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and asfar as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.”SEEING THE BIG PICTUREIn Stephen Sondheim’s haunting musical Sunday in the Park with George, about thePointillist painter George Seurat, one of the songs includes the telling line“She saw all of the pieces, but none of the whole.”The pieces are all in place—from physics and statistics to psychology andparapsychology—and they are ready to be integrated. Will you be able to see thewhole picture? And will you accept it when you see it? Compelling evidence forintelligent evolution and an experimenting G.O.D. process is staring at us fromall directions; it is waiting to be integrated and witnessed as a whole. Itappears that we no longer need historical religious figures to come to know God.We just need our rational and educated twenty-first-century minds, aided by thesacred gift of our innate intuitive potential.TOLSTOYAll, everything that I understand, I understand only because I love. Everythingis, everything exists, only because I love. Everything is united by it alone.Love is God, and to die means that I, a particle of love, shall return to thegeneral and eternal source."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUE Image [../images/00033.gif]INFINITE LOVE: THE ULTIMATE GIFT FROM G.O.D.?A few years ago, a woman whose husband had been brutally murdered came to see meat my office. Her husband had been an internationally recognized professor ofmusic at the University of Arizona. He was returning from an organ concert atnight when he stopped to help a man. It was raining. The man killed theprofessor for money to purchase drugs. The woman, Stardust Johnson, had come tome because my colleagues and I were conducting systematic research on thequestion of survival of consciousness after death. She, like her late husband,was a deeply religious person and attended church regularly. Though shedesperately wanted to believe in the possibility of survival of consciousnessafter death, her anger at God was preventing her.She said, “It’s bad enough that God could allow my husband to be taken from mefor such a horrible reason”—for money to buy drugs. Stardust believed that Godgives us a degree of free will—the opportunity or chance to make up our ownminds and behave accordingly—and we too often pay a price for this liberty whenpeople abuse their freedom. Her belief is consistent with the science we havepresented in this book.However, her subsequent words shook me to my core and I will never forget them.She said, “However, if God has not only allowed my husband’s love to be takenfrom me, but he has allowed his love to be taken from me forever, such a God istoo cruel to be imagined.” I experienced her emotional and spiritual pain as ifit were a sword in my soul.When she said these words, I wondered to myself, What kind of a God would allowthe light from distant stars to continue in the vacuum of space forever, but notallow our photons—our energy and information, our love and thoughts—to continueforever as well?I responded to Stardust by asking her a question: “What would you say if I toldyou that well-accepted scientific theory supports the idea that our energy andinformation—and hence our love and thoughts—continue forever like the light fromdistant stars, and that it is possible to document this scientifically?”Stardust responded by saying, “It would give me a reason to hope and to live.”Is G.O.D. as envisioned by evidence-based faith “too cruel to be imagined”? Orhave we simply not yet been able to fully envision the kind of loving G.O.D.process that actually exists?SKEPTICISM, LOVE, AND KNOWING SOMETHING FOR SURECan the well-trained skeptic who is, so to speak, addicted to agnostic thinking(not meaning “believing it is impossible to know God” in the narrow religioussense, but meaning “questioning or wondering” in the broadest philosophicalsense), know anything for sure?Even when I describe things that happen 100 percent of the time—such as when Iwitness objects dropping to the floor or sand paintings scrambling in a pot—Idescribe these things as happening “virtually” beyond any doubt. I alwaysinclude a little bit of doubt—keeping an open and discerning mind—for bothlogical and philosophical reasons. However, there is one thing that I know withabsolute certainty.It is fundamental to who I am.When people ask me, “What do you know for sure?” I answer, “The only thing Iknow for sure is that I love. I love people, animals, plants, places, books,music, art, sports, technology, stars, discoveries, and even ideas. Myexperience of love is beyond any doubt. Everything else I witness or experienceI would describe as a hypothesis!”Erich Fromm wrote that “love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to theproblem of human existence.”When I experience love—especially deep love—it fills me completely. There is nodoubt that I am having this experience. However, there is something absolutelyfoundational about love for me that to the best of my knowledge I have neverheard described before.And it relates to the question “Who is Gary Schwartz?” And by extension, who areyou?WHO IS GARY SCHWARTZ—IS HE WHAT HE HAS MANIFESTED, OR IS HE HIS YET UNMANIFESTEDPOTENTIAL?Is Gary Schwartz a male who grew up on Long Island, played professional guitarin high school and college, became a Harvard Ph.D. in psychophysiology,conducted internationally acclaimed health psychology research at Harvard andYale, directed an NIH-funded Center for Frontier Medicine in Biofield Science atthe University of Arizona, writes science-based medicine and spirituality booksfor the general public, and has unbridled passion for the desert, NativeAmerican Art, ancient history, mysteries, bulldogs, and recently cats? Is thisGary Schwartz?Or is Gary Schwartz the person that Gary could be? Am I my potential, the personI can be? And are you the potential of who you can be?The fact is, you or I could have grown up in Kansas, and developed a Midwesterntwang to our speech, or in Alabama. We could have grown up in France or China,speaking the language of the country. Though I began my undergraduate trainingas an electrical engineer, was premed and considered at least threemajors—philosophy, psychology, and chemistry—I could have chosen any number ofsubjects to major in.From this objective vantage point, I do not define myself in terms of mythoughts, philosophy, or history. I define myself in terms of not only who I amat the moment, but what my potential is. I see you the same way too.My personal potential is of course limited—for example, it does not include mybecoming a professional basketball player (I am physically too small) or avisual artist (I am red-green color-blind)—but that is not the point here. Thepoint is that I define myself by my potential. I do not define myself simply interms of what I have learned or achieved.At times I have imagined what it might be like if my thoughts, philosophy, orhistory were taken away. What I experience when I do this thought experiment isthat my essence—my potential—is still me. In other words, I can imagine losingaspects of my thoughts, philosophy, or history, and still feel like me. However,when I imagine what it might be like if my capacity to love were taken away, Iexperience myself disappearing in the process. If my capacity to love is takenaway, my experience of Gary as I know him ceases to exist.I have discussed this phenomenon with many people. They typically report havinga similar experience of losing their essence when they imagine what it would belike if they completely lost their capacity to love. The capacity to love, andwhat to love, may define you, too, in a deep and foundational way.THE REMARKABLE LOVING BRAINHumans are clearly hardwired for love. In fact, it can be argued that we comeinto the world as little global neurological love machines. As infants we findalmost everything interesting—most things are curiosities to be tasted andexamined. Depending upon our parents and upbringing, we will learn to eitherexpand or contract our capacity to love.Love can be stifled, suppressed, even imprisoned in anger and fear. Love canalso be nurtured, encouraged, and fostered at every level. I was blessed to growup in a home where exploration, love, and questioning were nurtured. My parentsdid not have money, but they had curiosity and an irrepressible passion forlife. I was the fortunate recipient of that love of life, and I continue to feelit to this day.I tell my students: “I love scorpions, sharks, rattlesnakes, and mountain lions;I just can’t live with them. They are dangerous for me, so I keep my distance.But that does not mean that I can’t appreciate their attributes, and marvel attheir very existence.” Loving many things does not necessarily mean that onelacks discernment or priorities. Also, one can love the capacity of animals orpeople to defend themselves and their loved ones, and hate how this capacity issometimes abused by humans in the name of love.It is said that God loves all creatures, great and small, be they on this planetor other planets in the universe. It is said that God has love and compassionfor saints and sinners alike. It is said that God forgives our mistakes, andgives us the opportunity to try again and evolve into a being of love and light.Influential religious role models, both ancient and contemporary—from Moses andJesus through Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama—share one outstanding attribute.They have an overriding compassion and overabundance of love. They candiscriminate right from wrong, yet also forgive those who have not learned thediscrimination or mastered the ability to put the lessons into action.Of all the known creatures on the planet earth, not only does the human mindstand out in terms of its ability for creativity and design, the human heartstands out in terms of its ability for love and compassion.Just as our minds have the potential to explore all things, our hearts have thepotential to love all things. The parallel here is nothing short ofbreathtaking. The evidence is overwhelming that our ability to love matches ourability to think. There are “heart geniuses” as there are “mind geniuses”(termed emotional and mental intelligence, respectively). The “Genius Within” isboth a feeling genius and thinking genius.But just as the individual mind must be developed to enable its potential tocreate to be actualized, the individual heart must be developed to enable itspotential to love to be actualized. We must develop both our minds and ourhearts. It behooves us to entertain seriously the possibility that the“Guiding-Organizing-Designing” process (mind) is also a“Generous-Opportunity-Developing” process (heart).What I am proposing is that built into the very fabric of the universe is thecapacity for infinite love and compassion as well as infinite intelligence andcreativity. “What’s love got to do with it?” My answer is: “Everything.”My working hypothesis, based upon available evidence in contemporary physics, isthat the kind of God that would create the capacity for both visible andinvisible photons never to lose their individuality in the “emptiness of space”is a God whose mind and heart should never be underestimated. Quite thecontrary, I suggest that we seriously entertain the hypothesis that our abilityto love, smile, and laugh is as vast as the universe itself and is as vast asthe mind that can conceive it. Moreover, our love appears to be as permanent andexpansive as the light from distant stars. Does that make you smile?The question becomes, how far can we humans go in developing our capacity forlove and compassion? It could be as great as our potential for creativity andunderstanding. Wouldn’t that be the ultimate gift? I say we already have it.GANDHIBecome the change you desire.FROM THE FILM BRUCE ALMIGHTY, WRITTEN BY STEVE KOREN ET AL.Be the miracle."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSImage [../images/00034.gif]I predicted this would be a daunting book to write; however, I did not fathomhow challenging it would be. Writing the first draft was a thrill, but theprocess of revising, reorganizing, extending, and polishing the book evoked abroad range of emotional experiences, from agony to ecstasy. Were it not for themany people and the G.O.D. process who inspire me—knowingly or unknowingly—toreach beyond my formal academic training (electrical engineering, psychology,physiology) in order to attempt to answer the profound questions always bouncingin my mind, this book would never have been written.First and foremost, I thank my writing partner, William L. Simon, for hisencouragement, his probing questions, and his devotion to crafting prose that isclear and captures the essence of ideas. Bill is an open-minded skeptic whounfailingly asks the hardest questions. Occasionally he includes some easy onesas well. Though the content of this book primarily comes from me, the polishingof my words to make them clearer than I could is Bill’s brilliant work. He and Iare like hydrogen and oxygen that make water; when we come together and joinforces, “emergent properties” arise where, as the saying goes, “the whole isgreater than the sum of its parts.”Dr. James Levin, a deeply spiritual physician with a strong evidencebased faithin the methods of science, was the first person to encourage me to “tell thesestories, tell them now, and tell them from your heart as well as your head.” Heintroduced me to the writings of Joel Goldsmith, such as God, the Substance ofAll Form and Consciousness Is What I Am. Jim also introduced me to WilliamGladstone, whose editorial and agent skills are a blessing. It was Gladstone whofirst introduced me to Bill Simon and his remarkable wife, Arynne. Gladstonebrought us to Atria Books, a publishing house that appreciates books thatintegrate science and spirituality. The staff at Atria, especially BrendaCopeland and LaMarr J. Bruce, our editors, have helped make this book “evocativeand magnanimous” (LaMarr’s words). Their commitment to high standardscomplements our own.Jim also introduced me to Dr. Deepak Chopra. Deepak wrote the foreword to theprevious book that Bill and I wrote, The Afterlife Experiments. I recommendDeepak’s book How to Know God, which deserves to be read by anyone who wants toconsider the question of all questions—the scientific reality of an evolvingG.O.D.-field process in the universe as a whole.The Guiding-Organizing-Designing hypothesis was seeded when I was a youngassistant professor of psychology and social relations at Harvard University inthe early 1970s and I read Dr. Walter Cannon’s book The Wisdom of the Body andAlfred North Whitehead’s Process and Reality. The concept of the “wisdom of thesystem” as in “the cosmos” came to me at that time.The concept began to bloom when I was a young professor of psychology andpsychiatry at Yale University in the early 1980s. There I read a combination ofbooks that spanned science and religion, especially Dr. James G. Miller’s LivingSystems, Dr. Jonas Salk’s The Anatomy of Reality, Dr. Lewis Thomas’s The Livesof a Cell, Heinz Pagels’s The Cosmic Code, Ervin Laszlo’s Introduction toSystems Philosophy, Stephen Pepper’s World Hypotheses, Harold Saxton Burr’sBlueprint for Immortality, R. Wayne Kraft’s A Reason for Hope, and HustonSmith’s The Religions of Man (the original title, which has evolved into TheWorld’s Religions, a more appropriate, nonsexist title, as Linda Olds gentlyreminds me). Together they led to a transformation of my consciousness thatcontinues to evolve to this day. I had the privilege to spend some quality timewith both Salk and Pagels—their openness and insights hopefully live on in thisbook.Because of contemporary books on chaos, self-organization, and complexitytheory, such as Heinz-Otto Peitgen and colleagues’ Fractals for the Classroom,the premise for this book has become ever more plausible. Thanks to remarkablecolleagues such as Dr. Donald Watson, the rationale for positing some sort ofordering capacity in the universe—Watson proposes the novel integrativescientific term “en-formy”—takes on even greater significance.Glen Olds, Ph.D., and Eva Olds, Ph.D., a husband and wife team who have servedmany roles that bridge science, spirituality, and humanity—from ambassador tothe United Nations and chair of the board of the World Federalist Association tothe first president of the Fetzer Foundation and the president of three collegesand universities—encouraged me to be brave and stand up for the potentialreality of a Guiding-Organizing-Designing process that science envisions to be afoundation of a living energy universe. Like me, they are quick to emphasizethat the premise of this book is a scientific one—and like any hypothesis, itmay be confirmed or disconfirmed through future research.I thank Rustum Roy, Ph.D., an emeritus science professor from Pennsylvania StateUniversity and a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and WilliamTiller, Ph.D., an emeritus science professor from Stanford University and aleader in contemporary physics and consciousness research, for not only havingserved as honorary nonanonymous cochairs in the late 1990s and in early 2000 forthe Human Energy Systems Laboratory’s anonymous F.D.A. Committee (it stood for“Friendly Devil’s Advocates”), but for bridging science, spirituality, andhealing in their professional and personal lives. Some of the faculty members ofour secret F.D.A. Committee feared that serving overtly in the role ofcritiquing some of the controversial research we are conducting in spiritualmedicine and spiritual systems science might place their scientific careers indanger, hence our decision to make the committee anonymous. Thanks to chairmenRoy and Tiller, and to the invisible members of the committee, the scientificintegrity of this work has hopefully been maintained at a high level.I also thank Lynn Nadel, Ph.D., professor and former head, Department ofPsychology; Holly Smith, Ph.D., former dean of the College of the Social andBehavioral Sciences; Al Kaszniak, Ph.D., professor and current head, Departmentof Psychology; and Richard Powell, Ph.D., former vice president for research—allat the University of Arizona—for fostering bridges between science andspirituality, and encouraging this work. Their understanding and respect foracademic freedom makes this work possible in a university setting.Integrative thinkers such as Ken Wilber and his “big bloom” vision, as describedin his book A Brief History of Everything, have played an important backgroundrole in the birthing of The G.O.D. Experiments. You have met a number ofintegrative thinkers and their courageous ideas in the course of reading thisbook. And you have met some inspirational young people like Sabrina Geoffrion,M.A., who reminded me that systems theory predicts that we can all be in directfeedback with the G.O.D. process. I especially thank Lonnie Nelson, Ph.D., whorevealed to me how conscious intention can lead the flow of electrons in anelectromagnetically shielded device to become more organized, and then “forced”me to address the existence of universal consciousness in this book. I alsothank Dan Lewis, B.A., who is part Cherokee; he revealed to me how even mineralsand crystals have dynamically organized fields that can be detected consciouslyby humans under experimental, double-blind conditions.Over the years my work has been funded by many federal sources, including theNational Institutes for Mental Health and the Advanced Research Projects Agency(Harvard); the National Science Foundation and the National Heart, Lung, andBlood Institute (Yale); and the National Center for Complementary andAlternative Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, and the Research Officeof Veterans Affairs (University of Arizona). Our research has also been fundedby many private sources, including the Spencer Foundation, the Canyon RanchFoundation, the Peter Hayes Fund, and the John Kaspari Fund. Though none of thisfunding was directed toward the focus of this book, it provided theinterdisciplinary education and integrative training I needed to do this work.The help of my colleagues in our Center for Frontier Medicine in BiofieldScience, funded by the National Center for Complementary Alternative Medicinefrom the National Institutes of Health, has been invaluable. Key members of myteam, who have directly or indirectly contributed to this work, include IrisBell, M.D., Ph.D.; Willow Sibert, Ph.D. pending; Allan Hamilton, M.D.; LewisMehl-Madrona, M.D., Ph.D.; Audrey Brooks, Ph.D.; Beverly Rubik, Ph.D.; KatherineCreath, Ph.D.; Katherine Burleson, M.D.; Melinda Connor, Ph.D.; Julie Beischel,Ph.D.; Maureen Campensino, Ph.D.; Cheryl Ritten-baugh, Ph.D.; Mikel Aicken,Ph.D.; Tomoe Lombard; Clarissa Siefert; Kim Corley; Katie Reece; Gerry Nangel;Sheryl Attig; Div. M.; Summer Stanwick; Larry Stephenson; and Jean Andrews. Icannot thank you enough.I have received invaluable scientific and spiritual guidance from three specialscholars and friends—Ernie Schloss, Ph.D., Jeanne Re-nouf, Ph.D., Ed.D., andSuzanne Mendelssohn, Ph.D. Hopefully this book honors your minds and hearts.I have received invaluable critical feedback from two special physicalscientists and friends, Peter Hayes, Ph.D., and Edgar Mitchell, Sc.D. Though wecontinue to disagree about the potential centrality of intelligence in theevolution of everything in the universe (for example, whether evolution is abottom-up or top-down process), our debate has resulted in clarity as well asdirection for future research.However, in the spirit of brevity, I shall simply say bless you—to the thousandsof authors, and many thousands of undergraduate and graduate students,colleagues, and friends, whose words and visions are an integral part of thiswork. And of course, if the thesis of this book turns out to be true, ourblessings and dedication go to the living energy source of it all, the UniversalIntelligent G.O.D.-field process who has so many names, including “Sam.” We canthank him/her for intelligent evolution.This book is also dedicated to the late Susy Smith—you are with me always, in mymind and heart. Not only does Susy inspire me, she also makes me giggle. And toLinda Van Dyck, Ph.D., my “spiritual interrogator”—you more than anyone havekept me focused on living a G.O.D.-conscious life.So many teachers, so many gifts. Thank you all.Gary E. Schwartz"},{"pageContent":"SUGGESTED READINGSThe following are a small but important subset of books that contributed to theconceptualization and manifestation of The G.O.D. Experiments and the hypothesisof intelligent evolution. I list these twenty-six books with brief commentaryabout how they contribute to the evidence and the reasoning in this book. Thebooks are organized by category. They are available from Amazon.com[http://Amazon.com] and other Internet sources.ATHEIST VIEWS IN THE CONTEXT OF SCIENCERichard Dawkins’s book The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence from EvolutionReveals a Universe Without Design is a very clever book. He takes the idea ofchance for granted. Using computer programs that require carefully designedfeedback loops, Dawkins attempts to make the argument that if these programs cangenerate apparent design—they do—and Dawkins (the programmer) is not consciousof what the final outputs will look like, then this is compelling evidence forwhat he terms “The Blind Watchmaker.” The problem with his logic is (1) he hadto carefully design the programs to perform these purposeful functions in thefirst place (the programs were not created by chance), and (2) the fact that hecould not foresee what the output would look like does not necessarily implythat someone smarter than he could not do so (humility is not Dawkins’s strongsuit). I suspect that most people who read his book will simply assume thatchance operates in the universe. Also, they probably will not realize the factthat the programswritten supposedly to disprove the existence of design actually require carefuldesign on the part of the programmer. Dawkins’s book is well written and worthreading even as it is misguided.Michael Shermer’s book How We Believe: The Search for God in the Age of Scienceis also a very clever book. Shermer assumes that science cannot address the Godquestion experimentally, and that the evidence in favor of some sort of Godhypothesis is weak at best. His book focuses on the psychology of how people cancome to believe things for which there is no evidence, and also on how peoplecan reach conclusions even though the evidence disproves their beliefs.Shermer’s book is also well written and worth reading even as it is incorrectconcerning the G.O.D. question.Mark Perakh’s book Unintelligent Design is one of the most thoughtful butmisguided books on this subject. The description on the book jacket suggeststhat the work attempts to equate “seek[ing] to prove the existence of Godmathematically” with “claims of neocreationism” and the views of “those whowould see evolutionary theory discarded.” In support of his position, Perakhchallenges one of the most respected thinkers on the subject, the mathematicianand philosopher Professor William Dembski, author of The Design Inference.Quoting Dembski’s statement that “design … constitutes a logical rather thancausal category,” Perakh retorts, “If design is disconnected from any causalhistory, it seems to mean that Dembski’s concept is that of a design without adesigner.” But Perakh misses another possibility: that Dembski means theappearance of design logically implies the existence of a designer, yet thatcomprehending a causal designer requires additional information. Though Perakh’sbook raises valid questions, the thoughtful reader will, I believe, likely comeaway unconvinced.SCIENTISTS WHO REASON THAT SOME SORT OF INTELLIGENT EVOLUTION IS REQUIREDGerald L. Schroeder’s book The Science of God: The Convergence of Scientific andBiblical Wisdom is a challenging book. Schroeder is aphysicist who is deeply interested in the potential connections betweencontemporary physics and historical writings from the Bible. His book provides asubstantial number of important, and sometimes surprising, parallels. It is aclassic, filled with substantive and insightful information.Lee M. Spetner’s book Not by Chance: Shattering the Modern Theory of Evolutionis a thought-provoking book. Spetner is an Israeli physicist and biophysicist.The book has been praised by scientists and religious scholars as one of the“most serious challenges to the modern theory of evolution.” Professor E. Simon,Department of Biology, Purdue University, claims it is “certainly the mostrational attack on evolution that I have ever read.” Spetner’s analysis andcritique of neo-Darwinian theory (NDT) is based upon the mathematics ofinformation theory. Spetner writes, “The NDT not only stands in the way of abetter understanding of the life sciences, it also tends to prevent us fromappreciating that there may be spiritual values in the universe that stem from asource higher than man.”Michael Behe, William A. Dembski, and Stephen C. Meyer, in their book Scienceand Evidence for Design in the Universe, provide an extensive review ofscientific evidence consistent with the design hypothesis. Dembski reviewsevidence for design in science in general, Meyer reviews evidence for design inphysics and biology, and Behe reviews evidence for design at the foundation oflife. They are some of the leading proponents of the intelligent designhypothesis, and it is important to understand the detailed evidence they review.William A. Dembski’s recent book No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity CannotBe Purchased Without Intelligence is absolute must reading. Dembski has thetraining to envision this grand question. He has a B.A. in psychology, an M.S.in statistics, and a Ph.D. in philosophy. He also has a Ph.D. in mathematicsfrom the University of Chicago and a Masters of Divinity from PrincetonTheological Seminary. This book is not light reading; however, it is essentialreading. Dembski reveals the fatal flaws in Dawkins’s The Blind Watchmaker andmakes a compelling case for the intelligent design hypothesis.Guillermo Gonzalez and Jay W. Richards’s book The PrivilegedPlanet: How Our Place in the Cosmos Is Designed for Discovery may be the mostevidential of books concerning the design hypothesis. The question is raised,“Is the Earth merely an insignificant speck in a vast and meaningless universe,”or is this “cherished assumption of materialism dead wrong?” The thesis of thisbook, filled with evidence from geophysics to astrophysics, is that “our planetis exquisitely fit not only to support life, but also to give us the best viewof the universe, as if the Earth were designed both for life and for scientificdiscovery.” This is a book that is definitely worth reading and pondering.HOW CONTEMPORARY PHYSICS (OFTEN UNKNOWINGLY) TAKES US TO G.O.D.Lynne McTaggart’s book The Field: The Quest for the Secret of the Universe is avisionary book. It presents the latest theory and research on electromagneticfields, biophotons, and the Zero Point Field. She shows how this research leadsto the conclusion that an energy field connects everything in the universe, andwe ourselves are part of this vast, dynamic network of energy exchange. For areader-friendly introduction to field dynamics and contemporary physics, thisbook is excellent. However, implications for understanding God are notemphasized. The word “God” is not in the index.Sten F. Odenwald’s book Patterns in the Void: Why Nothing Is Important is aprofound introduction to organized networks of invisible fields in the vacuum.Odenwald shares aspects of his spiritual pain with the reader (for example, hedoes not see how the new physics speaks to the question of survival ofconsciousness after death—even though physics provides such a foundation).However, his book is not focused on spiritual or theological questions. The word“God” is not in the index. But if you read this book with an open and discerningmind, the obvious take-home message about implications of the interconnectednessof everything, including the “void,” is unavoidable.Lawrence W. Fagg’s little book Electromagnetism and the Sacred is beautiful andinspiring. Fagg is an interdisciplinary scholar. He holdsa Ph.D. in physics from John Hopkins University and a master’s degree inreligion from George Washington University. Fagg explains that electromagnetismultimately underlies all of earthly nature from rocks and plants to humans andtheir brains. He explains that “electromagnetic radiation—light—has symbolizeddivine presence in the spiritual life of humankind for millennia, and yetfollowing the increasing disenchanting of nature, we have lost that contactbetween the physical and the spiritual.” Fagg argues that the “ubiquity ofelectromagnetic phenomena constitutes a powerful physical analogy for theubiquity of God’s indwelling presence.” The word “God” is heavily indexed.William A. Tiller, Walter E. Dibble Jr., and Michael J. Kohane’s book ConsciousActs of Creation: The Emergence of a New Physics is difficult reading if you arenot a physicist. The book is pioneering and visionary. It “marks a sharpdividing line between old ways of scientific thought and old experimentalprotocols, wherein human quality of consciousness, intention, emotion, mind, andspirit cannot significantly affect physical reality, and a new paradigm whereinthey can robustly do so.” The book integrates contributions from medicine,parapsychology, consciousness studies, and especially physics. Tiller et al.discuss fields, the vacuum, space, and what they call the “Biobodysuit”metaphor. The word “God” is not in the index. However, their book providescompelling support for the concept of universal consciousness.ASSORTED MEANINGFUL BOOKS ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS, ORDER, AND INTELLIGENCEDean Radin’s book The Conscious Universe: The Scientific Truth About PsychicPhenonena is essential reading. Radin not only reviews, in a definitive fashion,the experimental research on paranormal phenomena; he provides a wonderfulintroduction to how careful and creative research is conducted. He alsodiscusses the numerous reasons why superskeptics dismiss the evidence as if itdoesn’t exist. The politics of science and truth are examined in this seminalsynthesis of the field.The Conscious Universe provides experimental evidence that strongly supports theexistence of universal consciousness.Tyler Volk’s book Metapatterns: Across Space, Time and Mind is a meaningful bookbecause he presents compelling evidence for the existence of repeating patternsof organization that are found at every level of the universe, from subatomicparticles to galaxies and beyond. Not surprising, there are a few references toGod in the index. One can’t read this book and not be startled by the micro tomacro organization of everything in the universe.Mario Livio’s book The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World’s MostAstonishing Number is an astonishing book. Throughout history, thinkers frommathematicians to theologians have pondered the mysterious relationship betweennumbers and the nature of reality. Livio tells the tale of a number at the heartof that mystery, phi, or 1.6180339887…. The golden ratio shows a propensity toappear in the most remarkable places—from mollusk shells, sunflower florets, andthe crystals of some materials to the shapes of galaxies containing billions ofstars. From art and architecture to economics and astrophysics, the phimetapattern is discovered to be a beautiful and seemingly eternal order.Frank T. Vertosick Jr.’s book The Genius Within: Discovering the Intelligence ofEvery Living Thing is surprisingly enlightening. Vertosick explains how ourbodies contain many highly intelligent systems just as remarkable as our brains.We come to respect “the brilliance of viruses and the canniness of germs.” Irecommend this book because it helps one understand the essence of intelligence.When you can see how the immune system works with “a savvy and deviouscleverness,” you are on the path to seeing intelligence in all dynamicalsystems, not just biological systems. Though the word “God” is not in the index,the title of this book implies his focus.Gary E. Schwartz’s book (with William L. Simon) The Afterlife Experiments:Breakthrough Scientific Evidence for Life After Death reviews contemporaryresearch conducted at the Human Energy Systems Laboratory at the University ofArizona that speaks to the question “What comes first, brain or mind?” Theresearch providescompelling evidence not only for the existence of a larger spiritual reality,and that human consciousness continues “like the light from distant stars,” butalso that consciousness is primary in the universe, and that the physical world,including the human brain, is a manifestation of this universal process.BOOKS ABOUT GOD, CONSCIOUSNESS, EVOLUTION, AND RELIGIONHuston Smith’s book Why Religion Matters: The Fate of the Human Spirit in an Ageof Disbelief is one of his most important works. An eloquent and respectedauthority on religion, Smith offers a timely manifesto on the urgent need torestore the role of religion as the primary humanizing force for individuals andsociety. Weaving together insights from comparative religions, theology,philosophy, science, and history, along with examples drawn from current eventsand his own extraordinary personal experiences, Smith gives both a convincinghistorical and social critique and a profound expression of hope for thespiritual condition of humanity. He takes both historical religion and scienceto task. In the final part of his book, Smith imagines a time when “human beingsmove beyond the present materialistic and relativistic understanding ofexistence and recognize that consciousness, not matter, is the ultimatefoundation of the universe.”Jeff Levin’s book God, Faith, and Health: Exploring the Spirituality-HealingConnection provides an empirical reason why believing in God and sharing thisexperience with others matters. Levin explores the latest compelling evidence ofthe connection between health and an array of spiritual beliefs and practices,including prayer, attending religious services, meditation, faith in God, andothers. With examples from spiritual traditions as diverse as Christianity,Judaism, and yoga, he looks with an open mind and perceptive eye at the manyways that religious involvement and belief can prevent illness and promotehealth and well-being.James Redfield, Michael Murphy, and Sylvia Timbers’s book God and the EvolvingUniverse: The Next Step in Personal Evolution is bothhistorical and visionary. The authors contend that thousands of years of humanstriving have delivered us to this very moment, in which each act ofself-development is creating a new stage in planetary evolution—and theemergence of a human species possessed of vastly expanded spiritual experience.One important discussion is their chapter “The Experience of Integration andSynchronistic Flow.”Deepak Chopra’s book How to Know God: The Soul’s Journey into the Mystery ofMysteries is a tour de force. According to Chopra, the brain is “hardwired toknow God.” He reviews how the human nervous system has seven biologicalresponses that correspond to divine experience. These are shaped not by any onereligion (they are shared by all faiths), but by the brain’s need to take “aninfinite, chaotic universe and find meaning in it.” Chopra says that “God is ourhighest instinct to know ourselves.” His book integrates contemporary physics,physiology, and parapsychology with seven levels of the experience of God.George Trobridge’s biography Swedenborg: Life and Teachings is arguably the mostauthoritative history of Emanuel Swedenborg, an eighteenth-century scientistconsidered to be an “intellectual titan.” Swedenborg studied philosophy,science, mathematics, law, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, cosmology, anatomy, physiology,politics, economics, metallurgy, mineralogy, geology, mining, engineering, andchemistry (he did not study psychology or sociology; these disciplines did notexist in his time). His studies ultimately led him to a search for thephysiological seat of the soul. Following his investigations in the naturalsciences, which gained him prominence throughout academic Europe, he dedicatedhis last twenty-seven years to theology and the study of the Bible. In thisfinal career phase, he believed himself to be “under God’s call andillumination.” A true empirical scientist and experimental theologist, his lifeand teachings are worth knowing. His writings influenced the lives and works ofmany noted personalities, including Kant, Emerson, Henry and William James,Dostoyevsky, Strindberg, Jung, and the celebrated Helen Keller.Michael Reagan’s The Hand of God: Thoughts and Images Reflecting the Spirit ofthe Universe is a beautiful book. This book combines inspirationfor the mind and heart by juxtaposing majestic photographs of the cosmos withilluminating words of scientists, poets, and theologians. I was introduced tothe integrative spirituality of Wernher von Braun in this book. Here’s how ChetRaymo, author of Skeptics and True Believers, is quoted in the book: “Ourexplorations have produced a vast archive of remarkable astronomical images….The riches are too many for choices, the revelations beautiful and dreadful. Whocan look at these images and not be transformed? The heavens declare God’sglory.” One more quotation in the book, from Gerald L. Schroeder, author of TheScience of God: “Knowing the plumbing of the universe, intricate andawe-inspiring though that plumbing might be, is a far cry from discovering itspurpose.”Gregg Braden’s The God Code: The Secret of Our Past, the Promise of our Futureis a bold, controversial book. Braden takes us on a journey of discovery,leading us to his profound hypothesis of a universal code that is expressed, inparallel, in the original Hebrew language related to God and in our DNA code.According to Braden’s logic, the basic elements of DNA—hydrogen, nitrogen,oxygen, and carbon—directly translate into specific letters of the Hebrewalphabet (YHVA), which then translate into the original name of God. Braden’shope is that knowing that God’s signature is carried within each cell of theestimated 6 billion humans on earth will give humankind the evidence we need toovercome our differences and renew our faith. He writes, “Beyond Christian, Jew,Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Shinto, Native, Aboriginal, white, black, red, oryellow; man, woman, or child, the message reminds us that we are human. Ashumans, we share the same ancestors and exist as the children of the sameCreator. In the moments that we doubt this one immutable truth, we need look nofurther than the cells of our body to be reminded. This is the power of themessage within our cells.” Is this simply a statistical accident, or furtherevidence of a Guiding, Organizing Designer?Neale Donald Walsch’s Tomorrow’s God: Our Greatest Spiritual Challenge is also atour de force. It integrates ancient and contemporary sacred wisdom in a waythat is folksy, down-to-earth, and easy to digest, and at the same time isexquisitely visionary. He writes in theintroduction that the purpose of writing this book was “not that it containswisdom that we have not been given, but that it repeats wisdom to which we havenot been listening” (italics are Walsch’s). He goes on to say, “And the problemis, if we do not listen to this wisdom now, we may not have many more chances tohave it repeated. We are at the edge, you see. We have gone as far as we can goin the direction we have been taking. We need now to change course if we wish topreserve life as we know it on this planet.” Walsch proposes that each of us cancontribute to changing “the course of human history.” Is this an exaggeration,or an achievable goal? Walsch shows how evolving our vision of God is key to ourevolution as a species.Ted Peters and Martinez Hewlett’s book Evolution from Creation to New Creation:Conflict, Conversation, and Convergence provides an important overview andintegration of theology and science. Their synthesis combines the knowledge of atheologian (Dr. Peters) with a biologist’s (Dr. Hewlett). The conclusion theyhave reached is summarized in the term “theistic evolution”—which overlapsstrongly with the more generic term “intelligent evolution” as used in TheG.O.D. Experiments. In a 2005 opinion article, they wrote that their concept ofa God who “created our world in the beginning and continues to provide creativeand redemptive care [is] compatible with scientific methods that are blind todivine purpose within natural processes.” Further, they wrote that “what naturalscientists study we call ‘secondary causes,’ whereas God is the ‘primary’ cause.Science can contribute immensely to understanding the created world replete withsecondary causes, and indirectly contributes to our understanding of thecreator, the primary cause.” At the present time, there is sufficient empirical(evidential) and conceptual (theoretical) reason to hypothesize the existence of“theistic evolution”—which is why Peters and Hewlett wrote their book and teachcontemporary evolutionary theory from this integrative perspective. Peoplecommitted to honesty and integrity in education will hopefully encourage scienceteachers to consider teaching the hypothesis of theistic evolution—or morebroadly, intelligent evolution—with their students.Though I agree in principle with Peters and Hewlett’s cautiousrecommendations about theistic evolution and education, I would remind thereader of the essential distinction between observation (evidence) andinterpretation (theory or models). Science is concerned both with data(including seemingly anomalous data) and alternative explanations that canaccount for the data. At the present time, there is sufficient empirical(evidential) and conceptual (theoretical) reason to hypothesize the existence of“theistic evolution”—which is why Peters and Hewlett wrote their book and teachcontemporary evolutionary theory. People committed to honesty and integrity ineducation will hopefully encourage science teachers to consider sharing thehypothesis of theistic evolution (or more broadly, intelligent evolution) withtheir students."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX A Image [../images/00035.gif]A REVIEW AND STUDY GUIDE FOR TEACHERS AND THE REST OF USThe G.O.D. Experiments presents a body of evidence from physics, mathematics,psychology, and parapsychology that provides compelling reasons to posit theexistence of intelligence everywhere present in the universe and daily life. Thebook presents substantial evidence combined with systematic reasoning for theexistence of an intelligent, trial-and-error, universal G.O.D. process—aGuiding-Organizing-Designing process. The approach combines elements ofevolution theory with aspects of intelligent design theory; for ease ofcommunication, the approach is called intelligent evolution.The evidence not only crosses the “beyond reasonable doubt” threshold, but someof it virtually crosses the “beyond any doubt” threshold as well.The Introduction poses the question “Can science per se lead us to discover somesort of a G.O.D. process?”Parts One-Three present the evidence in detail, spanning from physics toparapsychology.Part Four addresses the theoretical debate about chance versus design in theuniverse, and comes to the conclusion that chance per se cannot explain theorigin and evolution of order in the universe. Logic and evidence point to somesort of intelligent evolution process.Part Five plus the Epilogue discuss some of the numerous implications ofadopting evidence-based faith concerning the existence of a G.O.D. process.Hopefully this review and study guide will provide teachers a means of helpingtheir students see both the forest and the trees—the big picture plus theimportant details—as they evaluate the evidence and come to their ownconclusions. And hopefully it will, as well, provide interested readers a usefulsummary overview as a refresher of the core ideas and arguments.The reader will note that this is neither a religious nor a political book—it isa science book. It describes a process of discovery leading to a challengingconclusion that has the potential to evolve both science and religion. Thesynthesis is termed intelligent evolution.PROLOGUE. CAN SCIENCE TAKE US TO GOD?Imagine that there had been no Abraham, no Moses, no Jesus, and no Muhammad, noTorah, no Bible, and no Koran, no shamans, no medicine men, no prophets, and nomystics. There was just contemporary, twenty-first-century science.Would scientists, on their own, come to the conclusion that some kind ofinvisible G.O.D.—a Guiding-Organizing-Designing process—existed in the universeas well as in our daily lives?There is no bigger or more important idea than the possible existence of auniversal, caring, creative, intelligent Guiding-Organizing-Designing processthat helps form and guide the evolving macro system we call the universe.Can the G.O.D. process question be addressed by contemporary science?The Prologue introduces this monumental question. It briefly reviews (1) how theseed of the idea came to the author when he was a young assistant professor ofpersonality psychology at Harvard University in the early 1970s, (2) how itblossomed when he was a professor of psychology and psychiatry at YaleUniversity in the 1980s, and (3) how it evolved into a veritable orchard when hewas a professor of psychology, medicine, surgery, neurology, and psychiatry atthe University of Arizona in the 1990s.The concept of evidence-based faith—which at first may sound like acontradiction in terms—is introduced in the Prologue. It is proposed not onlythat science is solving what Deepak Chopra in his book How to Know God calls the“mystery of mysteries,” but more important, that science is serving the mysteryof mysteries in a manner that portends our capacity for personal and globalhealing—including the healing of our business, political, and religiousinstitutions. The Prologue explains that this is not a religious book examiningideas about “God”—it is a science book about a universal G.O.D. process thataddresses the common ideas of higher purpose, higher intelligence, and higherpower in the universe and everyday life.PART ONE—THE SCIENCE OF PROPHECYCHAPTER 1. FORESEEING GOD IN THE LABORATORYChapter 1 begins with an overview of an extraordinary experiment testingChristopher Robinson, England’s Dream Detective. The ten-day experiment involvedRobinson dreaming about specific locations he would be taken to in the greaterTucson area on the following day. The results from one particular day aredescribed in detail.The dream information included the phrase “the spirit of God.” At the end of theday, the author and Robinson found themselves eating under an umbrelladisplaying the advertisement for Hebrew National hot dogs; the line on theumbrella read: “We answer to a Higher Authority.”How could Robinson know not only specific details about where the experimentallocation would be, but the surprising connection with God?Could this be explained by chance per se? Or was there some sort of aninvisible, intelligent Guiding-Organizing-Designing process operating in ourlives (and by extension, yours)?CHAPTER 2. DISCOVERING INTELLIGENT DESIGN IN OUR LIVESChapter 2 presents unanticipated evidence for the existence of intelligentlyorchestrated design in daily life. As the Ten-Days-in-Arizona experimentunfolded, the author began to realize that certain pieces of information thatRobinson was getting from his dreams in May, June, and July were predicting theexistence of activities, as well as the coordination of these activities, thathappened later in August.Day 10 was especially prophetic—it happened to fall on a day that the author hadto give a lecture in the early afternoon at the University of Arizona’s Collegeof Medicine. The dream Robinson had in June said that “Day 10 will end early,and you will spend the day at the pool.” Even though (1) the actual date for theexperiment had not been set in June, (2) the author had not selected possiblesites to visit, and (3) the sites ultimately selected had not yet beenrandomized, Robinson’s dream accurately foresaw the author’s schedule as beingintegrated with his.The building visited on Day 10—a Native American museum—turned out not only tobe a few blocks from Robinson’s hotel, but to be closed that day. As a result,the author had more than enough time to get to the medical school by noon, andRobinson did spend most of the day by the pool.What kind of superintelligence can foresee orchestrated events that have yet tobe selected and randomized by humans? Such intelligence is by all definitions“supernormal” if we use human intelligence as the standard of normal.PART TWO—SIMPLE G.O.D. EXPERIMENTSCHAPTER 3. K.I.S.S.: KEEP IT SIMPLE SCIENCEThis chapter demonstrates a simple experiment that families can perform in theirhomes to show how the predictions of chance per se don’t work when they areactually tested. The experiment involves sand paintings and what I call the“G.O.D. container” experiment.Take a container, place white sand in the bottom, and then purposely drawsomething using black sand. You can draw a cross, a Star of David, a heart, ahuman eye, the word “G.O.D.”—it does not matter. Then, cover thecontainer—preferably with a clear cover so you can see what happens—and shakethe container. What happens? Does the cross become a star? Does the heart becomean eye? No, what happens is universal and occurs 100 percent of the time. Whatthe sand does is mix. The black pieces spread out and uniformly mix with thewhite sand. The more you mix the sand, the more the black and white piecesdistribute themselves more or less equally.The take-home message is significant. Sand paintings do not happen by chance. Noamount of time will lead the sand to paint itself, by chance alone.This is evidence, not theory.Order in the simple physical world does not occur by chance. It takes some sortof a Guiding-Organizing-Designing process to paint a sand painting (or constructa building); it takes some sort of intelligent ordering process to create andmaintain ever more complex orders that we witness in an evolving cosmos.CHAPTER 4. G.O.D. IN THE COMPUTERThis chapter examines whether randomness can occur by chance. What statisticstells us is that the more data we collect—for example, the more times we flip acoin—in the absence of a Guiding-Organizing-Designing process, the greater isthe likelihood that a bell-shaped, “normal” distribution will occur.In the case of coin flips, this means that the greater the number of times acoin is flipped—and no ordering process (or cheating) is involved—the greaterthe probability that the average will approach 50 percent heads and 50 percenttails. Similarly, the more time we give monkeys the opportunity to peck at thekeys on a piano, the greater the probability that they will hit the notesequally, and therefore will never compose a Bach symphony (or even orchestrate“Twinkle, twinkle, little star”).The deep implication of this is that the normal curve—its shape andstructure—will always occur in the absence of a nonrandom process that couldshift the numbers away from chance.Chance occurs only when each and every event is independent of every otherevent. This is called random sampling. When you set up these precise conditions,the more data you collect, the more the distribution produces exactly the samenormal shape.The bell-shaped curve never becomes triangle shaped, or square shaped, orinverted. And extreme numbers—such as one hundred heads in a hundredflips—virtually never occurs.This is not theory; it is evidence—it is fact. You can program your personalcomputer to generate random numbers and plot the distributions. The normal curveshows up every single time. It is as reliable as sand mixing in a container.In the presence of complete independence, chance does not create improbablenovel orders. It creates normal curves.The explanation and surprising purpose for this fundamental observation isprovided in Part Four.Clearly, chance could neither explain nor create the kinds of life patternsobserved with Robinson in Part One, let alone the existence of supermacroorganized patterns of billions of spiral galaxies in the universe.PART THREE—CAN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH G.O.D.?CHAPTER 5. TALKING TO AN INTELLIGENT BLACK BOXPart Two indicates that chance cannot explain the existence of order in theDream Detective experiments described in Part One. Moreover, Part Two indicatesthat when chance is allowed to operate, one always gets a mixture—be it of sandor of numbers.If chance does not, by itself, produce the origin and evolution of complexorders (Part Two), and if exquisitely orchestrated orders exist subliminally inour lives (Part One), then it should be possible, in principle, to receiveinformation from this Guiding-Organizing-Designing process to help navigate ourlives.Chapter 5 provides the theoretical rationale from systems science that explainshow “the All is in the Small”—how a G.O.D. process is theoretically present inall things, from the micro to the macro. The fictional story of an intelligentblack box is shared, with a surprise ending (you’ll have to read the chapter forthe ending) that indicates how we must be willing to ask the right questions,with the right intentions (including genuineness and humility), if our goal isto receive the right answers.CHAPTER 6. I ASKED THE UNIVERSE A QUESTIONIn Chapter 6 the author performed an exploratory experiment and asked theuniverse a question. He was a professor at Yale at the time, and was beginningto accept the possibility that everyone, in principle, had the possibility ofreceiving information from a higher or universal creative intelligence.The author hated the word “God” (his childhood image was of a whitebushy-bearded man with a cane who went around spreading plagues on people). Hedecided one night to ask the universe if it would give him a new name for “God.”The surprising name he received (you’ll need to read the chapter to learn thename) initially sounded ridiculous but turned out to have a Hebrew root thatmeans “the name of God.”The author considered eleven possible explanations for the word he received,beginning with the possibility that he learned the answer when he went to templeas a child. However, the only explanation that fit the totality of the historyand experience was the eleventh explanation: “Be careful what you ask for.”The author was sufficiently frightened by the potential implications of hisinitial personal experiment that he did not ask another question of the universefor close to ten years.CHAPTER 7. I ASKED THE UNIVERSE MORE QUESTIONSLest the reader conclude that the name the author received in response to hisquestion was simply a lucky guess (one of the eleven possible explanationsconsidered in Chapter 6), the author includes one more example of an additionalpersonal experiment where he asked the universe a question.This question was triggered by a woman who boldly asked him a question after hegave an invited address at a science-of-consciousness meeting in New Mexico. Thewoman asked him, “Do you believe in the theory and data you presented?”The author attempted to explain to her, and the audience, that scientists do not“believe”; what they do is consider alternative hypotheses and evaluate theprobability that a given hypothesis is true.The woman was not satisfied with his answer. She repeated her question morevehemently; he proposed they talk about it later.That night, in his hotel, the author decided to ask the universe the followingquestion: “How can I know—and prove—that some sort of aGuiding-Organizing-Designing field exists in the universe?” (He sometimes refersto this as the G.O.D.-field process.)The answer he heard completely surprised him. It was “Remember the diamond.”This was followed by three images of diamonds, from the origin of diamonds inthe earth, to a skilled cutter shaping the rough diamond, to the use of thediamond in the COBE space telescope to detect the nonrandom background radiationthat occurred shortly after the Big Bang.The following morning, an extraordinary coincidence occurred that was asremarkable as any coincidence observed in the Robinson experiments (you willhave to read Chapter 7 to learn the coincidence). The event insured not onlythat the author would never forget the experience, but that he would ultimatelyconfess the experience as personal evidence for some sort of aGuiding-Organizing-Designing process in the universe.CHAPTER 8. INTERESTING AND AMUSING THEORIESWhat is the process by which scientists search for evidence and draw conclusionsfrom data, especially if the conclusions are bold and far-reaching?Using the phrase from emergency room medicine “When you hear hoofbeats, don’tthink zebras,” the chapter reviews how responsible medicine and science adoptthe framework of considering the most probable explanations first (for example,in the United States, horses), and consider the less probable explanations (forexample, zebras) only after the most probable explanations have been ruled out.If we use the criteria “beyond reasonable doubt” and even “virtually beyond anydoubt,” the totality of the evidence from physics, mathematics, psychology, andparapsychology leads to a simple and parsimonious conclusion—called Ockham’sRazor.The horse/chance explanation does not account for the totality of the data; azebra/universal intelligence explanation is required. In a word, the thesis ofthis book is “When you hear hoofbeats, think a G.O.D. process.”Chapter 8 also discusses the difference between “interesting” and “amusing”theories. The Nobel Prize-winning physicist Eugene Wigner, of PrincetonUniversity, taught his students that “interesting theories, though often true,are often not worth thinking about, whereas amusing theories, though often nottrue, are absolutely worth thinking about.” The book illustrates how theproposed Experimental G.O.D. process theory, existing as UniversalConsciousness, fits the criteria of being an “amusing” theory worthy of ourserious contemplation. It is important to remember that sometimes amusingtheories turn out to be true.The chapter ends with examining how people vary in their beliefs regarding somesort of a G.O.D. process—from strong believers, to agnostics, to extremedisbelievers.This book is not about culture-based beliefs derived from religion; it is aboutevidence-based beliefs derived from science. The evidence is provided in such away that the reader not only can make up his or her own mind, but in theprocess, can develop insight into how he or she comes to reach theseconclusions—or why she or he resists them.PART FOUR—THE GREAT G.O.D. DEBATECHAPTER 9. CHANCE VERSUS INTELLIGENT DESIGN—WHICH IS IT?Chapter 9 discusses the “chance universe” versus the “intelligently designeduniverse” debate in some depth. It reviews the debate from both a philosophicaland scientific point of view.In the process of reviewing the great debate, the fundamental but oftenforgotten distinction is drawn between observations (evidence) andinterpretations (explanations), using the Copernican Revolution as anillustration.Throughout recorded history—up to the present day—humans on the earth havewitnessed the sun seemingly rise in the east and set in the west. In Tucson,which typically receives more than 330 days of clear skies a year, it ispossible to see a bright yellow round-shaped object appear seemingly out ofnowhere in the east. It then seems to move across the sky during the day andultimately disappears at the end of the day.This completely replicable observation led people for thousands ofyears—including distinguished scientists and religious leaders—to theinterpretation/explanation/conclusion that the sun revolves around the earth.It is now well known that this conclusion is a mistaken interpretation of theobservations. There is an alternative explanation for the relationship betweenthe sun and the earth that creates the same observations of the sun seeminglyrevolving around the earth.Copernicus predicted, and Galileo confirmed, that the alternative and highlycontroversial interpretation—that the earth revolves on its axis and circles thesun—was the more accurate and probable explanation. Not only did the Copernican“heliocentric” explanation provide a simpler description of the observationsthan the commonsense “geocentric” explanation; it predicted and explainedseemingly anomalous observations in the movements of stars that could not behandled by the geocentric theory.The take-home message from this paradigm-changing moment in the history ofscience is that just because the sun looks like it is revolving around theearth—an interpretation of the observations—does not make it the onlyinterpretation or the correct one.This book proposes that the same lesson applies to coin flips and ourinterpretation of chance. There is no question that under certainconditions—complete independence of events—we will observe approximately 50percent heads and 50 percent tails. However, this does not mean that the chanceor random interpretation/explanation/conclusion is either the only conclusion orthe correct one. The author suggests that there is a new revolution in theinterpretation of apparent randomness and chance in the universe.CHAPTER 10. CAN G.O.D. PLAY DICE WITH THE UNIVERSE?The new, revolutionary explanation for the observation of coin flips is actuallyquite simple; in fact, it is just as simple, in principle, as is Copernicus’srevolutionary explanation for the observation of the sun’s relationship to theearth.Recall that to create the conditions necessary to observe chance, each eventmust be independent of every other event. Moreover, each event must be the sameas the previous event—it cannot change, grow, or learn over time. Under theseconditions, a normal distribution will be observed every single time, especiallyif you include more coin flips or data.The question then arises, does nature exist this way—does it fit these requiredconditions? The answer is plain and simple: no. What physics tells us is thatevents are not independent; they are interdependent to various degrees becauseeverything is interconnected by gravitational, electromagnetic, and quantumfields.The first person to state this expressly was Sir Isaac Newton with his theory ofgravity. Newton proposed that every physical object, regardless of its size, hasmass that pulls in all directions. This gravitational force extends into space,in all directions—and according to contemporary physics, it extends infinitely!This means that not only does the earth pull on you and the moon; you pull onthe earth and the moon. The moon cannot move without affecting the earth andyou; conversely, you can’t move without affecting the earth and the moon. Ofcourse, your mass is much smaller than that of the earth or the moon, so youreffect is less intense. But the effect is still there.This is why when you throw a coin in the air and you are standing on the earth,it falls. Moreover, it does not fall randomly, because it is influenced, tovarious degrees, by all objects in its vicinity, including you and other peoplearound you—even though it averages out to approximately 50 percent.Newton was an extremely religious man; he saw the universal, invisible,unconditional, nonprejudicial, attractive force that held the universe togetherto be an expression of “God’s love” in the universe.If the conditions of independence do not ultimately exist in nature, then thedistributions observed in nature should never actually be normal—they will beskewed or shaped to various degrees by the organizing forces interconnecting theobjects.In Pagels’s revealing chapter on randomness in his book The Cosmic Code, helamented that physicists, when they looked closely, discovered that the patternsof numbers observed in nature never expressed true randomness as produced byrandom sampling. Like most physicists, he found this quite puzzling. Iunderscore “never.”However, if interdependence is the rule, not the exception, in the universe,then the conditions necessary to produce a normal distribution are not presentin the universe. It logically follows that we cannot, with integrity, use chanceor randomness as an explanation for the origin and evolution of order in theuniverse if the conditions necessary to produce randomness are not present inthe first place.If chance cannot be an explanation for order, then the existence of some sort ofGuiding-Organizing-Designing process must be hypothesized.If intelligence is the rule, not the exception, in the universe, then whatintelligent purpose would apparent randomness (events that appear to beunpredictable) serve if it was not really random?Why would a universal intelligent designing process make it possible forapparent randomness to exist in the first place? Could this be an expression ofintelligent evolution?A simple K.I.S.S. explanation suggests itself. Since randomness—as produced byrandom sampling—does not occur by chance, what apparent randomness does is give,within limits, the opportunity or chance for novel orders to occur.In other words, relative randomness is a tool for allowing creatively designedorders to occur. Relative randomness allows for intelligent, trial-and-errorlearning to occur in the evolving universe.Therefore, the new revolution in thinking is the hypothesis that chance providesthe opportunity for creatively designed orders to be discovered and expressed.In a sense, God does play dice with the universe; however, the purpose isdifferent than we thought historically and it is ultimately consistent withEinstein’s spiritual vision.INTERLUDE. THE “DIVINE PROPORTION”One of the most remarkable metapatterns that replicate throughout nature and theuniverse is defined by the numerical ratio termed phi. Phi is defined bymathematicians to be an irrational number—it is like the pi ratio in that nomatter how far its digits have been extended, we have never discovered arepetition that defines its order. Because we are currently not able to discoverits order, we typically assume (mistakenly) that it must be random ordisordered.What’s truly astonishing about the phi ratio is that it pops up in diverseshapes and dynamics spanning art and architecture, botany and biology, physicsand mathematics, and even economics and astrophysics. The golden ratio is foundto occur in the dynamics of the stock market as well as the shape of billions ofstars in a spiraling galaxy.Does phi, sometimes called the golden ratio, reflect a “Divine Proportion”? IsG.O.D., among other things, a universal and infinite mathematician? Theseage-old questions take on new meaning in light of the evidence and reasoningpresented in this book.CHAPTER 11. WHY SCIENCE SHAVES WITH OCKHAM’S RAZORChance, by itself, cannot explain the origin and evolution of order in theuniverse. So does this necessarily require that we posit some kind ofintelligent designing process to explain everything that exists in the universe?The key word here is “everything” and the commonsense answer is “No.”Even if we accept the fact that sand paintings never paint themselves, or thatwatches never assemble themselves, we recognize that many phenomena in natureseem to organize themselves quite well. I underscore “seem.”Everyday experience reminds us that clouds appear to spontaneously emerge,raindrops appear to liquefy and fall naturally, and tornadoes appear to swirland create destruction, all seemingly by themselves. Oak seeds appear to growinto oak trees, and fertilized human eggs appear to grow into newborn babies,again all seemingly by themselves.Phenomena that seemingly invent and evolve themselves are scientifically termed“self-organizing systems.” Nature is replete with systems that show apparentself-organizing properties.This chapter addresses this question from the perspective of Ockham’s Razor. Itis a fact that some systems appear as if they self-organize; it is also a factthat the earth appears to be flat. The key term in both cases is “appear.” Oneapproach is to posit that there are two classes of phenomena in nature, oneclass or set of evidence that requires some sort of an externalGuiding-Organizing-Designing process (e.g., sand paintings), another class orset of evidence that seems not to (e.g., clouds). A second approach is toinclude and integrate all of the evidence—including the existence of invisiblefields that interconnect everything that exists in the universe—and posit that asingle explanation, the G.O.D. process explanation, accounts for both classes ofphenomena. This is the approach of Ockham’s Razor.The G.O.D. process explanation also makes new predictions that can be confirmedor disconfirmed in future research. The organizing sun prediction is explainedas a logical extension of using Ockham’s Razor and applying it to the G.O.D.process explanation.PART FIVE—IMPLICATIONS OF G.O.D. FOR EVERYTHINGCHAPTER 12. WHO ARE WE AND WHY ARE WE HERE?Chapter 12 returns to the power and potential of the human mind, and illustrateshow the human mind can extend from the “infinitely Small” to “beyond the All.”The reader is taken through a mental exercise to imagine holding an object inhis hand. The object of focus increases in size over eleven stages or steps. Thesteps include a single subatomic particle (photon), a single atom (hydrogen), asingle complex biochemical (DNA), a single cell (neuron), a single organ(brain), a single person (female), a single planet (earth), a single galaxy(Milky Way), and a universe (our universe). The last two steps involve imaginingthat your mind is holding the previous nine steps in your hand, and then thatyour mind is part of a larger Universal Mind that is enabling you to do this inthe first place.The lesson of this exercise is that the human mind has the potential to extendbeyond everything it can even imagine. Within the Small—our individual minds—isthe infinite potential of the All.The theoretically infinite potential of the human mind extends to understandingvarious types and levels of designing processes. Five levels of designing aredescribed. Designing processes can be thought of as being (1) relativelyindependent, (2) relatively genetically determined, (3) relatively shaped byeducation and culture, (4) relatively emergent through interactions with otherpeople, living as well as “in spirit” (discussed in The Afterlife Experiments),and (5) guided to some degree by a universal higher intelligence. All fivelevels can operate to various degrees and can be a manifestation of a universal,invisible G.O.D. process.The chapter ends with a discussion about how the human mind can discover theso-called weird nature of light (sometimes referred to as quantum weirdness). Itis explained how light is remarkably invisible to light—beams of light can passthrough each other without disturbing each other. Light is able to do thispresumably because it is both massless (has no mass) and spaceless (isinfinitely small). It is this seemingly miraculously property of light thatenables it to store infinite information in the vacuum of space.Is this seemingly impossible nature of light potential evidence of asuperintelligent designing process? Was this property of light designed for aspecial purpose? The answer that is revealed in the chapter is both simple andprofound.CHAPTER 13. EVIDENCE-BASED FAITHThere are five different ways that people form their beliefs and ultimatelytheir faiths. The five ways are (1) education-based beliefs taught by theirfamilies and institutions, (2) emotion-based beliefs shaped by their emotionsand wishes, (3) experience-based beliefs based upon their direct personalexperiences and how they interpret these experiences, (4) reason-based beliefsformed through logic and inductive thought, and (5) evidence-based beliefsdeveloped through personal experiments plus systematic research of scientists.The same five ways apply to the formation of faiths as well.Our beliefs about the world—be they spiritual or otherwise—reflect somecombination of these five ways of believing.How do you form your beliefs? Which ways do you use to determine your faiths?Particularly concerning religions, we are told that we should base our beliefsand faiths on what our parents and religious leaders tell us—i.e.,education-based faith—regardless of whether or not the stories we are told feelright (emotion-based), fit our direct personal experiences (experience-based),are logical (reason-based), or fit the facts as supported by scientific data(evidence-based).However, if our faith does not fit the facts of nature, why should we maintainthe faith? If the emperor has no clothes, shouldn’t we say so?This chapter proposes that if we use evidence-based faith as a primary way offorming our faiths, science curiously does not take away the idea of meaning,purpose, and higher intelligence in the universe; it actually supports theconcept of a universal and intelligent G.O.D. process in a way that turns out tobe remarkably true to the spiritual essence, commonalities, and foundations ofearly religious education, emotion, experience, and logic. By “essence” I do notmean creation stories and the like told by native cultures or written in theBible; I mean processes that reflect universal principles that can be documentedscientifically.The chapter emphasizes how, even when the evidence indicates that somethingappears to happen 100 percent of the time, we must nevertheless still take it onfaith and trust that it will continue to happen that way again in the future.Evidence-based faith teaches us that nothing is completely certain, not evenwhen something historically has occurred 100 percent of the time. Evidence-basedfaith reminds us to remain open to changing our minds in the future, to functioncautiously, with humility.The chapter ends with examples of how we can apply this to our daily lives,including applying evidence-based faith to discoveries of what the late SusySmith said was “too coincidental to be accidental.” The author shares an examplefrom his life—an apparent car accident that totally demolished his car. Onlymuch later did he realize the coincidental nature of how and why he could havesurvived the crash virtually unscathed.CHAPTER 14. IMPLICATIONS OF INTELLIGENT EVOLUTION FOR SOCIETYIf we take an evidence-based-faith approach to the existence of some sort ofuniversal G.O.D. process in our personal lives, the life of the planet, and theevolution of the universe as a whole, what implications does this approach havefor science, education, business, law, politics, and religion?Virtually no aspect of human activity is unaffected by this transformation inhow we view the cosmos and our place in it.This visionary and controversial chapter cannot be easily summarized—you mustread it to appreciate it. One illustration is presented below from the section“Considering Feedback from G.O.D. in Business Decisions.”What do you think might happen if business were to reexamine itself, and itconsidered receiving guidance and direction from the universe that it ultimatelyserves?If we are a product of an infinite intelligence—and I underscore if—the evidenceindicates that we have been given substantial freedom to believe what we want,regardless of whether or not our beliefs match reality. We even have the freedomto believe or not in the existence of an infinite intelligence that potentiallyprovided this gift of freedom in the first place! Freedom to believe, for betteror worse, appears to be a purposeful part of intelligent evolution.We have a choice not to believe in a G.O.D. process. And we can run ourbusinesses without thinking about G.O.D. in the context of what we do. In fact,this is the way most businesses function.However, we also have the choice to believe in a G.O.D. process. We can, if weso choose, take G.O.D. into account in the design and execution of what we do inour business lives. We can even consider consulting with people speciallytrained who regularly ask the universe for feedback about business choices andvalues, and see what information they receive—what I term “evidence-basedoracles.”Should we “ask God first” when we make business decisions? Should we place thisinformation on the boardroom table, and see how it fits with what we want to do?Is G.O.D. the ultimate CEO? Are our CEOs ultimately under the invisibleguidance? What if our CEOs were to ask for more overt guidance from G.O.D.?Would our world become a healthier, joyful, more peaceful and fulfilling home?Science is no longer taking G.O.D. away; it is discovering G.O.D. in every placeit looks. Science is not an enemy of a G.O.D. process; it is his/her/its/theirultimate servant.Science is the universal tool by which we can know the G.O.D. process and revealthe great potential that exists within us and around us.Science is not only enabling us to see the power of our individual minds; it isenabling us to discover the universal meta-mind that provides the spark for allof us.CHAPTER 15. THE ORGANIZING MINDIn this chapter we return to research and address the question, can the humanmind interact with subatomic particles that are isolated by electrical andmagnetic shielding? Experiments are reported using an electronic device thatmeasures the behavior of electrons in an electro-magnetically shielded box. Thefindings indicate that when a person is in a mental state that is meditativeand/or absorbing, the electro-magnetically isolated electrons will begin movingaway from presumed randomness. In the process, the behavior of the electronsbecomes more organized.Moreover, if groups of people are engaged in synchronized meditation and othertasks that are absorbing, the behavior of the electrons will become moreorganized.Even though the people were not trying to influence the electrons, the electronsresponded to the mental state of the people. The experiment involvedapproximately twenty-five hundred practitioners of a kind of Chinese Qigong who,save for our Chinese collaborators and their colleagues, were completely unawarethat their meeting was being monitored.The findings suggest two conclusions. The first is that the human mind, when itis in certain states, can have an organizing effect even at the subatomic level.The second is that this effect is not mediated by electromagnetic fields per se,but may involve a more direct quantum connection if not actual consciousnessconnection attributed to the hypothesis of universal consciousness.CHAPTER 16. WISDOM IN THE STARSWalter Cannon, M.D., the distinguished professor of physiology at HarvardUniversity, wrote a book titled The Wisdom of the Body that addressed thequestion “How does the physical body become organized and maintain a state ofbalance and health?”Chapter 16 takes this question further by asking whether there is evidence forthe wisdom of the system or the wisdom of the universe as a whole.The author describes a thought experiment conceived at Harvard involving theinvention of the “superstomach” that illustrates how processes will go out ofcontrol when essential, guiding feedback systems are disrupted or disconnected.If a universal G.O.D. process exists, and it has infinite intelligence andwisdom, then we should be able to discover this wisdom to the extent that we areable and willing to apply the knowledge for the purpose of healing, evolution,and transformation.CHAPTER 17. THE GENIUS WITHIN EVERYONETwo thousand years ago, the stoic philosopher Epictetus wrote: “When you closeyour doors and make darkness within, remember never to say you are alone, foryou are not alone; God is within, and your genius is within.”If G.O.D. is some sort of universal Guiding-Organizing-Designing process, thisimplies that G.O.D. is some sort of omnipresent Genius-Organizing-Developer ofthe universe and everything within it.Can science go beyond concluding that “some sort of” intelligent G.O.D. processexists, and discover more precisely what is the nature of this process?Can science reveal details about G.O.D.?Chapter 17 presents contemporary scientific evidence and associated theory thatlead to the conclusion that consciousness is not a product of the brain, or evena creation of matter per se, but actually precedes and shapes the creation ofenergy and matter.Dr. Dean Radin’s book The Conscious Universe and Dr. William Tiller’s bookConscious Acts of Creation provide substantial evidence supporting the thesisthat consciousness is a universal process that is omnipresent to various degreesat every level of nature.This visionary and controversial conclusion, coming from current physics andparapsychology, provides an empirical foundation for the existence of anintelligent, and evolving, Guiding-Organizing-Designing process at every levelof nature.The evidence is not going away. It is growing. The challenge is for us to cometo understand and accept it, and then live our lives accordingly.CHAPTER 18. SUMMING UP THE G.O.D. EXPERIMENTS—THE EMERGING CASE FOR INTELLIGENTEVOLUTIONThis chapter reviews the logic and evidence presented in the book that leads tothe conclusion that some sort of superintelligent G.O.D. process exists in theuniverse. The logic and evidence flow as follows.Fact 1: Order is the rule. There is compelling evidence that order is the rule,not the exception, in nature and the universe, and that metapatterns replicateat every level in nature, from subatomic particles to clusters of galaxies, andeverything in between.Fact 2: Extraordinary order in everyday life. There are long-standing claims,buttressed by contemporary evidence in parapsychology (an example of such anexperiment is presented in Part One), that indicate that levels of coincidencesand synchronicities can be observed in daily life. These patterns are soextraordinary that they imply the existence of exceptional orchestration andcoordination in life.Fact 3: Extraordinary order is virtually impossible by chance alone. Whenconventional statistics are used to calculate the probabilities of suchorders—including metapatterns—occurring by chance per se, the probabilities areextremely tiny if not infinitesimally small.Fact 4: Experiments do not support chance as a valid explanation. When simpleexperiments are conducted to determine whether orders occur by chance alone, thefindings come up negative. An experiment using colored sand is described thatindicates that sand paintings are never created by chance alone. In the absenceof a Guiding-Organizing-Designing process, sand always mixes. Moreover, whencomputer modeling experiments are conducted that set up the required conditionsfor randomness to occur—the key condition is independence of events—the computeralways generates a normal curve.Fact 5: Nature does not fit the required conditions for chance. When therequired conditions for chance to occur—complete independence of events—areviewed in the context of contemporary physics, we discover that nothing thatexists meets the criteria of independence. All things are interconnected andintertwined by physical fields—including gravitational and electromagneticfields. Randomness cannot occur in the absence of complete independence.Some sort of an intelligent, trial-and-error, Guiding-Organizing-Designingprocess is required to explain 1-5 above (Part Five).Fact 6: The universe sometimes answers questions. Exploratory experiments arepresented indicating that under certain conditions, it is possible to ask theuniverse questions and receive answers that can be verified. The findingsprovide proof in principle that some sort of a G.O.D. process can be accessed bythe human mind and brought into the laboratory in future research (Part Three).Fact 7: Ockham’s Razor and parsimonious explanation. Although certain phenomenain nature—such as the emergence of clouds or the growing of oak trees—appear toself-organize, the key term here is “appear.” The history of science reminds usthat just because the earth appears to be flat, or that the sun appears torevolve around the earth, does not necessarily mean that these are the correctperceptions. Ockham’s Razor is used in science to select the simplestexplanation that not only accounts for the largest amount of the data, but alsomakes novel predictions that can be confirmed or disconfirmed in futureresearch. When Ockham’s Razor is applied to the totality of the evidence, itpicks some sort of an intelligent, trial-and-error, G.O.D. process explanation.The conventional explanation offered by skeptics, is that the existence ofnatural laws, plus randomness, can account for both creativity and evolution oforders in the universe. However, these scientists do not address the questionabout where the laws and their essential organization and compatibility comefrom (chance is not a viable explanation), nor how random sampling—whichrequires independence—could exist to foster creative orders in an interconnecteduniverse.Chapter 18 ends with a question: can science go beyond the “some sort of” G.O.D.explanation to discover details of the nature of G.O.D.? The answer is yes,mathematically and psychologically.EPILOGUE. INFINITE LOVE: THE ULTIMATE GIFT FROM G.O.D.?No discussion of an evidence-based-faith approach to G.O.D. can be completewithout introducing the concept of universal infinite love as an expression ofan infinite G.O.D. process. Religious writers throughout recorded history havetypically described the universal God as a “God of love.”This chapter reveals how humans, more than any species, have the capacity tolove virtually everything. We can love people, animals, plants, places, art,music, buildings, machines, sports, stories, and ideas themselves. We are borninto the world as little spiritual bio-love machines. Our potential to love isas vast as our potential to think.However, just as our capacity for thinking and creativity requires carefuleducation and training, our capacity for love and compassion requires carefulnurturing and modeling. Humans’ capacity to love is as much a miracle as is ourcapacity to understand.Just as we too often take our mind’s potential for granted, we take our heart’spotential for granted as well. The question is, can we learn to love wisely aswe learn to think wisely?The chapter begins with the question, is G.O.D. “too cruel to be imagined”? Orare we given choice—in other words, given the chance—to choose wisdom and loveover ignorance and hatred? Who are you, ultimately—your education and history,or your potential to grow and evolve?Who do you wish to be?If the “All is in the Small,” then our universal potential for infinite love maybe the universe’s ultimate gift.The G.O.D. process says, “Ahh, finally you have the idea.”"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX B Image [../images/00035.gif]FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND SOME CRITICAL ANSWERSWhat led you to the conclusion that some sort of a G.O.D. process must exist inthe universe?I was led there first by theory, second by experiments, and third by personalexperiences. I was not led there by religion or politics.I was originally led to the G.O.D. process conclusion in the early 1980s when Iread textbooks on systems theory and integrated this information withcontemporary physics.Systems (and networks) are highly interconnected, and everything is ultimatelyinterconnected by physical fields. Being well trained in statistics, I realizedthat if I accepted the reality required by systems theory and physicalfields—and I underscore “if”—then chance and randomness as defined statistically(the orders that occur with random sampling) could not actually operate in theuniverse, since the statistics of chance and random sampling require completeindependence of events.Appreciating the theoretical prediction that chance could not operate in aninterconnected universe, I then began to test whether this prediction was trueor not using simple experiments like the sand painting experiment, followed bycomputer modeling experiments. The experiments were definitive—for example, sandpaintings never occurred by chance per se; instead, sand always mixed. Andcomputer programs designed to allow chance to occur always produced normaldistributions.My personal experiences, approached as exploratory experiments, came later. Itis possible that my personal exploratory experiments turned out to be sopositive because in light of the compelling theoretical and experimentaldiscoveries, I was open to the possibility of a G.O.D. process.Was the G.O.D. process concept based upon your religious upbringing?Not at all.I was raised in a Reform Jewish home that practiced what I call “devoutagnosticism” and what my writing partner calls “orthodox agnosticism.” Whetherthe question raised was about gravity or God, the approach was the same.My parents taught me, and I paraphrase, “I don’t know. Could be yes, could beno. Show me the data. I’m open.” Their philosophy was not “It’s impossible toknow about gravity or God”; rather it was “I don’t know, but I’m open tolearning, one way or the other.” I was the annoying child in school who wasalways asking questions like “Why is the sky blue” and “Why are photonsinvisible?”I did go to Catholic church with girlfriends, I played basketball for a while asa member of a Methodist church team, and I learned a bit about how Christiansviewed God.Meanwhile, my Jewish upbringing spoke of a white man with a beard and cane whopurportedly not only killed Egyptians but indirectly allowed his son to bekilled as well.The truth is, as an adolescent and adult I viewed such stories as myths andfables, and I rejected them.Are you a religious person?In the sense of holding a specific set of beliefs and following a particularpractice, the answer is no.Are you a spiritual person?Yes, but I have come to my spirituality through science.Are you a creationist?Since I do not hold a specific set of religious beliefs, I cannot be acreationist—and this book is not a creationist book.Are you a Kabbalist or a numerologist?Same answer. I do not hold beliefs that would allow me to be a Kabbalist or anumerologist. Just because some of the data reported in this book are consistentwith certain predictions of specific religious or metaphysical groups—includingcreationists, Kabbalists, and numerologists—that does not imply that I adopt theoverall philosophies and practices of these groups.Are you a Darwinian evolutionist or a Dembskian “intelligent designist”?In the scientific sense I subscribe to the concepts of both evolution andintelligent design, but only when these words are defined in terms of theiroriginal, generic meanings. I am neither a Darwinian nor an Dembskian,especially in terms of the politics of science or religion.The only “ist” that I firmly adopt is “scientist.” My purpose is to be a“truthist”—concerned with the truth, whatever it is.Were you an atheist when you began this work?Somewhat. I was originally an agnostic, leaning toward the atheist side.What books, early on, opened your mind to the possibility of a G.O.D. process?Early on, the books that opened my eyes came primarily from physiology andsystems theory.Dr. Walter Cannon’s The Wisdom of the Body opened my eyes to the existence ofremarkable order in the body (and in his last chapter, of order in socialsystems). Cannon introduced me to the idea that feedback was a universal processin all systems at all levels.Dr. James G. Miller’s Living Systems opened my mind to the existence of complexsystems sharing common organizations that “shred out” (as he termed it) fromcells and organs to organisms and institutions. Miller showed me how ordersseemed to replicate, from the micro to the macro.Dr. Heinz Pagels’s book The Cosmic Code opened my mind to the existence of codes(orders) that operate even at the quantum level. He also reminded me that fieldsare the rule, not the exception, everywhere, including the “vacuum” of space.I read hundreds of books during that period. But these three provided theinspiration that ultimately led to my writing this book.Is research on the G.O.D. process encouraged by your discipline or colleagues?For the most part, no.Psychologists, as a group, tend to focus on individuals or groups ofindividuals. This is their mission.They are not typically well trained in mathematics, physics, systems science,complexity theory, parapsychology, ecology, or astrophysics. And as a group theyhave little interest in these topics.Hence, the discipline of psychology does not stimulate its constituents toponder big-picture questions or think integratively.In addition, academic psychologists tend to be secular, not strongly religiousor spiritual, and a significant subset of them are confirmed atheists. Also,evolutionary psychology is growing.However, the psychology of religion is growing, and I created a course at theUniversity of Arizona titled Psychology of Religion and Spirituality.Have your conceptions been inspired by certain individuals?Yes. Einstein has been a huge hero and role model. His interests spanned thescientific and the spiritual. Cannon, Miller, and Pagels have each inspired mein their own ways.Contemporary senior scientists like Professors Rustum Roy and William Tiller,discussed in Chapters 16-18, as well as Drs. Radin and Nelson as examples (seeChapter 7), are visionary scientists who see the need to integrate science,spirituality, and healing.What was the critical theoretical insight that led you to conclude that chancecould not be the primary explanation for the origin and evolution of order inthe universe?The key was the concept of the field in physics. Beginning with Sir Isaac Newtonand his concept of the gravitational field, physics became open to inferring theexistence of invisible fields that could travel in all directions and extendinto space, potentially infinitely. When Sir James Clerk Maxwell developed themathematical equations for electromagnetic fields, it became clear that masslessand spaceless particles, termed photons, existed and traveled in the “vacuum” ofspace and interconnected everything that existed in the universe.The truth is that fields are ultimately completely mysterious. What sense doesit make to posit something that is nonmaterial (has no mass and takes up nospace), yet travels in space and provides information—form—that regulateseverything that is material?Physicists posit the existence of fields because the math (logic) dictates theirexistence, and experiments provide data that require their existence.Einstein said, “The field is the only reality.” Einstein was driven to discovera unified field theory. He never reached his goal.The existence of fields eliminates independence in the universe. Noindependence, no randomness as defined by statistics. We can’t use the chanceexplanation, first and foremost, because the universe does not fit theconditions required for chance to occur.What was the critical experimental insight that led you to conclude that chancecould not be the primary explanation for the origin and evolution of order inthe universe?I had many experimental insights that were critical. However, my favoriteinvolved sand paintings and sand mixing. Everyone can understand the conditionsfor creating sand paintings. Everyone can conduct the sand painting containerexperiment. Everyone can discover that sand always mixes in the absence of anordering process. Sand paintings can be beautiful. And sand paintings arefundamentally spiritual and are used for healing by native cultures.The sand painting experiment was not the very first experiment that led me tothe deep experimental insight. The experimental insight first occurred to me ina more mundane setting—as I was folding my clothing in a lovely Maine Laundromatthat looked out over the ocean.A woman across the table from me was creating a folded clothing sculpture—andmine by comparison looked like a mess. However, despite the prediction of simplestatistics that by chance alone, one’s clothing could fold, if you conduct theexperiment (throw your clean clothes in the air), does it ever come down neatlyfolded? Of course not.If the G.O.D. process is truly universal, it must play a role not only inguiding the behavior of electrons, DNA, brains, sand paintings, people’s lives,the earth’s climate, the paths of the planets, the spiraling of galaxies, andthe formation of superclusters of galaxies; it must also play a role in guidingeven the most mundane of events, such as the folding of clothing.The price a scientist pays for positing the existence of a universal process isthat she or he has the responsibility to determine whether the claim foruniversality can be met or not.What was the critical personal experience you had that led you to conclude thatchance could not be the primary explanation for the origin and evolution oforder in the universe?The most powerful personal experience was probably the set of events I describein Appendix C: “Extraordinary Synchronicity in New York City.” If you could putyourself in my shoes, and ponder what I must have felt as I witnessed oneimprobable event after another occurring, you could imagine my sense of bothwonder and fear. I could not deny seeing the patterns in the evidence, yet thetotality of the evidence seemed completely unbelievable to me as well as to mostpeople who hear the story.Only the existence of some sort of an intelligent G.O.D. process could explainthis pattern of data.How do you respond to skeptics who claim that if you wait long enough, sandpaintings will ultimately paint themselves?My response is simple. I ask them the following question: “Why do you think thatif you wait long enough, it will happen by chance?”Is their prediction based upon data? Clearly no, because the evidence from thesand container box shows that every single time, the sand moves towarduniformity as it mixes. It never does otherwise. Never.Is their prediction based upon theory? Clearly no, because chance statisticsrequires that each event be independent of every other event, and this conditiondoes not exist in a sand container box.So if their prediction is inconsistent with the evidence, and is not based uponlogic consistent with scientific theory, then what is it based upon?Possibilities include (1) misunderstanding statistics, (2) distrust of physics,(3) wishful thinking, (4) magical thinking, (5) need to believe that a G.O.D.process does not exist, (6) fear of invisible guidance and power implied by aG.O.D. process, (7) lack of humility and inability to accept being wrong.It is remotely possible that they have a valid reason—however, given everythingthat we currently understand in math, physics, psychology, and parapsychology, Ijust don’t know at this point what this could be.How is your concept of evidence-based faith related to William James’s conceptof radical empiricism?William James was ultimately an empiricist. Even though James loved ideas (hewas a philosopher as well as a scientist), he was more in favor of evidence thanideas. I suspect that James would approve of the philosophy of evidence-basedfaith.In your opinion, what is the most plausible and responsible skeptical criticismof the position you have taken in this book?A responsible skeptic will point out that sometimes Ockham’s Razor is wrong.Ockham’s Razor is not an ironclad rule; it is a helpful guide. The phrase “Thesimplest and most parsimonious explanation is usually the correct one” shouldemphasize “usually.”It is possible that at least two explanations will be required to explain thetotality of order in the universe, and neither will require the existence of auniversal Guiding-Organizing-Designing process.Yes, humans engage in intelligent, trial-and-error design. So do lower animalsto various degrees. Intelligence exists and is growing—artificial intelligencecan now be packaged in man-made machines.And yes, sand does not paint itself; and watches do not design themselves orself-assemble.However, as I discuss in Chapter 12, clouds form, rains fall, oak trees grow,and humans are born. My proposal that this apparent self-organization is just“apparent” (i.e., that it requires invisible G.O.D. fields or what Sheldrakecalls “morphologic fields”) could be wrong, even though physics tells us thatself-organization depends upon the precise modulation by patterns of externalfields. Maybe instances of pure self-organization actually exist.As a general rule, skeptics usually like Ockham’s Razor. However, we must againemphasize the term “usually.” In this case, it is appropriate to be open to thepossibility that although the totality of the evidence best fits theparsimonious G.O.D. process explanation, this does not necessarily mean that itis the correct explanation.Future experiments can be conducted to provide a more definitive answer.In your opinion, what is the motivation of people who are superskeptical aboutthe existence of some sort of a G.O.D. process in the universe?Some people are motivated to be superskeptical because they are professionalskeptics. They edit skeptical magazines, serve as officers in skepticalsocieties, and advocate skeptical positions in public forums.When I gave an invited address on The Afterlife Experiments to thetwenty-fifth-anniversary meeting of the founding of the Committee to InvestigateClaims of the Paranormal (CSICOPS), I learned that approximately 95 percent ofthe members of the organization were devoted atheists.If you are a motivated and devoted atheist, whether or not you are a leader ofthe skeptical movement, you will find the evidence for a G.O.D. processchallenging if not upsetting.However, if after reading the evidence, atheists cannot come up with a goodreason to reject the evidence or its conclusion, then there are other factorsbesides logic and evidence playing a role in their skepticism.I suspect superskeptics suffer from a form of what I suffer from. I call it PESD(after PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder). “PESD” stands for posteducationstress disorder.You will recall in Chapter 6 when I first asked the universe a question. Youwill remember that I hated the word “God.” I asked for a new name for Godbecause I suffered from PESD when came to the idea of a G.O.D. process, and Ihad already come to the conclusion that the emerging logic and evidence nolonger justified my very agnostic position. It is one thing to questionevidence; it is another to dismiss evidence and the reality it reveals.Are you still an agnostic about God?Currently I would define myself as a recovered agnostic concerning the G.O.D.question. Moreover, an unintended consequence of writing a book like this isthat it becomes much harder—if not impossible—to deny the evidence and theconclusions you have reached. It is said that the proof is in the pudding. Ihave tasted heaping plates of G.O.D. pudding; and the taste is metaphoricallydivine.One of my colleagues, sophisticated in statistics and physics, severelycriticized my failure to distinguish between random sampling—a statisticaltechnique for modeling chance processes—and randomness—an observation ofapparent unpredictability that is laden with implicit interpretations (such asthe process is inherently unpredictable) in an earlier draft of the book. He wascorrect. Constructive feedback is invaluable.Also, for the record, when I report observations related to the Kabbalah, it isimportant to know that I am not a Kabbalist, and I do not subscribe to itshistorical claims. Though I resonate with some of its history and ideals, I doso from the perspective of a scientist, approaching his personal life as anatural laboratory for discovery and learning.Do you believe in a personal God?I have come to such a belief, and my belief is evidence-based. Systems scienceprovides the logic. Experiments in physics, mathematics, computer science, andparapsychology provide supportive evidence. Direct personal experience (receivedin the context of personal exploratory experiments) provides confirmatoryevidence.Why do you believe that an intelligent G.O.D. process is likely to be acreative, trial-and-error, Experimenting G.O.D.?If we adopt systems science, and then examine the evidence from nature,particularly evolution, we witness a complex process where not only is noveltythe rule (and not the exception) but also extinction is the rule (and not theexception).If (1) nature is an expression of a G.O.D. process, and (2) some sort of naturalselection process is occurring, and (3) the natural selection process isintelligent (intelligent evolution, the conclusion drawn in this book), then (4)the kind of intelligent designing process expressed is one that fits anintelligent, trial-and-error designing process.The idea of a creative, trial-and-error Experimenting G.O.D. is anevidence-based hypothesis, not a culturally (religiously) based one.What kind of evidence would convince you that the G.O.D. process theory waswrong?This is a difficult and very important question. It is difficult because I don’tknow of a plausible alternative explanation at the present time. It is veryimportant because one ideal of science is to be able, in principle, todisconfirm a given hypothesis.In certain areas of science this is sometimes extremely difficult to do.Astrophysics is one such discipline where certain hypotheses and explanationscannot be experimentally disconfirmed.Obviously, if future experiments can demonstrate that sand can actually paintitself, or that watches can assemble themselves, for example, this would bepotentially convincing. Or if evidence of complete independence is discovered toexist in future research in physics (termed a completely closed system—none havebeen discovered to this date), this would be potentially convincing.If some fundamental flaw in the reasoning was discovered, this would bepotentially convincing.This is why I qualify “beyond any doubt” with “virtually.”Keeping a little bit of doubt is always healthy.Are you a G.O.D. advocate?No. I explain to people that I am not trying to prove the existence of a G.O.D.process, nor am I trying to disprove the plausibility of chance as anexplanation for order in the universe.What I am doing is attempting to give the G.O.D. process the opportunity (or“chance”) to prove itself. Experimentally we attempt to create optimalconditions to allow the G.O.D. process, if it is real, to reveal itself. Thusfar, it has.I have also conducted experiments that have attempted to give the chanceexplanation every possible chance to prove itself. The fact that it hasrepeatedly failed to do so is telling.Are you a truth advocate?Emphatically and unequivocally yes. Harvard’s motto is Veritas and Yale’s mottois Lux et Veritas (“Light and truth”).Why do you come to the conclusion that the G.O.D. process may be evolving?The preponderance of evidence indicates that the universe has been evolving forapproximately 12 billion years or more. If the G.O.D. process is intimatelyinvolved with the origin and evolution of order in the universe, it isreasonable to posit that the G.O.D. process itself could be evolving as well.How do you respond to people who claim that they don’t understand the logicalleaps you make?My responsibility, as an educator and writer, is to try to make the logic asunderstandable as possible. Part of the reason I work with a gifted professionalwriter is to increase the probability that my logical steps are understandable.Hence, when someone does not understand the logic, I attempt to find new wordsand examples to help him. However, sometimes even simple logic is notunderstandable, that is, if the person does not want to understand.A dear friend once confessed to me, “If I dislike something, my feelings stop mefrom understanding it.”It is hard to try to understand things when they make you angry, frightened,saddened, or disgusted. For some people, the idea of a G.O.D. makes them angry,frightened, saddened, or disgusted.This helps explain why an interested child can learn this information so quicklywhile some hardened adults find it difficult if not impossible to understand.How do you respond to people who claim that the logical leaps you have made areunjustified, if not wrong?My response is simple. It is, “Please explain what the errors are that you see.”I believe in the universality of feedback and the Guiding-Organizing-Designinginformation that honest feedback provides. To guide includes the process ofcorrecting.No one that I know is perfect, and that includes me. Hence, I always ask peoplefor their explanations.Some of my colleagues provided me with some critical and helpful feedback that Iincluded in the book—such as responding explicitly to conventional scientistswho believe that physical and chemical laws are sufficient to account for theorigin and evolution of complex biochemical and biological systems, even thoughthey avoid the question of explaining the order and evolution of the laws andtheir organization in the first place. I also received some critical feedbackwhich I thought was unnecessary to include in the book—such as “maybe some sortof clockwork universe model could be formulated in the future that did notrequire intelligence” (which I would consider, using his own words, to be “idlespeculation” at best), or that maybe “interested spirits who were precognitivemanipulated the presumably random shuffling of the envelopes by the secretperson in California to create the apparent extraordinary synchronization andcoordination observed in the Christopher Robinson experiment” (which is slightlyless speculative than the clockwork universe model, but extremely improbablegiven the available evidence regarding the “power” of deceased individuals toprecisely control our behavior).A person’s explanation may be correct or incorrect in a given case. Part of thefun of science is in discovering which it is.What led you to hypothesize that a G.O.D. process involves UniversalConsciousness and Intelligence?The idea of Universal Consciousness is ancient, and I was familiar with variousphilosophical and religious arguments pro and con to the concept.However, it was a former graduate student at the University of Arizona—LonnieNelson, Ph.D.—who pushed me to go beyond the “some-sort of” G.O.D. processexplanation to address the “what kind of” G.O.D. process question.A three-hour conversation with Lonnie led us to address the question of theuniversality of consciousness as implied by the idea of a universal, intelligentG.O.D. process.The synthesis outlined in Chapter 17, written after the first polished draft ofthis book was completed, was formulated after that fateful conversation.Are there any young people who inspire you to take a scientific approach to theG.O.D. question?Thankfully, yes. Lonnie Nelson, Ph.D., is one. Others are Sheryl Attig, JulieBeischel, Ph.D., Shauna Shapiro, Ph.D., Shamini Jain, Dan Lewis, and SabrinaLewis. Others—who seem still young to me—include Katherine Creath, Ph.D., LewisMehl-Madrona, M.D., Ph.D., and Katherine Burleson, M.D. The combination of theirinspiration and critical examination provides me with energy and guidance.What do you see are the core components of the coming paradigm change implied bythis book?One big change is our idea of randomness, chance, and disorder. If order is therule in the universe, and what we term disorder is a particular kind of order(e.g., an order too complex for us to describe at the present time), then manyof our perceptions in science and life will need to change accordingly.A second big change is our idea of interconnectedness. If everything we do,including what we think, takes place in a sea of interdependence andintermixing, it follows that our sense of individuality and responsibility willneed to change accordingly.A third big change is our idea of intelligence. If intelligence is the rule inthe universe, then even lowly photons and electrons may be found to have aproto-intelligence, and our science will need to discover these properties.A fourth big change is our idea of consciousness. If consciousness is the rulein the universe, then our individual minds are expressions of a vast consciouspotential, and our answers to questions about who we are and why are we herewill take on deeper meaning. Also, how we treat animals, plants, and theenvironment will take on a new perspective.A fifth big change is our idea of physical laws and their purpose. First, asRupert Sheldrake writes, if everything that exists is in a state of evolution,including evolution itself, then what we call physical laws may be in evolutiontoo (he terms them “habits” of nature). Second, since the evidence indicatesthat there are universal orders/laws, the question arises, how do these lawsrelate to the question of intelligent design? The answer is, what we call lawsreflect intelligently designed principles and processes. In other words, aneconomical/ parsimonious universal designer will, like a skilled computerprogrammer, create commands that can serve specific design functions. From thisperspective, just as commands are created by computer programmers, universalcommands are created by the Universal Programmer.If the universe is a conscious universe, how do we as individuals fit into thegrand scheme of things?As far as we know, only human beings can hold an image of photons in one handand an image of the whole universe in the other. Our minds, in principle, arebigger in scope than the entire universe. If the universe is a universal,intelligent G.O.D. process, then we are little intelligent g.o.d. processes,serving the big G.O.D.Jesus’ words, which are not unique to him (and he claimed they came from the“Father”), that we are “all children of God” take on a deep systems and physicalfields meaning in light of this book.Why do you believe that many people resist the idea of a God?The invisible can be scary. The invisible can be unpredictable. The power of asingle tornado frightens us; the power of the sun is more daunting. How muchpower does the G.O.D. process have? Can you really imagine what “infinite power”means?Are we powerless in the face of G.O.D.? Is G.O.D. really a caring G.O.D. when itnot only allows plagues and hurricanes, but allows humans to abuse themselvesand everything else around them?And then there is all that intelligence. If G.O.D. can coordinate the entireuniverse, as well as relationships within our lives to various degrees, we feelpretty small intellectually in comparison.In terms of energy, G.O.D. is huge and we are tiny. However, in terms ofconsciousness, our minds have a huge scope. The challenge is for us to discoverthis potential and use it wisely.How can science and religion ever join forces?The key to joining forces will likely require that they both agree to evolve asa function of what they learn.Moses, Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad, for example, believed (as far as we know)that the world was flat and that the sun revolved around the earth. Their ideaswere shaped by the status of their knowledge.Knowledge is growing. If the history of science teaches us anything, it shouldbe humility.To the extent that both scientists and religious leaders can learn humility, andagree to let evidence and knowledge advise them, then science and religion willslowly but surely come together as one.Can the G.O.D. process be trusted?The answer depends upon what we mean by trust. Can we trust gravity? Theavailable evidence is yes; gravity is a stable field property of all materialobjects.Can we trust the G.O.D. process to orchestrate weather storms to cleanse theplanet and keep things flowing? And if we are in the way, will we be harmed?Again, the available evidence is obviously yes.Can we trust the G.O.D. process to be evolving—at least in terms of itsmanifestation—and therefore that we must remain open-minded and keep on ourtoes? The available evidence says yes.Can we trust the G.O.D. process to surprise us, whether we personally like it ornot? The evidence seems to be yes.Can we trust the G.O.D. process to keep secrets from us? If the G.O.D. processis intelligent, and is a good “parent,” then I would hope so.Will the G.O.D. process ever lie to us? As a scientist, I don’t know.Personally, I hope not.If G.O.D. has infinite intelligence and the infinite potential for love, why isthere so much pain and evil in the world?There are a number of logical possibilities.One is that the G.O.D. process is evolving; the G.O.D. process today may be moremature than the G.O.D. process fifty thousand years ago.Another is that the G.O.D. process appears to have given all systems, to variousdegrees, relative freedom and independence to make their own decisions. IfG.O.D. has relative independence—I say relative because everything isinterconnected, and therefore interconstrained, to various degrees—and we are apart of this G.O.D., then we have relative independence too. Just as a knife canbe used for healing or harm, it follows that freedom can be used for good orevil.A third is that the human potential for rage and destruction is not a hardwareproblem but a software problem. Our capacity for rage and killing can serve toprotect our loved ones if they are being harmed, or be employed to abuse our“loved” ones if we have been harmed by our parents.The gift of freedom is a double-edged sword. Our species may well not survive ifit does not grow up and mature wisely into its hardware anatomy.However, will G.O.D. allow us to completely destroy the planet? Is Gaia a livingsystem with consciousness and intelligence? (The G.O.D. process explanationpredicts yes.) Is she more powerful than we? Is there “wisdom of the earth” likethere is “wisdom of the body”?My hope is for the earth.Does the available evidence provide any clues to the origin of the G.O.D.process itself?No, not that I am aware of.Why is the Gödel proof so important to you and this work?Because Gödel appreciates mathematically that some things are so complex, andrequire a level of complexity. This requires that we accept such evidence withopen-minded faith. Gödel teaches us humility. Humility may be a prerequisite forthe universe to decide to reveal its secrets to us.Is science a tool of God, and is G.O.D. the ultimate experimenter?If what we mean by experimentation is intelligent, trial-and-error learning—notjust the running of controlled, confirmatory experiments—than nature appears tobe experimenting. If the universe is one great experiment, then G.O.D. would bethe ultimate experimenter.It is easier to feel for G.O.D., and wish to serve the G.O.D. process, if we seeit being in the process of learning and evolution as we are.Does the available evidence speak to whether the G.O.D. is male and/or female?From a scientific point of view, what we call male, female, genderless, andandrogynous are living systems that exist on the earth. If “the All is in theSmall” and “the Small is in the All,” then logic takes us to the conclusion thatG.O.D. is all of these, and more. No single word—she, he, it, they—conveys thisvision.Does the available evidence speak to whether there is one G.O.D.?What the available evidence suggests is that certain processes and principlesappear to be universal—and universal implies one. For example, all masses appearto show evidence of what we label gravity. All systems appear to show evidenceof what we label feedback. If there are a set of universal processes andprinciples, this implies some sort of universal G.O.D.Universe, simply stated, is “uni-verse” which is “one-story.”If G.O.D. is so intelligent, beautiful, and compassionate, why would it make somany stupid, ugly, and dangerous creatures?It is said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. “Stupid” and “dangerous”are similarly relative terms.Rabbits are dangerous to carrots; wolves are dangerous to rabbits; humans (withbows and arrows or guns) are dangerous to wolves. Is there intelligence to thisordering process at the level of the earth? Probably.Rabbits seem to be more intelligent than carrots. However, would it beintelligent for carrots to hop around? What if plants refused to stay put? Wouldthis be intelligent for the earth as a whole? I don’t think so.While I was writing these words, I saw some javelinas (they look like pigs)playing in the four-tiered waterfall behind my house that I can see from mydesk. To humans, these creatures look quite ugly (and somewhat scary). However,they seem to really like one another. The mothers dote over the babies, and themales enjoy the females whenever they can. It seems intelligent to me forjavelinas to find one another attractive, and for us to keep our distance fromthem!Does the G.O.D. process have a sense of humor?If one of the ways we come to know the G.O.D. process is to examine the evidencefrom nature, one wonders, What kind of Guiding-Organizing-Designing processwould make it possible to create a stub-nosed, bowlegged, snorting, and droolingcreature called a bulldog?And where does our capacity for laughter come from? I would not be surprised ifG.O.D. giggled.Can science address the question “Is there really a messiah?”It depends upon what you mean by messiah. For example, can the messiah or saviorbe a single person, a group of persons, or a system of thought?And who is being saved, the Jews, the Native Americans, the human species, orthe earth as a whole?If the G.O.D. process exists, and its caring is truly universal, then it wouldwant to help everything, not just the Jews, Christians, or Muslims.The instinct to save may come not simply from our internal design (DNA) but fromthe Guiding-Organizing-Designing process as well.Can science ever come to know the mind of the G.O.D. process?The evidence from the history of science, especially as presented in this book,suggests yes. As we become more knowledgeable, sophisticated, and hopefully moredeserving, this information will hopefully be revealed.Is apparent self-organization an expression of the mind of the G.O.D. process?In theory, the answer is yes. For example, to be self-consistent, I use thefriendly acronym of the S.E.L.F.—the Supreme-Eternal-Living-Field—whichplayfully integrates dynamical complex systems theory, infinite set theory, andphysical field theory. From this perspective, phenomena that we experience asshowing self-organization can be viewed as reflecting a special case ofS.E.L.F.-organization. For us to discover aspects of the hypothesized infinitemind of G.O.D., we must be willing to expand our minds accordingly. A step inthis direction is to envision the G.O.D.S.E.L.F. and, in the process, smile.ALBERT EINSTEINThe intellect has little to do on the road to discovery. There comes a leap inconsciousness, call it Intuition or what you will, the solution comes to you andyou don’t know how or why."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX C Image [../images/00035.gif]EXTRAORDINARY SYNCHRONICITY IN NEW YORK CITYBeing open to receiving information from the universe provides us withcontinuous surprises of all shapes and sizes.Einstein appreciated that “the intellect has little to do on the road todiscovery.” He realized that he would take a “leap in consciousness” and thesolution would come to him, and he didn’t know “how or why.” Einstein’sexplanation was to “call it Intuition or what you will.”Einstein—as did Carl Jung—appreciated the ubiquitous orders and patterns in theuniverse as well as our daily lives. According to Tyler Volk in his bookMetapatterns, the evidence convincingly indicates that the universe consists of“patterns of patterns” that replicate themselves at all levels of nature, fromthe subatomic world, through our planetary world, to the world of superclustersof galaxies. These metapatterns include spheres, borders, binaries, centers,layers, and cycles.Metapatterns are by definition not random. They are universal designs, and theyprovide a unifying structure for the universe as a whole.However, there are exquisite patterns to events in our personal lives, includingpatterns in our relationships with others, which are so complex that theytypically seem to us to be random. I underscore “seem to us” because ourperception that they appear to be random is an interpretation that is mostlikely false.Friedrich Schiller put it this way: “There is no such thing as chance; and whatseems to us merest accident springs from the deepest source of destiny.”I share the following story about extraordinary synchronicity in New York Citybecause it illustrates how important it is that we keep our eyes open to theprobability that there is no such thing as coincidence. We should not confusethe existence of flexibility and relative freedom with unmediated andmeaningless accident.The extraordinary synchronicity (actually an avalanche of synchronicities)described in this chapter involves a degree of coincidence that is beyond whatis mathematically described as “the emerging science of spontaneous order” inSteven Strogatz’s book Sync. To explain this avalanche of evidence we must positthe existence of invisible intelligent guidance that interweaves our personallives.If any single set of events in my life opened both my mind and heart to SusySmith’s phrase “It’s too coincidental to be accidental,” it was this experience.The experience was like being run over by a caravan of Mack trucks. Once youhave had such an experience, you don’t doubt it, you never forget it, and youare forever transformed.Remember—I metaphorically come from Missouri—I am a “show me” person. I sharethis personal story because it really happened, even though the evidence bogglesthe mind.THE NUMBER 11 AT YALEI love numbers. I seem to have a natural talent for playing with them. I wonvarious awards for mathematics in my early schooling, and I received a nearlyperfect grade in my senior year New Math course that included logical analysisand Boolean algebra. I also received a near perfect grade in advanced statisticsin a graduate course I took at the University of Wisconsin.For the record, I do not mean to brag. To balance the scales and keep things inperspective, you might enjoy knowing that I almost failed French in high school,and I continued to perform miserably in French in both college and graduateschool. Whereas numbers have mostly been my friends, words in French have mostlybeen my nemesis.However, there was a period of time when numbers seemed not to be my friends. Itwas the mid-1980s at Yale. I had discovered a weird pattern where the number 11,in various guises, seemed to be surrounding me.Readers, please note—I am not a numerologist and I do not subscribe tonumerology’s claims. Although I will literally call a spade a spade if thenumeric pattern “spade” shows up reliably in a given set of numbers, this doesnot make me a “spade-ologist.”When I describe the replicable pattern of the number 11 below, I report thesepatterns as a scientist, not as a numerologist. If science ends up supportingcertain predictions of numerology, we must remember to distinguish carefullybetween the specific predictions that have been confirmed and the ancientphilosophies and superstitions that surround them.I recall the insight beginning by my noticing my office number, 1A, in thebasement of Yale’s Sterling-Strathcona-Sheffield Hall. The letter A is the firstletter in the alphabet—which gives us 11.The Psychology Building was on “Hillhouse Av” (which is how the sign wasprinted). It has 11 letters.I then realized that I took Route 1A to get to my house. Another 11.I lived at 326 Colonial Road. 326 adds up to 11.Though I don’t recall my precise phone numbers, license plates, and such today,those numbers—or combinations of numbers and letters—often added up to 11.Even Connecticut had 11 letters.Of course, I considered various explanations to account for the apparent anomalyof all these 11’s. However, I did not have to search for 11’s in my vicinity,they were literally all around me.It was clear that a statistical anomaly was happening here. The probability ofall these 11’s occurring by chance alone was far less than one in 11 million.However, though highly improbable, the numbers could have happened by chance. Atthe time I had no idea whether this anomaly had any significance.“SOMETIMES YOU SAY THINGS THAT ARE PROPHETIC”A professor’s life can be very challenging. One juggles many activities andresponsibilities at the same time.One day a young African-American fourth-year medical student came to see me toask if I would be his adviser for his dissertation (I apologize to him for notremembering his name). Unlike most American universities that requiredissertations only of Ph.D. students, Yale honored the older European traditionof requiring that M.D. students do a dissertation, albeit somewhat lessextensive, as well.This young man wanted to do a dissertation that integrated quantum physics,acupuncture, and ancient African philosophy. I told him that I knew a fairamount about quantum physics, a little about acupuncture, and absolutely nothingabout ancient African philosophy. However, if he wanted to meet weekly with meto discuss the writing of his dissertation, I would be happy to provide whatadvice I could.Approximately six weeks into our meetings, he said, “Dr. Schwartz, every now andagain, especially when you talk about systems theory, order, and patterns ofnumbers, what you say is prophetic.”“Prophetic?” I said. “What do you mean?”He said. “You say things that are right out of the Kabbalah.”“The Ka Ba Wah?” I asked. I had no idea what he was talking about.“No. The Kabbalah.”“The Kabbalah, what’s that?”“Ancient secret Jewish mysticism,” he said, somewhat mistaking the facts.“Ancient secret Jewish mysticism?” I replied. I had never been taught that therewas anything mystical about Judaism.“Yes. Sometimes what you say reflects these secret teachings.”The thought popped into my head: I wonder if this relates to my strangeobservations concerning the number 11. Of course I did not mention this to him.I asked, “How can I learn about these secret teachings?”He replied, “You are fortunate. Books are beginning to appear in English thatdescribe these traditions. I suspect if you go to New York City, you can find abook.”Needless to say, that weekend I drove to New York City. I went to Scribner’sbookstore on Fifth Avenue and looked for books on the Kabbalah.Remember, this was the early 1980s, and there were very few published books inEnglish about the Kabbalah then.I can vividly recall going up the stairs to the second level, along the wall onthe right side, the second shelf, and finding two books on the Kabbalah.One was called Kabbalah for the Layman. I said to myself, I’m a layman! and Ibought the work.What I read took me by complete surprise. I saw that just as my student said,the philosophical tenets of Kabbalah were virtually the same as those ofcontemporary systems science. The book also described the ancient practice ofnumerology (though I have since learned that numerology is not an authentic partof Kabbalah), in which letters of the Hebrew alphabet were converted to numbersand summed to obtain a one- or two-digit number.It turned out that the number 11 was a “master number.” In fact, according tosome texts, the number 11 was the number for “God.”It’s important to understand that my learning of the existence of the Kabbalahoccurred at least one year before I ultimately decided to be brave enough to askthe universe a question (Chapter 6).Also, it’s important to remember that I am definitely not a numerologist. What Iam is a statistician who examines patterns in numbers and letters and recognizeswhen they are statistically beyond chance.I told my then-wife, Jeanne, about this remarkable coincidence—the number 11,the black medical student, the Kabbalah, and then numerology. I told her Iwanted to study the Kabbalah.Jeanne said, “Absolutely no.” She reminded me that I was a Yale professor and ahighly visible scientist, not a Jewish academic mystic. Not understanding theteachings of the Kabbalah, she was also frankly worried about how I would copewith what I might learn.I could not argue with her. Jeanne was a smart, loving, and tough woman.However, I felt the strong need to stay connected, somehow, to this seeminglysynchronous and meaningful set of events.A few weeks later, the seemingly impossible happened. Emotionally it felt like amiracle. It still does.A practical yet seemingly ridiculous idea popped into my headWe were in New York City again. We were staying at the Yale Club; though I can’tremember the precise room number, I do remember that it added up to 11.It was a Saturday. We were to spend the afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera. Wewere having lunch on Sixty-fifth Street (6+5=11). We were in a restaurant calledShun Lee West (it has a total of 11 letters).I was silently thinking about the eerie frequency of the number 11 in New YorkCity, wondering if my experience was due to what used to be called the“Volkswagen Bug effect”—if you think about purchasing a Volkswagen, you startnoticing more Bugs on the street simply because you are now conscious of them.Or was it something more?And then I thought to myself, How am I going to stay connected to the potentialcoincidence of the master number 11, the Kabbalah, numerology, and prophecy inmy life?I didn’t consciously and purposely ask the universe the question. I simply askedthe question silently in my head.Immediately a wild idea popped into my head, seemingly out of nowhere, and Iheard, “Get a Cardigan Welsh corgi.”Get a Cardigan Welsh corgi? As soon as I pictured the idea, I couldn’t helpsuppressing a huge grin.First, I immediately realized that the name Cardigan Welsh corgi had connectionsto the number 11. The initials CWC equal 3+23+3= 29=11. The letter C isespecially important, because Kabbalah is sometimes spelled Cabbalah. K is theeleventh letter, C is the third letter. But in binary, 3 is expressed as 11.There were other connections to the number 11. They are not important here. Whatis important is that I realized that the name of this extremely rare breed ofdog could serve as a secret reminder to me of the Kabbalah as well as the number11.Second, I immediately realized that getting a Cardigan Welsh corgi would beacceptable to Jeanne. At that time we had a Pembroke Welsh corgi named Thurber(after James Thurber). Jeanne was about to begin working at Yale, which meantthat Thurber would have to be alone during the day. We did not have children;Thurber was like a child to Jeanne and me. If we got Thurber a younger brotheror sister, then he would have someone to keep him company when we were at work.Pembroke Welsh corgis are fairly rare. When we had our Pembroke, the queen ofEngland had eleven Pembrokes (no joke). Pembrokes have no tails, Cardigans havetails. I had once met a Cardigan Welsh corgi on Bailey Island in Maine. Thoughthe dog’s name was Killer he was a pussycat. Cardigans often have gentledispositions—perfect for Thurber.One almost never bumps into Cardigan Welsh corgis on the street. I meanliterally almost never.Without telling Jeanne what was going through my mind, I brought up the subjectof Thurber being alone, and that maybe we should get him a friend, a CardiganWelsh corgi.Jeanne thought it was a great idea. She suggested that we attempt to rescue anadult Cardigan that was looking for a home. She suggested that since Cardigansare so rare, we should see if there was a Cardigan Welsh corgi club somewhere inthe United States and we could let it be known that we were looking to adopt anadult Cardigan who needed a home.Jeanne saw my excitement. She didn’t know, of course, that if we could somehow,someday, find an adult corgi to rescue, he or she would become my secretKabbalah corgi. That was my sacred secret.What happened next was beyond belief. As I write these words, I still find itvirtually impossible to believe that this actually happened.We left the restaurant and walked uptown. We purchased two yogurt cones, andthen began crossing Seventh Avenue. Around Seventy-fourth Street (yes, 7+4=11),Jeanne asked me: “Gary, is that a Cardigan Welsh corgi?”I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. In the middle island separating the uptownand downtown streets was the funniest-looking dog I had ever seen. He was a bluemerle and a “fluffy”—which is a flaw for the breed. One of his eyes was brown,the other eye was blue. The brown eye had only half a pupil. He had huge ears.He had the typical short legs and long body of a corgi, with a large fluffytail. He looked positively goofy.How could this be happening? Out of the blue, an idea pops into my head that Ishould get a Cardigan Welsh corgi as a secret Kabbalah corgi, and a few minuteslater I bump into a Cardigan corgi on the streets of New York City?I fell to my knees and gave the dog my yogurt. The woman walking the dog lookeda bit alarmed. However, I was wearing a jacket and tie for the opera, so Ilooked presentable.I blurted out, “Please excuse me. My name is Dr. Schwartz, and you’ll neverguess what happened. We live in Connecticut and have a Pembroke Welsh corginamed Thurber. Just a few minutes ago we decided that we wanted to get aCardigan Welsh corgi as a friend for Thurber. We would like to adopt an adultdog who is looking for a home, and we were just talking about how we would goabout finding a Cardigan Welsh corgi club. Do you happen to know if there issuch a club?”I saw tears welling up in her eyes. What she said brought tears to my eyes. Shesaid, “My God, my prayers have finally been answered. You may find this hard tobelieve. I am getting a divorce and losing my country home in Connecticut. Ihave an apartment not far from here. It has become necessary for me to find ahome for my dog, Willie. Would you like to talk with me about possibly adoptinghim?”There are no words to describe what I felt at that moment. The mixture ofemotions included awe, wonder, sadness (for her), joy, pain, confusion, shock. Iwas frankly stunned.I asked myself, What is the probability that this could happen by chance? Howmany dogs are there on the planet? How many are actually Cardigan corgis,looking for a home, who are walking at precisely the place and time that I amthinking about adopting one? We are talking about a truly infinitesimally smallnumber.Jeanne and I made an appointment to meet with the woman and Willie the followingmorning. I hardly heard the opera that afternoon. And I don’t know how I sleptthat night.The next morning we drove uptown to her apartment. I don’t remember what streetit was on. But I vividly recall the number of her apartment—5F. F is the sixthletter in the alphabet: 5+6=11.It turned out the woman was an assistant opera coach at the Metropolitan Opera.She interviewed us for about an hour. She really loved Willie, and I sensed thatthe coincidence of us being there was almost as powerful for her as it was forme.When the woman began to see that Jeanne and I were serious, I gently asked her,with no warning, “Do you know anything about numbers?” I just felt the need toask. Jeanne looked at me cross-eyed. “Where did this come from?” was written onher face.Meanwhile, the woman looked squarely in my eyes, searchingly and knowingly, andsaid, “Ah. Now I understand. I think you should come with me into the nextroom.”I followed her. What I saw I could not believe. What I was seeing was asimpossible for me to believe as seeing Willie for the first time. We were in herbedroom. The long wall had floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. The entire collectionof books was on astrology and numerology. Besides being an opera coach, thewoman was a professional astrologer!No joke. If you find it hard to believe what you are now reading, you canimagine how I felt. She went to the right side and from a waist-level shelfpulled out a book with the words “astrology” and “Kabbalah” in the title. Iasked her if I could borrow the book. Jeanne looked at me completely confused.The woman insisted on driving out to our home in Guilford, Connecticut. As shewas getting Willie ready for the trip, I sheepishly asked her, “Do you know whatthe number 11 means?”The woman looked up and said, “You know, the number 11 is a very importantnumber.”I said, “Do you know what your apartment is?”She said, “Of course: 5F.”I said, “5F equals 11.”Again our eyes locked. We both knew that Willie was moving to Guilford.THE 11 CONNECTION CONTINUED, EVEN AFTER WILLIE DIEDFrom that day forward, Willie became my secret Kabbalah corgi. It is importantto understand that Willie was not known for his intelligence. One of my formerYale Ph.D. students, Geoffrey Ahern, now an M.D., Ph.D., and professor ofneurology and psychology at the University of Arizona, and a fellow dog lover,used to say that Willie operated on “two neurons.”I, of course, didn’t mind his reference to “two.” Geof didn’t know about the 11connection, and therefore could not know that 2 (that is, 1+1) reminded me ofthe master number.Of the many dogs I have had the privilege to share my life with, Willie wasunequivocally my soul mate doggie.The connection between the Kabbalah, numbers, and Willie emerged seeminglyimpossibly once again, of all places, at his funeral.It was the mid-1990s. Jeanne and I were divorced. Willie was with me in Tucson,Arizona. He had become frail; he was almost fourteen years old. I had justrushed home from a visit to Boca Raton, Florida. Debbie, a woman who stayed withWillie when I traveled, had called me explaining that Willie was behaving as ifhe was in severe pain. He could hardly walk.I took Willie to an emergency animal hospital, where he was diagnosed to be inkidney failure and could not be treated. The doctor recommended that he shouldbe let go. I held Willie in my arms as he died.My grief was severe. It went way beyond just Willie, the dog. As Willie wasdying in my arms, I realized that my living secret symbol of the Kabbalah wasdying too.The doctor offered to have someone from his staff take Willie’s body to thelocal animal cemetery, where one of my other corgis was buried. I explained thatI knew the owner of the cemetery, and would prefer to take Willie myself.When I arrived at the cemetery, I learned that it had been recently sold to ayoung couple. I was introduced to the wife. I explained that I had another dogalready buried in her cemetery. As we were preparing the paperwork, she asked ifI wanted a footstone.I explained that I had previously prepared my epitaph for Willie’s plaque andthat it was on file. She asked me to tell her the epitaph.I said, “In Loving Memory of Willie, My Kabbalah Corgi, My Soul Mate Doggie.”She replied, surprised, “Did you say Kabbalah?”I said, “Yes.”She said. “That’s remarkable. You must meet my husband.”I could not believe what I was hearing. Willie had come to me via the Kabbalah.Could it be possible that he would be leaving me via the Kabbalah as well? Not achance.She went to get her husband. It turned out that not only did this young man, aCatholic in his early twenties, have an absolute passion for the Kabbalah, buthe was also an expert in numerology. Moreover, with two of his high schoolfriends who also shared a passion for Kabbalah, they had discovered the secretfor calculating the solution to what is known mathematically as the “magiccube.”The details of the magic cube are not important here. What is important is thatthis extremely difficult numeric calculation was revealed to this man and hisfriends through their study of numerology in the Kabbalah.I spent almost three hours with this young man—he came to appreciate my tears asI confessed to him why Willie was my secret Kabbalah corgi.A few days later Willie was buried. We had a formal ceremony. It was led by ayoung Catholic Kabbalist who knew much more about numerology than I.As Willie’s casket was being lowered into the ground, I asked myself, How manypet cemeteries in the United States are headed by a Kabbalist who has masteredthe sacred art of numerology? and, What is the probability that a Kabbalah corgifrom New York City would be buried by a Kabbalah Catholic in the city of Tucson?Give me a break!Though I had lost my soul mate doggie, I had been given a definitive reminder ofa seemingly impossible gift—hard evidence that our lives are so much more than arandom walk in a competitive struggle for mere survival.My experience with Willie clearly fits the definition of “amusing” (rememberWigner in Chapter 8)—it is absolutely worth thinking about.I share this mind-boggling experience in The G.O.D. Experiments not only tohonor my sacred teacher and fluffy friend Willie, but to honor an intelligentG.O.D. universe that appears to be teeming with invisible Guidance,Organization, and Design. Every now and again we are privileged to be clobberedby coincidence and witness an apparent G.O.D. process in our personal lives.The patterns are here—so too are the metapatterns.The question is, can we listen? Will we accept? Can we understand? Shall wetransform? And will we celebrate?I hope so.To see or not to see, that is the question."},{"pageContent":"INDEXAbraham, 1 [part0004.html#Page_1]Afterlife consciousness, 59 [part0012.html#Page_59], 77 [part0014.html#Page_77],81 [part0014.html#Page_81], 141 [part0022.html#Page_141], 193[part0027.html#Page_193], 213 [part0029.html#Page_213]-14, 228[part0031.html#Page_228]-29Afterlife Experiments: Breakthrough Scientific Evidence for Life After Death(Schwartz and Simon), 59 [part0012.html#Page_59], 77 [part0014.html#Page_77],136 [part0022.html#Page_136], 143 [part0023.html#Page_143], 193[part0027.html#Page_193], 231 [part0031.html#Page_231], 269[part0033.html#Page_269]Agnosticism, 67 [part0013.html#Page_67], 155 [part0024.html#Page_155]-56, 269[part0033.html#Page_269]-70Ahern, Geoffrey, 290 [part0034.html#Page_290]All, 67 [part0013.html#Page_67], 68 [part0013.html#Page_68], 132[part0022.html#Page_132]All in the Smallcommunication with G.O.D. and, 206 [part0028.html#Page_206]consciousness and, 190 [part0027.html#Page_190]God’s gender and, 278 [part0033.html#Page_278]infinite potential of humanity and, 128 [part0022.html#Page_128]systems science and, 60 [part0012.html#Page_60]-61, 68 [part0013.html#Page_68],142 [part0022.html#Page_142]university mind and, 132 [part0022.html#Page_132], 153 [part0023.html#Page_153]Allen, Susan M., 223 [part0030.html#Page_223]American Psychological Association, 91 [part0015.html#Page_91], 174[part0025.html#Page_174]Amusing theories, 91 [part0015.html#Page_91]-92Anatomy of Reality: Merging of Intuition and Reason (Salk), 177[part0026.html#Page_177]Anomalous communication, 58 [part0012.html#Page_58]Anthropic Principle, 201Apparent randomness, 101 [part0018.html#Page_101]-12Apple II computers, 45 [part0010.html#Page_45]Artificial intelligence, 188 [part0027.html#Page_188]Artificial-life programs, 203 [part0028.html#Page_203]As below, so above, 61 [part0012.html#Page_61]-62, 142 [part0022.html#Page_142]Astrophysics, 271 [part0033.html#Page_271]Atheism, 88 [part0015.html#Page_88]Background radiation, 79 [part0014.html#Page_79]-80BASIC, 45 [part0010.html#Page_45]Behe, Michael, 227 [part0031.html#Page_227]Beirman, Dick, 172 [part0025.html#Page_172]Belief, 144 [part0023.html#Page_144]-46, 187 [part0027.html#Page_187]-88Bell’s Theorem, 108 [part0018.html#Page_108]Berg, Rabbi, 285 [part0034.html#Page_285]Big Bang, 79 [part0014.html#Page_79]-80, 211 [part0028.html#Page_211]Biology.
